TI  - TNF-driven adaptive response mediates resistance to EGFR inhibition in lung
      cancer.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96148 [doi]

AB  - Although aberrant Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling is widespread
      in cancer, EGFR inhibition is effective only in a subset of NSCLC (non-small cell
      lung cancer) with EGFR activating mutations. A majority of NSCLCs express EGFR
      wild type (EGFRwt) and do not respond to EGFR inhibition. Tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) is a major mediator of inflammation-induced cancer. We find that a rapid
      increase in TNF level is a universal adaptive response to EGFR inhibition in
      NSCLC regardless of EGFR status. EGFR signaling actively suppresses TNF mRNA
      levels by inducing expression of miR-21 resulting in decreased TNF mRNA
      stability. Conversely, EGFR inhibition results in loss of miR-21 and increased
      TNF mRNA stability. In addition, TNF-induced NF-kB activation leads to increased 
      TNF transcription in a feedforward loop. Inhibition of TNF signaling renders
      EGFRwt expressing NSCLC cell lines and an EGFRwt Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) 
      model highly sensitive to EGFR inhibition. In EGFR mutant oncogene-addicted
      cells, blocking TNF enhances the effectiveness of EGFR inhibition. EGFR plus TNF 
      inhibition is also effective in NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR
      inhibition. We suggest concomitant EGFR and TNF inhibition as a new treatment
      approach that could be beneficial for a majority of lung cancer patients.

TI  - Autoinhibitory regulation of S100A8/S100A9 alarmin activity locally restricts
      sterile inflammation.
LID - 10.1172/JCI89867 [doi]
LID - 89867 [pii]
AB  - Autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and arthritis, show a patchy distribution 
      of inflammation despite systemic dysregulation of adaptive immunity. Thus,
      additional tissue-derived signals, such as danger-associated molecular patterns
      (DAMPs), are indispensable for manifestation of local inflammation. S100A8/S100A9
      complexes are the most abundant DAMPs in many autoimmune diseases. However,
      regulatory mechanisms locally restricting DAMP activities are barely understood. 
      We now unravel for the first time, to our knowledge, a mechanism of
      autoinhibition in mice and humans restricting S100-DAMP activity to local sites
      of inflammation. Combining protease degradation, pull-down assays, mass
      spectrometry, and targeted mutations, we identified specific peptide sequences
      within the second calcium-binding EF-hands triggering TLR4/MD2-dependent
      inflammation. These binding sites are free when S100A8/S100A9 heterodimers are
      released at sites of inflammation. Subsequently, S100A8/S100A9 activities are
      locally restricted by calcium-induced (S100A8/S100A9)2 tetramer formation hiding 
      the TLR4/MD2-binding site within the tetramer interphase, thus preventing
      undesirable systemic effects. Loss of this autoinhibitory mechanism in vivo
      results in TNF-alpha-driven fatal inflammation, as shown by lack of tetramer
      formation in crossing S100A9-/- mice with 2 independent TNF-alpha-transgene mouse
      strains. Since S100A8/S100A9 is the most abundant DAMP in many inflammatory
      diseases, specifically blocking the TLR4-binding site of active S100 dimers may
      represent a promising approach for local suppression of inflammatory diseases,
      avoiding systemic side effects.

TI  - Galectin-9 inhibits TLR7-mediated autoimmunity in murine lupus models.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97333 [doi]
LID - 97333 [pii]
AB  - Uncontrolled secretion of type I IFN, as the result of endosomal TLR (i.e., TLR7 
      and TLR9) signaling in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and abnormal production of
      autoantibodies by B cells are critical for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
      pathogenesis. The importance of galectin-9 (Gal-9) in regulating various
      autoimmune diseases, including lupus, has been demonstrated. However, the precise
      mechanism by which Gal-9 mediates this effect remains unclear. Here, using
      spontaneous murine models of lupus (i.e., BXSB/MpJ and NZB/W F1 mice), we
      demonstrate that administration of Gal-9 results in reduced TLR7-mediated
      autoimmune manifestations. While investigating the mechanism underlying this
      phenomenon, we observed that Gal-9 inhibits the phenotypic maturation of pDCs and
      B cells and abrogates their ability to mount cytokine responses to TLR7/TLR9
      ligands. Importantly, immunocomplex-mediated (IC-mediated) and neutrophil
      extracellular trap-mediated (NET-mediated) pDC activation was inhibited by Gal-9.
      Additionally, the mTOR/p70S6K pathway, which is recruited by both pDCs and B
      cells for TLR-mediated IFN secretion and autoantibody generation, respectively,
      was attenuated. Gal-9 was found to exert its inhibitory effect on both the cells 
      by interacting with CD44.

TI  - CYP3A4 mutation causes vitamin D-dependent rickets type 3.
LID - 10.1172/JCI98680 [doi]
LID - 98680 [pii]
AB  - Genetic forms of vitamin D-dependent rickets (VDDRs) are due to mutations
      impairing activation of vitamin D or decreasing vitamin D receptor
      responsiveness. Here we describe two unrelated patients with early-onset rickets,
      reduced serum levels of the vitamin D metabolites 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and deficient responsiveness to parent and activated
      forms of vitamin D. Neither patient had a mutation in any genes known to cause
      VDDR; however, using whole exome sequencing analysis, we identified a recurrent
      de novo missense mutation, c.902T>C (p.I301T), in CYP3A4 in both subjects that
      alters the conformation of substrate recognition site 4 (SRS-4). In vitro, the
      mutant CYP3A4 oxidized 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D with 10-fold greater activity than
      WT CYP3A4 and 2-fold greater activity than CYP24A1, the principal inactivator of 
      vitamin D metabolites. As CYP3A4 mutations have not previously been linked to
      rickets, these findings provide insight into vitamin D metabolism and demonstrate
      that accelerated inactivation of vitamin D metabolites represents a mechanism for
      vitamin D deficiency.

TI  - Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL1 variation modifies HLA-B*57
      protection against HIV-1.
LID - 10.1172/JCI98463 [doi]
LID - 98463 [pii]
AB  - HLA-B*57 control of HIV involves enhanced CD8+ T cell responses against infected 
      cells, but extensive heterogeneity exists in the level of HIV control among B*57+
      individuals. Using whole-genome sequencing of untreated B*57+ HIV-1-infected
      controllers and noncontrollers, we identified a single variant (rs643347A/G)
      encoding an isoleucine-to-valine substitution at position 47 (I47V) of the
      inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR3DL1 as the only
      significant modifier of B*57 protection. The association was replicated in an
      independent cohort and across multiple outcomes. The modifying effect of I47V was
      confined to B*57:01 and was not observed for the closely related B*57:03.
      Positions 2, 47, and 54 tracked one another nearly perfectly, and 2 KIR3DL1
      allotypes differing only at these 3 positions showed significant differences in
      binding B*57:01 tetramers, whereas the protective allotype showed lower binding. 
      Thus, variation in an immune NK cell receptor that binds B*57:01 modifies its
      protection. These data highlight the exquisite specificity of KIR-HLA
      interactions in human health and disease.

TI  - Surface receptor Toso controls B cell-mediated regulation of T cell immunity.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97280 [doi]
LID - 97280 [pii]
AB  - The immune system is tightly controlled by regulatory processes that allow for
      the elimination of invading pathogens, while limiting immunopathological damage
      to the host. In the present study, we found that conditional deletion of the cell
      surface receptor Toso on B cells unexpectedly resulted in impaired
      proinflammatory T cell responses, which led to impaired immune protection in an
      acute viral infection model and was associated with reduced immunopathological
      tissue damage in a chronic inflammatory context. Toso exhibited its B
      cell-inherent immunoregulatory function by negatively controlling the pool of
      IL-10-competent B1 and B2 B cells, which were characterized by a high degree of
      self-reactivity and were shown to mediate immunosuppressive activity on
      inflammatory T cell responses in vivo. Our results indicate that Toso is involved
      in the differentiation/maintenance of regulatory B cells by fine-tuning B cell
      receptor activation thresholds. Furthermore, we showed that during influenza
      A-induced pulmonary inflammation, the application of Toso-specific antibodies
      selectively induced IL-10-competent B cells at the site of inflammation and
      resulted in decreased proinflammatory cytokine production by lung T cells. These 
      findings suggest that Toso may serve as a novel therapeutic target to dampen
      pathogenic T cell responses via the modulation of IL-10-competent regulatory B
      cells.

TI  - Mycobacterial growth inhibition is associated with trained innate immunity.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97508 [doi]
LID - 97508 [pii]
AB  - The lack of defined correlates of protection hampers development of vaccines
      against tuberculosis (TB). In vitro mycobacterial outgrowth assays are thought to
      better capture the complexity of the human host/Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 
      interaction. Here, we used a mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) based
      on peripheral blood mononuclear cells to investigate the capacity to control
      outgrowth of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Interestingly, strong control of BCG 
      outgrowth was observed almost exclusively in individuals with recent exposure to 
      Mtb, but not in (long-term) latent TB infection, and only modestly in BCG
      vaccinees. Mechanistically, control of mycobacterial outgrowth strongly
      correlated with the presence of a CD14dim monocyte population, but also required 
      the presence of T cells. The nonclassical monocytes produced CXCL10, and CXCR3
      receptor blockade inhibited the capacity to control BCG outgrowth. Expression of 
      CXCR3 splice variants was altered in recently Mtb-exposed individuals. Cytokines 
      previously associated with trained immunity were detected in MGIA supernatants,
      and CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 represent new markers of trained immunity. These
      data indicate that CXCR3 ligands are associated with trained immunity and are
      critical factors in controlling mycobacterial outgrowth. In conclusion, control
      of mycobacterial outgrowth early after exposure to Mtb is the result of trained
      immunity mediated by a CXCL10-producing nonclassical CD14dim monocyte subset.

TI  - STAT3-enhancing germline mutations contribute to tumor-extrinsic immune evasion.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96708 [doi]
LID - 96708 [pii]
AB  - Immune evasion and the suppression of antitumor responses during cancer
      progression are considered hallmarks of cancer and are typically attributed to
      tumor-derived factors. Although the molecular basis for the crosstalk between
      tumor and immune cells is an area of active investigation, whether host-specific 
      germline variants can dictate immunosuppressive mechanisms has remained a
      challenge to address. A commonly occurring germline mutation (c.1162G>A/rs351855 
      G/A) in the FGFR4 (CD334) gene enhances signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling and is associated with poor prognosis and
      accelerated progression of multiple cancer types. Here, using rs351855
      SNP-knockin transgenic mice and Fgfr4-knockout mice, we reveal the
      genotype-specific gain of immunological function of suppressing the
      CD8/CD4+FOXP3+CD25+ regulatory T cell ratio in vivo. Furthermore, using knockin
      transgenic mouse models for lung and breast cancers, we establish the
      host-specific, tumor-extrinsic functions of STAT3-enhancing germline variants in 
      impeding the tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells. Thus, STAT3-enhancing germline
      receptor variants contribute to immune evasion through their pleiotropic
      functions in immune cells.

      diabetes.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97739 [doi]
LID - 97739 [pii]
AB  - Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules are strongly associated with
      many autoimmune disorders. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the DQ8 molecule is common, 
      confers significant disease risk, and is involved in disease pathogenesis. We
      hypothesized that blocking DQ8 antigen presentation would provide therapeutic
      benefit by preventing recognition of self-peptides by pathogenic T cells. We used
      the crystal structure of DQ8 to select drug-like small molecules predicted to
      bind structural pockets in the MHC antigen-binding cleft. A limited number of the
      predicted compounds inhibited DQ8 antigen presentation in vitro, with 1 compound 
      preventing insulin autoantibody production and delaying diabetes onset in an
      animal model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. An existing drug with a similar 
      structure, methyldopa, specifically blocked DQ8 in patients with recent-onset T1D
      and reduced inflammatory T cell responses to insulin, highlighting the relevance 
      of blocking disease-specific MHC class II antigen presentation to treat
      autoimmunity.

LID - 95146 [pii]
AB  - Cellular senescence, a major tumor-suppressive cell fate, has emerged from humble
      beginnings as an in vitro phenomenon into recognition as a fundamental mechanism 
      of aging. In the process, senescent cells have attracted attention as a
      therapeutic target for age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Given the
      aging global population and the inadequacy of current medical management,
      attenuating the health care burden of CVD would be transformative to clinical
      practice. Here, we review the evidence that cellular senescence drives CVD in a
      bimodal fashion by both priming the aged cardiovascular system for disease and
      driving established disease forward. Hence, the growing field of senotherapy
      (neutralizing senescent cells for therapeutic benefit) is poised to contribute to
      both prevention and treatment of CVD.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a physiological phenomenon that has both beneficial and
      detrimental consequences. Senescence limits tumorigenesis and tissue damage
      throughout the lifetime. However, at the late stages of life, senescent cells
      increasingly accumulate in tissues and might also contribute to the development
      of various age-related pathologies. Recent studies have revealed the molecular
      pathways that preserve the viability of senescent cells and the ones regulating
      their immune surveillance. These studies provide essential initial insights for
      the development of novel therapeutic strategies for targeting senescent cells. At
      the same time they stress the need to understand the limitations of the existing 
      strategies, their efficacy and safety, and the possible deleterious consequences 
      of senescent cell elimination. Here we discuss the existing strategies for
      targeting senescent cells and upcoming challenges in translating these strategies
      into safe and efficient therapies. Successful translation of these strategies
      could have implications for treating a variety of diseases at old age and could
      potentially reshape our view of health management during aging.

AB  - Senescent cells (SnCs) are associated with age-related pathologies.
      Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by pain, loss of cartilage, and
      joint inflammation, and its incidence increases with age. For years, the presence
      of SnCs in cartilage isolated from patients undergoing total knee artificial
      implants has been noted, but these cells' relevance to disease was unclear. In
      this Review, we summarize current knowledge of SnCs in the multiple tissues that 
      constitute the articular joint. New evidence for the causative role of SnCs in
      the development of posttraumatic and age-related arthritis is reviewed along with
      the therapeutic benefit of SnC clearance. As part of their senescence-associated 
      secretory phenotype, SnCs secrete cytokines that impact the immune system and its
      response to joint tissue trauma. We present concepts of the immune response to
      tissue trauma as well as the interactions with SnCs and the local tissue
      environment. Finally, we discuss therapeutic implications of targeting SnCs in
      treating osteoarthritis.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a highly stable cell cycle arrest that is elicited in
      response to different stresses. By imposing a growth arrest, senescence limits
      the replication of old or damaged cells. Besides exiting the cell cycle,
      senescent cells undergo many other phenotypic alterations such as metabolic
      reprogramming, chromatin rearrangement, or autophagy modulation. In addition,
      senescent cells produce and secrete a complex combination of factors,
      collectively referred as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, that
      mediate most of their non-cell-autonomous effects. Because senescent cells
      influence the outcome of a variety of physiological and pathological processes,
      including cancer and age-related diseases, pro-senescent and anti-senescent
      therapies are actively being explored. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms 
      regulating different aspects of the senescence phenotype and their functional
      implications. This knowledge is essential to improve the identification and
      characterization of senescent cells in vivo and will help to develop rational
      strategies to modulate the senescence program for therapeutic benefit.

TI  - Sox2 haploinsufficiency primes regeneration and Wnt responsiveness in the mouse
      cochlea.
PG  - 1641-1656
LID - 10.1172/JCI97248 [doi]
LID - 97248 [pii]
AB  - During development, Sox2 is indispensable for cell division and differentiation, 
      yet its roles in regenerating tissues are less clear. Here, we used combinations 
      of transgenic mouse models to reveal that Sox2 haploinsufficiency (Sox2haplo)
      increases rather than impairs cochlear regeneration in vivo. Sox2haplo cochleae
      had delayed terminal mitosis and ectopic sensory cells, yet normal auditory
      function. Sox2haplo amplified and expanded domains of damage-induced Atoh1+
      transitional cell formation in neonatal cochlea. Wnt activation via beta-catenin 
      stabilization (beta-cateninGOF) alone failed to induce proliferation or
      transitional cell formation. By contrast, beta-cateninGOF caused proliferation
      when either Sox2haplo or damage was present, and transitional cell formation when
      both were present in neonatal, but not mature, cochlea. Mechanistically,
      Sox2haplo or damaged neonatal cochleae showed lower levels of Sox2 and Hes5, but 
      not of Wnt target genes. Together, our study unveils an interplay between Sox2
      and damage in directing tissue regeneration and Wnt responsiveness and thus
      provides a foundation for potential combinatorial therapies aimed at stimulating 
      mammalian cochlear regeneration to reverse hearing loss in humans.

AB  - Apoptosis has been proposed as a key mechanism responsible for CD4+ T cell
      depletion and immune dysfunction during HIV infection. We demonstrated that
      Q-VD-OPH, a caspase inhibitor, inhibits spontaneous and activation-induced death 
      of T cells from SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs). When administered during the 
      acute phase of infection, Q-VD-OPH was associated with (a) reduced levels of T
      cell death, (b) preservation of CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in lymphoid organs and in 
      the gut, (c) maintenance of memory CD4+ T cells, and (d) increased specific CD4+ 
      T cell response associated with the expression of cytotoxic molecules. Although
      therapy was limited to the acute phase of infection, Q-VD-OPH-treated RMs showed 
      lower levels of both viral load and cell-associated SIV DNA as compared with
      control SIV-infected RMs throughout the chronic phase of infection, and prevented
      the development of AIDS. Overall, our data demonstrate that Q-VD-OPH injection in
      SIV-infected RMs may represent an adjunctive therapeutic agent to control HIV
      infection and delaying disease progression to AIDS.

      steatohepatitis.

AB  - Incidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is considered a hepatic
      manifestation of metabolic syndrome, has been increasing worldwide with the rise 
      in obesity; however, its pathological mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we
      demonstrate that the hepatic expression of aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein
      (ACLP), a glycosylated, secreted protein, increases in NASH in humans and mice.
      Furthermore, we elucidate that ACLP is a ligand, unrelated to WNT proteins, that 
      activates the canonical WNT pathway and exacerbates NASH pathology. In the liver,
      ACLP is specifically expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). As fatty liver
      disease progresses, ACLP expression is enhanced via activation of STAT3 signaling
      by obesity-related factors in serum. ACLP specifically binds to frizzled-8 and
      low-density lipoprotein-related receptor 6 to form a ternary complex that
      activates canonical WNT signaling. Consequently, ACLP activates HSCs by
      inhibiting PPARgamma signals. HSC-specific ACLP deficiency inhibits fibrosis
      progression in NASH by inhibiting canonical WNT signaling in HSCs. The present
      study elucidates the role of canonical WNT pathway activation by ACLP in NASH
      pathology, indicating that NASH can be treated by targeting ACLP-induced
      canonical WNT pathway activation in HSCs.

AB  - As oncogenes drive carcinogenesis and promote cancer cell survival, they are
      highly attractive therapeutic targets, and oncogene-targeting small molecules
      have achieved some clinical success. While many oncogenes are presently
      considered to be "druggable," tumors often acquire treatment resistance, and
      patients are rarely cured in response to oncogene-specific treatment. In this
      issue of the JCI, Veatch and colleagues describe a patient with metastatic acral 
      melanoma who experienced a complete tumor response following infusion of
      tumor-infiltrating T cells that targeted multiple tumor antigens, including a
      BRAFV600E driver mutation. T cells genetically engineered to express an
      anti-BRAFV600E T cell receptor (TCR) from the patient demonstrated recognition of
      an epitope that spanned the BRAFV600E mutation. These findings suggest that
      BRAFV600E might be targeted therapeutically with adoptive transfer of
      anti-BRAFV600E T cells. This research supports the emerging therapeutic paradigm 
      of targeting oncogenic drivers with T cell immunotherapy.

      interactions.
PG  - 1523-1537
LID - 10.1172/JCI96174 [doi]
LID - 96174 [pii]
AB  - UL18 is a human CMV (HCMV) MHC class I (MHCI) homolog that efficiently inhibits
      leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 1 (LILRB1)+ NK cells.
      We found an association of LILRB1 polymorphisms in the regulatory regions and
      ligand-binding domains with control of HCMV in transplant patients. Naturally
      occurring LILRB1 variants expressed in model NK cells showed functional
      differences with UL18 and classical MHCI, but not with HLA-G. The altered
      functional recognition was recapitulated in binding assays with the binding
      domains of LILRB1. Each of 4 nonsynonymous substitutions in the first 2 LILRB1
      immunoglobulin domains contributed to binding with UL18, classical MHCI, and
      HLA-G. One of the polymorphisms controlled addition of an N-linked glycan, and
      that mutation of the glycosylation site altered binding to all ligands tested,
      including enhancing binding to UL18. Together, these findings indicate that
      specific LILRB1 alleles that allow for superior immune evasion by HCMV are
      restricted by mutations that limit LILRB1 expression selectively on NK cells. The
      polymorphisms also maintained an appropriate interaction with HLA-G, fitting with
      a principal role of LILRB1 in fetal tolerance.

LID - 91512 [pii]
AB  - Polypeptide vaccines effectively activate human T cells but suffer from poor
      biological stability, which confines both transport logistics and in vivo
      therapeutic activity. Synthetic biology has the potential to address these
      limitations through the generation of highly stable antigenic "mimics" using
      subunits that do not exist in the natural world. We developed a platform based on
      D-amino acid combinatorial chemistry and used this platform to reverse engineer a
      fully artificial CD8+ T cell agonist that mirrored the immunogenicity profile of 
      a native epitope blueprint from influenza virus. This nonnatural peptide was
      highly stable in human serum and gastric acid, reflecting an intrinsic resistance
      to physical and enzymatic degradation. In vitro, the synthetic agonist stimulated
      and expanded an archetypal repertoire of polyfunctional human influenza
      virus-specific CD8+ T cells. In vivo, specific responses were elicited in naive
      humanized mice by subcutaneous vaccination, conferring protection from subsequent
      lethal influenza challenge. Moreover, the synthetic agonist was immunogenic after
      oral administration. This proof-of-concept study highlights the power of
      synthetic biology to expand the horizons of vaccine design and therapeutic
      delivery.

AB  - Malaria, caused by mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium parasites, continues to take a
      major toll on global health. The development of drugs and vaccines that reduce
      malaria transmission from humans back to mosquitos could contribute to the
      control and eventual eradication of malaria, but research models for the early
      clinical evaluation of candidate interventions are lacking. In this issue of the 
      JCI, Collins and colleagues report the successful transmission of Plasmodium
      falciparum parasites from humans to mosquitoes during controlled human malaria
      infection, thus providing a potential tool to accelerate the development of much 
      needed transmission-blocking drugs and vaccines.

AB  - Obesity is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In
      adipose tissue, obesity-mediated insulin resistance correlates with the
      accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages and inflammation. However, the causal
      relationship of these events is unclear. Here, we report that obesity-induced
      insulin resistance in mice precedes macrophage accumulation and inflammation in
      adipose tissue. Using a mouse model that combines genetically induced,
      adipose-specific insulin resistance (mTORC2-knockout) and diet-induced obesity,
      we found that insulin resistance causes local accumulation of proinflammatory
      macrophages. Mechanistically, insulin resistance in adipocytes results in
      production of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), which
      recruits monocytes and activates proinflammatory macrophages. Finally, insulin
      resistance (high homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR])
      correlated with reduced insulin/mTORC2 signaling and elevated MCP1 production in 
      visceral adipose tissue from obese human subjects. Our findings suggest that
      insulin resistance in adipose tissue leads to inflammation rather than vice
      versa.

AB  - Bone formation and resorption are tightly coupled, and dysfunction of either
      process leads to bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone-forming agents have
      been explored clinically to increase bone density; however, long-term efficacy of
      these strategies is limited due to the accompanying increase in resorption in
      response to increased bone formation. Axonal guidance molecules have recently
      been shown to regulate formation-resorption coupling and thus have the potential 
      for osteoporosis therapy. In this issue of the JCI, Kim et al. demonstrate that
      osteoclast-secreted SLIT3 influences bone formation and resorption by promoting
      osteoblast migration and suppressing osteoclast differentiation. Activation of
      SLIT3/ROBO signaling in ovariectomized mice increased bone mass, suggesting that 
      SLIT3 should be further explored as a therapeutic target.

LID - 91086 [pii]
AB  - Coupling is the process that links bone resorption to bone formation in a
      temporally and spatially coordinated manner within the remodeling cycle. Several 
      lines of evidence point to the critical roles of osteoclast-derived coupling
      factors in the regulation of osteoblast performance. Here, we used a fractionated
      secretomic approach and identified the axon-guidance molecule SLIT3 as a
      clastokine that stimulated osteoblast migration and proliferation by activating
      beta-catenin. SLIT3 also inhibited bone resorption by suppressing osteoclast
      differentiation in an autocrine manner. Mice deficient in Slit3 or its receptor, 
      Robo1, exhibited osteopenic phenotypes due to a decrease in bone formation and
      increase in bone resorption. Mice lacking Slit3 specifically in osteoclasts had
      low bone mass, whereas mice with either neuron-specific Slit3 deletion or
      osteoblast-specific Slit3 deletion had normal bone mass, thereby indicating the
      importance of SLIT3 as a local determinant of bone metabolism. In postmenopausal 
      women, higher circulating SLIT3 levels were associated with increased bone mass. 
      Notably, injection of a truncated recombinant SLIT3 markedly rescued bone loss
      after an ovariectomy. Thus, these results indicate that SLIT3 plays an
      osteoprotective role by synchronously stimulating bone formation and inhibiting
      bone resorption, making it a potential therapeutic target for metabolic bone
      diseases.

AB  - Intralesional therapy with oncolytic viruses (OVs) leads to the activation of
      local and systemic immune pathways, which may present targets for further
      combinatorial therapies. Here, we used human tumor histocultures as well as
      syngeneic tumor models treated with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) to identify a
      range of immune targets upregulated with OV treatment. Despite tumor infiltration
      of effector T lymphocytes in response to NDV, there was ongoing inhibition
      through programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), acting as a mechanism of early and
      late adaptive immune resistance to the type I IFN response and T cell
      infiltration, respectively. Systemic therapeutic targeting of programmed cell
      death receptor 1 (PD-1) or PD-L1 in combination with intratumoral NDV resulted in
      the rejection of both treated and distant tumors. These findings have
      implications for the timing of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in conjunction with OV therapy
      and highlight the importance of understanding the adaptive mechanisms of immune
      resistance to specific OVs for the rational design of combinatorial approaches
      using these agents.

AB  - Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a versatile new class of therapeutic agents based on 
      native or genetically modified viruses that selectively replicate in tumor cells 
      and can express therapeutic transgenes designed to target cells within the tumor 
      microenvironment and/or host immunity. To date, however, confirmation of the
      underlying mechanism of action and an understanding of innate and acquired drug
      resistance for most OVs have been limited. In this issue of the JCI, Zamarin et
      al. report a comprehensive analysis of an oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV)
      using both murine melanoma tumor models and human tumor explants to explore how
      the virus promotes tumor eradication and details of the mechanisms involved.
      These findings have implications for the optimization of oncolytic immunotherapy,
      at least that based on NDV, and further confirm that specific combinatorial
      approaches are promising for clinical development.

LID - 94330 [pii]
AB  - We have previously reported that the fractalkine (FKN)/CX3CR1 system represents a
      novel regulatory mechanism for insulin secretion and beta cell function. Here, we
      demonstrate that chronic administration of a long-acting form of FKN, FKN-Fc, can
      exert durable effects to improve glucose tolerance with increased
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decreased beta cell apoptosis in obese
      rodent models. Unexpectedly, chronic FKN-Fc administration also led to decreased 
      alpha cell glucagon secretion. In islet cells, FKN inhibited ATP-sensitive
      potassium channel conductance by an ERK-dependent mechanism, which triggered beta
      cell action potential (AP) firing and decreased alpha cell AP amplitude. This
      results in increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decreased glucagon 
      secretion. Beyond its islet effects, FKN-Fc also exerted peripheral effects to
      enhance hepatic insulin sensitivity due to inhibition of glucagon action. In
      hepatocytes, FKN treatment reduced glucagon-stimulated cAMP production and CREB
      phosphorylation in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Together, these results
      raise the possibility of use of FKN-based therapy to improve type 2 diabetes by
      increasing both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Translational repression of HIF2alpha expression in mice with Chuvash
      polycythemia reverses polycythemia.
PG  - 1317-1325
LID - 10.1172/JCI97684 [doi]
LID - 97684 [pii]
AB  - Chuvash polycythemia is an inherited disease caused by a homozygous germline
      VHLR200W mutation, which leads to impaired degradation of HIF2alpha, elevated
      levels of serum erythropoietin, and erythrocytosis/polycythemia. This phenotype
      is recapitulated by a mouse model bearing a homozygous VhlR200W mutation. We
      previously showed that iron-regulatory protein 1-knockout (Irp1-knockout) mice
      developed erythrocytosis/polycythemia through translational derepression of
      Hif2alpha, suggesting that IRP1 could be a therapeutic target to treat Chuvash
      polycythemia. Here, we fed VhlR200W mice supplemented with Tempol, a small,
      stable nitroxide molecule and observed that Tempol decreased erythropoietin
      production, corrected splenomegaly, normalized hematocrit levels, and increased
      the lifespans of these mice. We attribute the reversal of
      erythrocytosis/polycythemia to translational repression of Hif2alpha expression
      by Tempol-mediated increases in the IRE-binding activity of Irp1, as reversal of 
      polycythemia was abrogated in VhlR200W mice in which Irp1 was genetically
      ablated. Thus, a new approach to the treatment of patients with Chuvash
      polycythemia may include dietary supplementation of Tempol, which decreased
      Hif2alpha expression and markedly reduced life-threatening
      erythrocytosis/polycythemia in the VhlR200W mice.

TI  - Integrated RNA and DNA sequencing reveals early drivers of metastatic breast
      cancer.
PG  - 1371-1383
LID - 10.1172/JCI96153 [doi]
LID - 96153 [pii]
AB  - Breast cancer metastasis remains a clinical challenge, even within a single
      patient across multiple sites of the disease. Genome-wide comparisons of both the
      DNA and gene expression of primary tumors and metastases in multiple patients
      could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms that cause breast cancer
      metastasis. To address this issue, we performed DNA exome and RNA sequencing of
      matched primary tumors and multiple metastases from 16 patients, totaling 83
      distinct specimens. We identified tumor-specific drivers by integrating known
      protein-protein network information with RNA expression and somatic DNA
      alterations and found that genetic drivers were predominantly established in the 
      primary tumor and maintained through metastatic spreading. In addition, our
      analyses revealed that most genetic drivers were DNA copy number changes, the
      TP53 mutation was a recurrent founding mutation regardless of subtype, and that
      multiclonal seeding of metastases was frequent and occurred in multiple subtypes.
      Genetic drivers unique to metastasis were identified as somatic mutations in the 
      estrogen and androgen receptor genes. These results highlight the complexity of
      metastatic spreading, be it monoclonal or multiclonal, and suggest that most
      metastatic drivers are established in the primary tumor, despite the substantial 
      heterogeneity seen in the metastases.

TI  - Pharmacological targeting of MYC-regulated IRE1/XBP1 pathway suppresses
      MYC-driven breast cancer.
PG  - 1283-1299
LID - 10.1172/JCI95873 [doi]
LID - 95873 [pii]
AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular homeostatic mechanism that is
      activated in many human cancers and plays pivotal roles in tumor progression and 
      therapy resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms for UPR activation and
      regulation in cancer cells remain elusive. Here, we show that oncogenic MYC
      regulates the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)
      branch of the UPR in breast cancer via multiple mechanisms. We found that MYC
      directly controls IRE1 transcription by binding to its promoter and enhancer.
      Furthermore, MYC forms a transcriptional complex with XBP1, a target of IRE1, and
      enhances its transcriptional activity. Importantly, we demonstrate that XBP1 is a
      synthetic lethal partner of MYC. Silencing of XBP1 selectively blocked the growth
      of MYC-hyperactivated cells. Pharmacological inhibition of IRE1 RNase activity
      with small molecule inhibitor 8866 selectively restrained the MYC-overexpressing 
      tumor growth in vivo in a cohort of preclinical patient-derived xenograft models 
      and genetically engineered mouse models. Strikingly, 8866 substantially enhanced 
      the efficacy of docetaxel chemotherapy, resulting in rapid regression of
      MYC-overexpressing tumors. Collectively, these data establish the synthetic
      lethal interaction of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway with MYC hyperactivation and provide 
      a potential therapy for MYC-driven human breast cancers.

      adding vaccination with gp100 peptide formulated in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 
      (IFA). Here, using a mouse model of melanoma, we found that gp100 vaccination
      induced gp100-specific effector T cells (Teffs), which dominantly forced
      trafficking of anti-CTLA-4-induced, non-gp100-specific Teffs away from the tumor,
      reducing tumor control. The inflamed vaccination site subsequently also
      sequestered and destroyed anti-CTLA-4-induced Teffs with specificities for tumor 
      antigens other than gp100, reducing the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4
      therapy. Mechanistically, Teffs at the vaccination site recruited inflammatory
      monocytes, which in turn attracted additional Teffs in a vicious cycle mediated
      by IFN-gamma, CXCR3, ICAM-1, and CCL2, dependent on IFA formulation. In contrast,
      nonpersistent vaccine formulations based on dendritic cells, viral vectors, or
      water-soluble peptides potently synergized with checkpoint blockade of both
      CTLA-4 and PD-L1 and induced complete tumor regression, including in settings of 
      primary resistance to dual checkpoint blockade. We conclude that cancer vaccine
      formulation can dominantly determine synergy, or lack thereof, with CTLA-4 and
      PD-L1 checkpoint blockade therapy for cancer.

AB  - Metastatic breast cancers are still incurable. Characterizing the evolutionary
      landscape of these cancers, including the role of metastatic axillary lymph nodes
      (ALNs) in seeding distant organ metastasis, can provide a rational basis for
      effective treatments. Here, we have described the genomic analyses of the primary
      tumors and metastatic lesions from 99 samples obtained from 20 patients with
      breast cancer. Our evolutionary analyses revealed diverse spreading and seeding
      patterns that govern tumor progression. Although linear evolution to successive
      metastatic sites was common, parallel evolution from the primary tumor to
      multiple distant sites was also evident. Metastatic spreading was frequently
      coupled with polyclonal seeding, in which multiple metastatic subclones
      originated from the primary tumor and/or other distant metastases. Synchronous
      ALN metastasis, a well-established prognosticator of breast cancer, was not
      involved in seeding the distant metastasis, suggesting a hematogenous route for
      cancer dissemination. Clonal evolution coincided frequently with emerging driver 
      alterations and evolving mutational processes, notably an increase in
      apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like-associated
      (APOBEC-associated) mutagenesis. Our data provide genomic evidence for a role of 
      ALN metastasis in seeding distant organ metastasis and elucidate the evolving
      mutational landscape during cancer progression.

TI  - Mosaic RAS/MAPK variants cause sporadic vascular malformations which respond to
      targeted therapy.
PG  - 1496-1508

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sporadic vascular malformations (VMs) are complex congenital
      anomalies of blood vessels that lead to stroke, life-threatening bleeds,
      disfigurement, overgrowth, and/or pain. Therapeutic options are severely limited,
      and multidisciplinary management remains challenging, particularly for high-flow 
      arteriovenous malformations (AVM). METHODS: To investigate the pathogenesis of
      sporadic intracranial and extracranial VMs in 160 children in which known genetic
      causes had been excluded, we sequenced DNA from affected tissue and optimized
      analysis for detection of low mutant allele frequency. RESULTS: We discovered
      multiple mosaic-activating variants in 4 genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway, KRAS,
      NRAS, BRAF, and MAP2K1, a pathway commonly activated in cancer and responsible
      for the germline RAS-opathies. These variants were more frequent in high-flow
      than low-flow VMs. In vitro characterization and 2 transgenic zebrafish AVM
      models that recapitulated the human phenotype validated the pathogenesis of the
      mutant alleles. Importantly, treatment of AVM-BRAF mutant zebrafish with the BRAF
      inhibitor vemurafinib restored blood flow in AVM. CONCLUSION: Our findings
      uncover a major cause of sporadic VMs of different clinical types and thereby
      offer the potential of personalized medical treatment by repurposing existing
      licensed cancer therapies. FUNDING: This work was funded or supported by grants
      from the AVM Butterfly Charity, the Wellcome Trust (UK), the Medical Research
      Council (UK), the UK National Institute for Health Research, the L'Oreal-Melanoma
      Research Alliance, the European Research Council, and the National Human Genome
      Research Institute (US).

AB  - Along with a general decline in overall health, most chronic degenerative human
      diseases are inherently associated with increasing age. Age-associated cognitive 
      impairments and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
      diseases, are potentially debilitating conditions that lack viable options for
      treatment, resulting in a tremendous economic and societal cost. Most
      high-profile clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases have led to
      inefficacious results, suggesting that novel approaches to treating these
      pathologies are needed. Numerous recent studies have demonstrated that senescent 
      cells, which are characterized by sustained cell cycle arrest and production of a
      distinct senescence-associated secretory phenotype, accumulate with age and at
      sites of age-related diseases throughout the body, where they actively promote
      tissue deterioration. Cells with features of senescence have been detected in the
      context of brain aging and neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that they may
      also promote dysfunction. Here, we discuss the evidence implicating senescent
      cells in neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanistic contribution of these cells 
      that may actively drive neurodegeneration, and how these cells or their effects
      may be targeted therapeutically.

AB  - Synthetic lethality is an efficient mechanism-based approach to selectively
      target DNA repair defects. Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) 
      deficiency is frequently found in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making this
      DNA repair protein an attractive target for exploiting synthetic lethal
      approaches in the disease. Using unbiased proteomic and metabolic high-throughput
      profiling on a unique in-house-generated isogenic model of ERCC1 deficiency, we
      found marked metabolic rewiring of ERCC1-deficient populations, including
      decreased levels of the metabolite NAD+ and reduced expression of the
      rate-limiting NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
      (NAMPT). We also found reduced NAMPT expression in NSCLC samples with low levels 
      of ERCC1. These metabolic alterations were a primary effect of ERCC1 deficiency, 
      and caused selective exquisite sensitivity to small-molecule NAMPT inhibitors,
      both in vitro - ERCC1-deficient cells being approximately 1,000 times more
      sensitive than ERCC1-WT cells - and in vivo. Using transmission electronic
      microscopy and functional metabolic studies, we found that ERCC1-deficient cells 
      harbor mitochondrial defects. We propose a model where NAD+ acts as a regulator
      of ERCC1-deficient NSCLC cell fitness. These findings open therapeutic
      opportunities that exploit a yet-undescribed nuclear-mitochondrial synthetic
      lethal relationship in NSCLC models, and highlight the potential for targeting
      DNA repair/metabolic crosstalks for cancer therapy.

AB  - Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are associated with low levels of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The insulin-repressible FoxO
      transcription factors are potential mediators of the effect of insulin on HDL-C. 
      FoxOs mediate a substantial portion of insulin-regulated transcription, and poor 
      FoxO repression is thought to contribute to the excessive glucose production in
      diabetes. In this work, we show that mice with liver-specific triple FoxO
      knockout (L-FoxO1,3,4), which are known to have reduced hepatic glucose
      production, also have increased HDL-C. This was associated with decreased
      expression of the HDL-C clearance factors scavenger receptor class B type I
      (SR-BI) and hepatic lipase and defective selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl
      ester by the liver. The phenotype could be rescued by re-expression of SR-BI.
      These findings demonstrate that hepatic FoxOs are required for cholesterol
      homeostasis and HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport to the liver.

LID - 10.1172/JCI94331 [doi]

AB  - Agonists of the vanilloid receptor transient vanilloid potential 1 (TRPV1) are
      emerging as highly efficacious nonopioid analgesics in preclinical studies. These
      drugs selectively lesion TRPV1+ primary sensory afferents, which are responsible 
      for the transmission of many noxious stimulus modalities. Resiniferatoxin (RTX)
      is a very potent and selective TRPV1 agonist and is a promising candidate for
      treating many types of pain. Recent work establishing intrathecal application of 
      RTX for the treatment of pain resulting from advanced cancer has demonstrated
      profound analgesia in client-owned dogs with osteosarcoma. The present study uses
      transcriptomics and histochemistry to examine the molecular mechanism of RTX
      action in rats, in clinical canine subjects, and in 1 human subject with advanced
      cancer treated for pain using intrathecal RTX. In all 3 species, we observe a
      strong analgesic action, yet this was accompanied by limited transcriptional
      alterations at the level of the dorsal root ganglion. Functional and
      neuroanatomical studies demonstrated that intrathecal RTX largely spares
      susceptible neuronal perikarya, which remain active peripherally but unable to
      transmit signals to the spinal cord. The results demonstrate that central
      chemo-axotomy of the TRPV1+ afferents underlies RTX analgesia and refine the
      neurobiology underlying effective clinical use of TRPV1 agonists for pain
      control.

PG  - 1509-1522
LID - 10.1172/JCI97350 [doi]
LID - 97350 [pii]
AB  - A modifier variant can abrogate the risk of a monogenic disorder. DFNM1 is a
      locus on chromosome 1 encoding a dominant suppressor of human DFNB26 recessive,
      profound deafness. Here, we report that DFNB26 is associated with a substitution 
      (p.Gly116Glu) in the pleckstrin homology domain of GRB2-associated binding
      protein 1 (GAB1), an essential scaffold in the MET proto-oncogene, receptor
      tyrosine kinase/HGF (MET/HGF) pathway. A dominant substitution (p.Arg544Gln) of
      METTL13, encoding a predicted methyltransferase, is the DFNM1 suppressor of
      GAB1-associated deafness. In zebrafish, human METTL13 mRNA harboring the modifier
      allele rescued the GAB1-associated morphant phenotype. In mice, GAB1 and METTL13 
      colocalized in auditory sensory neurons, and METTL13 coimmunoprecipitated with
      GAB1 and SPRY2, indicating at least a tripartite complex. Expression of
      MET-signaling genes in human lymphoblastoid cells of individuals homozygous for
      p.Gly116Glu GAB1 revealed dysregulation of HGF, MET, SHP2, and SPRY2, all of
      which have reported variants associated with deafness. However, SPRY2 was not
      dysregulated in normal-hearing humans homozygous for both the GAB1 DFNB26
      deafness variant and the dominant METTL13 deafness suppressor, indicating a
      plausible mechanism of suppression. Identification of METTL13-based modification 
      of MET signaling offers a potential therapeutic strategy for a wide range of
      associated hearing disorders. Furthermore, MET signaling is essential for diverse
      functions in many tissues including the inner ear. Therefore, identification of
      the modifier of MET signaling is likely to have broad clinical implications.

TI  - Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 regulates erythropoiesis by controlling GATA1
      translation.

AB  - Ribosomal proteins (RP) regulate specific gene expression by selectively
      translating subsets of mRNAs. Indeed, in Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 5q-
      syndrome, mutations in RP genes lead to a specific defect in erythroid gene
      translation and cause anemia. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of
      selective mRNA translation and involvement of ribosomal-associated factors in
      this process. Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 (RNH1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein
      that binds to and inhibits pancreatic-type ribonucleases. Here, we report that
      RNH1 binds to ribosomes and regulates erythropoiesis by controlling translation
      of the erythroid transcription factor GATA1. Rnh1-deficient mice die between
      embryonic days E8.5 and E10 due to impaired production of mature erythroid cells 
      from progenitor cells. In Rnh1-deficient embryos, mRNA levels of Gata1 are
      normal, but GATA1 protein levels are decreased. At the molecular level, we found 
      that RNH1 binds to the 40S subunit of ribosomes and facilitates polysome
      formation on Gata1 mRNA to confer transcript-specific translation. Further, RNH1 
      knockdown in human CD34+ progenitor cells decreased erythroid differentiation
      without affecting myelopoiesis. Our results reveal an unsuspected role for RNH1
      in the control of GATA1 mRNA translation and erythropoiesis.

TI  - A controlled human malaria infection model enabling evaluation of
      transmission-blocking interventions.
PG  - 1551-1562

LID - 98012 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs and vaccines that can interrupt the transmission of Plasmodium 
      falciparum will be important for malaria control and elimination. However, models
      for early clinical evaluation of candidate transmission-blocking interventions
      are currently unavailable. Here, we describe a new model for evaluating malaria
      transmission from humans to Anopheles mosquitoes using controlled human malaria
      infection (CHMI). METHODS: Seventeen healthy malaria-naive volunteers underwent
      CHMI by intravenous inoculation of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to
      initiate blood-stage infection. Seven to eight days after inoculation,
      participants received piperaquine (480 mg) to attenuate asexual parasite
      replication while allowing gametocytes to develop and mature. Primary end points 
      were development of gametocytemia, the transmissibility of gametocytes from
      humans to mosquitoes, and the safety and tolerability of the CHMI transmission
      model. To investigate in vivo gametocytocidal drug activity in this model,
      participants were either given an experimental antimalarial, artefenomel (500
      mg), or a known gametocytocidal drug, primaquine (15 mg), or remained untreated
      during the period of gametocyte carriage. RESULTS: Male and female gametocytes
      were detected in all participants, and transmission to mosquitoes was achieved
      from 8 of 11 (73%) participants evaluated. Compared with results in untreated
      controls (n = 7), primaquine (15 mg, n = 5) significantly reduced gametocyte
      burden (P = 0.01), while artefenomel (500 mg, n = 4) had no effect. Adverse
      events (AEs) were mostly mild or moderate. Three AEs were assessed as severe -
      fatigue, elevated alanine aminotransferase, and elevated aspartate
      aminotransferase - and were attributed to malaria infection. Transaminase
      elevations were transient, asymptomatic, and resolved without intervention.
      CONCLUSION: We report the safe and reproducible induction of P. falciparum
      gametocytes in healthy malaria-naive volunteers at densities infectious to
      mosquitoes, thereby demonstrating the potential for evaluating
      transmission-blocking interventions in this model. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Tuberous sclerosis complex-associated CNS abnormalities depend on hyperactivation
      of mTORC1 and Akt.
PG  - 1688-1706
LID - 10.1172/JCI96342 [doi]
LID - 96342 [pii]
AB  - Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a dominantly inherited disease caused by
      hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway and characterized by the development of
      hamartomas and benign tumors, including in the brain. Among the neurological
      manifestations associated with TSC, the tumor progression of static subependymal 
      nodules (SENs) into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) is one of the
      major causes of morbidity and shortened life expectancy. To date, mouse modeling 
      has failed in reproducing these 2 lesions. Here we report that simultaneous
      hyperactivation of mTORC1 and Akt pathways by codeletion of Tsc1 and Pten,
      selectively in postnatal neural stem cells (pNSCs), is required for the formation
      of bona fide SENs and SEGAs. Notably, both lesions closely recapitulate the
      pathognomonic morphological and molecular features of the corresponding human
      abnormalities. The establishment of long-term expanding pNSC lines from mouse
      SENs and SEGAs made possible the identification of mTORC2 as one of the mediators
      conferring tumorigenic potential to SEGA pNSCs. Notably, in spite of concurrent
      Akt hyperactivation in mouse brain lesions, single mTOR inhibition by rapamycin
      was sufficient to strongly impair mouse SEGA growth. This study provides evidence
      that, concomitant with mTORC1 hyperactivation, sustained activation of Akt and
      mTORC2 in pNSCs is a mandatory step for the induction of SENs and SEGAs, and, at 
      the same time, makes available an unprecedented NSC-based in vivo/in vitro model 
      to be exploited for identifying actionable targets in TSC.

TI  - IRE1alpha RNase-dependent lipid homeostasis promotes survival in Myc-transformed 
      cancers.

LID - 95864 [pii]
AB  - Myc activation is a primary oncogenic event in many human cancers; however, these
      transcription factors are difficult to inhibit pharmacologically, suggesting that
      Myc-dependent downstream effectors may be more tractable therapeutic targets.
      Here, we show that Myc overexpression induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
      and engages the inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha)/X-box binding
      protein 1 (XBP1) pathway through multiple molecular mechanisms in a variety of
      c-Myc- and N-Myc-dependent cancers. In particular, Myc-overexpressing cells
      require IRE1alpha/XBP1 signaling for sustained growth and survival in vitro and
      in vivo, dependent on elevated stearoyl-CoA-desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity.
      Pharmacological and genetic XBP1 inhibition induces Myc-dependent apoptosis,
      which is alleviated by exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. Of note, SCD1
      inhibition phenocopies IRE1alpha RNase activity suppression in vivo. Furthermore,
      IRE1alpha inhibition enhances the cytotoxic effects of standard chemotherapy
      drugs used to treat c-Myc-overexpressing Burkitt's lymphoma, suggesting that
      inhibiting the IRE1alpha/XBP1 pathway is a useful general strategy for treatment 
      of Myc-driven cancers.

TI  - Hypoglycemia unawareness in type 1 diabetes suppresses brain responses to
      hypoglycemia.
PG  - 1485-1495
LID - 10.1172/JCI97696 [doi]
LID - 97696 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among nondiabetic individuals, mild glucose decrements alter brain
      activity in regions linked to reward, motivation, and executive control. Whether 
      these effects differ in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with and without
      hypoglycemia awareness remains unclear. METHODS: Forty-two individuals (13
      healthy control [HC] subjects, 16 T1DM individuals with hypoglycemia awareness
      [T1DM-Aware], and 13 T1DM individuals with hypoglycemia unawareness
      [T1DM-Unaware]) underwent blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI brain
      imaging during a 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic (90 mg/dl)-hypoglycemic (60
      mg/dl) clamp for assessment of neural responses to mild hypoglycemia. RESULTS:
      Mild hypoglycemia in HC subjects altered activity in the caudate, insula,
      prefrontal cortex, and angular gyrus, whereas T1DM-Aware subjects showed no
      caudate and insula changes, but showed altered activation patterns in the
      prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus. Most strikingly, in direct contrast to HC
      and T1DM-Aware subjects, T1DM-Unaware subjects failed to show any
      hypoglycemia-induced changes in brain activity. These findings were also
      associated with blunted hormonal counterregulatory responses and hypoglycemia
      symptom scores during mild hypoglycemia. CONCLUSION: In T1DM, and in particular
      T1DM-Unaware patients, there is a progressive blunting of brain responses in
      cortico-striatal and fronto-parietal neurocircuits in response to mild-moderate
      hypoglycemia. These findings have implications for understanding why individuals 
      with impaired hypoglycemia awareness fail to respond appropriately to falling
      blood glucose levels. FUNDING: This study was supported in part by NIH grants
      R01DK020495, P30 DK045735, K23DK109284, K08AA023545. The Yale Center for Clinical

AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) often results in progressive renal dysfunction. The inactive
      rhomboid 2 (iRhom2) is a newly identified key regulator of A disintegrin and
      metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), whose substrates, such as TNF-alpha and
      heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic
      kidney diseases. Here, we demonstrate that deficiency of iRhom2 protects the
      lupus-prone Fcgr2b-/- mice from developing severe kidney damage without altering 
      anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) Ab production by simultaneously blocking
      HB-EGF/EGFR and TNF-alpha signaling in the kidney tissues. Unbiased transcriptome
      profiling of kidneys and kidney macrophages revealed that TNF-alpha and
      HB-EGF/EGFR signaling pathways are highly upregulated in Fcgr2b-/- mice,
      alterations that were diminished in the absence of iRhom2. Pharmacological
      blockade of either TNF-alpha or EGFR signaling protected Fcgr2b-/- mice from
      severe renal damage. Finally, kidneys from LN patients showed increased iRhom2
      and HB-EGF expression, with interstitial HB-EGF expression significantly
      associated with chronicity indices. Our data suggest that activation of
      iRhom2/ADAM17-dependent TNF-alpha and EGFR signaling plays a crucial role in
      mediating irreversible kidney damage in LN, thereby uncovering a target for
      selective and simultaneous dual inhibition of 2 major pathological pathways in
      the effector arm of the disease.

TI  - Tumor-infiltrating BRAFV600E-specific CD4+ T cells correlated with complete
      clinical response in melanoma.

AB  - T cells specific for neoantigens encoded by mutated genes in cancers are
      increasingly recognized as mediators of tumor destruction after immune checkpoint
      inhibitor therapy or adoptive cell transfer. Unfortunately, most neoantigens
      result from random mutations and are patient specific, and some cancers contain
      few mutations to serve as potential antigens. We describe a patient with stage IV
      acral melanoma who achieved a complete response following adoptive transfer of
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Tumor exome sequencing surprisingly
      revealed fewer than 30 nonsynonymous somatic mutations, including oncogenic
      BRAFV600E. Analysis of the specificity of TILs identified rare CD4+ T cells
      specific for BRAFV600E and diverse CD8+ T cells reactive to nonmutated
      self-antigens. These specificities increased in blood after TIL transfer and
      persisted long-term, suggesting they contributed to the effective antitumor
      immune response. Gene transfer of the BRAFV600E-specific T cell receptor (TCR)
      conferred recognition of class II MHC-positive cells expressing the BRAF
      mutation. Therapy with TCR-engineered BRAFV600E-specific CD4+ T cells may have
      direct antitumor effects and augment CD8+ T cell responses to self- and/or
      mutated tumor antigens in patients with BRAF-mutated cancers.

AB  - Disordered coagulation contributes to death in sepsis and lacks effective
      treatments. Existing markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
      reflect its sequelae rather than its causes, delaying diagnosis and treatment.
      Here we show that disruption of the endothelial Tie2 axis is a sentinel event in 
      septic DIC. Proteomics in septic DIC patients revealed a network involving
      inflammation and coagulation with the Tie2 antagonist, angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2), 
      occupying a central node. Angpt-2 was strongly associated with traditional DIC
      markers including platelet counts, yet more accurately predicted mortality in 2
      large independent cohorts (combined N = 1,077). In endotoxemic mice, reduced Tie2
      signaling preceded signs of overt DIC. During this early phase, intravital
      imaging of microvascular injury revealed excessive fibrin accumulation, a pattern
      remarkably mimicked by Tie2 deficiency even without inflammation. Conversely,
      Tie2 activation normalized prothrombotic responses by inhibiting endothelial
      tissue factor and phosphatidylserine exposure. Critically, Tie2 activation had no
      adverse effects on bleeding. These results mechanistically implicate Tie2
      signaling as a central regulator of microvascular thrombus formation in septic
      DIC and indicate that circulating markers of the Tie2 axis could facilitate
      earlier diagnosis. Finally, interventions targeting Tie2 may normalize
      coagulation in inflammatory states while averting the bleeding risks of current
      DIC therapies.

AB  - Aberrant activation of MAPK signaling leads to the activation of oncogenic
      transcriptomes. How MAPK signaling is coupled with the transcriptional response
      in cancer is not fully understood. In 2 MAPK-activated tumor types,
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor and melanoma, we found that ETV1 and other
      Pea3-ETS transcription factors are critical nuclear effectors of MAPK signaling
      that are regulated through protein stability. Expression of stabilized Pea3-ETS
      factors can partially rescue the MAPK transcriptome and cell viability after MAPK
      inhibition. To identify the players involved in this process, we performed a
      pooled genome-wide RNAi screen using a fluorescence-based ETV1 protein stability 
      sensor and identified COP1, DET1, DDB1, UBE3C, PSMD4, and COP9 signalosome
      members. COP1 or DET1 loss led to decoupling between MAPK signaling and the
      downstream transcriptional response, where MAPK inhibition failed to destabilize 
      Pea3 factors and fully inhibit the MAPK transcriptome, thus resulting in
      decreased sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors. We identified multiple COP1 and
      DET1 mutations in human tumors that were defective in the degradation of Pea3-ETS
      factors. Two melanoma patients had de novo DET1 mutations arising after
      vemurafenib treatment. These observations indicate that MAPK signaling-dependent 
      regulation of Pea3-ETS protein stability is a key signaling node in oncogenesis
      and therapeutic resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition.

AB  - The tumor suppressor FBW7 targets oncoproteins such as c-MYC for ubiquitylation
      and is mutated in several human cancers. We noted that in a substantial
      percentage of colon cancers, FBW7 protein is undetectable despite the presence of
      FBW7 mRNA. To understand the molecular mechanism of FBW7 regulation in these
      cancers, we employed proteomics and identified the deubiquitinase (DUB) USP9X as 
      an FBW7 interactor. USP9X antagonized FBW7 ubiquitylation, and Usp9x deletion
      caused Fbw7 destabilization. Mice lacking Usp9x in the gut showed reduced
      secretory cell differentiation and increased progenitor proliferation,
      phenocopying Fbw7 loss. In addition, Usp9x inactivation impaired intestinal
      regeneration and increased tumor burden in colitis-associated intestinal cancer. 
      c-Myc heterozygosity abrogated increased progenitor proliferation and tumor
      burden in Usp9x-deficient mice, suggesting that Usp9x suppresses tumor formation 
      by regulating Fbw7 protein stability and thereby reducing c-Myc. Thus, we
      identify a tumor suppressor mechanism in the mammalian intestine that arises from
      the posttranslational regulation of FBW7 by USP9X independent of somatic FBW7
      mutations.

AB  - During epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) epithelial cancer cells
      transdifferentiate into highly motile, invasive, mesenchymal-like cells, giving
      rise to disseminating tumor cells. Few of these disseminated cells successfully
      metastasize. Immune cells and inflammation in the tumor microenvironment were
      shown to drive EMT, but few studies investigated the consequences of EMT for
      tumor immunosurveillance. In addition to initiating metastasis, we demonstrate
      that EMT confers increased susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cells and
      contributes, in part, to the inefficiency of the metastatic process. Depletion of
      NK cells allowed spontaneous metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth.
      EMT-induced modulation of E-cadherin and cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1)
      mediated increased susceptibility to NK cytotoxicity. Higher CADM1 expression
      correlates with improved patient survival in 2 lung and 1 breast adenocarcinoma
      patient cohorts and decreased metastasis. Our observations reveal a novel
      NK-mediated, metastasis-specific immunosurveillance in lung cancer and present a 
      window of opportunity for preventing metastasis by boosting NK cell activity.

AB  - Epithelial tumor cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to gain
      metastatic activity. Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) have binding sites for a 
      common set of microRNAs (miRs) and regulate each other's expression by sponging
      miRs. Here, we address whether ceRNAs govern metastasis driven by the
      EMT-activating transcription factor ZEB1. High miR-181b levels were correlated
      with an improved prognosis in human lung adenocarcinomas, and metastatic tumor
      cell lines derived from a murine lung adenocarcinoma model in which metastasis is
      ZEB1-driven were enriched in miR-181b targets. ZEB1 relieved a strong basal
      repression of alpha1 integrin (ITGA1) mRNA, which in turn upregulated adenylyl
      cyclase 9 mRNA (ADCY9) by sponging miR181b. Ectopic expression of the ITGA1
      3'-untranslated region reversed miR-181b-mediated metastasis suppression and
      increased the levels of adenylyl cyclase 9 protein (AC9), which promoted tumor
      cell migration and metastasis. In human lung adenocarcinomas, ITGA1 and ADCY9
      levels were positively correlated, and an AC9-activated transcriptomic signature 
      had poor-prognostic value. Thus, ZEB1 initiates a miR-181b-regulated ceRNA
      network to drive metastasis.

LID - 120414 [pii]
AB  - Inheritance of the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) substantially
      increases the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). A large body 
      of evidence has firmly established a role for apoE in modulating the risk of
      developing the amyloid plaque pathology that is pathognomonic for AD. In this
      issue of the JCI, Liao and colleagues discovered that antibodies against a
      nonlipidated form of apoE4 are highly effective in delaying the deposition of
      amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in mouse models of AD pathology. Using a
      combination of passive immunization and viral-mediated expression of recombinant 
      antibodies, the authors show that Fc receptor-mediated clearance of the
      nonlipidated apoE4 was critical in delaying Abeta deposition. Collectively, this 
      study identifies a new therapeutic target that could be exploited to prevent, or 
      possibly reverse, the Abeta pathology of AD.

TI  - Targeting of nonlipidated, aggregated apoE with antibodies inhibits amyloid
      accumulation.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96429 [doi]
LID - 96429 [pii]
AB  - The apolipoprotein E E4 allele of the APOE gene is the strongest genetic factor
      for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). There is compelling evidence that apoE
      influences Alzheimer disease (AD) in large part by affecting amyloid beta (Abeta)
      aggregation and clearance; however, the molecular mechanism underlying these
      findings remains largely unknown. Herein, we tested whether anti-human apoE
      antibodies can decrease Abeta pathology in mice producing both human Abeta and
      apoE4, and investigated the mechanism underlying these effects. We utilized
      APPPS1-21 mice crossed to apoE4-knockin mice expressing human apoE4
      (APPPS1-21/APOE4). We discovered an anti-human apoE antibody, anti-human apoE 4
      (HAE-4), that specifically recognizes human apoE4 and apoE3 and preferentially
      binds nonlipidated, aggregated apoE over the lipidated apoE found in circulation.
      HAE-4 also binds to apoE in amyloid plaques in unfixed brain sections and in
      living APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. When delivered centrally or by peripheral injection,
      HAE-4 reduced Abeta deposition in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. Using adeno-associated
      virus to express 2 different full-length anti-apoE antibodies in the brain, we
      found that HAE antibodies decreased amyloid accumulation, which was dependent on 
      Fcgamma receptor function. These data support the hypothesis that a primary
      mechanism for apoE-mediated plaque formation may be a result of apoE aggregation,
      as preferentially targeting apoE aggregates with therapeutic antibodies reduces
      Abeta pathology and may represent a selective approach to treat AD.

TI  - Contributions of inflammation and tumor microenvironment to neurofibroma
      tumorigenesis.
LID - 10.1172/JCI99424 [doi]
LID - 99424 [pii]
AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 associates with multiple neoplasms and the Schwann cell 
      tumor neurofibroma is the most prevalent. A hallmark feature of neurofibroma is
      mast cell infiltration which is recruited by chemoattractant stem cell factor
      (SCF) that has been suggested to sustain neurofibroma tumorigenesis. In this
      study, using new genetically engineered Scf mice, we decipher the contributions
      of tumor-derived SCF and mast cells to neurofibroma development. We demonstrate
      that mast cell infiltration is dependent on SCF from tumor Schwann cells.
      However, removal of mast cells by depleting this main SCF source only slightly
      affects neurofibroma progression. Other inflammation signatures show that all
      neurofibromas are associated with high levels of macrophages regardless of Scf
      status. These findings suggest an active inflammation in neurofibromas and partly
      explain why mast cell removal alone is not sufficient to relieve tumor burden in 
      this experimental neurofibroma model. Furthermore, we show that plexiform
      neurofibromas are highly associated with injury-prone spinal nerves that are
      close to flexible vertebras. In summary, our study details the role of
      inflammation in neurofibromagenesis. These data paired with the observed tumor
      locations indicate that prevention of inflammation, and possibly nerve injury,
      are therapeutic approaches for neurofibroma prophylaxis and treatment that should
      be explored.

TI  - Neuronal hypothalamic regulation of body metabolism and bone density is
      galanin-dependent.
LID - 10.1172/JCI99350 [doi]
LID - 99350 [pii]
AB  - In the brain, the ventral hypothalamus (VHT) regulates energy and bone
      metabolism. Whether this regulation uses the same or different neuronal circuits 
      is unknown. Alteration of AP1 signaling in the VHT increases energy expenditure, 
      glucose utilization, and bone density, yet the specific neurons responsible for
      each or all of these phenotypes are not identified. Using neuron-specific
      genetically targeted AP1 alterations as a tool in adult mice, we found that AgRP-
      or POMC- expressing neurons, predominantly present in the arcuate nucleus (ARC)
      within the VHT, stimulate whole body energy expenditure, glucose utilization and 
      bone formation and density, although their effects on bone resorption differed.
      In contrast, AP1 alterations in Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-expressing neurons, 
      present in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), increase energy, but decrease
      bone density, suggesting that these effects are independent. Altered AP1
      signaling also increased the levels of the neuromediator galanin in the
      hypothalamus and global galanin deletion, VHT galanin silencing using shRNA, or
      pharmacological galanin receptor blockade, counteracted the observed effects on
      energy and bone. Thus, AP1 antagonism reveals that AgRP- and POMC- expressing
      neurons can stimulate body metabolism and increase bone density, with galanin
      acting as a central downstream effector. The results obtained with SF1-expressing
      neurons, however, indicate that bone homeostasis is not always dictated by the
      global energy status, and vice versa.

LID - 10.1172/JCI98509 [doi]
LID - 98509 [pii]
AB  - In situ cancer vaccines are under active clinical investigation due to their
      reported ability to eradicate both local and disseminated malignancies.
      Intratumoral vaccine administration is thought to activate a T cell mediated
      immune response, which begins in the treated tumor and cascades systemically. We 
      describe a positron emission tomography tracer (64Cu-DOTA-AbOX40) that enabled
      non-invasive and longitudinal imaging of OX40, a cell surface marker of T cell
      activation. We report the spatiotemporal dynamics of T cell activation following 
      in situ vaccination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, in a dual tumor bearing mouse 
      model. We demonstrate that OX40 imaging could predict tumor responses at day 9
      post treatment based on tumor tracer uptake at day 2, with higher accuracy than
      both anatomical and blood-based measurements. These studies provide key insights 
      into global T cell activation following local CpG treatment and indicate that
      64Cu-DOTA-AbOX40 is a promising candidate for monitoring clinical cancer
      immunotherapy strategies.

TI  - PPARgamma deacetylation dissociates thiazolidinedione's metabolic benefits from
      its adverse effects.
LID - 10.1172/JCI98709 [doi]
LID - 98709 [pii]
AB  - Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are PPARgamma agonists with potent insulin-sensitizing 
      effects. However, their use has been curtailed by significant adverse effects on 
      weight, bone, heart, and hemodynamic balance. TZDs induce the deacetylation of
      PPARgamma on K268 and K293 to cause the browning of white adipocytes. Here we
      showed that targeted PPARgamma mutations resulting in constitutive deacetylation 
      (K268R/K293R, 2KR) increased energy expenditure, and protected from visceral
      adiposity and diet-induced obesity by augmenting brown remodeling of white
      adipose tissues. Strikingly, when 2KR mice were treated with rosiglitazone, they 
      maintained the insulin-sensitizing, glucose-lowering response to TZDs, while
      displaying little, if any, adverse effects on fat deposition, bone density, fluid
      retention, and cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, deacetylation appears to fulfill the
      goal of dissociating the metabolic benefits of PPARgamma activation from its
      adverse effects. Strategies to leverage PPARgamma deacetylation may lead to the
      design of safer, more effective agonists of this nuclear receptor in the
      treatment of metabolic diseases.

TI  - Blocking fatty acid-fueled mROS production within macrophages alleviates acute
      gouty inflammation.
LID - 10.1172/JCI94584 [doi]
LID - 94584 [pii]
AB  - Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis affecting men. Acute gouty
      inflammation is triggered by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition in and
      around joints that activates macrophages into a proinflammatory state, resulting 
      in neutrophil recruitment. A complete understanding of how MSU crystals activate 
      macrophages in vivo has been difficult because of limitations of live imaging
      this process in traditional animal models. By live imaging the macrophage and
      neutrophil response to MSU crystals within an intact host (larval zebrafish), we 
      reveal that macrophage activation requires mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generated
      through fatty acid oxidation. This mitochondrial source of ROS contributes to
      NF-kappaB-driven production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, which promote neutrophil
      recruitment. We demonstrate the therapeutic utility of this discovery by showing 
      that this mechanism is conserved in human macrophages and, via pharmacologic
      blockade, that it contributes to neutrophil recruitment in a mouse model of acute
      gouty inflammation. To our knowledge, this study is the first to uncover an
      immunometabolic mechanism of macrophage activation that operates during acute
      gouty inflammation. Targeting this pathway holds promise in the management of
      gout and, potentially, other macrophage-driven diseases.

LID - 10.1172/JCI93198 [doi]
LID - 93198 [pii]
AB  - Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) are responsible for the initiation, development,
      and relapse of leukemia. The identification of novel therapeutic LIC targets is
      critical to curing leukemia. In this report, we reveal that junctional adhesion
      molecule 3 (JAM3) is highly enriched in both mouse and human LICs. Leukemogenesis
      is almost completely abrogated upon Jam3 deletion during serial transplantations 
      in an MLL-AF9-induced murine acute myeloid leukemia model. In contrast, Jam3
      deletion does not affect the functions of mouse hematopoietic stem cells.
      Moreover, knockdown of JAM3 leads to a dramatic decrease in the proliferation of 
      both human leukemia cell lines and primary LICs. JAM3 directly associates with
      LRP5 to activate the downstream PDK1/AKT pathway, followed by the downregulation 
      of GSK3beta and activation of beta-catenin/CCND1 signaling, to maintain the
      self-renewal ability and cell cycle entry of LICs. Thus, JAM3 may serve as a
      functional LIC marker and play an important role in the maintenance of LIC
      stemness through unexpected LRP5/PDK1/AKT/GSK3beta/beta-catenin/CCND1 signaling
      pathways but not via its canonical role in cell junctions and migration. JAM3 may
      be an ideal therapeutic target for the eradication of LICs without influencing
      normal hematopoiesis.

TI  - PAI1 mediates fibroblast-mast cell interactions in skin fibrosis.
LID - 10.1172/JCI99088 [doi]
LID - 99088 [pii]
AB  - Fibrosis is a prevalent pathological condition arising from the chronic
      activation of fibroblasts. This activation results from the extensive
      intercellular crosstalk mediated by both soluble factors and direct cell-cell
      connections. Prominent among these are the interactions of fibroblasts with
      immune cells, in which the fibroblast-mast cell connection, although
      acknowledged, is relatively unexplored. We have used a Tg mouse model of skin
      fibrosis, based on expression of the transcription factor Snail in the epidermis,
      to probe the mechanisms regulating mast cell activity and the contribution of
      these cells to this pathology. We have discovered that Snail-expressing
      keratinocytes secrete plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI1), which
      functions as a chemotactic factor to increase mast cell infiltration into the
      skin. Moreover, we have determined that PAI1 upregulates intercellular adhesion
      molecule type 1 (ICAM1) expression on dermal fibroblasts, rendering them
      competent to bind to mast cells. This heterotypic cell-cell adhesion, also
      observed in the skin fibrotic disorder scleroderma, culminates in the reciprocal 
      activation of both mast cells and fibroblasts, leading to the cascade of events
      that promote fibrogenesis. Thus, we have identified roles for PAI1 in the
      multifactorial program of fibrogenesis that expand its functional repertoire
      beyond its canonical role in plasmin-dependent processes.

TI  - Role of proNGF/p75 signaling in bladder dysfunction after spinal cord injury.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97837 [doi]
LID - 97837 [pii]
AB  - Loss of bladder control is a challenging outcome facing patients with spinal cord
      injury (SCI). We report that systemic blocking of pro-nerve growth factor
      (proNGF) signaling through p75 with a CNS-penetrating small-molecule p75
      inhibitor resulted in significant improvement in bladder function after SCI in
      rodents. The usual hyperreflexia was attenuated with normal bladder pressure, and
      automatic micturition was acquired weeks earlier than in the controls. The
      improvement was associated with increased excitatory input to the spinal cord, in
      particular onto the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers in the dorsal
      commissure. The drug also had an effect on the bladder itself, as the urothelial 
      hyperplasia and detrusor hypertrophy that accompany SCI were largely prevented.
      Urothelial cell loss that precedes hyperplasia was dependent on p75 in response
      to urinary proNGF that is detected after SCI in rodents and humans. Surprisingly,
      death of urothelial cells and the ensuing hyperplastic response were beneficial
      to functional recovery. Deleting p75 from the urothelium prevented urothelial
      death, but resulted in reduction in overall voiding efficiency after SCI. These
      results unveil a dual role of proNGF/p75 signaling in bladder function under
      pathological conditions with a CNS effect overriding the peripheral one.

TI  - Constitutively active follicle-stimulating hormone receptor enables
      androgen-independent spermatogenesis.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96794 [doi]
LID - 96794 [pii]
AB  - Spermatogenesis is regulated by the 2 pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing
      hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This process is considered
      impossible without the absolute requirement of LH-stimulated testicular
      testosterone (T) production. The role of FSH remains unclear because men and mice
      with inactivating FSH receptor (FSHR) mutations are fertile. We revisited the
      role of FSH in spermatogenesis using transgenic mice expressing a constitutively 
      strongly active FSHR mutant in a LH receptor-null (LHR-null) background. The
      mutant FSHR reversed the azoospermia and partially restored fertility of Lhr-/-
      mice. The finding was initially ascribed to the residual Leydig cell T
      production. However, when T action was completely blocked with the potent
      antiandrogen flutamide, spermatogenesis persisted. Hence, completely
      T-independent spermatogenesis is possible through strong FSHR activation, and the
      dogma of T being a sine qua non for spermatogenesis may need modification. The
      mechanism for the finding appeared to be that FSHR activation maintained the
      expression of Sertoli cell genes considered androgen dependent. The translational
      message of our findings is the possibility of developing a new strategy of
      high-dose FSH treatment for spermatogenic failure. Our findings also provide an
      explanation of molecular pathogenesis for Pasqualini syndrome (fertile eunuchs;
      LH/T deficiency with persistent spermatogenesis) and explain how the hormonal
      regulation of spermatogenesis has shifted from FSH to T dominance during
      evolution.

TI  - Loss-of-function CARD8 mutation causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and Crohn's 
      disease.
LID - 10.1172/JCI98642 [doi]
LID - 98642 [pii]
AB  - In these studies, we evaluated the contribution of the NLRP3 inflammasome to
      Crohn's disease (CD) in a kindred containing individuals having a missense
      mutation in CARD8, a protein known to inhibit this inflammasome. Whole exome
      sequencing and PCR studies identified the affected individuals as having a V44I
      mutation in a single allele of the T60 isoform of CARD8. The serum levels of
      IL-1beta in the affected individuals were increased compared with those in
      healthy controls, and their peripheral monocytes produced increased amounts of
      IL-1beta when stimulated by NLRP3 activators. Immunoblot studies probing the
      basis of these findings showed that mutated T60 CARD8 failed to downregulate the 
      NLRP3 inflammasome because it did not bind to NLRP3 and inhibit its
      oligomerization. In addition, these studies showed that mutated T60 CARD8 exerted
      a dominant-negative effect by its capacity to bind to and form oligomers with
      unmutated T60 or T48 CARD8 that impeded their binding to NLRP3. Finally,
      inflammasome activation studies revealed that intact but not mutated CARD8
      prevented NLRP3 deubiquitination and serine dephosphorylation. CD due to a CARD8 
      mutation was not effectively treated by anti-TNF-alpha, but did respond to
      IL-1beta inhibitors. Thus, patients with anti-TNF-alpha-resistant CD may respond 
      to this treatment option.

TI  - UHRF1 epigenetically orchestrates smooth muscle cell plasticity in arterial
      disease.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96121 [doi]
LID - 96121 [pii]
AB  - Adult vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) possess the peculiar ability to
      de-differentiate in response to extracellular cues, such as vascular damage and
      inflammation. De-differentiated VSMCs are proliferative, migratory, and have
      decreased contractile capacity. VSMC dedifferentiation contributes not only to
      vascular repair, but also to cardiovascular pathologies, such as intimal
      hyperplasia/restenosis in coronary artery or peripheral vascular diseases and
      arterial aneurysm. We here demonstrate the role of ubiquitin-like, containing PHD
      and RING finger domains, 1 (UHRF1) as an epigenetic master regulator of VSMC
      plasticity. The expression of UHRF1 correlates with the development of a wide
      array of vascular pathologies associated also with modulation of non-coding RNAs,
      such as microRNAs. Importantly, miR-145, a pivotal gene regulating VSMC
      plasticity, which is reduced in vascular diseases, was found to control Uhrf1
      mRNA translation. In turn, UHRF1 triggers VSMC proliferation by directly
      repressing the promoters of cell cycle inhibitor genes, such as p21 and p27, and 
      of key pro-differentiation genes via the methylation of DNA and histones. Local
      vascular viral delivery of Uhrf1 shRNAs or Uhrf1 VSMC-specific deletion prevented
      intimal hyperplasia in mouse carotid artery and decreased vessel damage in a
      mouse model of aortic aneurysm.Our study demonstrates the fundamental role of
      Uhrf1 in regulating VSMC phenotype by promoting proliferation and
      de-differentiation. UHRF1 targeting may hold therapeutic potential in vascular
      pathologies, modulating also the VSMC component.

TI  - HMGB1 promotes ductular reaction and tumorigenesis in autophagy-deficient livers.
LID - 10.1172/JCI91814 [doi]
LID - 91814 [pii]
AB  - Autophagy is important for liver homeostasis and the deficiency leads to injury, 
      inflammation, ductular reaction (DR), fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. It is not
      clear how these events are mechanistically linked to autophagy deficiency. Here
      we reveal the role of highmobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in two of these processes.
      First, HMGB1 was required for DR, which represents the expansion of hepatic
      progenitor cells (HPC) implicated in liver repair and regeneration. DR caused by 
      hepatic toxic diets (DDC or CDE) also depended on HMGB1, indicating that HMGB1
      may be generally required for DR in various injury scenarios. Second, HMGB1
      promoted tumor development in autophagy deficient livers. Receptor for advanced
      glycation end product (RAGE), a receptor for HMGB1, was required in the same two 
      processes, and could mediate HMGB1's proliferative effects in isolated HPC. HMGB1
      was released from autophagy-deficient hepatocytes independently of cellular
      injury, but depending on NRF2 and inflammasome, which was activated by NRF2.
      Pharmacological or genetic activation of NRF2 alone without disabling autophagy
      or causing injury was sufficient to cause inflammasomedependent HMGB1 release. In
      conclusion, HMGB1 release is a critical mechanism in hepatic pathogenesis under
      the autophagy deficient condition, which leads to HPC expansion but also tumor
      development.

TI  - HMGB1 links chronic liver injury to progenitor responses and
      hepatocarcinogenesis.
LID - 10.1172/JCI91786 [doi]
LID - 91786 [pii]
AB  - Cell death is a key driver of disease progression and carcinogenesis in chronic
      liver disease (CLD), highlighted by the well-established clinical correlation
      between hepatocellular death and risk for the development of cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, hepatocellular death is sufficient to
      trigger fibrosis and HCC in mice. However, the pathways through which cell death 
      drives CLD progression remain elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
      high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
      with key roles in acute liver injury, may link cell death to injury responses and
      hepatocarcinogenesis in CLD. While liver-specific HMGB1 deficiency did not
      significantly affect chronic injury responses such as fibrosis, regeneration and 
      inflammation, it inhibited ductular/progenitor cell expansion and hepatocyte
      metaplasia. HMGB1 promoted ductular expansion independently of active secretion
      in a non-autonomous fashion, consistent with its role as DAMP. Liver-specific
      HMGB1 deficiency reduced HCC development in three models with chronic injury but 
      not in a model lacking chronic liver injury. Similar to CLD, HMGB1 ablation
      reduced the expression of progenitor and oncofetal markers, a key determinant of 
      HCC aggressiveness, in tumors. In summary, HMGB1 links hepatocyte death to
      ductular reaction, progenitor signature and hepatocarcinogenesis in CLD.

TI  - Blocking IFNRA1 inhibits multiple myeloma-driven Treg expansion and
      immunosuppression.
LID - 10.1172/JCI88169 [doi]
LID - 88169 [pii]
AB  - Despite significant advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), most
      patients succumb to disease progression. One of the major immunosuppressive
      mechanisms that is believed to play a role in myeloma progression, is the
      expansion of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). In this study, we demonstrate that
      myeloma cells drive Treg expansion and activation by secreting type-1 interferon 
      (IFN). Blocking IFNAR1 (interferon alpha and beta receptor 1) on Tregs
      significantly decreases both, myeloma-associated Treg immunosuppressive function 
      and myeloma progression. Using syngeneic transplantable murine myeloma models and
      bone marrow (BM) aspirates of multiple myeloma patients, we found that Tregs were
      expanded and activated in the BM microenvironment at early stages of myeloma
      development. Selective depletion of Tregs led to a complete remission and
      prolonged survival in mice injected with myeloma cells. Further analysis of the
      interaction between myeloma cells and Tregs using gene sequencing and enrichment 
      analysis uncovered a feedback loop, wherein myeloma-cell-secreted type-1 IFN
      induced proliferation and expansion of Tregs. By using IFNAR1-blocking antibody
      treatment and IFNAR1 knockout Tregs, we demonstrated a significant decrease in
      myeloma-associated Treg proliferation, which was associated with longer survival 
      of myeloma-injected mice. Our results thus suggest that blocking type-1 IFN
      signaling represents a potential strategy to target immunosuppressive Treg
      function in MM.

TI  - Coexisting genomic aberrations associated with lymph node metastasis in breast
      cancer.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97449 [doi]
LID - 97449 [pii]
AB  - Single cancer cell sequencing studies currently use randomly-selected cells,
      limiting correlations between genomic aberrations, morphology and spatial
      localization. We laser-captured microdissected single cells from
      morphologically-distinct areas of primary breast cancer and corresponding lymph
      node metastasis and performed whole-exome or deep-target sequencing of greater
      than 100 such cells. Two major subclones co-existed in different areas of the
      primary tumor, and the lymph node metastasis originated from a minor subclone in 
      the invasive front of the primary tumor with additional copy number changes
      including 8q gain, but no additional point mutations in driver genes. Lack of
      metastasis-specific driver events lead us to assess whether other clonal and
      subclonal genomic aberrations pre-existing in primary tumors contribute to lymph 
      node metastasis. Gene mutations and copy number variations analyzed in five
      breast cancer tissue sample sets revealed that copy number variations in several 
      genomic regions, including areas within chromosome 1p, 8q, 9p, 12q and 20q,
      harboring several metastasis-associated genes, were consistently associated with 
      lymph node metastasis. Moreover, clonal expansion was observed in an area of
      morphologically-normal breast epithelia, likely driven by a driver mutation and a
      subsequent amplification in chromosome 1q. Our study illuminates the molecular
      evolution of breast cancer and genomic aberrations contributing to metastases.

TI  - Transient HIF2A inhibition promotes satellite cell proliferation and muscle
      regeneration.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96208 [doi]
LID - 96208 [pii]
AB  - The remarkable regeneration capability of skeletal muscle depends on coordinated 
      proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. The self-renewal of
      satellite cells is critical for long-term maintenance of muscle regeneration
      potential. Hypoxia profoundly affects the proliferation, differentiation, and
      self-renewal of cultured myoblasts. However, the physiological relevance of
      hypoxia and hypoxia signaling in satellite cells in vivo remains largely unknown.
      Here, we report that satellite cells are in an intrinsic hypoxic state in vivo
      and express hypoxia-inducible factor 2A (HIF2A). HIF2A promotes the stemness and 
      long-term homeostatic maintenance of satellite cells by maintaining the
      quiescence, increasing the self-renewal and blocking the myogenic differentiation
      of satellite cells. HIF2A stabilization in satellite cells cultured under
      normoxia augmented their engraftment potential in regenerative muscle. Reversely,
      HIF2A ablation led to the depletion of satellite cells and the consequent
      regenerative failure in the long-term. In contrast, transient pharmacological
      inhibition of HIF2A accelerated muscle regeneration by increasing satellite cell 
      proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, HIF2A induces the
      quiescence/self-renewal of satellite cells by binding the promoter of Spry1 gene 
      and activating Spry1 expression. These findings suggest that HIF2A is a pivotal
      mediator of hypoxia signaling in satellite cells and may be therapeutically
      targeted to improve muscle regeneration.

TI  - Reducing CXCR4-mediated nociceptor hyperexcitability reverses painful diabetic
      neuropathy.
LID - 10.1172/JCI92117 [doi]
LID - 92117 [pii]
AB  - Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is an intractable complication of diabetes that
      affects 25% of patients. PDN is characterized by neuropathic pain and small-fiber
      degeneration, accompanied by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor
      hyperexcitability and loss of their axons within the skin. The molecular
      mechanisms underlying DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability and small-fiber
      degeneration in PDN are unknown. We hypothesize that chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4
      signaling is central to this mechanism, as we have shown that CXCL12/CXCR4
      signaling is necessary for the development of mechanical allodynia, a pain
      hypersensitivity behavior common in PDN. Focusing on DRG neurons expressing the
      sodium channel Nav1.8, we applied transgenic, electrophysiological, imaging, and 
      chemogenetic techniques to test this hypothesis. In the high-fat diet mouse model
      of PDN, we were able to prevent and reverse mechanical allodynia and small-fiber 
      degeneration by limiting CXCR4 signaling or neuronal excitability. This study
      reveals that excitatory CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons
      plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mechanical allodynia and small-fiber
      degeneration in a mouse model of PDN. Hence, we propose that targeting
      CXCR4-mediated DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic
      approach for disease-modifying treatments for this currently intractable and
      widespread affliction.

TI  - Circadian clock component REV-ERBalpha controls homeostatic regulation of
      pulmonary inflammation.
LID - 10.1172/JCI93910 [doi]
LID - 93910 [pii]
AB  - Recent studies reveal that airway epithelial cells are critical pulmonary
      circadian pacemaker cells, mediating rhythmic inflammatory responses. Using mouse
      models, we now identify the rhythmic circadian repressor REV-ERB as essential to 
      the mechanism coupling the pulmonary clock to innate immunity, involving both
      myeloid, and bronchial epithelial cells in temporal gating and determining
      amplitude of response to inhaled endotoxin. Dual mutation of REV-ERBalpha and its
      paralog REV-ERBbeta in bronchial epithelia further augmented inflammatory
      responses and chemokine activation, but also initiated a basal inflammatory
      state, revealing a critical homeostatic role for REV-ERB proteins in the
      suppression of the endogenous pro-inflammatory mechanism in un-challenged cells. 
      However, REV-ERBalpha plays the dominant role as deletion of REV-ERBbeta alone
      had no impact on inflammatory responses. In turn, inflammatory challenges cause
      striking changes in stability and degradation of REV-ERBalpha protein, driven by 
      SUMOylation and ubiquitination. We developed a novel selective oxazole-based
      inverse agonist of REV-ERB, which protects REV-ERBalpha protein from degradation 
      and used this to reveal how pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger rapid degradation 
      of REV-ERalpha in the elaboration of an inflammatory response. Thus, dynamic
      changes in stability of REV-ERalpha protein couple the core clock to innate
      immunity.

      deficiency of a particular aldolase, aldolase B, results in the accumulation of
      intracellular phosphorylated fructose thus leading to phosphate sequestration and
      depletion, increased ATP turnover and a plethora of conditions leading to
      clinical manifestations including fatty liver, hyperuricemia, Fanconi syndrome
      and severe hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, to date, there is no treatment for HFI
      and avoiding sugar and fructose in our society has become quite challenging. In
      this report, through use of genetically modified mice and pharmacological
      inhibitors, we demonstrate that the absence or inhibition of ketohexokinase
      (Khk), an enzyme upstream of aldolase B, is sufficient to prevent hypoglycemia
      and liver and intestinal injury associated with HFI using aldolase B knockout
      mice. We thus provide evidence for the first time of a potential therapeutic
      approach for this condition. Mechanistically, our studies suggest that it is the 
      inhibition of the Khk C isoform, not the A isoform, that protects animals from
      HFI.

TI  - Mutant ataxin1 disrupts cerebellar development in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96765 [doi]
LID - 96765 [pii]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the protein ATXN1, which is involved in
      transcriptional regulation. Although symptoms appear relatively late in life,
      primarily from cerebellar dysfunction, pathogenesis begins early, with brain-wide
      transcriptional changes detectable as early as a week after birth in SCA1
      knock-in mice. Given the importance of this postnatal period for cerebellar
      development, we asked whether this region might be developmentally altered by
      mutant ATXN1. We found that expanded ATXN1 stimulates the proliferation of
      postnatal cerebellar stem cells in SCA1 mice. These hyper-proliferating stem
      cells tended to differentiate into GABAergic inhibitory interneurons rather than 
      astrocytes; this significantly increased the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron
      synaptic connections, disrupting cerebellar Purkinje cell function in a non-cell 
      autonomous manner. We confirmed the increased basket cell-Purkinje cell
      connectivity in human SCA1 patients. Mutant ATXN1 thus alters the neural
      circuitry of the developing cerebellum, setting the stage for the later
      vulnerability of Purkinje cells to SCA1. We propose that other late-onset
      degenerative diseases may also be rooted in subtle developmental derailments.

TI  - Dose intensification of TRAIL-inducing ONC201 inhibits metastasis and promotes
      intratumoral NK cell recruitment.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96711 [doi]
LID - 96711 [pii]
AB  - ONC201 is a first-in-class, orally active anti-tumor agent that upregulates
      cytotoxic TRAIL pathway signaling in cancer cells. ONC201 has demonstrated safety
      and preliminary efficacy in the first-in-human trial where patients were dosed
      every 3 weeks. We hypothesized that dose-intensification of ONC201 may impact
      anti-tumor efficacy. We discovered that ONC201 exerts dose- and
      schedule-dependent effects on tumor progression and cell-death signaling in vivo.
      With dose intensification, we note a potent anti-metastasis effect and inhibition
      of cancer cell migration and invasion. Our preclinical results prompted a change 
      in ONC201 dosing in all open clinical trials. We observe accumulation of
      activated NK+ and CD3+ cells within ONC201-treated tumors, and NK-cell depletion 
      inhibits ONC201 efficacy in vivo, including against TRAIL/ONC201-resistant Bax-/-
      tumors. Immunocompetent NCR1-GFP mice with GFP-expressing NK-cells demonstrate
      GFP(+)-NK cell infiltration of syngeneic MC38 colorectal tumors. Activation of
      primary human NK cells and increased de-granulation occur in response to ONC201. 
      Co-culture experiments identified a role for TRAIL in human NK-mediated
      anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Preclinical results indicate potential utility for
      ONC201 plus anti-PD-1 therapy. We observed an increase in activated
      TRAIL-secreting NK cells in the peripheral blood of patients after receiving
      ONC201 treatment. The results offer a unique pathway of immune stimulation for
      cancer therapy.

      liver injury.
LID - 10.1172/JCI95120 [doi]
LID - 95120 [pii]
AB  - Understanding the molecular basis of the regenerative response following hepatic 
      injury holds promise for improved treatments of liver diseases. Here, we report
      an innovative method to profile gene expression specifically in the hepatocytes
      that regenerate the liver following toxic injury. We utilize the Fah-/- mouse, a 
      model of hereditary tyrosinemia, which conditionally undergoes severe liver
      injury unless fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) expression is reconstituted
      ectopically. We employ translating ribosome affinity purification followed by
      high-throughput RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) to isolate mRNAs specific to
      repopulating hepatocytes. We uncover novel upstream regulators and important
      signaling pathways to be highly enriched in genes changed in regenerating
      hepatocytes. Specifically, we identify glutathione metabolism - particularly the 
      gene Slc7a11 encoding the cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) - to be massively
      upregulated during liver regeneration. Furthermore, we show that Slc7a11
      overexpression in hepatocytes enhances, and its suppression inhibits,
      repopulation following toxic injury. TRAP-seq allows cell type-specific
      expression profiling in repopulating hepatocytes and suggests xCT as a potential 
      therapeutic target for supporting antioxidant responses during liver
      regeneration.

TI  - A PET imaging agent for evaluating PARP-1 expression in ovarian cancer.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97992 [doi]
LID - 97992 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in a
      broad population of ovarian cancer patients, however resistance caused by low
      enzyme expression of the drug target, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1),
      remains to be clinically evaluated in this context. We hypothesize that PARP-1
      expression is variable in ovarian cancer and can be quantified in primary and
      metastatic disease using a novel positron emitting tomography (PET) imaging
      agent. METHODS: We used a translational approach to describe the significance of 
      PET imaging of PARP-1 in ovarian cancer. First, we produced PARP1 KO ovarian
      cancer cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test loss of PARP-1 as a
      resistance mechanism to all clinically used PARP inhibitors. Next, we performed
      pre-clinical microPET imaging studies using ovarian cancer patient derived
      xenografts in mouse models. Finally, in a phase 1 PET imaging clinical trial we
      explored PET imaging as a regional marker of PARP-1 expression in primary and
      metastatic disease through correlative tissue histology. RESULTS: We found
      deletion of PARP1 causes resistance to all PARP inhibitors in vitro and microPET 
      imaging provides proof of concept as an approach to quantify PARP-1 in vivo.
      Clinically, we observed a spectrum of standard uptake values (SUVs) for PARP-1 in
      tumors ranging from 2-12. In addition, we found a positive correlation between
      PET SUVs and fluorescent immunohistochemistry for PARP-1 (r2: 0.60). CONCLUSIONS:
      This work confirms the translational potential of a PARP-1 PET imaging agent and 
      supports future clinical trials to test PARP-1 expression as a method to stratify
      patients for PARP inhibitor therapy. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02637934.

TI  - Protein kinase N1 critically regulates cerebellar development and longterm
      function.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96165 [doi]
LID - 96165 [pii]
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that synapse dysfunctions are a major determinant of
      several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we identify
      protein kinase N1 (PKN1) as a novel key player in fine-tuning the balance between
      axonal outgrowth and presynaptic differentiation in the parallel fiber
      (PF)-forming cerebellar granule cells (Cgc). Postnatal Pkn1-/- animals showed a
      defective PF-Purkinje cell (PC) synapse formation. In vitro, Pkn1-/- Cgc
      exhibited deregulated axonal outgrowth, elevated AKT phosphorylation and higher
      levels of neuronal differentiation-2 (NeuroD2), a transcription factor preventing
      presynaptic maturation. Concomitantly Pkn1-/- Cgc had a reduced density of
      presynaptic sites. By inhibiting AKT with MK-2206 and siRNA-mediated knockdown,
      we found that AKT hyperactivation is responsible for the elongated axons, higher 
      NeuroD2 levels and the reduced density of presynaptic specifications in Pkn1-/-
      Cgc. In line with our in vitro data, Pkn1-/- mice showed AKT hyperactivation,
      elevated NeuroD2 levels and reduced expression of PF-PC synaptic markers during
      stages of PF maturation in vivo. The long-term effect of Pkn1 knockout was
      further seen in cerebellar atrophy and mild ataxia. In summary, our results
      demonstrate that PKN1 functions as a developmentally active gatekeeper of AKT
      activity, thereby fine-tuning axonal outgrowth and presynaptic differentiation of
      Cgc and subsequently the correct PF-PC synapse formation.

AB  - Intake of hemoglobin by the hemoglobin-haptoglobin receptor CD163 leads to a
      distinct alternative non-foam cell antiinflammatory macrophage phenotype that was
      previously considered atheroprotective. Here, we reveal an unexpected but
      important pathogenic role for these macrophages in atherosclerosis. Using human
      atherosclerotic samples, cultured cells, and a mouse model of advanced
      atherosclerosis, we investigated the role of intraplaque hemorrhage on macrophage
      function with respect to angiogenesis, vascular permeability, inflammation, and
      plaque progression. In human atherosclerotic lesions, CD163+ macrophages were
      associated with plaque progression, microvascularity, and a high level of
      HIF1alpha and VEGF-A expression. We observed irregular vascular endothelial
      cadherin in intraplaque microvessels surrounded by CD163+ macrophages. Within
      these cells, activation of HIF1alpha via inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases
      promoted VEGF-mediated increases in intraplaque angiogenesis, vascular
      permeability, and inflammatory cell recruitment. CD163+ macrophages increased
      intraplaque endothelial VCAM expression and plaque inflammation. Subjects with
      homozygous minor alleles of the SNP rs7136716 had elevated microvessel density,
      increased expression of CD163 in ruptured coronary plaques, and a higher risk of 
      myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease in population cohorts. Thus, our
      findings highlight a nonlipid-driven mechanism by which alternative macrophages
      promote plaque angiogenesis, leakiness, inflammation, and progression via the
      CD163/HIF1alpha/VEGF-A pathway.

TI  - A common variant alters SCN5A-miR-24 interaction and associates with heart
      failure mortality.
PG  - 1154-1163

LID - 95710 [pii]
AB  - SCN5A encodes the voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.5 that is responsible for
      depolarization of the cardiac action potential and rapid intercellular
      conduction. Mutations disrupting the SCN5A coding sequence cause inherited
      arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked
      to SCN5A splicing, localization, and function associate with heart
      failure-related sudden cardiac death. However, the clinical relevance of SNPs
      that modulate SCN5A expression levels remains understudied. We recently generated
      a transcriptome-wide map of microRNA (miR) binding sites in human heart,
      evaluated their overlap with common SNPs, and identified a synonymous SNP
      (rs1805126) adjacent to a miR-24 site within the SCN5A coding sequence. This SNP 
      was previously shown to reproducibly associate with cardiac electrophysiological 
      parameters, but was not considered to be causal. Here, we show that miR-24
      potently suppresses SCN5A expression and that rs1805126 modulates this
      regulation. We found that the rs1805126 minor allele associates with decreased
      cardiac SCN5A expression and that heart failure subjects homozygous for the minor
      allele have decreased ejection fraction and increased mortality, but not
      increased ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In mice, we identified a potential basis 
      for this in discovering that decreased Scn5a expression leads to accumulation of 
      myocardial reactive oxygen species. Together, these data reiterate the importance
      of considering the mechanistic significance of synonymous SNPs as they relate to 
      miRs and disease, and highlight a surprising link between SCN5A expression and
      nonarrhythmic death in heart failure.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) has been referred to as the cardiovascular epidemic of our
      time. Understanding the molecular determinants of HF disease progression and
      mortality risk is of utmost importance. In this issue of the JCI, Zhang et al.
      uncover an important link between clinical HF mortality risk and a common variant
      that regulates SCN5A expression through microRNA-dependent
      (miR-dependent)mechanisms. They also demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of SCN5A
      is associated with increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a
      genetically engineered murine model. Their data suggest that even modest
      depression of SCN5A expression may promote pathologic cardiac remodeling and
      progression of HF.

TI  - Alternative macrophages in atherosclerosis: not always protective!
PG  - 910-912
LID - 10.1172/JCI120123 [doi]
LID - 120123 [pii]
AB  - Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vasculature that is
      initiated by cholesterol deposition into the arterial wall, which triggers the
      infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells, including monocytes and
      macrophages. As atherosclerotic plaques progress, localized hypoxia promotes
      compensatory angiogenesis from the vasa vasorum. Immature neovessels are prone to
      leakage, thus destabilizing the plaque and leading to intraplaque hemorrhage.
      Macrophages with different phenotypes, ranging from classical inflammatory
      subtypes to alternatively activated antiinflammatory macrophages, have been
      identified in atherosclerotic lesions. Antiinflammatory hemoglobin-scavenging
      CD163+ macrophages are present in neovessel- and hemorrhage-rich areas; however, 
      the role of these macrophages in atherogenesis has been unclear. In this issue of
      the JCI, Guo, Akahori, and colleagues show that CD163+ macrophages promote
      angiogenesis, vessel permeability, and leucocyte infiltration in human and mouse 
      atherosclerotic lesions through a mechanism involving
      hemoglobin:haptoglobin/CD163/HIF1alpha-mediated VEGF induction. This study thus
      identifies proatherogenic properties of CD163+ macrophages, which previously were
      thought to be beneficial.

PG  - 1178-1189
LID - 10.1172/JCI97702 [doi]
LID - 97702 [pii]
AB  - The compensatory proliferation of insulin-producing beta cells is critical to
      maintaining glucose homeostasis at the early stage of type 2 diabetes. Failure of
      beta cells to proliferate results in hyperglycemia and insulin dependence in
      patients. To understand the effect of the interplay between beta cell
      compensation and lipid metabolism upon obesity and peripheral insulin resistance,
      we eliminated LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a pleiotropic mediator of
      cholesterol, insulin, energy metabolism, and other cellular processes, in beta
      cells. Upon high-fat diet exposure, LRP1 ablation significantly impaired insulin 
      secretion and proliferation of beta cells. The diminished insulin signaling was
      partly contributed to by the hypersensitivity to glucose-induced, Ca2+-dependent 
      activation of Erk and the mTORC1 effector p85 S6K1. Surprisingly, in
      LRP1-deficient islets, lipotoxic sphingolipids were mitigated by improved lipid
      metabolism, mediated at least in part by the master transcriptional regulator
      PPARgamma2. Acute overexpression of PPARgamma2 in beta cells impaired insulin
      signaling and insulin secretion. Elimination of Apbb2, a functional regulator of 
      LRP1 cytoplasmic domain, also impaired beta cell function in a similar fashion.
      In summary, our results uncover the double-edged effects of intracellular lipid
      metabolism on beta cell function and viability in obesity and type 2 diabetes and
      highlight LRP1 as an essential regulator of these processes.

TI  - TIA1 variant drives myodegeneration in multisystem proteinopathy with SQSTM1
      mutations.
PG  - 1164-1177

AB  - Multisystem proteinopathy (MSP) involves disturbances of stress granule (SG)
      dynamics and autophagic protein degradation that underlie the pathogenesis of a
      spectrum of degenerative diseases that affect muscle, brain, and bone.
      Specifically, identical mutations in the autophagic adaptor SQSTM1 can cause
      varied penetrance of 4 distinct phenotypes: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
      frontotemporal dementia, Paget's disease of the bone, and distal myopathy. It has
      been hypothesized that clinical pleiotropy relates to additional genetic
      determinants, but thus far, evidence has been lacking. Here, we provide evidence 
      that a TIA1 (p.N357S) variant dictates a myodegenerative phenotype when
      inherited, along with a pathogenic SQSTM1 mutation. Experimentally, the
      TIA1-N357S variant significantly enhances liquid-liquid-phase separation in vitro
      and impairs SG dynamics in living cells. Depletion of SQSTM1 or the introduction 
      of a mutant version of SQSTM1 similarly impairs SG dynamics.
      TIA1-N357S-persistent SGs have increased association with SQSTM1, accumulation of
      ubiquitin conjugates, and additional aggregated proteins. Synergistic expression 
      of the TIA1-N357S variant and a SQSTM1-A390X mutation in myoblasts leads to
      impaired SG clearance and myotoxicity relative to control myoblasts. These
      findings demonstrate a pathogenic connection between SG homeostasis and
      ubiquitin-mediated autophagic degradation that drives the penetrance of an MSP
      phenotype.

TI  - HIV latency is reversed by ACSS2-driven histone crotonylation.
PG  - 1190-1198
LID - 10.1172/JCI98071 [doi]
LID - 98071 [pii]
AB  - Eradication of HIV-1 (HIV) is hindered by stable viral reservoirs. Viral latency 
      is epigenetically regulated. While the effects of histone acetylation and
      methylation at the HIV long-terminal repeat (LTR) have been described, our
      knowledge of the proviral epigenetic landscape is incomplete. We report that a
      previously unrecognized epigenetic modification of the HIV LTR, histone
      crotonylation, is a regulator of HIV latency. Reactivation of latent HIV was
      achieved following the induction of histone crotonylation through increased
      expression of the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain
      family member 2 (ACSS2). This reprogrammed the local chromatin at the HIV LTR
      through increased histone acetylation and reduced histone methylation.
      Pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA knockdown of ACSS2 diminished histone
      crotonylation-induced HIV replication and reactivation. ACSS2 induction was
      highly synergistic in combination with either a protein kinase C agonist (PEP005)
      or a histone deacetylase inhibitor (vorinostat) in reactivating latent HIV. In
      the SIV-infected nonhuman primate model of AIDS, the expression of ACSS2 was
      significantly induced in intestinal mucosa in vivo, which correlated with altered
      fatty acid metabolism. Our study links the HIV/SIV infection-induced fatty acid
      enzyme ACSS2 to HIV latency and identifies histone lysine crotonylation as a
      novel epigenetic regulator for HIV transcription that can be targeted for HIV
      eradication.

TI  - Hypothalamic ER-associated degradation regulates POMC maturation, feeding, and
      age-associated obesity.
PG  - 1125-1140
LID - 10.1172/JCI96420 [doi]
LID - 96420 [pii]
AB  - Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons function as key regulators of metabolism and 
      physiology by releasing prohormone-derived neuropeptides with distinct biological
      activities. However, our understanding of early events in prohormone maturation
      in the ER remains incomplete. Highlighting the significance of this gap in
      knowledge, a single POMC cysteine-to-phenylalanine mutation at position 28
      (POMC-C28F) is defective for ER processing and causes early onset obesity in a
      dominant-negative manner in humans through an unclear mechanism. Here, we report 
      a pathologically important role of Sel1L-Hrd1, the protein complex of
      ER-associated degradation (ERAD), within POMC neurons. Mice with POMC
      neuron-specific Sel1L deficiency developed age-associated obesity due, at least
      in part, to the ER retention of POMC that led to hyperphagia. The Sel1L-Hrd1
      complex targets a fraction of nascent POMC molecules for ubiquitination and
      proteasomal degradation, preventing accumulation of misfolded and aggregated
      POMC, thereby ensuring that another fraction of POMC can undergo normal
      posttranslational processing and trafficking for secretion. Moreover, we found
      that the disease-associated POMC-C28F mutant evades ERAD and becomes aggregated
      due to the presence of a highly reactive unpaired cysteine thiol at position 50. 
      Thus, this study not only identifies ERAD as an important mechanism regulating
      POMC maturation within the ER, but also provides insights into the pathogenesis
      of monogenic obesity associated with defective prohormone folding.

TI  - Vhl deletion in osteoblasts boosts cellular glycolysis and improves global
      glucose metabolism.
PG  - 1087-1105
LID - 10.1172/JCI97794 [doi]
LID - 97794 [pii]
AB  - The skeleton has emerged as an important regulator of systemic glucose
      homeostasis, with osteocalcin and insulin representing prime mediators of the
      interplay between bone and energy metabolism. However, genetic evidence indicates
      that osteoblasts can influence global energy metabolism through additional, as
      yet unknown, mechanisms. Here, we report that constitutive or postnatally induced
      deletion of the hypoxia signaling pathway component von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) in
      skeletal osteolineage cells of mice led to high bone mass as well as hypoglycemia
      and increased glucose tolerance, not accounted for by osteocalcin or insulin. In 
      vitro and in vivo data indicated that Vhl-deficient osteoblasts displayed
      massively increased glucose uptake and glycolysis associated with upregulated
      HIF-target gene expression, resembling the Warburg effect that typifies cancer
      cells. Overall, the glucose consumption by the skeleton was increased in the
      mutant mice, as revealed by 18F-FDG radioactive tracer experiments. Moreover, the
      glycemia levels correlated inversely with the level of skeletal glucose uptake,
      and pharmacological treatment with the glycolysis inhibitor dichloroacetate
      (DCA), which restored glucose metabolism in Vhl-deficient osteogenic cells in
      vitro, prevented the development of the systemic metabolic phenotype in the
      mutant mice. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel link between cellular
      glucose metabolism in osteoblasts and whole-body glucose homeostasis, controlled 
      by local hypoxia signaling in the skeleton.

AB  - Infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain USA300 causes tissue injury, multiorgan
      failure, and high mortality. However, the mechanisms by which the bacteria adhere
      to, then stabilize on, mucosal surfaces before causing injury remain unclear. We 
      addressed these issues through the first real-time determinations of
      USA300-alveolar interactions in live lungs. We found that within minutes, inhaled
      USA300 established stable, self-associated microaggregates in niches at curved,
      but not at flat, regions of the alveolar wall. The microaggregates released
      alpha-hemolysin toxin, causing localized alveolar injury, as indicated by
      epithelial dye loss, mitochondrial depolarization, and cytosolic Ca2+ increase.
      Spread of cytosolic Ca2+ through intercellular gap junctions to adjoining,
      uninfected alveoli caused pulmonary edema. Systemic pretreatment with vancomycin,
      a USA300-cidal antibiotic, failed to protect mice infected with inhaled WT
      USA300. However, vancomycin pretreatment markedly abrogated mortality in mice
      infected with mutant USA300 that lacked the aggregation-promoting factor PhnD. We
      interpret USA300-induced mortality as having resulted from rapid bacterial
      aggregation in alveolar niches. These findings indicate, for the first time to
      our knowledge, that alveolar microanatomy is critical in promoting the
      aggregation and, hence, in causing USA300-induced alveolar injury. We propose
      that in addition to antibiotics, strategies for bacterial disaggregation may
      constitute novel therapy against USA300-induced lung injury.

TI  - STAT3/p53 pathway activation disrupts IFN-beta-induced dormancy in
      tumor-repopulating cells.
PG  - 1057-1073

LID - 96329 [pii]
AB  - Dynamic interaction with the immune system profoundly regulates tumor cell
      dormancy. However, it is unclear how immunological cues trigger cancer
      cell-intrinsic signaling pathways for entering into dormancy. Here, we show that 
      IFN-beta treatment induced tumor-repopulating cells (TRC) to enter dormancy
      through an indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase/kynurenine/aryl hydrocarbon
      receptor/p27-dependent (IDO/Kyn/AhR/p27-dependent) pathway. Strategies to block
      this metabolic circuitry did not relieve dormancy, but led to apoptosis of
      dormant TRCs in murine and human melanoma models. Specifically, blocking AhR
      redirected IFN-beta signaling to STAT3 phosphorylation through both tyrosine and 
      serine sites, which subsequently facilitated STAT3 nuclear translocation and
      subsequent binding to the p53 promoter in the nucleus. Upregulation of p53 in
      turn disrupted the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to excessive ROS production
      and dormant TRC death. Additionally, in melanoma patients, high expression of
      IFN-beta correlated with tumor cell dormancy. Identification of this mechanism
      for controlling TRC dormancy by IFN-beta provides deeper insights into
      cancer-immune interaction and potential new cancer immunotherapeutic modalities.

TI  - Physiological genomics identifies genetic modifiers of long QT syndrome type 2
      severity.
PG  - 1043-1056

LID - 94996 [pii]
AB  - Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited channelopathy associated with 
      life-threatening arrhythmias. LQTS type 2 (LQT2) is caused by mutations in KCNH2,
      which encodes the potassium channel hERG. We hypothesized that modifier genes are
      partly responsible for the variable phenotype severity observed in some LQT2
      families. Here, we identified contributors to variable expressivity in an LQT2
      family by using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs)
      and whole exome sequencing in a synergistic manner. We found that iPSC-CMs
      recapitulated the clinical genotype-phenotype discordance in vitro. Importantly, 
      iPSC-CMs derived from the severely affected LQT2 patients displayed prolonged
      action potentials compared with cells from mildly affected first-degree
      relatives. The iPSC-CMs derived from all patients with hERG R752W mutation
      displayed lower IKr amplitude. Interestingly, iPSC-CMs from severely affected
      mutation-positive individuals exhibited greater L-type Ca2+ current. Whole exome 
      sequencing identified variants of KCNK17 and the GTP-binding protein REM2,
      providing biologically plausible explanations for this variable expressivity.
      Genome editing to correct a REM2 variant reversed the enhanced L-type Ca2+
      current and prolonged action potential observed in iPSC-CMs from severely
      affected individuals. Thus, our findings showcase the power of combining
      complementary physiological and genomic analyses to identify genetic modifiers
      and potential therapeutic targets of a monogenic disorder. Furthermore, we
      propose that this strategy can be deployed to unravel myriad confounding
      pathologies displaying variable expressivity.

LID - 10.1172/JCI96481 [doi]
LID - 96481 [pii]
AB  - The mechanisms that mediate durable protection against Staphylococcus aureus skin
      reinfections are unclear, as recurrences are common despite high antibody titers 
      and memory T cells. Here, we developed a mouse model of S. aureus skin
      reinfection to investigate protective memory responses. In contrast with WT mice,
      IL-1beta-deficient mice exhibited poor neutrophil recruitment and bacterial
      clearance during primary infection that was rescued during secondary S. aureus
      challenge. The gammadelta T cells from skin-draining LNs utilized compensatory T 
      cell-intrinsic TLR2/MyD88 signaling to mediate rescue by trafficking and
      producing TNF and IFN-gamma, which restored neutrophil recruitment and promoted
      bacterial clearance. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the LNs revealed a clonotypic S.
      aureus-induced gammadelta T cell expansion with a complementarity-determining
      region 3 (CDR3) aa sequence identical to that of invariant Vgamma5+ dendritic
      epidermal T cells. However, this T cell receptor gamma (TRG) aa sequence of the
      dominant CDR3 sequence was generated from multiple gene rearrangements of TRGV5
      and TRGV6, indicating clonotypic expansion. TNF- and IFN-gamma-producing
      gammadelta T cells were also expanded in peripheral blood of IRAK4-deficient
      humans no longer predisposed to S. aureus skin infections. Thus, clonally
      expanded gammadelta T cells represent a mechanism for long-lasting immunity
      against recurrent S. aureus skin infections.

      cutaneous adverse reactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated (CTL-mediated) severe cutaneous
      adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic
      epidermal necrolysis (TEN), are rare but life-threatening adverse reactions
      commonly induced by drugs. Although high levels of CTL-associated cytokines,
      chemokines, or cytotoxic proteins, including TNF-alpha and granulysin, were
      observed in SJS-TEN patients in recent studies, the optimal treatment for these
      diseases remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      therapeutic mechanism of a TNF-alpha antagonist in CTL-mediated SCARs. METHODS:
      We enrolled 96 patients with SJS-TEN in a randomized trial to compare the effects
      of the TNF-alpha antagonist etanercept versus traditional corticosteroids.
      RESULTS: Etanercept improved clinical outcomes in patients with SJS-TEN.
      Etanercept decreased the SCORTEN-based predicted mortality rate (predicted and
      observed rates, 17.7% and 8.3%, respectively). Compared with corticosteroids,
      etanercept further reduced the skin-healing time in moderate-to-severe SJS-TEN
      patients (median time for skin healing was 14 and 19 days for etanercept and
      corticosteroids, respectively; P = 0.010), with a lower incidence of
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage in all SJS-TEN patients (2.6% for etanercept and
      18.2% for corticosteroids; P = 0.03). In the therapeutic mechanism study,
      etanercept decreased the TNF-alpha and granulysin secretions in blister fluids
      and plasma (45.7%-62.5% decrease after treatment; all P < 0.05) and increased the
      Treg population (2-fold percentage increase after treatment; P = 0.002), which
      was related to mortality in severe SJS-TEN. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-TNF-alpha
      biologic agent etanercept serves as an effective alternative for the treatment of
      CTL-mediated SCARs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01276314. FUNDING:

TI  - Claudin-18-mediated YAP activity regulates lung stem and progenitor cell
      homeostasis and tumorigenesis.
PG  - 970-984
LID - 10.1172/JCI90429 [doi]
LID - 90429 [pii]
AB  - Claudins, the integral tight junction (TJ) proteins that regulate paracellular
      permeability and cell polarity, are frequently dysregulated in cancer; however,
      their role in neoplastic progression is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that
      knockout of Cldn18, a claudin family member highly expressed in lung alveolar
      epithelium, leads to lung enlargement, parenchymal expansion, increased abundance
      and proliferation of known distal lung progenitors, the alveolar epithelial type 
      II (AT2) cells, activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), increased organ size,
      and tumorigenesis in mice. Inhibition of YAP decreased proliferation and
      colony-forming efficiency (CFE) of Cldn18-/- AT2 cells and prevented increased
      lung size, while CLDN18 overexpression decreased YAP nuclear localization, cell
      proliferation, CFE, and YAP transcriptional activity. CLDN18 and YAP interacted
      and colocalized at cell-cell contacts, while loss of CLDN18 decreased YAP
      interaction with Hippo kinases p-LATS1/2. Additionally, Cldn18-/- mice had
      increased propensity to develop lung adenocarcinomas (LuAd) with age, and human
      LuAd showed stage-dependent reduction of CLDN18.1. These results establish CLDN18
      as a regulator of YAP activity that serves to restrict organ size, progenitor
      cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis, and suggest a mechanism whereby TJ
      disruption may promote progenitor proliferation to enhance repair following
      injury.

LID - 99726 [pii]
AB  - Asthma is remarkably heterogeneous, and there are multiple underlying
      inflammatory pathways and structural airway abnormalities that lead to
      symptomatic disease. Consequently, a current challenge in the field is to
      precisely characterize different types of asthma, with the goal of developing
      personalized approaches to therapy. In the current issue of the JCI, Dunican et
      al. developed a noninvasive way to assess airway dysfunction in asthma by
      measuring mucus accumulation using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and
      found that mucus plugging of small airways was remarkably common in subjects with
      severe asthma. This work highlights the importance of noninvasive imaging
      approaches in defining specific asthma subsets and guiding targeted therapies.

      established in chronic severe asthma, and the role of eosinophils and their
      products in mucus plug formation is unknown. METHODS: In clinical studies, we
      developed and applied a bronchopulmonary segment-based scoring system to quantify
      mucus plugs on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) lung scans from 146
      subjects with asthma and 22 controls, and analyzed relationships among mucus plug
      scores, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and airway eosinophils.
      Additionally, we used airway mucus gel models to explore whether oxidants
      generated by eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) oxidize cysteine thiol groups to promote
      mucus plug formation. RESULTS: Mucus plugs occurred in at least 1 of 20 lung
      segments in 58% of subjects with asthma and in only 4.5% of controls, and the
      plugs in subjects with asthma persisted in the same segment for years. A high
      mucus score (plugs in >/= 4 segments) occurred in 67% of subjects with asthma
      with FEV1 of less than 60% of predicted volume, 19% with FEV1 of 60%-80%, and 6% 
      with FEV1 greater than 80% (P < 0.001) and was associated with marked increases
      in sputum eosinophils and EPO. EPO catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate and bromide
      by H2O2 to generate oxidants that crosslink cysteine thiol groups and stiffen
      thiolated hydrogels. CONCLUSION: Mucus plugs are a plausible mechanism of chronic
      airflow obstruction in severe asthma, and EPO-generated oxidants may mediate
      mucus plug formation. We propose an approach for quantifying airway mucus
      plugging using MDCT lung scans and suggest that treating mucus plugs may improve 
      airflow in chronic severe asthma. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov

TI  - Hippo-mediated suppression of IRS2/AKT signaling prevents hepatic steatosis and
      liver cancer.
PG  - 1010-1025
LID - 10.1172/JCI95802 [doi]
LID - 95802 [pii]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major risk factor for liver cancer;
      therefore, its prevention is an important clinical goal. Ablation of phosphatase 
      and tensin homolog (PTEN) or the protein kinase Hippo signaling pathway induces
      liver cancer via activation of AKT or the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ,
      respectively; however, the potential for crosstalk between the PTEN/AKT and
      Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathways in liver tumorigenesis has thus far remained unclear.
      Here, we have shown that deletion of both PTEN and SAV1 in the liver accelerates 
      the development of NAFLD and liver cancer in mice. At the molecular level,
      activation of YAP/TAZ in the liver of Pten-/- Sav1-/- mice amplified AKT
      signaling through the upregulation of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2)
      expression. Both ablation of YAP/TAZ and activation of the Hippo pathway could
      rescue these phenotypes. A high level of YAP/ TAZ expression was associated with 
      a high level of IRS2 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      Moreover, treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 or knockout of IRS2 by
      AAV-Cas9 successfully repressed liver tumorigenesis in Pten-/- Sav1-/- mice.
      Thus, our findings suggest that Hippo signaling interacts with AKT signaling by
      regulating IRS2 expression to prevent NAFLD and liver cancer progression and
      provide evidence that impaired crosstalk between these 2 pathways accelerates
      NAFLD and liver cancer.

TI  - Claudin-18: unexpected regulator of lung alveolar epithelial cell proliferation.
PG  - 903-905
LID - 10.1172/JCI99799 [doi]
LID - 99799 [pii]
AB  - Claudin 18 (CLDN18) is a tight junction protein that is highly expressed in the
      lung. While mice lacking CLDN18 exhibit the expected loss of epithelial integrity
      in the lung, these animals also have unexpectedly large lungs. In this issue of
      the JCI, Zhou, Flodby, and colleagues reveal that the increased lung size of
      Cldn18-/- mice is the result of increased type 2 alveolar epithelial (AT2) cell
      proliferation. This increase in proliferation was shown to be driven by
      translocation of the transcriptional regulator Yes-associated protein (YAP) to
      the nucleus and subsequent induction of proliferative pathways. CLDN18-deficent
      mice also had increased frequency of lung adenocarcinomas. Together, the results 
      of this study advance our understanding of the mechanisms that likely regulate
      homeostasis of the normal lung as well as promote the proliferative state of
      malignant cells found in lung adenocarcinomas thought to originate from AT2
      cells.

TI  - Factor XII and uPAR upregulate neutrophil functions to influence wound healing.
PG  - 944-959
LID - 10.1172/JCI92880 [doi]
LID - 92880 [pii]
AB  - Coagulation factor XII (FXII) deficiency is associated with decreased neutrophil 
      migration, but the mechanisms remain uncharacterized. Here, we examine how FXII
      contributes to the inflammatory response. In 2 models of sterile inflammation,
      FXII-deficient mice (F12-/-) had fewer neutrophils recruited than WT mice. We
      discovered that neutrophils produced a pool of FXII that is functionally distinct
      from hepatic-derived FXII and contributes to neutrophil trafficking at sites of
      inflammation. FXII signals in neutrophils through urokinase plasminogen activator
      receptor-mediated (uPAR-mediated) Akt2 phosphorylation at S474 (pAktS474).
      Downstream of pAkt2S474, FXII stimulation of neutrophils upregulated surface
      expression of alphaMbeta2 integrin, increased intracellular calcium, and promoted
      extracellular DNA release. The sum of these activities contributed to neutrophil 
      cell adhesion, migration, and release of neutrophil extracellular traps in a
      process called NETosis. Decreased neutrophil signaling in F12-/- mice resulted in
      less inflammation and faster wound healing. Targeting hepatic F12 with siRNA did 
      not affect neutrophil migration, whereas WT BM transplanted into F12-/- hosts was
      sufficient to correct the neutrophil migration defect in F12-/- mice and restore 
      wound inflammation. Importantly, these activities were a zymogen FXII function
      and independent of FXIIa and contact activation, highlighting that FXII has a
      sophisticated role in vivo that has not been previously appreciated.

TI  - Hypothalamic loss of Snord116 and Prader-Willi syndrome hyperphagia: the buck
      stops here?

AB  - Hyperphagia and obesity are the best-known manifestations of Prader-Willi
      syndrome (PWS) and are responsible for most of the overall morbidity and
      mortality associated with the disease. Yet these PWS symptoms remain poorly
      understood and without effective pharmacologic therapies. Mouse models attempting
      to recapitulate both the genetic alterations and marked hyperphagia plus obesity 
      of PWS have been enigmatic, leading to skepticism about the use of mouse models
      to investigate PWS. In this issue of the JCI, Polex-Wolf and colleagues challenge
      the skeptics by successfully inducing hyperphagia following bilateral mediobasal 
      hypothalamic deletion of the Snord116 gene from adult mice. Obesity also
      resulted, although only in a subset of mice. While this approach represents an
      exciting advance, highlighting a pathologic effect of loss of mediobasal
      hypothalamic Snord116 expression on the development of PWS's hallmark symptoms,
      the variability in the body-weight and body composition responses to this
      site-selective gene deletion raises several questions.

PG  - 897-899

LID - 98685 [pii]
AB  - Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the gut is common following
      hematopoetic cell transplantation (HCT) and is associated with high mortality.
      However, it remains unclear whether Th1 or Th17 CD4+ T cells can initiate acute
      gut GVHD. In this issue of the JCI, Ullrich and colleagues identified a subset of
      CD4+ T cells that express high levels of IL-7Ralpha and granulocyte-macrophage
      CSF (IL-7RalphahiGM-CSF+) cells that are involved in the induction of acute gut
      GVHD in murine models. The IL-7RalphahiGM-CSF+ effector memory cells were BATF
      dependent, RORgammat independent, produced large amounts of GM-CSF and IFN-gamma,
      and released little IL-17. CD4+IL-7RalphahiGM-CSF+ cells were not classical Th17 
      cells but had more of a Th1-like phenotype, despite their dependence on BATF.
      This work suggests that targeting the IL-7R/BATF/GM-CSF axis has therapeutic
      potential for treating acute gut GVHD.

TI  - BATF-dependent IL-7RhiGM-CSF+ T cells control intestinal graft-versus-host
      disease.
PG  - 916-930
LID - 10.1172/JCI89242 [doi]
LID - 89242 [pii]
AB  - Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) represents a severe, T cell-driven
      inflammatory complication following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (allo-HCT). GVHD often affects the intestine and is associated with a poor
      prognosis. Although frequently detectable, proinflammatory mechanisms exerted by 
      intestinal tissue-infiltrating Th cell subsets remain to be fully elucidated.
      Here, we show that the Th17-defining transcription factor basic leucine zipper
      transcription factor ATF-like (BATF) was strongly regulated across human and
      mouse intestinal GVHD tissues. Studies in complete MHC-mismatched and minor
      histocompatibility-mismatched (miHA-mismatched) GVHD models revealed that
      BATF-expressing T cells were functionally indispensable for intestinal GVHD
      manifestation. Mechanistically, BATF controlled the formation of
      colon-infiltrating, IL-7 receptor-positive (IL-7R+), granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor-positive (GM-CSF+), donor T effector memory (Tem)
      cells. This T cell subset was sufficient to promote intestinal GVHD, while its
      occurrence was largely dependent on T cell-intrinsic BATF expression, required
      IL-7-IL-7R interaction, and was enhanced by GM-CSF. Thus, this study identifies
      BATF-dependent pathogenic GM-CSF+ effector T cells as critical promoters of
      intestinal inflammation in GVHD and hence putatively provides mechanistic insight
      into inflammatory processes previously assumed to be selectively Th17 driven.

AB  - Recent findings have highlighted the role of microglia in orchestrating normal
      development and refining neural network connectivity in the healthy CNS.
      Microglia are not only vital cells in maintaining CNS homeostasis, but also
      respond to injury, infection, and disease by undergoing proliferation and changes
      in transcription and morphology. A better understanding of the specific role of
      microglia in responding to viral infection is complicated by the presence of
      nonmicroglial myeloid cells with potentially overlapping function in the healthy 
      brain and by the rapid infiltration of hematopoietic myeloid cells into the brain
      in diseased states. Here, we used an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1
      receptor (CSF1R) that depletes microglia to examine the specific roles of
      microglia in response to infection with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a
      neurotropic coronavirus. Our results show that microglia were required during the
      early days after infection to limit MHV replication and subsequent morbidity and 
      lethality. Additionally, microglia depletion resulted in ineffective T cell
      responses. These results reveal nonredundant, critical roles for microglia in the
      early innate and virus-specific T cell responses and for subsequent host
      protection from viral encephalitis.

      syndrome.
PG  - 960-969
LID - 10.1172/JCI97007 [doi]
LID - 97007 [pii]
AB  - Profound hyperphagia is a major disabling feature of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).
      Characterization of the mechanisms that underlie PWS-associated hyperphagia has
      been slowed by the paucity of animal models with increased food intake or
      obesity. Mice with a microdeletion encompassing the Snord116 cluster of noncoding
      RNAs encoded within the Prader-Willi minimal deletion critical region have
      previously been reported to show growth retardation and hyperphagia. Here,
      consistent with previous reports, we observed growth retardation in Snord116+/-P 
      mice with a congenital paternal Snord116 deletion. However, these mice neither
      displayed increased food intake nor had reduced hypothalamic expression of the
      proprotein convertase 1 gene PCSK1 or its upstream regulator NHLH2, which have
      recently been suggested to be key mediators of PWS pathogenesis. Specifically, we
      disrupted Snord116 expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus in Snord116fl mice
      via bilateral stereotaxic injections of a Cre-expressing adeno-associated virus
      (AAV). While the Cre-injected mice had no change in measured energy expenditure, 
      they became hyperphagic between 9 and 10 weeks after injection, with a subset of 
      animals developing marked obesity. In conclusion, we show that selective
      disruption of Snord116 expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus models the
      hyperphagia of PWS.

PG  - 1141-1153
LID - 10.1172/JCI94999 [doi]
LID - 94999 [pii]
AB  - Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy commonly due to
      mutations of the sodium channel gene SCN1A. Patients with DS have a high risk of 
      sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), widely believed to be due to
      cardiac mechanisms. Here we show that patients with DS commonly have peri-ictal
      respiratory dysfunction. One patient had severe and prolonged postictal
      hypoventilation during video EEG monitoring and died later of SUDEP. Mice with an
      Scn1aR1407X/+ loss-of-function mutation were monitored and died after spontaneous
      and heat-induced seizures due to central apnea followed by progressive
      bradycardia. Death could be prevented with mechanical ventilation after seizures 
      were induced by hyperthermia or maximal electroshock. Muscarinic receptor
      antagonists did not prevent bradycardia or death when given at doses selective
      for peripheral parasympathetic blockade, whereas apnea, bradycardia, and death
      were prevented by the same drugs given at doses high enough to cross the
      blood-brain barrier. When given via intracerebroventricular infusion at a very
      low dose, a muscarinic receptor antagonist prevented apnea, bradycardia, and
      death. We conclude that SUDEP in patients with DS can result from primary central
      apnea, which can cause bradycardia, presumably via a direct effect of hypoxemia
      on cardiac muscle.

TI  - Redirection to the bone marrow improves T cell persistence and antitumor
      functions.
LID - 10.1172/JCI97454 [doi]
LID - 97454 [pii]
AB  - A key predictor for the success of gene-modified T cell therapies for cancer is
      the persistence of transferred cells in the patient. The propensity of less
      differentiated memory T cells to expand and survive efficiently has therefore
      made them attractive candidates for clinical application. We hypothesized that
      re-directing T cells to specialized niches in the bone marrow (BM) that support
      memory differentiation would confer increased therapeutic efficacy. We show that 
      overexpression of chemokine receptor CXCR4 in CD8+ T cells (TCXCR4) enhanced
      their migration towards vascular-associated CXCL12+ cells in the BM and increased
      their local engraftment. Increased access of TCXCR4 to the BM microenvironment
      induced IL-15-dependent homeostatic expansion and promoted the differentiation of
      memory precursor-like cells with low expression of programmed death-1, resistance
      to apoptosis and a heightened capacity to generate poly-functional
      cytokine-producing effector cells. Following transfer to lymphoma-bearing mice,
      TCXCR4 showed a greater capacity for effector expansion and better tumor
      protection, the latter being independent of changes in trafficking to the tumor
      bed or local out-competition of regulatory T cells. Thus, re-directed homing of T
      cells to the BM confers increased memory differentiation and anti-tumor immunity,
      suggesting an innovative solution to increase the persistence and functions of
      therapeutic T cells.

TI  - Self-adjuvanting nanoemulsion targeting dendritic cell receptor Clec9A enables
      antigen-specific immunotherapy.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96791 [doi]
LID - 96791 [pii]
AB  - Non-antigen-specific stimulatory cancer immunotherapies are commonly complicated 
      by off-target effects. Antigen-specific immunotherapy, combining viral tumor
      antigen or personalised neo-epitopes with immune targeting, offers a solution.
      However, the lack of flexible systems targeting tumor antigens to
      cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) limits clinical development. Although
      antigen-anti-CLEC-9A mAb conjugates target cross-presenting DCs, adjuvant must be
      co-delivered for cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) induction. We functionalized tailored
      nanoemulsions encapsulating tumor antigens to target Clec9A (Clec9A-TNE).
      Clec9A-TNE encapsulating ovalbumin (OVA) antigen targeted and activated
      cross-presenting DCs without additional adjuvant, promoting antigen-specific CD4+
      and CD8+ T cell proliferation, CTL and antibody responses. OVA-Clec9A-TNE-induced
      DC activation required CD4 and CD8 epitopes, CD40 and IFN-alpha. Clec9A-TNE
      encapsulating human papillomavirus (HPV) E6-E7 significantly suppressed
      HPV-associated tumor growth while E6-E7-CpG did not. Clec9A-TNE loaded with
      pooled B16F10 melanoma neo-epitopes induced epitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
      responses, permitting selection of immunogenic neo-epitopes. Clec9A-TNE
      encapsulating six neo-epitopes significantly suppressed B16-F10 melanoma growth
      in a CD4 T cell-dependent manner. Thus, cross-presenting DCs targeted with
      antigen-Clec9A-TNE stimulate therapeutically-effective tumor-specific immunity,
      dependent on T cell help.

TI  - Tandem bispecific neutralizing antibody eliminates HIV-1 infection in humanized
      mice.
LID - 10.1172/JCI96764 [doi]
LID - 96764 [pii]
AB  - The discovery of an HIV-1 cure remains a medical challenge because the virus
      rebounds quickly after the cessation of combination antiretroviral drug therapy
      (cART). Here, we investigate the potential of an engineered tandem bi-specific
      broadly neutralizing antibody (bs-bnAb) as an innovative product for HIV-1
      prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. We discovered that by preserving two 
      scFv binding domains of each parental bnAb, a single-gene-encoded tandem bs-bnAb,
      namely BiIA-SG, displayed significantly improved breadth and potency. BiIA-SG
      neutralized all 124 HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses tested, including global
      subtypes/recombinant forms, transmitted/founder viruses, and variants less or not
      susceptible to parental and many bnAbs, with an average IC50 value of 0.073
      micro/ml (range < 0.001 to 1.03 microg/ml). In humanized mice, an injection of
      BiIA-SG conferred sterile protection when administered prior to challenges with
      diverse live HIV-1 stains. Moreover, while BiIA-SG delayed viral rebound in a
      short-term therapeutic setting when combined with cART, a single injection of
      AAV-transferred BiIA-SG gene resulted dose-dependently in prolonged in vivo
      expression of BiIA-SG, which was associated with complete viremia control and
      subsequent elimination of infected cells in humanized mice. These results warrant
      the clinical development of BiIA-SG as a promising bs-bnAb-based biomedical
      intervention for prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infections.

LID - 97509 [pii]
AB  - The fundamental pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuronal dysfunction
      leading to cognitive impairment. The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), derived from
      amyloid precursor protein, is one driver of AD, but how it leads to neuronal
      dysfunction is not established. In this Review, I discuss the complexity of AD
      and possible cause-and-effect relationships between Abeta and the vascular and
      hemostatic systems. AD can be considered a multifactorial syndrome with various
      contributing pathological mechanisms. Therefore, as is routinely done with
      cancer, it will be important to classify patients with respect to their disease
      signature so that specific pathologies, including vascular pathways, can be
      therapeutically targeted.

      fructose metabolism as well as potential mechanisms by which excessive fructose
      consumption may contribute to cardiometabolic disease.

      progression and metastasis.
PG  - 834-845
LID - 10.1172/JCI94674 [doi]
LID - 94674 [pii]
AB  - The endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor Tie1 remains poorly characterized,
      largely owing to its orphan receptor status. Global Tie1 inactivation causes late
      embryonic lethality, thereby reflecting its importance during development. Tie1
      also plays pivotal roles during pathologies such as atherosclerosis and
      tumorigenesis. In order to study the contribution of Tie1 to tumor progression
      and metastasis, we conditionally deleted Tie1 in endothelial cells at different
      stages of tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. Tie1 deletion during primary
      tumor growth in mice led to a decrease in microvessel density and an increase in 
      mural cell coverage with improved vessel perfusion. Reduced angiogenesis and
      enhanced vascular normalization resulted in a progressive increase of
      intratumoral necrosis that caused a growth delay only at later stages of tumor
      progression. Concomitantly, surgical removal of the primary tumor decreased the
      number of circulating tumor cells, reduced metastasis, and prolonged overall
      survival. Additionally, Tie1 deletion in experimental murine metastasis models
      prevented extravasation of tumor cells into the lungs and reduced metastatic
      foci. Taken together, the data support Tie1 as a therapeutic target by defining
      its regulatory functions during angiogenesis and vascular abnormalization and
      identifying its role during metastasis.

      current efforts to cure infection. The so-called kick-and-kill paradigm proposes 
      to purge these reservoirs by combining latency-reversing agents with immune
      effectors such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Support for this approach is largely
      based on success in latency models, which do not fully reflect the makeup of
      latent reservoirs in individuals on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART).
      Recent studies have shown that CD8+ T cells have the potential to recognize
      defective proviruses, which comprise the vast majority of all infected cells, and
      that the proviral landscape can be shaped over time due to in vivo clonal
      expansion of infected CD4+ T cells. Here, we have shown that treating CD4+ T
      cells from ART-treated individuals with combinations of potent latency-reversing 
      agents and autologous CD8+ T cells consistently reduced cell-associated HIV DNA, 
      but failed to deplete replication-competent virus. These CD8+ T cells recognized 
      and potently eliminated CD4+ T cells that were newly infected with autologous
      reservoir virus, ruling out a role for both immune escape and CD8+ T cell
      dysfunction. Thus, our results suggest that cells harboring replication-competent
      HIV possess an inherent resistance to CD8+ T cells that may need to be addressed 
      to cure infection.

TI  - Aberrant TGF-beta activation in bone tendon insertion induces enthesopathy-like
      disease.
PG  - 846-860
LID - 10.1172/JCI96186 [doi]
LID - 96186 [pii]
AB  - Enthesopathy is a disorder of bone, tendon, or ligament insertion. It represents 
      one-fourth of all tendon-ligament diseases and is one of the most difficult
      tendon-ligament disorders to treat. Despite its high prevalence, the exact
      pathogenesis of this condition remains unknown. Here, we show that TGF-beta was
      activated in both a semi-Achilles tendon transection (SMTS) mouse model and in a 
      dorsiflexion immobilization (DI) mouse model of enthesopathy. High concentrations
      of active TGF-beta recruited mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) and led to
      excessive vessel formation, bone deterioration, and fibrocartilage calcification.
      Transgenic expression of active TGF-beta1 in bone also induced enthesopathy with 
      a phenotype similar to that observed in SMTS and DI mice. Systemic inhibition of 
      TGF-beta activity by injection of 1D11, a TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody, but not
      a vehicle antibody, attenuated the excessive vessel formation and restored
      uncoupled bone remodeling in SMTS mice. 1D11-treated SMTS fibrocartilage had
      increased proteoglycan and decreased collagen X and matrix metalloproteinase 13
      expression relative to control antibody treatment. Notably, inducible knockout of
      the TGF-beta type II receptor in mouse MSCs preserved the bone microarchitecture 
      and fibrocartilage composition after SMTS relative to the WT littermate controls.
      Thus, elevated levels of active TGF-beta in the enthesis bone marrow induce the
      initial pathological changes of enthesopathy, indicating that TGF-beta inhibition
      could be a potential therapeutic strategy.

TI  - JAK2/IDH-mutant-driven myeloproliferative neoplasm is sensitive to combined
      targeted inhibition.
PG  - 789-804
LID - 10.1172/JCI94516 [doi]
LID - 94516 [pii]
AB  - Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) frequently progress to bone
      marrow failure or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and mutations in epigenetic
      regulators such as the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are
      associated with poor outcomes. Here, we showed that combined expression of
      Jak2V617F and mutant IDH1R132H or Idh2R140Q induces MPN progression, alters
      stem/progenitor cell function, and impairs differentiation in mice. Jak2V617F
      Idh2R140Q-mutant MPNs were sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of IDH.
      Combined inhibition of JAK2 and IDH2 normalized the stem and progenitor cell
      compartments in the murine model and reduced disease burden to a greater extent
      than was seen with JAK inhibition alone. In addition, combined JAK2 and IDH2
      inhibitor treatment also reversed aberrant gene expression in MPN stem cells and 
      reversed the metabolite perturbations induced by concurrent JAK2 and IDH2
      mutations. Combined JAK2 and IDH2 inhibitor therapy also showed cooperative
      efficacy in cells from MPN patients with both JAK2mut and IDH2mut mutations.
      Taken together, these data suggest that combined JAK and IDH inhibition may offer
      a therapeutic advantage in this high-risk MPN subtype.

AB  - The prognosis for bladder cancer patients with lymph node (LN) metastasis is
      dismal and only minimally improved by current treatment modalities. Elucidation
      of the molecular mechanisms that underlie LN metastasis may provide clinical
      therapeutic strategies for LN-metastatic bladder cancer. Here, we report that a
      long noncoding RNA LINC00958, which we have termed bladder cancer-associated
      transcript 2 (BLACAT2), was markedly upregulated in LN-metastatic bladder cancer 
      and correlated with LN metastasis. Overexpression of BLACAT2 promoted bladder
      cancer-associated lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in both cultured
      bladder cancer cell lines and mouse models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
      BLACAT2 epigenetically upregulated VEGF-C expression by directly associating with
      WDR5, a core subunit of human H3K4 methyltransferase complexes. Importantly,
      administration of an anti-VEGF-C antibody inhibited LN metastasis in
      BLACAT2-overexpressing bladder cancer. Taken together, these findings uncover a
      molecular mechanism in the lymphatic metastasis of bladder cancer and indicate
      that BLACAT2 may represent a target for clinical intervention in LN-metastatic
      bladder cancer.

AB  - Blockade of the checkpoint inhibitor programmed death 1 (PD1) has demonstrated
      remarkable success in the clinic for the treatment of cancer; however, a majority
      of tumors are resistant to anti-PD1 monotherapy. Numerous ongoing clinical
      combination therapy studies will likely reveal additional therapeutics that
      complement anti-PD1 blockade. Recent studies found that immunogenic cell death
      (ICD) improves T cell responses against different tumors, thus indicating that
      ICD may further augment antitumor immunity elicited by anti-PD1. Here, we
      observed antitumor activity following combinatorial therapy with anti-PD1 Ab and 
      the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dinaciclib in immunocompetent mouse tumor
      models. Dinaciclib induced a type I IFN gene signature within the tumor, leading 
      us to hypothesize that dinaciclib potentiates the effects of anti-PD1 by
      eliciting ICD. Indeed, tumor cells treated with dinaciclib showed the hallmarks
      of ICD including surface calreticulin expression and release of high mobility
      group box 1 (HMGB1) and ATP. Mice treated with both anti-PD1 and dinaciclib
      showed increased T cell infiltration and DC activation within the tumor,
      indicating that this combination improves the overall quality of the immune
      response generated. These findings identify a potential mechanism for the
      observed benefit of combining dinaciclib and anti-PD1, in which dinaciclib
      induces ICD, thereby converting the tumor cell into an endogenous vaccine and
      boosting the effects of anti-PD1.

PG  - 816-825

LID - 96160 [pii]
AB  - Paclitaxel is among the most widely used anticancer drugs and is known to cause a
      dose-limiting peripheral neurotoxicity, the initiating mechanisms of which remain
      unknown. Here, we identified the murine solute carrier organic anion-transporting
      polypeptide B2 (OATP1B2) as a mediator of paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity.
      Additionally, using established tests to assess acute and chronic
      paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity, we found that genetic or pharmacologic knockout
      of OATP1B2 protected mice from mechanically induced allodynia, thermal
      hyperalgesia, and changes in digital maximal action potential amplitudes. The
      function of this transport system was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
      nilotinib through a noncompetitive mechanism, without compromising the anticancer
      properties of paclitaxel. Collectively, our findings reveal a pathway that
      explains the fundamental basis of paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity, with
      potential implications for its therapeutic management.

TI  - Role for VGLUT2 in selective vulnerability of midbrain dopamine neurons.
PG  - 774-788
LID - 10.1172/JCI95795 [doi]
LID - 95795 [pii]
AB  - Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the 
      substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area
      are more resistant to this degeneration than those in the SNc, though the
      mechanisms for selective resistance or vulnerability remain poorly understood. A 
      key to elucidating these processes may lie within the subset of DA neurons that
      corelease glutamate and express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. Here,
      we addressed the potential relationship between VGLUT expression and DA neuronal 
      vulnerability by overexpressing VGLUT in DA neurons of flies and mice. In
      Drosophila, VGLUT overexpression led to loss of select DA neuron populations.
      Similarly, expression of VGLUT2 specifically in murine SNc DA neurons led to
      neuronal loss and Parkinsonian behaviors. Other neuronal cell types showed no
      such sensitivity, suggesting that DA neurons are distinctively vulnerable to
      VGLUT2 expression. Additionally, most DA neurons expressed VGLUT2 during
      development, and coexpression of VGLUT2 with DA markers increased following
      injury in the adult. Finally, conditional deletion of VGLUT2 made DA neurons more
      susceptible to Parkinsonian neurotoxins. These data suggest that the balance of
      VGLUT2 expression is a crucial determinant of DA neuron survival. Ultimately,
      manipulation of this VGLUT2-dependent process may represent an avenue for
      therapeutic development.

      proteotoxicity.
PG  - 682-698
LID - 10.1172/JCI85210 [doi]
LID - 85210 [pii]
AB  - Islet amyloidosis is characterized by the aberrant accumulation of islet amyloid 
      polypeptide (IAPP) in pancreatic islets, resulting in beta cell toxicity, which
      exacerbates type 2 diabetes and islet transplant failure. It is not fully clear
      how IAPP induces cellular stress or how IAPP-induced toxicity can be prevented or
      treated. We recently defined the properties of toxic IAPP species. Here, we have 
      identified a receptor-mediated mechanism of islet amyloidosis-induced
      proteotoxicity. In human diabetic pancreas and in cellular and mouse models of
      islet amyloidosis, increased expression of the receptor for advanced glycation
      endproducts (RAGE) correlated with human IAPP-induced (h-IAPP-induced) beta cell 
      and islet inflammation, toxicity, and apoptosis. RAGE selectively bound toxic
      intermediates, but not nontoxic forms of h-IAPP, including amyloid fibrils. The
      isolated extracellular ligand-binding domains of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) blocked
      both h-IAPP toxicity and amyloid formation. Inhibition of the interaction between
      h-IAPP and RAGE by sRAGE, RAGE-blocking antibodies, or genetic RAGE deletion
      protected pancreatic islets, beta cells, and smooth muscle cells from
      h-IAPP-induced inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. sRAGE-treated h-IAPP Tg
      mice were protected from amyloid deposition, loss of beta cell area, beta cell
      inflammation, stress, apoptosis, and glucose intolerance. These findings
      establish RAGE as a mediator of IAPP-induced toxicity and suggest that targeting 
      the IAPP/RAGE axis is a potential strategy to mitigate this source of beta cell
      dysfunction in metabolic disease.

LID - 99037 [pii]
AB  - Hepatic glucose production (HGP) is a key determinant of glucose homeostasis.
      Glucagon binding to its cognate seven-transmembrane Gs-coupled receptor in
      hepatocytes stimulates cAMP production, resulting in increased HGP. In this issue
      of the JCI, Rossi and colleagues tested the hypothesis that activation of hepatic
      Gi-coupled receptors, which should inhibit cAMP production, would oppose the
      cAMP-inducing action of glucagon and thereby decrease HGP. Surprisingly, however,
      the opposite occurred: activation of Gi signaling increased HGP via a novel
      mechanism, while inhibition of Gi signaling reduced HGP. These results define a
      new physiologic role for hepatic Gi signaling and identify a potential
      therapeutic target for HGP regulation.

TI  - Zinc transporter Slc39a8 is essential for cardiac ventricular compaction.
PG  - 826-833
LID - 10.1172/JCI96993 [doi]
LID - 96993 [pii]
AB  - Isolated left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) results from excessive
      trabeculation and impaired myocardial compaction during heart development. The
      extracellular matrix (ECM) that separates endocardium from myocardium plays a
      critical but poorly understood role in ventricular trabeculation and compaction. 
      In an attempt to characterize solute carrier family 39 member 8-null
      (Slc39a8-null) mice, we discovered that homozygous null embryos do not survive
      embryogenesis and exhibit a cardiac phenotype similar to human LVNC. Slc39a8
      encodes a divalent metal cation importer that has been implicated in ECM
      degradation through the zinc/metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (Zn/MTF1)
      axis, which promotes the expression of ECM-degrading enzymes, including Adamts
      metalloproteinases. Here, we have shown that Slc39a8 is expressed by endothelial 
      cells in the developing mouse heart, where it serves to maintain cellular Zn
      levels. Furthermore, Slc39a8-null hearts exhibited marked ECM accumulation and
      reduction of several Adamts metalloproteinases. Consistent with the in vivo
      observations, knockdown of SLC39A8 in HUVECs decreased ADAMTS1 transcription by
      decreasing cellular Zn uptake and, as a result, MTF1 transcriptional activity.
      Our study thus identifies a gene underlying ventricular trabeculation and
      compaction development, and a pathway regulating ECM during myocardial
      morphogenesis.

AB  - Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-L1, B7-H1) and programmed cell death protein 1
      (PD-1) pathway blockade is a promising therapy for treating cancer. However, the 
      mechanistic contribution of host and tumor PD-L1 and PD-1 signaling to the
      therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade remains elusive. Here, we
      evaluated 3 tumor-bearing mouse models that differ in their sensitivity to PD-L1 
      blockade and demonstrated a loss of therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in
      immunodeficient mice and in PD-L1- and PD-1-deficient mice. In contrast, neither 
      knockout nor overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor cells had an effect on PD-L1
      blockade efficacy. Human and murine studies showed high levels of functional
      PD-L1 expression in dendritic cells and macrophages in the tumor
      microenvironments and draining lymph nodes. Additionally, expression of PD-L1 on 
      dendritic cells and macrophages in ovarian cancer and melanoma patients
      correlated with the efficacy of treatment with either anti-PD-1 alone or in
      combination with anti-CTLA-4. Thus, PD-L1-expressing dendritic cells and
      macrophages may mechanistically shape and therapeutically predict clinical
      efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade.

AB  - Tumors frequently escape from immune surveillance by hijacking the natural
      control mechanisms that regulate normal immune responses. The programmed death-1 
      receptor (PD1) on T cells normally helps limit excessive immune activation, but
      it can also suppress beneficial antitumor immunity. In the clinic, blocking
      either PD1 or one of its principal counterligands, programmed death-ligand 1
      (PDL1), can lead to dramatic responses in certain patients. Because PDL1 can be
      expressed by both the tumor cells themselves and also the host cells, including
      host immune cells, the actual mechanistic target of therapy has remained unclear.
      In the current issue of the JCI, two papers, one by Tang and colleagues and the
      other by Lin and colleagues, used a variety of mouse tumor models to demonstrate 
      that the relevant target for therapy in each case was the PDL1 molecules
      expressed by host cells and not by tumor cells. If this finding is generalized to
      humans, then it would suggest that the tumor persuades the host to actively
      suppress its own attempted immune response against the tumor cells.

AB  - Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells is essential for T
      cell impairment, and PD-L1 blockade therapy has shown unprecedented durable
      responses in several clinical studies. Although higher expression of PD-L1 on
      tumor cells is associated with a better immune response after Ab blockade, some
      PD-L1-negative patients also respond to this therapy. In the current study, we
      explored whether PD-L1 on tumor or host cells was essential for
      anti-PD-L1-mediated therapy in 2 different murine tumor models. Using real-time
      imaging in whole tumor tissues, we found that anti-PD-L1 Ab accumulates in tumor 
      tissues, regardless of the status of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. We further 
      observed that, while PD-L1 on tumor cells was largely dispensable for the
      response to checkpoint blockade, PD-L1 in host myeloid cells was essential for
      this response. Additionally, PD-L1 signaling in defined antigen-presenting cells 
      (APCs) negatively regulated and inhibited T cell activation. PD-L1 blockade
      inside tumors was not sufficient to mediate regression, as limiting T cell
      trafficking reduced the efficacy of the blockade. Together, these findings
      demonstrate that PD-L1 expressed in APCs, rather than on tumor cells, plays an
      essential role in checkpoint blockade therapy, providing an insight into the
      mechanisms of this therapy.

LID - 10.1172/JCI95743 [doi]
LID - 95743 [pii]
AB  - The nonerythrocytic alpha-spectrin-1 (SPTAN1) gene encodes the cytoskeletal
      protein alphaII spectrin. Mutations in SPTAN1 cause early infantile epileptic
      encephalopathy type 5 (EIEE5); however, the role of alphaII spectrin in
      neurodevelopment and EIEE5 pathogenesis is unknown. Prior work suggests that
      alphaII spectrin is absent in the axon initial segment (AIS) and contributes to a
      diffusion barrier in the distal axon. Here, we have shown that alphaII spectrin
      is expressed ubiquitously in rodent and human somatodendritic and axonal domains.
      CRISPR-mediated deletion of Sptan1 in embryonic rat forebrain by in utero
      electroporation caused altered dendritic and axonal development, loss of the AIS,
      and decreased inhibitory innervation. Overexpression of human EIEE5 mutant SPTAN1
      in embryonic rat forebrain and mouse hippocampal neurons led to similar
      developmental defects that were also observed in EIEE5 patient-derived neurons.
      Additionally, patient-derived neurons displayed aggregation of spectrin
      complexes. Taken together, these findings implicate alphaII spectrin in critical 
      aspects of dendritic and axonal development and synaptogenesis, and support a
      dominant-negative mechanism of SPTAN1 mutations in EIEE5.

PG  - 746-759

LID - 94505 [pii]
AB  - An increase in hepatic glucose production (HGP) is a key feature of type 2
      diabetes. Excessive signaling through hepatic Gs-linked glucagon receptors
      critically contributes to pathologically elevated HGP. Here, we tested the
      hypothesis that this metabolic impairment can be counteracted by enhancing
      hepatic Gi signaling. Specifically, we used a chemogenetic approach to
      selectively activate Gi-type G proteins in mouse hepatocytes in vivo.
      Unexpectedly, activation of hepatic Gi signaling triggered a pronounced increase 
      in HGP and severely impaired glucose homeostasis. Moreover, increased Gi
      signaling stimulated glucose release in human hepatocytes. A lack of functional
      Gi-type G proteins in hepatocytes reduced blood glucose levels and protected mice
      against the metabolic deficits caused by the consumption of a high-fat diet.
      Additionally, we delineated a signaling cascade that links hepatic Gi signaling
      to ROS production, JNK activation, and a subsequent increase in HGP. Taken
      together, our data support the concept that drugs able to block hepatic
      Gi-coupled GPCRs may prove beneficial as antidiabetic drugs.

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be managed clinically with nucleos(t)ide
      therapy, which suppresses viral replication; however, these drugs must often be
      used long term, as they are unable to fully eliminate the virus. For many
      patients, discontinuation of treatment results in viral resurgence and hepatic
      flare, and there is not a reliable way to identify those individuals that can be 
      successfully taken off nucleos(t)ide therapy. In this issue of the JCI, Rivino
      and colleagues report on their use of a multipronged approach to investigate
      potential biomarkers indicative of HBV-infected patients who can safely stop
      nucleos(t)ide therapy. The authors identified a population of HBV-specific,
      PD1-positive T cells that was present in HBV-infected patients who successfully
      discontinued treatment without hepatic flare, but not in those that developed
      flare upon treatment cessation. Together, these results support the concept that 
      PD1+ cells may play an important role in viral control, the further evaluation of
      this T cell subset in preventing hepatic flare, and the development of assays to 
      better detect this PD1+ T cell population in HBV-infected patients on
      nucleos(t)ide therapy.

TI  - Insulin exits skeletal muscle capillaries by fluid-phase transport.
PG  - 699-714
LID - 10.1172/JCI94053 [doi]
LID - 94053 [pii]
AB  - Before insulin can stimulate myocytes to take up glucose, it must first move from
      the circulation to the interstitial space. The continuous endothelium of skeletal
      muscle (SkM) capillaries restricts insulin's access to myocytes. The mechanism by
      which insulin crosses this continuous endothelium is critical to understand
      insulin action and insulin resistance; however, methodological obstacles have
      limited understanding of endothelial insulin transport in vivo. Here, we present 
      an intravital microscopy technique to measure the rate of insulin efflux across
      the endothelium of SkM capillaries. This method involves development of a fully
      bioactive, fluorescent insulin probe, a gastrocnemius preparation for intravital 
      microscopy, an automated vascular segmentation algorithm, and the use of
      mathematical models to estimate endothelial transport parameters. We combined
      direct visualization of insulin efflux from SkM capillaries with modeling of
      insulin efflux kinetics to identify fluid-phase transport as the major mode of
      transendothelial insulin efflux in mice. Model-independent experiments
      demonstrating that insulin movement is neither saturable nor affected by insulin 
      receptor antagonism supported this result. Our finding that insulin enters the
      SkM interstitium by fluid-phase transport may have implications in the
      pathophysiology of SkM insulin resistance as well as in the treatment of diabetes
      with various insulin analogs.

TI  - Hepatitis B virus-specific T cells associate with viral control upon
      nucleos(t)ide-analogue therapy discontinuation.
PG  - 668-681
LID - 10.1172/JCI92812 [doi]
LID - 92812 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients
      is based exclusively on virological parameters that cannot independently
      determine in which patients nucleos(t)ide-analogue (NUC) therapy can be safely
      discontinued. NUCs efficiently suppress viral replication, but do not eliminate
      HBV. Thus, therapy discontinuation can be associated with virological and
      biochemical relapse and, consequently, therapy in the majority is life-long.
      METHODS: Since antiviral immunity is pivotal for HBV control, we investigated
      potential biomarkers for the safe discontinuation of NUCs within immune profiles 
      of chronic HBV patients by utilizing traditional immunological assays (ELISPOT,
      flow cytometry) in conjunction with analyses of global non-antigen-specific
      immune populations (NanoString and CyTOF). Two distinct cohorts of 19 and 27
      chronic HBV patients, respectively, were analyzed longitudinally prior to and
      after discontinuation of 2 different NUC therapy strategies. RESULTS: Absence of 
      hepatic flares following discontinuation of NUC treatment correlated with the
      presence, during NUC viral suppression, of HBV core and polymerase-specific T
      cells that were contained within the ex vivo PD-1+ population. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study identifies the presence of functional HBV-specific T cells as a candidate
      immunological biomarker for safe therapy discontinuation in chronic HBV patients.
      Furthermore, the persistent and functional antiviral activity of PD-1+
      HBV-specific T cells highlights the potential beneficial role of the expression
      of T cell exhaustion markers during human chronic viral infection. FUNDING: This 
      work was funded by a Singapore Translational Research Investigator Award

PG  - 577-579

LID - 99036 [pii]
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors are becoming a cornerstone of cancer immunotherapy
      as a result of their clinical success in relieving immune suppression and driving
      durable antitumor T cell responses in certain subsets of patients. Unfortunately,
      checkpoint inhibition is also associated with treatment-related toxicities that
      result in a myriad of side effects, ranging from mild and manageable to severe
      and debilitating. In this issue of the JCI, Das and colleagues report an
      association between early therapy-induced changes in circulating B cells and an
      increased risk of high-grade immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) in patients
      treated with checkpoint inhibitors that target cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated 
      antigen-4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1). These findings
      identify potential predictive biomarkers for high-grade IRAEs that may be
      leveraged to improve patient monitoring and may prompt new treatment strategies
      to prevent IRAEs.

LID - 96798 [pii]
AB  - Combination checkpoint blockade (CCB) targeting inhibitory CTLA4 and PD1
      receptors holds promise for cancer therapy. Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs)
      remain a major obstacle for the optimal application of CCB in cancer. Here, we
      analyzed B cell changes in patients with melanoma following treatment with either
      anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1, or in combination. CCB therapy led to changes in
      circulating B cells that were detectable after the first cycle of therapy and
      characterized by a decline in circulating B cells and an increase in CD21lo B
      cells and plasmablasts. PD1 expression was higher in the CD21lo B cells, and B
      cell receptor sequencing of these cells demonstrated greater clonality and a
      higher frequency of clones compared with CD21hi cells. CCB induced proliferation 
      in the CD21lo compartment, and single-cell RNA sequencing identified B cell
      activation in cells with genomic profiles of CD21lo B cells in vivo. Increased
      clonality of circulating B cells following CCB occurred in some patients.
      Treatment-induced changes in B cells preceded and correlated with both the
      frequency and timing of IRAEs. Patients with early B cell changes experienced
      higher rates of grade 3 or higher IRAEs 6 months after CCB. Thus, early changes
      in B cells following CCB may identify patients who are at increased risk of
      IRAEs, and preemptive strategies targeting B cells may reduce toxicities in these
      patients.

AB  - The human lung harbors a large population of resident memory T cells (Trm cells).
      These cells are perfectly positioned to mediate rapid protection against
      respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus, a highly contagious respiratory
      pathogen that continues to be a major public health burden. Animal models show
      that influenza-specific lung CD8+ Trm cells are indispensable for crossprotection
      against pulmonary infection with different influenza virus strains. However, it
      is not known whether influenza-specific CD8+ Trm cells present within the human
      lung have the same critical role in modulating the course of the disease. Here,
      we showed that human lung contains a population of CD8+ Trm cells that are highly
      proliferative and have polyfunctional progeny. We observed that different
      influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell specificities differentiated into Trm cells 
      with varying efficiencies and that the size of the influenza-specific CD8+ T cell
      population persisting in the lung directly correlated with the efficiency of
      differentiation into Trm cells. To our knowledge, we provide the first ex vivo
      dissection of paired T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of human
      influenza-specific CD8+ Trm cells. Our data reveal diverse TCR profiles within
      the human lung Trm cells and a high degree of clonal sharing with other CD8+ T
      cell populations, a feature important for effective T cell function and
      protection against the generation of viral-escape mutants.

LID - 97032 [pii]
AB  - The underlying cellular mechanisms of catatonia, an executive "psychomotor"
      syndrome that is observed across neuropsychiatric diseases, have remained
      obscure. In humans and mice, reduced expression of the structural myelin protein 
      CNP is associated with catatonic signs in an age-dependent manner, pointing to
      the involvement of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. Here, we showed that the
      underlying cause of catatonic signs is the low-grade inflammation of white matter
      tracts, which marks a final common pathway in Cnp-deficient and other mutant mice
      with minor myelin abnormalities. The inhibitor of CSF1 receptor kinase signaling 
      PLX5622 depleted microglia and alleviated the catatonic symptoms of Cnp mutants. 
      Thus, microglia and low-grade inflammation of myelinated tracts emerged as the
      trigger of a previously unexplained mental condition. We observed a very high
      (25%) prevalence of individuals with catatonic signs in a deeply phenotyped
      schizophrenia sample (n = 1095). Additionally, we found the loss-of-function
      allele of a myelin-specific gene (CNP rs2070106-AA) associated with catatonia in 
      2 independent schizophrenia cohorts and also associated with white matter
      hyperintensities in a general population sample. Since the catatonic syndrome is 
      likely a surrogate marker for other executive function defects, we suggest that
      microglia-directed therapies may be considered in psychiatric disorders
      associated with myelin abnormalities.

AB  - White matter abnormalities are prevalent in neuropsychiatric disorders such as
      schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether these abnormalities represent a cause or
      consequence of these disorders. Reduced levels of the myelin protein 2'-3'-cyclic
      nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) are associated with the schizophrenic
      symptom catatonia in both humans and mouse models. In this issue of the JCI,
      Janova et al. show that reduced CNP levels correlate with catatonia and white
      matter inflammation in human subjects. Furthermore, they demonstrate that
      microglial ablation prevents and alleviates catatonic signs in Cnp-/- mice,
      indicating that microglial-mediated inflammation causes catatonia. Together, this
      study identifies a cellular mechanism by which subtle myelin abnormalities cause 
      low-grade neuroinflammation and catatonic behavior.

      promote ovarian cancer chemoresistance.
PG  - 589-606
LID - 10.1172/JCI95200 [doi]
LID - 95200 [pii]
AB  - The molecular mechanism by which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) confer
      chemoresistance in ovarian cancer is poorly understood. The purpose of the
      present study was to evaluate the roles of CAFs in modulating tumor vasculature, 
      chemoresistance, and disease progression. Here, we found that CAFs upregulated
      the lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) gene in microvascular endothelial cells (MECs)
      and that LPP expression levels in intratumoral MECs correlated with survival and 
      chemoresistance in patients with ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, LPP increased
      focal adhesion and stress fiber formation to promote endothelial cell motility
      and permeability. siRNA-mediated LPP silencing in ovarian tumor-bearing mice
      improved paclitaxel delivery to cancer cells by decreasing intratumoral
      microvessel leakiness. Further studies showed that CAFs regulate endothelial LPP 
      via a calcium-dependent signaling pathway involving microfibrillar-associated
      protein 5 (MFAP5), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ERK, and LPP. Thus, our findings 
      suggest that targeting endothelial LPP enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in
      ovarian cancer. Our data highlight the importance of CAF-endothelial cell
      crosstalk signaling in cancer chemoresistance and demonstrate the improved
      efficacy of using LPP-targeting siRNA in combination with cytotoxic drugs.

      metastasis.
PG  - 625-643
LID - 10.1172/JCI89212 [doi]
LID - 89212 [pii]
AB  - HIF-1alpha, one of the most extensively studied oncogenes, is activated by a
      variety of microenvironmental factors. The resulting biological effects are
      thought to depend on its transcriptional activity. The RNAse enzyme Dicer is
      frequently downregulated in human cancers, which has been functionally linked to 
      enhanced metastatic properties; however, current knowledge of the upstream
      mechanisms regulating Dicer is limited. In the present study, we identified Dicer
      as a HIF-1alpha-interacting protein in multiple types of cancer cell lines and
      different human tumors. HIF-1alpha downregulated Dicer expression by facilitating
      its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase Parkin, thereby enhancing autophagy-mediated 
      degradation of Dicer, which further suppressed the maturation of known tumor
      suppressors, such as the microRNA let-7 and microRNA-200b. Consequently,
      expression of HIF-1alpha facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and 
      metastasis in tumor-bearing mice. Thus, this study uncovered a connection between
      oncogenic HIF-1alpha and the tumor-suppressive Dicer. This function of HIF-1alpha
      is transcription independent and occurs through previously unrecognized protein
      interaction-mediated ubiquitination and autophagic proteolysis.

AB  - Macrophages are a source of both proinflammatory and restorative functions in
      damaged tissue through complex dynamic phenotypic changes. Here, we sought to
      determine whether monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) contribute to recovery
      after acute sterile brain injury. By profiling the transcriptional dynamics of
      MDMs in the murine brain after experimental intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), we
      found robust phenotypic changes in the infiltrating MDMs over time and
      demonstrated that MDMs are essential for optimal hematoma clearance and
      neurological recovery. Next, we identified the mechanism by which the engulfment 
      of erythrocytes with exposed phosphatidylserine directly modulated the phenotype 
      of both murine and human MDMs. In mice, loss of receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and
      MERTK reduced efferocytosis of eryptotic erythrocytes and hematoma clearance,
      worsened neurological recovery, exacerbated iron deposition, and decreased
      alternative activation of macrophages after ICH. Patients with higher circulating
      soluble AXL had poor 1-year outcomes after ICH onset, suggesting that
      therapeutically augmenting efferocytosis may improve functional outcomes by both 
      reducing tissue injury and promoting the development of reparative macrophage
      responses. Thus, our results identify the efferocytosis of eryptotic erythrocytes
      through AXL/MERTK as a critical mechanism modulating macrophage phenotype and
      contributing to recovery from ICH.

TI  - PBX transcription factors drive pulmonary vascular adaptation to birth.
PG  - 655-667
LID - 10.1172/JCI93395 [doi]
LID - 93395 [pii]
AB  - A critical event in the adaptation to extrauterine life is relaxation of the
      pulmonary vasculature at birth, allowing for a rapid increase in pulmonary blood 
      flow that is essential for efficient gas exchange. Failure of this transition
      leads to pulmonary hypertension (PH), a major cause of newborn mortality
      associated with preterm birth, infection, hypoxia, and malformations including
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). While individual vasoconstrictor and
      dilator genes have been identified, the coordination of their expression is not
      well understood. Here, we found that lung mesenchyme-specific deletion of
      CDH-implicated genes encoding pre-B cell leukemia transcription factors (Pbx) led
      to lethal PH in mice shortly after birth. Loss of Pbx genes resulted in the
      misexpression of both vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in multiple pathways that
      converge to increase phosphorylation of myosin in vascular smooth muscle (VSM)
      cells, causing persistent constriction. While targeting endothelin and
      angiotensin, which are upstream regulators that promote VSM contraction, was not 
      effective, treatment with the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 reduced vessel
      constriction and PH in Pbx-mutant mice. These results demonstrate a
      lung-intrinsic, herniation-independent cause of PH in CDH. More broadly, our
      findings indicate that neonatal PH can result from perturbation of multiple
      pathways and suggest that targeting the downstream common effectors may be a more
      effective treatment for neonatal PH.

LID - 93563 [pii]
AB  - Fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix that often occurs 
      as a wound healing response to repeated or chronic tissue injury, and may lead to
      the disruption of organ architecture and loss of function. Although fibrosis was 
      previously thought to be irreversible, recent evidence indicates that certain
      circumstances permit the resolution of fibrosis when the underlying causes of
      injury are eradicated. The mechanism of fibrosis resolution encompasses
      degradation of the fibrotic extracellular matrix as well as elimination of
      fibrogenic myofibroblasts through their adaptation of various cell fates,
      including apoptosis, senescence, dedifferentiation, and reprogramming. In this
      Review, we discuss the present knowledge and gaps in our understanding of how
      matrix degradation is regulated and how myofibroblast cell fates can be
      manipulated, areas that may identify potential therapeutic approaches for
      fibrosis.

LID - 93555 [pii]
AB  - Fibroblasts synthesize the extracellular matrix of connective tissue and play an 
      essential role in maintaining the structural integrity of most tissues.
      Researchers have long suspected that fibroblasts exhibit functional
      specialization according to their organ of origin, body site, and spatial
      location. In recent years, a number of approaches have revealed the existence of 
      fibroblast subtypes in mice. Here, we discuss fibroblast heterogeneity with a
      focus on the mammalian dermis, which has proven an accessible and tractable
      system for the dissection of these relationships. We begin by considering
      differences in fibroblast identity according to anatomical site of origin.
      Subsequently, we discuss new results relating to the existence of multiple
      fibroblast subtypes within the mouse dermis. We consider the developmental origin
      of fibroblasts and how this influences heterogeneity and lineage restriction. We 
      discuss the mechanisms by which fibroblast heterogeneity arises, including
      intrinsic specification by transcriptional regulatory networks and epigenetic
      factors in combination with extrinsic effects of the spatial context within
      tissue. Finally, we discuss how fibroblast heterogeneity may provide insights
      into pathological states including wound healing, fibrotic diseases, and aging.
      Our evolving understanding suggests that ex vivo expansion or in vivo inhibition 
      of specific fibroblast subtypes may have important therapeutic applications.

PG  - 85-96

LID - 93562 [pii]
AB  - Epithelial cell loss alters a tissue's optimal function and awakens
      evolutionarily adapted healing mechanisms to reestablish homeostasis. Although
      adult mammalian organs have a limited regeneration potential, the liver stands
      out as one remarkable exception. Following injury, the liver mounts a dynamic
      multicellular response wherein stromal cells are activated in situ and/or
      recruited from the bloodstream, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is remodeled, and 
      epithelial cells expand to replenish their lost numbers. Chronic damage makes
      this response persistent instead of transient, tipping the system into an
      abnormal steady state known as fibrosis, in which ECM accumulates excessively and
      tissue function degenerates. Here we explore the cellular and molecular switches 
      that balance hepatic regeneration and fibrosis, with a focus on uncovering
      avenues of disease modeling and therapeutic intervention.

LID - 93558 [pii]
AB  - The ability to repair tissues is essential for the survival of organisms. In
      chronic settings, the failure of the repair process to terminate results in
      overproduction of collagen, a pathology known as fibrosis, which compromises
      organ recovery and impairs function. The origin of the collagen-overproducing
      cell has been debated for years. Here we review recent insights gained from the
      use of lineage tracing approaches in several organs. The resulting evidence
      points toward specific subsets of tissue-resident mesenchymal cells, mainly
      localized in a perivascular position, as the major source for collagen-producing 
      cells after injury. We discuss these findings in view of the functional
      heterogeneity of mesenchymal cells of the perivascular niche, which have
      essential vascular, immune, and regenerative functions that need to be preserved 
      for efficient repair.

AB  - The clinical spectrum of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract
      (CAKUT) encompasses a common birth defect in humans that has significant impact
      on long-term patient survival. Overall, data indicate that approximately 20% of
      patients may have a genetic disorder that is usually not detected based on
      standard clinical evaluation, implicating many different mutational mechanisms
      and pathogenic pathways. In particular, 10% to 15% of CAKUT patients harbor an
      unsuspected genomic disorder that increases risk of neurocognitive impairment and
      whose early recognition can impact clinical care. The emergence of
      high-throughput genomic technologies is expected to provide insight into the
      common and rare genetic determinants of diseases and offer opportunities for
      early diagnosis with genetic testing.

AB  - Tissue injury disrupts the mechanical homeostasis that underlies normal tissue
      architecture and function. The failure to resolve injury and restore homeostasis 
      gives rise to progressive fibrosis that is accompanied by persistent alterations 
      in the mechanical environment as a consequence of pathological matrix deposition 
      and stiffening. This Review focuses on our rapidly growing understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms linking the altered mechanical environment in injury,
      repair, and fibrosis to cellular activation. In particular, our focus is on the
      mechanisms by which cells transduce mechanical signals, leading to
      transcriptional and epigenetic responses that underlie both transient and
      persistent alterations in cell state that contribute to fibrosis. Translation of 
      these mechanobiological insights may enable new approaches to promote tissue
      repair and arrest or reverse fibrotic tissue remodeling.

AB  - Genetic investigations of fibrotic diseases, including those of late onset, often
      yield unanticipated insights into disease pathogenesis. This Review focuses on
      pathways underlying lung fibrosis that are generalizable to other organs. Herein,
      we discuss genetic variants subdivided into those that shorten telomeres,
      activate the DNA damage response, change resident protein expression or function,
      or affect organelle activity. Genetic studies provide a window into the
      downstream cascade of maladaptive responses and pathways that lead to tissue
      fibrosis. In addition, these studies reveal interactions between genetic
      variants, environmental factors, and age that influence the phenotypic spectrum
      of disease. The discovery of forces counterbalancing inherited risk alleles
      identifies potential therapeutic targets, thus providing hope for future
      prevention or reversal of fibrosis.

AB  - Intratumoral fibrosis results from the deposition of a cross-linked collagen
      matrix by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This type of fibrosis has been
      shown to exert mechanical forces and create a biochemical milieu that, together, 
      shape intratumoral immunity and influence tumor cell metastatic behavior. In this
      Review, we present recent evidence that CAFs and tumor cells are regulated by
      provisional matrix molecules, that metastasis results from a change in the type
      of stromal collagen cross-link, and that fibrosis and inflammation perpetuate
      each other through proteolytic and chemotactic mediators released into the tumor 
      stroma. We also discuss aspects of the emerging biology that have potential
      therapeutic value.

PG  - 64-73

LID - 93560 [pii]
AB  - Eukaryotic cells contain an elegant protein quality control system that is
      crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis; however, dysfunction of this system 
      results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded
      protein response (UPR). Severe or prolonged ER stress is associated with the
      development of degenerative and fibrotic disorders in multiple organs, as
      evidenced by the identification of disease-causing mutations in
      epithelial-restricted genes that lead to protein misfolding or mistrafficking in 
      familial fibrotic diseases. Emerging evidence implicates ER stress and UPR
      signaling in a variety of profibrotic mechanisms in individual cell types. In
      epithelial cells, ER stress can induce apoptosis, inflammatory signaling, and
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In other cell types, ER stress is linked to
      myofibroblast activation, macrophage polarization, and T cell differentiation. ER
      stress-targeted therapies have begun to emerge using approaches that range from
      global enhancement of chaperone function to selective targeting of activated ER
      stress sensors and other downstream mediators. As the complex regulatory
      mechanisms of this system are further clarified, there are opportunities to
      develop new disease-modifying therapeutic strategies in a wide range of chronic
      fibrotic diseases.

LID - 93557 [pii]
AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) is dynamically tuned to optimize physiological
      function. Its major properties, including composition and mechanics, profoundly
      influence cell biology. Cell-ECM interactions operate through an integrated set
      of sensor and effector circuits that use several classes of receptors and signal 
      transduction pathways. At the single-cell level, the ECM governs differentiation,
      metabolism, motility, orientation, proliferation, and survival. At the cell
      population level, the ECM provides higher-order guidance that is essential for
      physiological function. When pathological changes in the ECM lead to impairment
      of organ function, we use the term "fibrosis." In this Review, we differentiate
      fibrosis initiation from progression and focus primarily on progressive lung
      fibrosis impairing organ function. We present a working model to explain how the 
      altered ECM is not only a consequence but also a driver of fibrosis.
      Additionally, we advance the concept that fibrosis progression occurs in a
      fibrogenic niche that is composed of a fibrogenic ECM that nurtures fibrogenic
      mesenchymal progenitor cells and their fibrogenic progeny.

LID - 98490 [pii]
AB  - Most of the adult CNS lacks regenerative activity in terms of both neuron birth
      and neurite outgrowth. While this regeneration-unfriendly environment of the
      adult CNS may preserve the existing neuronal circuitry that takes years to
      develop in higher organisms, it also poses a major obstacle for CNS repair later 
      in life. In this issue of the JCI, Song et al. report on their development of a
      strategy that uses region-specific and molecularly engineered astrocytes to turn 
      an unfavorable brain environment into a favorable one for engrafted neural
      stem/progenitor cells (NSC/NPCs). In a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD),
      cografting NPCs with midbrain-derived astrocytes engineered to overexpress the
      transcription factors Nurr1 and Foxa2 promotes maturation and survival of the
      graft, resulting in therapeutic improvement. The results of this study raise the 
      prospect of using modified astrocytes to improve the survival, maturation, and
      integration of engrafted NSC/NPCs as a restorative treatment for PD.

LID - 93801 [pii]
AB  - As new generations of targeted therapies emerge and tumor genome sequencing
      discovers increasingly comprehensive mutation repertoires, the functional
      relationships of mutations to tumor phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we
      measured ex vivo sensitivity of 246 blood cancers to 63 drugs alongside genome,
      transcriptome, and DNA methylome analysis to understand determinants of drug
      response. We assembled a primary blood cancer cell encyclopedia data set that
      revealed disease-specific sensitivities for each cancer. Within chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), responses to 62% of drugs were associated with 2 or
      more mutations, and linked the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway to trisomy 12, an
      important driver of CLL. Based on drug responses, the disease could be organized 
      into phenotypic subgroups characterized by exploitable dependencies on BCR, mTOR,
      or MEK signaling and associated with mutations, gene expression, and DNA
      methylation. Fourteen percent of CLLs were driven by mTOR signaling in a
      non-BCR-dependent manner. Multivariate modeling revealed immunoglobulin heavy
      chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status and trisomy 12 as the most important
      modulators of response to kinase inhibitors in CLL. Ex vivo drug responses were
      associated with outcome. This study overcomes the perception that most mutations 
      do not influence drug response of cancer, and points to an updated approach to
      understanding tumor biology, with implications for biomarker discovery and cancer
      care.

AB  - Histone protein modifications control fate determination during normal
      development and dedifferentiation during disease. Here, we set out to determine
      the extent to which dynamic changes to histones affect the differentiated
      phenotype of ordinarily quiescent adult glomerular podocytes. To do this, we
      examined the consequences of shifting the balance of the repressive histone H3
      lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark in podocytes. Adriamycin nephrotoxicity 
      and subtotal nephrectomy (SNx) studies indicated that deletion of the histone
      methylating enzyme EZH2 from podocytes decreased H3K27me3 levels and sensitized
      mice to glomerular disease. H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter region of the
      Notch ligand Jag1 in podocytes, and derepression of Jag1 by EZH2 inhibition or
      knockdown facilitated podocyte dedifferentiation. Conversely, inhibition of the
      Jumonji C domain-containing demethylases Jmjd3 and UTX increased the H3K27me3
      content of podocytes and attenuated glomerular disease in adriamycin
      nephrotoxicity, SNx, and diabetes. Podocytes in glomeruli from humans with focal 
      segmental glomerulosclerosis or diabetic nephropathy exhibited diminished
      H3K27me3 and heightened UTX content. Analogous to human disease, inhibition of
      Jmjd3 and UTX abated nephropathy progression in mice with established glomerular 
      injury and reduced H3K27me3 levels. Together, these findings indicate that
      ostensibly stable chromatin modifications can be dynamically regulated in
      quiescent cells and that epigenetic reprogramming can improve outcomes in
      glomerular disease by repressing the reactivation of developmental pathways.

LID - 93924 [pii]
AB  - Transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is a potential therapy for
      treating neurodegenerative disorders, but this approach has faced many challenges
      and limited success, primarily because of inhospitable host brain environments
      that interfere with enriched neuron engraftment and function. Astrocytes play
      neurotrophic roles in the developing and adult brain, making them potential
      candidates for helping with modification of hostile brain environments. In this
      study, we examined whether astrocytic function could be utilized to overcome the 
      current limitations of cell-based therapies in a murine model of Parkinson's
      disease (PD) that is characterized by dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration in the
      midbrain. We show here that cografting astrocytes, especially those derived from 
      the midbrain, remarkably enhanced NPC-based cell therapeutic outcomes along with 
      robust DA neuron engraftment in PD rats for at least 6 months after
      transplantation. We further show that engineering of donor astrocytes with Nurr1 
      and Foxa2, transcription factors that were recently reported to polarize harmful 
      immunogenic glia into the neuroprotective form, further promoted the neurotrophic
      actions of grafted astrocytes in the cell therapeutic approach. Collectively,
      these findings suggest that cografting astrocytes could be a potential strategy
      for successful cell therapeutic outcomes in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - SHARPIN, an adaptor for the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC),
      plays important roles in NF-kappaB signaling and inflammation. Here, we have
      demonstrated a LUBAC-independent role for SHARPIN in regulating melanoma growth. 
      We observed that SHARPIN interacted with PRMT5, a type II protein arginine
      methyltransferase, and increased its multiprotein complex and methyltransferase
      activity. Activated PRMT5 controlled the expression of the transcription factors 
      SOX10 and MITF by SHARPIN-dependent arginine dimethylation and inhibition of the 
      transcriptional corepressor SKI. Activation of PRMT5 by SHARPIN counteracted
      PRMT5 inhibition by methylthioadenosine, a substrate of methylthioadenosine
      phosphorylase, which is codeleted with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A
      (CDKN2A) in approximately 15% of human cancers. Collectively, we identified a
      LUBAC-independent role for SHARPIN in enhancing PRMT5 activity that contributes
      to melanomagenesis through the SKI/SOX10 regulatory axis.

      acute myeloid leukemia.

AB  - Oncogenic addiction to the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a hallmark of
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that harbors the FLT3-internal tandem duplication
      (FLT3-ITD) mutation. While FLT3 inhibitors like sorafenib show initial
      therapeutic efficacy, resistance rapidly develops through mechanisms that are
      incompletely understood. Here, we used RNA-Seq-based analysis of patient leukemic
      cells and found that upregulation of the Tec family kinase BMX occurs during
      sorafenib resistance. This upregulation was recapitulated in an in vivo murine
      FLT3-ITD-positive (FLT3-ITD+) model of sorafenib resistance. Mechanistically, the
      antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib led to increased bone marrow hypoxia, which
      contributed to HIF-dependent BMX upregulation. In in vitro experiments,
      hypoxia-dependent BMX upregulation was observed in both AML and non-AML cell
      lines. Functional studies in human FLT3-ITD+ cell lines showed that BMX is part
      of a compensatory signaling mechanism that promotes AML cell survival during FLT3
      inhibition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that hypoxia-dependent
      upregulation of BMX contributes to therapeutic resistance through a compensatory 
      prosurvival signaling mechanism. These results also reveal the role of off-target
      drug effects on tumor microenvironment and development of acquired drug
      resistance. We propose that the bone marrow niche can be altered by anticancer
      therapeutics, resulting in drug resistance through cell-nonautonomous
      microenvironment-dependent effects.

TI  - Targeting Mcl-1 enhances DNA replication stress sensitivity to cancer therapy.
PG  - 500-516

LID - 92742 [pii]
AB  - DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are mainly repaired either by homologous
      recombination (HR) or by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Here, we
      showed that myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) acts as a functional switch 
      in selecting between HR and NHEJ pathways. Mcl-1 was cell cycle-regulated during 
      HR, with its expression peaking in S/G2 phase. While endogenous Mcl-1 depletion
      reduced HR and enhanced NHEJ, Mcl-1 overexpression resulted in a net increase in 
      HR over NHEJ. Mcl-1 directly interacted with the dimeric Ku protein complex via
      its Bcl-2 homology 1 and 3 (BH1 and BH3) domains, which are required for Mcl-1 to
      inhibit Ku-mediated NHEJ. Mcl-1 also promoted DNA resection mediated by the Mre11
      complex and HR-dependent DSB repair. Using the Mcl-1 BH1 domain as a docking
      site, we identified a small molecule, MI-223, that directly bound to BH1 and
      blocked Mcl-1-stimulated HR DNA repair, leading to sensitization of cancer cells 
      to hydroxyurea- or olaparib-induced DNA replication stress. Combined treatment
      with MI-223 and hydroxyurea or olaparib exhibited a strong synergy against lung
      cancer in vivo. This mechanism-driven combination of agents provides a highly
      attractive therapeutic strategy to improve lung cancer outcomes.

LID - 93707 [pii]
AB  - Breast cancer cells with stem cell properties are key contributors to metastatic 
      disease, and there remains a need to better understand and target these cells in 
      human cancers. Here, we identified rare stem-like cells in patients' tumors
      characterized by low levels of the proapoptotic molecule p53-upregulated
      modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and showed that these cells play a critical role in
      tumor progression that is independent of clinical subtype. A signaling axis
      consisting of the integrin alphavbeta3, Src kinase, and the transcription factor 
      Slug suppresses PUMA in these cells, promoting tumor stemness. We showed that
      genetic or pharmacological disruption of alphavbeta3/Src signaling drives PUMA
      expression, specifically depleting these stem-like tumor cells; increases their
      sensitivity to apoptosis; and reduces pulmonary metastasis, with no effect on
      primary tumor growth. Taken together, these findings point to PUMA as a key
      vulnerability of stem-like cells and suggest that pharmacological upregulation of
      PUMA via Src inhibition may represent a strategy to selectively target these
      cells in a wide spectrum of aggressive breast cancers.

TI  - PMP22 antisense oligonucleotides reverse Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A
      features in rodent models.

LID - 96499 [pii]
AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is caused by duplication of
      peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) and is the most common hereditary peripheral
      neuropathy. CMT1A is characterized by demyelination and axonal loss, which
      underlie slowed motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and reduced compound
      muscle action potentials (CMAP) in patients. There is currently no known
      treatment for this disease. Here, we show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) 
      effectively suppress PMP22 mRNA in affected nerves in 2 murine CMT1A models.
      Notably, initiation of ASO treatment after disease onset restored myelination,
      MNCV, and CMAP almost to levels seen in WT animals. In addition to
      disease-associated gene expression networks that were restored with ASO
      treatment, we also identified potential disease biomarkers through transcriptomic
      profiling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that reduction of PMP22 mRNA in skin
      biopsies from ASO-treated rats is a suitable biomarker for evaluating target
      engagement in response to ASO therapy. These results support the use of ASOs as a
      potential treatment for CMT1A and elucidate potential disease and target
      engagement biomarkers for use in future clinical trials.

LID - 92513 [pii]
AB  - Oncogenomic studies indicate that copy number variation (CNV) alters genes
      involved in tumor progression; however, identification of specific driver genes
      affected by CNV has been difficult, as these rearrangements are often contained
      in large chromosomal intervals among several bystander genes. Here, we addressed 
      this problem and identified a CNV-targeted oncogene by performing comparative
      oncogenomics of human and zebrafish melanomas. We determined that the gene
      encoding growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), which is the ligand for the BMP 
      family, is recurrently amplified and transcriptionally upregulated in melanoma.
      GDF6-induced BMP signaling maintained a trunk neural crest gene signature in
      melanomas. Additionally, GDF6 repressed the melanocyte differentiation gene MITF 
      and the proapoptotic factor SOX9, thereby preventing differentiation, inhibiting 
      cell death, and promoting tumor growth. GDF6 was specifically expressed in
      melanomas but not melanocytes. Moreover, GDF6 expression levels in melanomas were
      inversely correlated with patient survival. Our study has identified a
      fundamental role for GDF6 and BMP signaling in governing an embryonic cell gene
      signature to promote melanoma progression, thus providing potential opportunities
      for targeted therapy to treat GDF6-positive cancers.

TI  - Bone marrow drives central nervous system regeneration after radiation injury.

AB  - Nervous system injury is a frequent result of cancer therapy involving cranial
      irradiation, leaving patients with marked memory and other neurobehavioral
      disabilities. Here, we report an unanticipated link between bone marrow and brain
      in the setting of radiation injury. Specifically, we demonstrate that bone
      marrow-derived monocytes and macrophages are essential for structural and
      functional repair mechanisms, including regeneration of cerebral white matter and
      improvement in neurocognitive function. Using a granulocyte-colony stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) receptor knockout mouse model in combination with bone marrow cell
      transplantation, MRI, and neurocognitive functional assessments, we demonstrate
      that bone marrow-derived G-CSF-responsive cells home to the injured brain and are
      critical for altering neural progenitor cells and brain repair. Additionally,
      compared with untreated animals, animals that received G-CSF following radiation 
      injury exhibited enhanced functional brain repair. Together, these results
      demonstrate that, in addition to its known role in defense and debris removal,
      the hematopoietic system provides critical regenerative drive to the brain that
      can be modulated by clinically available agents.

TI  - Differential impact of RB status on E2F1 reprogramming in human cancer.
PG  - 341-358
LID - 10.1172/JCI93566 [doi]
LID - 93566 [pii]
AB  - The tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma (RB) is mechanistically linked to
      suppression of transcription factor E2F1-mediated cell cycle regulation. For
      multiple tumor types, loss of RB function is associated with poor clinical
      outcome. RB action is abrogated either by direct depletion or through
      inactivation of RB function; however, the basis for this selectivity is unknown. 
      Here, analysis of tumor samples and cell-free DNA from patients with advanced
      prostate cancer showed that direct RB loss was the preferred pathway of
      disruption in human disease. While RB loss was associated with lethal disease,
      RB-deficient tumors had no proliferative advantage and exhibited downstream
      effects distinct from cell cycle control. Mechanistically, RB loss led to E2F1
      cistrome expansion and different binding specificity, alterations distinct from
      those observed after functional RB inactivation. Additionally, identification of 
      protumorigenic transcriptional networks specific to RB loss that were validated
      in clinical samples demonstrated the ability of RB loss to differentially
      reprogram E2F1 in human cancers. Together, these findings not only identify
      tumor-suppressive functions of RB that are distinct from cell cycle control, but 
      also demonstrate that the molecular consequence of RB loss is distinct from RB
      inactivation. Thus, these studies provide insight into how RB loss promotes
      disease progression, and identify new nodes for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - SPOP mutation drives prostate neoplasia without stabilizing oncogenic
      transcription factor ERG.
PG  - 381-386
LID - 10.1172/JCI96551 [doi]
LID - 96551 [pii]
AB  - Nearly 50% of prostate cancers harbor gene fusions that lead to overexpression of
      the transcription factor ERG, while a mutually exclusive 10% of prostate cancers 
      harbor recurrent mutations in the gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPOP.
      Recent reports suggest that SPOP acts as a ubiquitin ligase for ERG and propose
      that ERG stabilization is the oncogenic effector of SPOP mutation. Here, we used 
      human prostate cancer samples and showed that the vast majority of human
      SPOP-mutant cancers do not express ERG. Comparison of SPOP-mutant and ERG-fusion 
      organoid models showed evidence of divergent, rather than common, transcriptional
      programs. Furthermore, expression of prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations in
      genetically engineered mouse models of SPOP-mutant prostate cancer did not result
      in the expression of ERG protein in histologically normal prostate glands,
      high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive adenocarcinoma, or
      prostate organoids. In summary, we found no evidence that ERG is an effector of
      SPOP mutation in human prostate cancer or mouse models.

PG  - 415-426

LID - 95837 [pii]
AB  - gammadeltaT cells produce inflammatory cytokines and have been implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmunity. The T cell
      receptor (TCR) signal transduction that specifically regulates the development of
      IL-17-producing gammadeltaT (gammadeltaT17) cells largely remains unclear. Here, 
      we showed that the receptor proximal tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for
      gammadeltaTCR signal transduction and development of gammadeltaT17 in the mouse
      thymus. Zap70, another tyrosine kinase essential for the development of
      alphabetaT cells, failed to functionally substitute for Syk in the development of
      gammadeltaT17. Syk induced the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway upon
      gammadeltaTCR stimulation. Mice deficient in PI3K signaling exhibited a complete 
      loss of gammadeltaT17, without impaired development of IFN-gamma-producing
      gammadeltaT cells. Moreover, gammadeltaT17-dependent skin inflammation was
      ameliorated in mice deficient in RhoH, an adaptor known to recruit Syk. Thus, we 
      deciphered lineage-specific TCR signaling and identified the Syk/PI3K pathway as 
      a critical determinant of proinflammatory gammadeltaT cell differentiation.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9 screen reveals a MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma dependency on EZH2.
PG  - 446-462
LID - 10.1172/JCI90793 [doi]
LID - 90793 [pii]
AB  - Pharmacologically difficult targets, such as MYC transcription factors, represent
      a major challenge in cancer therapy. For the childhood cancer neuroblastoma,
      amplification of the oncogene MYCN is associated with high-risk disease and poor 
      prognosis. Here, we deployed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening of MYCN-amplified
      neuroblastoma and found a preferential dependency on genes encoding the polycomb 
      repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components EZH2, EED, and SUZ12. Genetic and
      pharmacological suppression of EZH2 inhibited neuroblastoma growth in vitro and
      in vivo. Moreover, compared with neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification,
      MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas expressed higher levels of EZH2. ChIP analysis
      showed that MYCN binds at the EZH2 promoter, thereby directly driving expression.
      Transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis, as well as genetic rescue experiments,
      revealed that EZH2 represses neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma in a
      PRC2-dependent manner. Moreover, MYCN-amplified and high-risk primary tumors from
      patients with neuroblastoma exhibited strong repression of EZH2-regulated genes. 
      Additionally, overexpression of IGFBP3, a direct EZH2 target, suppressed
      neuroblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo. We further observed strong synergy
      between histone deacetylase inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitors. Together, these
      observations demonstrate that MYCN upregulates EZH2, leading to inactivation of a
      tumor suppressor program in neuroblastoma, and support testing EZH2 inhibitors in

AB  - Germline mutations in the gene encoding tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 lead to
      gastrointestinal tumorigenesis in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) patients and mouse
      models; however, the cell types and signaling pathways underlying tumor formation
      are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that mesenchymal progenitor- or stromal
      fibroblast-specific deletion of Lkb1 results in fully penetrant polyposis in
      mice. Lineage tracing and immunohistochemical analyses revealed clonal expansion 
      of Lkb1-deficient myofibroblast-like cell foci in the tumor stroma. Loss of Lkb1 
      in stromal cells was associated with induction of an inflammatory program
      including IL-11 production and activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway in tumor
      epithelia concomitant with proliferation. Importantly, treatment of LKB1-defcient
      mice with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib dramatically decreased polyposis.
      These data indicate that IL-11-mediated induction of JAK/STAT3 is critical in
      gastrointestinal tumorigenesis following Lkb1 mutations and suggest that
      targeting this pathway has therapeutic potential in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

TI  - ADHFE1 is a breast cancer oncogene and induces metabolic reprogramming.
PG  - 323-340
LID - 10.1172/JCI93815 [doi]
LID - 93815 [pii]
AB  - Metabolic reprogramming in breast tumors is linked to increases in putative
      oncogenic metabolites that may contribute to malignant transformation. We
      previously showed that accumulation of the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate
      (2HG), in breast tumors was associated with MYC signaling, but not with
      isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, suggesting a distinct mechanism for
      increased 2HG in breast cancer. Here, we determined that D-2HG is the predominant
      enantiomer in human breast tumors and show that the D-2HG-producing mitochondrial
      enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, iron-containing protein 1 (ADHFE1), is a breast
      cancer oncogene that decreases patient survival. We found that MYC upregulates
      ADHFE1 through changes in iron metabolism while coexpression of both ADHFE1 and
      MYC strongly enhanced orthotopic tumor growth in MCF7 cells. Moreover, ADHFE1
      promoted metabolic reprogramming with increased formation of D-2HG and reactive
      oxygen, a reductive glutamine metabolism, and modifications of the epigenetic
      landscape, leading to cellular dedifferentiation, enhanced mesenchymal
      transition, and phenocopying alterations that occur with high D-2HG levels in
      cancer cells with IDH mutations. Together, our data support the hypothesis that
      ADHFE1 and MYC signaling contribute to D-2HG accumulation in breast tumors and
      show that D-2HG is an oncogenic metabolite and potential driver of disease
      progression.

TI  - FODMAP diet modulates visceral nociception by lipopolysaccharide-mediated

PG  - 267-280

LID - 92390 [pii]
AB  - Foods high in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) exacerbate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however,
      their mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that a high-FODMAP (HFM)
      diet increases visceral nociception by inducing dysbiosis and that the
      FODMAP-altered gut microbial community leads to intestinal pathology. We fed rats
      an HFM and showed that HFM increases rat fecal Gram-negative bacteria, elevates
      lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and induces intestinal pathology, as indicated by
      inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and visceral hypersensitivity (VH). These
      manifestations were prevented by antibiotics and reversed by low-FODMAP (LFM)
      diet. Additionally, intracolonic administration of LPS or fecal supernatant (FS) 
      from HFM-fed rats caused intestinal barrier dysfunction and VH, which were
      blocked by the LPS antagonist LPS-RS or by TLR4 knockdown. Fecal LPS was higher
      in IBS patients than in healthy subjects (HS), and IBS patients on a 4-week LFM
      diet had improved IBS symptoms and reduced fecal LPS levels. Intracolonic
      administration of FS from IBS patients, but not FS from HS or LFM-treated IBS
      patients, induced VH in rats, which was ameliorated by LPS-RS. Our findings
      indicate that HFM-associated gut dysbiosis and elevated fecal LPS levels induce
      intestinal pathology, thereby modulating visceral nociception and IBS
      symptomatology, and might provide an explanation for the success of LFM diet in
      IBS patients.

TI  - Hyposialylated IgG activates endothelial IgG receptor FcgammaRIIB to promote
      obesity-induced insulin resistance.
PG  - 309-322
LID - 10.1172/JCI89333 [doi]
LID - 89333 [pii]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common complication of obesity. Here, we
      have shown that activation of the IgG receptor FcgammaRIIB in endothelium by
      hyposialylated IgG plays an important role in obesity-induced insulin resistance.
      Despite becoming obese on a high-fat diet (HFD), mice lacking FcgammaRIIB
      globally or selectively in endothelium were protected from insulin resistance as 
      a result of the preservation of insulin delivery to skeletal muscle and resulting
      maintenance of muscle glucose disposal. IgG transfer in IgG-deficient mice
      implicated IgG as the pathogenetic ligand for endothelial FcgammaRIIB in
      obesity-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, IgG transferred from patients with 
      T2DM but not from metabolically healthy subjects caused insulin resistance in
      IgG-deficient mice via FcgammaRIIB, indicating that similar processes may be
      operative in T2DM in humans. Mechanistically, the activation of FcgammaRIIB by
      IgG from obese mice impaired endothelial cell insulin transcytosis in culture and
      in vivo. These effects were attributed to hyposialylation of the Fc glycan, and
      IgG from T2DM patients was also hyposialylated. In HFD-fed mice, supplementation 
      with the sialic acid precursor N-acetyl-D-mannosamine restored IgG sialylation
      and preserved insulin sensitivity without affecting weight gain. Thus, IgG
      sialylation and endothelial FcgammaRIIB may represent promising therapeutic
      targets to sever the link between obesity and T2DM.

AB  - During tumor progression, immune system phagocytes continually clear apoptotic
      cancer cells in a process known as efferocytosis. However, the impact of
      efferocytosis in metastatic tumor growth is unknown. In this study, we observed
      that macrophage-driven efferocytosis of prostate cancer cells in vitro induced
      the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as CXCL5 by activating Stat3 and
      NF-kappaB(p65) signaling. Administration of a dimerizer ligand (AP20187)
      triggered apoptosis in 2 in vivo syngeneic models of bone tumor growth in which
      apoptosis-inducible prostate cancer cells were either coimplanted with vertebral 
      bodies, or inoculated in the tibiae of immunocompetent mice. Induction of 2
      pulses of apoptosis correlated with increased infiltration of inflammatory cells 
      and accelerated tumor growth in the bone. Apoptosis-induced tumors displayed
      elevated expression of the proinflammatory cytokine CXCL5. Likewise,
      CXCL5-deficient mice had reduced tumor progression. Peripheral blood monocytes
      isolated from patients with bone metastasis of prostate cancer were more
      efferocytic compared with normal controls, and CXCL5 serum levels were higher in 
      metastatic prostate cancer patients relative to patients with localized prostate 
      cancer or controls. Altogether, these findings suggest that the myeloid
      phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cancer cells accelerates CXCL5-mediated
      inflammation and tumor growth in bone, pointing to CXCL5 as a potential target
      for cancer therapeutics.

LID - 93725 [pii]
AB  - The molecular mechanisms that transduce the osteoblast response to physical
      forces in the bone microenvironment are poorly understood. Here, we used genetic 
      and pharmacological experiments to determine whether the polycystins PC1 and PC2 
      (encoded by Pkd1 and Pkd2) and the transcriptional coactivator TAZ form a
      mechanosensing complex in osteoblasts. Compound-heterozygous mice lacking 1 copy 
      of Pkd1 and Taz exhibited additive decrements in bone mass, impaired
      osteoblast-mediated bone formation, and enhanced bone marrow fat accumulation.
      Bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts derived from these mice showed impaired
      osteoblastogenesis and enhanced adipogenesis. Increased extracellular matrix
      stiffness and application of mechanical stretch to multipotent mesenchymal cells 
      stimulated the nuclear translocation of the PC1 C-terminal tail/TAZ (PC1-CTT/TAZ)
      complex, leading to increased runt-related transcription factor 2-mediated
      (Runx2-mediated) osteogenic and decreased PPARgamma-dependent adipogenic gene
      expression. Using structure-based virtual screening, we identified a compound
      predicted to bind to PC2 in the PC1:PC2 C-terminal tail region with helix:helix
      interaction. This molecule stimulated polycystin- and TAZ-dependent
      osteoblastogenesis and inhibited adipogenesis. Thus, we show that polycystins and
      TAZ integrate at the molecular level to reciprocally regulate osteoblast and
      adipocyte differentiation, indicating that the polycystins/TAZ complex may be a
      potential therapeutic target to increase bone mass.

PG  - 233-247
LID - 10.1172/JCI95937 [doi]
LID - 95937 [pii]
AB  - Uncovering the causes of pregnancy complications such as preterm labor requires
      greater insight into how the uterus remains in a noncontractile state until term 
      and then surmounts this state to enter labor. Here, we show that dynamic
      generation and erasure of the repressive histone modification tri-methyl histone 
      H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in decidual stromal cells dictate both elements of
      pregnancy success in mice. In early gestation, H3K27me3-induced transcriptional
      silencing of select gene targets ensured uterine quiescence by preventing the
      decidua from expressing parturition-inducing hormone receptors, manifesting type 
      1 immunity, and most unexpectedly, generating myofibroblasts and associated
      wound-healing responses. In late gestation, genome-wide H3K27 demethylation
      allowed for target gene upregulation, decidual activation, and labor entry.
      Pharmacological inhibition of H3K27 demethylation in late gestation not only
      prevented term parturition, but also inhibited delivery while maintaining pup
      viability in a noninflammatory model of preterm parturition. Immunofluorescence
      analysis of human specimens suggested that similar regulatory events might occur 
      in the human decidua. Together, these results reveal the centrality of regulated 
      gene silencing in the uterine adaptation to pregnancy and suggest new areas in
      the study and treatment of pregnancy disorders.

      for normal embryo implantation.
PG  - 175-189

LID - 92862 [pii]
AB  - Natural and synthetic progestogens have been commonly used to prevent recurrent
      pregnancy loss in women with inadequate progesterone secretion or reduced
      progesterone sensitivity. However, the clinical efficacy of progesterone and its 
      analogs for maintaining pregnancy is variable. Additionally, the underlying cause
      of impaired endometrial progesterone responsiveness during early pregnancy
      remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that uterine-selective depletion of BMI1, 
      a key component of the polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1), hampers uterine
      progesterone responsiveness and derails normal uterine receptivity, resulting in 
      implantation failure in mice. We further uncovered genetic and biochemical
      evidence that BMI1 interacts with the progesterone receptor (PR) and the E3
      ligase E6AP in a polycomb complex-independent manner and regulates the PR
      ubiquitination that is essential for normal progesterone responsiveness. A close 
      association of aberrantly low endometrial BMI1 expression with restrained PR
      responsiveness in women who had previously had a miscarriage indicated that the
      role of BMI1 in endometrial PR function is conserved in mice and in humans. In
      addition to uncovering a potential regulatory mechanism of BMI1 that ensures
      normal endometrial progesterone responsiveness during early pregnancy, our
      findings have the potential to help clarify the underlying causes of spontaneous 
      pregnancy loss in women.

AB  - Humoral rejection is the most common cause of solid organ transplant failure.
      Here, we evaluated a cohort of 49 patients who were successfully grafted with
      allogenic islets and determined that the appearance of donor-specific anti-HLA
      antibodies (DSAs) did not accelerate the rate of islet graft attrition,
      suggesting resistance to humoral rejection. Murine DSAs bound to allogeneic
      targets expressed by islet cells and induced their destruction in vitro; however,
      passive transfer of the same DSAs did not affect islet graft survival in murine
      models. Live imaging revealed that DSAs were sequestrated in the circulation of
      the recipients and failed to reach the endocrine cells of grafted islets. We used
      murine heart transplantation models to confirm that endothelial cells were the
      only accessible targets for DSAs, which induced the development of typical
      microvascular lesions in allogeneic transplants. In contrast, the vasculature of 
      DSA-exposed allogeneic islet grafts was devoid of lesions because sprouting of
      recipient capillaries reestablished blood flow in grafted islets. Thus, we
      conclude that endothelial chimerism combined with vascular sequestration of DSAs 
      protects islet grafts from humoral rejection. The reduced immunoglobulin
      concentrations in the interstitial tissue, confirmed in patients, may have
      important implications for biotherapies such as vaccines and monoclonal
      antibodies.

      JAK2V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms.
PG  - 125-140
LID - 10.1172/JCI94518 [doi]

AB  - V617F driver mutation of JAK2 is the leading cause of the
      Philadelphia-chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Although
      thrombosis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in MPNs, the mechanisms 
      underlying their pathogenesis are unclear. Here, we identified pleckstrin-2
      (Plek2) as a downstream target of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in erythroid and myeloid
      cells, and showed that it is upregulated in a JAK2V617F-positive MPN mouse model 
      and in patients with MPNs. Loss of Plek2 ameliorated JAK2V617F-induced
      myeloproliferative phenotypes including erythrocytosis, neutrophilia,
      thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly, thereby reverting the widespread vascular
      occlusions and lethality in JAK2V617F-knockin mice. Additionally, we demonstrated
      that a reduction in red blood cell mass was the main contributing factor in the
      reversion of vascular occlusions. Thus, our study identifies Plek2 as an effector
      of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway and a key factor in the pathogenesis of
      JAK2V617F-induced MPNs, pointing to Plek2 as a viable target for the treatment of
      MPNs.

LID - 93123 [pii]
AB  - The incorporation of excess saturated free fatty acids (SFAs) into membrane
      phospholipids within the ER promotes ER stress, insulin resistance, and hepatic
      gluconeogenesis. Thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2) is a
      mitochondria-associated long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase that is activated 
      upon binding phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP). Under fasting
      conditions, the Them2/PC-TP complex directs saturated fatty acyl-CoA toward
      beta-oxidation. Here, we showed that during either chronic overnutrition or acute
      induction of ER stress, Them2 and PC-TP play critical roles in trafficking SFAs
      into the glycerolipid biosynthetic pathway to form saturated phospholipids, which
      ultimately reduce ER membrane fluidity. The Them2/PC-TP complex activated ER
      stress pathways by enhancing translocon-mediated efflux of ER calcium. The
      increased cytosolic calcium, in turn, led to the phosphorylation of
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which promoted both hepatic
      insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis. These findings delineate a mechanistic
      link between obesity and insulin resistance and establish the Them2/PC-TP complex
      as an attractive target for the management of hepatic steatosis and insulin
      resistance.

PG  - 120-124

LID - 92710 [pii]
AB  - Medulloblastoma, an aggressive cancer of the cerebellum, is among the most common
      pediatric brain tumors. Approximately one-third of medulloblastomas are
      associated with misactivation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. GLI family zinc
      finger 2 (GLI2) coordinates the Hh transcriptional program; however, the GLI2
      targets that promote cancer cell proliferation are unknown. Here, we incorporated
      a Gli2-EGFP allele into 2 different genetic mouse models of Hh-associated
      medulloblastoma. Hh signaling induced GLI2 binding to the Cdk6 promoter and
      activated Cdk6 expression, thereby promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation.
      Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CDK6 in mice repressed the growth of
      Hh-associated medulloblastoma and prolonged survival through inhibition of cell
      proliferation. In human medulloblastoma, misactivation of Hh signaling was
      associated with high levels of CDK6, pointing to CDK6 as a direct transcriptional
      target of the Hh pathway. These results suggest that CDK6 antagonists may be a
      promising therapeutic approach for Hh-associated medulloblastoma in humans.

      gene augmentation approach.

AB  - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a major cause of blindness that affects 1.5 million 
      people worldwide. Mutations in cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta 1 (CNGB1)
      cause approximately 4% of autosomal recessive RP. Gene augmentation therapy shows
      promise for treating inherited retinal degenerations; however, relevant animal
      models and biomarkers of progression in patients with RP are needed to assess
      therapeutic outcomes. Here, we evaluated RP patients with CNGB1 mutations for
      potential biomarkers of progression and compared human phenotypes with those of
      mouse and dog models of the disease. Additionally, we used gene augmentation
      therapy in a CNGbeta1-deficient dog model to evaluate potential translation to
      patients. CNGB1-deficient RP patients and mouse and dog models had a similar
      phenotype characterized by early loss of rod function and slow rod photoreceptor 
      loss with a secondary decline in cone function. Advanced imaging showed promise
      for evaluating RP progression in human patients, and gene augmentation using
      adeno-associated virus vectors robustly sustained the rescue of rod function and 
      preserved retinal structure in the dog model. Together, our results reveal an
      early loss of rod function in CNGB1-deficient patients and a wide window for
      therapeutic intervention. Moreover, the identification of potential biomarkers of
      outcome measures, availability of relevant animal models, and robust functional
      rescue from gene augmentation therapy support future work to move CNGB1-RP
      therapies toward clinical trials.

TI  - Paracrine osteoprotegerin and beta-catenin stabilization support synovial
      sarcomagenesis in periosteal cells.
PG  - 207-218
LID - 10.1172/JCI94955 [doi]
LID - 94955 [pii]
AB  - Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma that is often
      discovered during adolescence and young adulthood. Despite the name, synovial
      sarcoma does not typically arise from a synoviocyte but instead arises in close
      proximity to bones. Previous work demonstrated that mice expressing the
      characteristic SS18-SSX fusion oncogene in myogenic factor 5-expressing
      (Myf5-expressing) cells develop fully penetrant sarcomagenesis, suggesting
      skeletal muscle progenitor cell origin. However, Myf5 is not restricted to
      committed myoblasts in embryos but is also expressed in multipotent mesenchymal
      progenitors. Here, we demonstrated that human SS and mouse tumors arising from
      SS18-SSX expression in the embryonic, but not postnatal, Myf5 lineage share an
      anatomic location that is frequently adjacent to bone. Additionally, we showed
      that SS can originate from periosteal cells expressing SS18-SSX alone and from
      preosteoblasts expressing the fusion oncogene accompanied by the added
      stabilization of beta-catenin, which is a common secondary change in SS.
      Expression and secretion of the osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor
      osteoprotegerin enabled early growth of SS18-SSX2-transformed cells, indicating a
      paracrine link between the bone and synovial sarcomagenesis. These findings
      explain the skeletal contact frequently observed in human SS and may provide
      alternate means of enabling SS18-SSX-driven oncogenesis in cells as
      differentiated as preosteoblasts.

TI  - STAT5BN642H is a driver mutation for T cell neoplasia.
PG  - 387-401
LID - 10.1172/JCI94509 [doi]
LID - 94509 [pii]
AB  - STAT5B is often mutated in hematopoietic malignancies. The most frequent STAT5B
      mutation, Asp642His (N642H), has been found in over 90 leukemia and lymphoma
      patients. Here, we used the Vav1 promoter to generate transgenic mouse models
      that expressed either human STAT5B or STAT5BN642H in the hematopoietic
      compartment. While STAT5B-expressing mice lacked a hematopoietic phenotype, the
      STAT5BN642H-expressing mice rapidly developed T cell neoplasms. Neoplasia
      manifested as transplantable CD8+ lymphoma or leukemia, indicating that the
      STAT5BN642H mutation drives cancer development. Persistent and enhanced levels of
      STAT5BN642H tyrosine phosphorylation in transformed CD8+ T cells led to profound 
      changes in gene expression that were accompanied by alterations in DNA
      methylation at potential histone methyltransferase EZH2-binding sites. Aurora
      kinase genes were enriched in STAT5BN642H-expressing CD8+ T cells, which were
      exquisitely sensitive to JAK and Aurora kinase inhibitors. Together, our data
      suggest that JAK and Aurora kinase inhibitors should be further explored as
      potential therapeutics for lymphoma and leukemia patients with the STAT5BN642H
      mutation who respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is the most common heritable
      peripheral neuropathy and results from a duplication on chromosome 17 that
      results in an extra copy and increased dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22
      (PMP22). Zhao et al., in this issue of the JCI, successfully utilized antisense
      oligonucleotides (ASOs) to reduce PMP22 and ameliorated neuropathy in both mouse 
      and rat models of CMT1A. These data confirm that strategies to reduce PMP22 have 
      potential as effective therapeutic approaches for CMT1A and lay the groundwork
      for clinical trials in humans afflicted with this chronic, debilitating
      neurodegenerative disease.

LID - 98619 [pii]
AB  - The inappropriate activation of transcription factors, including STATs, is known 
      to promote tumor initiation and progression. The most common mechanisms of
      misregulation lead to constitutive activation of WT STATs. However, the recent
      discovery of rare STAT mutations in hematopoietic malignancies suggests that STAT
      mutants may be oncogenic. In this issue of the JCI, Pham et al. use a transgenic 
      mouse model to demonstrate that STAT5BN642H is sufficient for the development of 
      T cell neoplasia. This study, along with other studies of constitutively active
      STAT mutants, provides insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of
      STAT5-driven cancer.

      attributes of GLP-1 action and enteroendocrine science are reviewed, with
      emphasis on mechanistic advances and clinical proof-of-concept studies. The
      discovery that GLP-2 promotes mucosal growth in the intestine is described, and
      key findings from both preclinical studies and the GLP-2 clinical development
      program for short bowel syndrome (SBS) are reviewed. Finally, we summarize recent
      progress in GLP biology, highlighting emerging concepts and scientific insights
      with translational relevance.

AB  - Endothelial cells (ECs) are components of the hematopoietic microenvironment and 
      regulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) homeostasis. Cytokine
      treatments that cause HSPC trafficking to peripheral blood are associated with an
      increase in dipeptidylpeptidase 4/CD26 (DPP4/CD26), an enzyme that truncates the 
      neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY). Here, we show that enzymatically altered
      NPY signaling in ECs caused reduced VE-cadherin and CD31 expression along EC
      junctions, resulting in increased vascular permeability and HSPC egress.
      Moreover, selective NPY2 and NPY5 receptor antagonists restored vascular
      integrity and limited HSPC mobilization, demonstrating that the enzymatically
      controlled vascular gateway specifically opens by cleavage of NPY by CD26
      signaling via NPY2 and NPY5 receptors. Mice lacking CD26 or NPY exhibited
      impaired HSPC trafficking that was restored by treatment with truncated NPY.
      Thus, our results point to ECs as gatekeepers of HSPC trafficking and identify a 
      CD26-mediated NPY axis that has potential as a pharmacologic target to regulate
      hematopoietic trafficking in homeostatic and stress conditions.

AB  - Mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the bone
      marrow (BM) into the peripheral blood is a complex process that is enhanced
      dramatically under stress-induced conditions. A better understanding of how the
      mobilization process is regulated will likely facilitate the development of
      improved clinical protocols for stem cell harvesting and transplantation. In this
      issue of the JCI, Singh et al. (1) showed that the truncated cleaved form of
      neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) actively promotes a breach of BM vascular
      sinusoidal portals, thereby augmenting HSPC trafficking to the circulation. The
      authors report a previously unrecognized axis, in which expression of the enzyme 
      dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4)/CD26 by endothelial cells activates NPY-mediated
      signaling by increasing the bioavailability of the truncated form of NPY. These
      findings underscore the importance of and urgency to develop pharmacological
      therapies that target the vasculature and regulate diverse aspects of
      hematopoiesis, such as HSPC trafficking, in steady-state and stress-induced
      conditions.

LID - 98262 [pii]
AB  - Ubiquitylation is a tightly regulated process that is essential for appropriate
      cell survival and function, and the ubiquitin pathway has shown promise as a
      therapeutic target for several forms of cancer. In this issue of the JCI, Kedves 
      and colleagues report the identification of a subset of gynecological cancers
      with repressed expression of the polyubiquitin gene UBB, which renders these
      cancer cells sensitive to further decreases in ubiquitin production by inhibition
      of the polyubiquitin gene UBC. Moreover, inducible depletion of UBC in mice
      harboring tumors with low UBB levels dramatically decreased tumor burden and
      prolonged survival. Together, the results of this study indicate that there is a 
      synthetic lethal relationship between UBB and UBC that has potential to be
      exploited as a therapeutic strategy to fight these devastating cancers.

TI  - Amphiphysin (BIN1) negatively regulates dynamin 2 for normal muscle maturation.
PG  - 4477-4487
LID - 10.1172/JCI90542 [doi]
LID - 90542 [pii]
AB  - Regulation of skeletal muscle development and organization is a complex process
      that is not fully understood. Here, we focused on amphiphysin 2 (BIN1, also known
      as bridging integrator-1) and dynamin 2 (DNM2), two ubiquitous proteins
      implicated in membrane remodeling and mutated in centronuclear myopathies (CNMs).
      We generated Bin1-/- Dnm2+/- mice to decipher the physiological interplay between
      BIN1 and DNM2. While Bin1-/- mice die perinatally from a skeletal muscle defect, 
      Bin1-/- Dnm2+/- mice survived at least 18 months, and had normal muscle force and
      intracellular organization of muscle fibers, supporting BIN1 as a negative
      regulator of DNM2. We next characterized muscle-specific isoforms of BIN1 and
      DNM2. While BIN1 colocalized with and partially inhibited DNM2 activity during
      muscle maturation, BIN1 had no effect on the isoform of DNM2 found in adult
      muscle. Together, these results indicate that BIN1 and DNM2 regulate muscle
      development and organization, function through a common pathway, and define BIN1 
      as a negative regulator of DNM2 in vitro and in vivo during muscle maturation.
      Our data suggest that DNM2 modulation has potential as a therapeutic approach for
      patients with CNM and BIN1 defects. As BIN1 is implicated in cancers, arrhythmia,
      and late-onset Alzheimer disease, these findings may trigger research directions 
      and therapeutic development for these common diseases.

PG  - 4498-4515
LID - 10.1172/JCI91553 [doi]
LID - 91553 [pii]
AB  - Conventional therapies for breast cancer brain metastases (BCBMs) have been
      largely ineffective because of chemoresistance and impermeability of the
      blood-brain barrier. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism
      that allows breast cancer cells to infiltrate the brain is necessary to
      circumvent treatment resistance of BCBMs. Here, we determined that expression of 
      a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that we have named lncRNA associated with BCBM
      (Lnc-BM) is prognostic of the progression of brain metastasis in breast cancer
      patients. In preclinical murine models, elevated Lnc-BM expression drove BCBM,
      while depletion of Lnc-BM with nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNAs effectively
      treated BCBM. Lnc-BM increased JAK2 kinase activity to mediate oncostatin M- and 
      IL-6-triggered STAT3 phosphorylation. In breast cancer cells, Lnc-BM promoted
      STAT3-dependent expression of ICAM1 and CCL2, which mediated vascular co-option
      and recruitment of macrophages in the brain, respectively. Recruited macrophages 
      in turn produced oncostatin M and IL-6, thereby further activating the
      Lnc-BM/JAK2/STAT3 pathway and enhancing BCBM. Collectively, our results show that
      Lnc-BM and JAK2 promote BCBMs by mediating communication between breast cancer
      cells and the brain microenvironment. Moreover, these results suggest targeting
      Lnc-BM as a potential strategy for fighting this difficult disease.

TI  - Histamine-releasing factor enhances food allergy.
PG  - 4541-4553
LID - 10.1172/JCI96525 [doi]
LID - 96525 [pii]
AB  - Food allergy occurs due to IgE- and mast cell-dependent intestinal inflammation. 
      Previously, we showed that histamine-releasing factor (HRF), a multifunctional
      protein secreted during allergy, interacts with a subset of IgE molecules and
      that the HRF dimer activates mast cells in an HRF-reactive IgE-dependent manner. 
      In this study, we investigated whether HRF plays any role in food allergy.
      Specifically, we determined that prophylactic and therapeutic administration of
      HRF inhibitors that block HRF-IgE interactions reduces the incidence of diarrhea 
      and mastocytosis in a murine model of food allergy. Food allergy-associated
      intestinal inflammation was accompanied by increased secretion of the HRF dimer
      into the intestine in response to proinflammatory, Th2, and epithelial-derived
      cytokines and HRF-reactive IgE levels at the elicitation phase. Consistent with
      these data, patients with egg allergy had higher blood levels of HRF-reactive IgE
      compared with individuals that were not hypersensitive. Successful oral
      immunotherapy in egg-allergy patients and food-allergic mice reduced HRF-reactive
      IgE levels, thereby suggesting a pathological role for HRF in food allergy.
      Together, these results suggest that antigen and HRF dimer amplify intestinal
      inflammation by synergistically activating mast cells and indicate that HRF has
      potential as a therapeutic target in food allergy.

TI  - Recurrent ubiquitin B silencing in gynecological cancers establishes dependence
      on ubiquitin C.
PG  - 4554-4568
LID - 10.1172/JCI92914 [doi]
LID - 92914 [pii]
AB  - Transcriptional repression of ubiquitin B (UBB) is a cancer-subtype-specific
      alteration that occurs in a substantial population of patients with cancers of
      the female reproductive tract. UBB is 1 of 2 genes encoding for ubiquitin as a
      polyprotein consisting of multiple copies of ubiquitin monomers. Silencing of UBB
      reduces cellular UBB levels and results in an exquisite dependence on ubiquitin C
      (UBC), the second polyubiquitin gene. UBB is repressed in approximately 30% of
      high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients and is a recurrent lesion in
      uterine carcinosarcoma and endometrial carcinoma. We identified ovarian tumor
      cell lines that retain UBB in a repressed state, used these cell lines to
      establish orthotopic ovarian tumors, and found that inducible expression of a
      UBC-targeting shRNA led to tumor regression, and substantial long-term survival
      benefit. Thus, we describe a recurrent cancer-specific lesion at the level of
      ubiquitin production. Moreover, these observations reveal the prognostic value of
      UBB repression and establish UBC as a promising therapeutic target for ovarian
      cancer patients with recurrent UBB silencing.

PG  - 4238-4241

LID - 98297 [pii]
AB  - The prevalence of food allergies has been increasing at an alarming rate over the
      last few decades. Despite the dramatic increase in disease prevalence, the
      development of effective therapies has not kept pace. In this issue of the JCI,
      Ando et al. provide a causal link between histamine-releasing factor (HRF)
      interactions with IgE and food allergy in a murine model. Successful oral
      immunotherapy of both egg-allergic human patients and food-allergic mice was
      associated with sustained suppression of HRF-reactive IgE levels. These results
      support a role for HRF-IgE interactions in the amplification of intestinal
      inflammation and suggest HRF as a therapeutic target in food allergy.

TI  - p120-Catenin is an obligate haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in intestinal
      neoplasia.
PG  - 4462-4476
LID - 10.1172/JCI77217 [doi]
LID - 77217 [pii]
AB  - p120-Catenin (p120) functions as a tumor suppressor in intestinal cancer, but the
      mechanism is unclear. Here, using conditional p120 knockout in Apc-sensitized
      mouse models of intestinal cancer, we have identified p120 as an "obligatory"
      haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Whereas monoallelic loss of p120 was
      associated with a significant increase in tumor multiplicity, loss of both
      alleles was never observed in tumors from these mice. Moreover, forced ablation
      of the second allele did not further enhance tumorigenesis, but instead induced
      synthetic lethality in combination with Apc loss of heterozygosity. In
      tumor-derived organoid cultures, elimination of both p120 alleles resulted in
      caspase-3-dependent apoptosis that was blocked by inhibition of Rho kinase
      (ROCK). With ROCK inhibition, however, p120-ablated organoids exhibited a
      branching phenotype and a substantial increase in cell proliferation. Access to
      data from Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis screens afforded an opportunity to directly
      assess the tumorigenic impact of p120 haploinsufficiency relative to other
      candidate drivers. Remarkably, p120 ranked third among the 919 drivers
      identified. Cofactors alpha-catenin and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) were
      also among the highest scoring candidates, indicating a mechanism at the level of
      the intact complex that may play an important role at very early stages of of
      intestinal tumorigenesis while simultaneously restricting outright loss via
      synthetic lethality.

AB  - The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system and
      can be activated in response to microbial and endogenous danger signals.
      Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in caspase-1-dependent secretion of 
      the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18. Gain-of-function missense
      mutations in NLRP3 result in a group of autoinflammatory diseases collectively
      known as the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS patients have
      traditionally been successfully treated with therapeutics targeting the IL-1
      pathway; however, there are a number of identified CAPS patients who show only a 
      partial response to IL-1 blockade. In this issue of the JCI, McGeough et al.
      demonstrated that TNF-alpha, in addition to IL-1beta, plays an important role in 
      promoting NLRP3 inflammasomopathies.

AB  - Abnormal activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a causal role
      in the development of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and associated
      cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure.
      As both a vasoconstrictor and a proinflammatory mediator, angiotensin II (Ang II)
      is considered a potential link between hypertension and atherosclerosis. However,
      a role for Ang II-induced inflammation in atherosclerosis has not been clearly
      established, and the molecular mechanisms and intracellular signaling pathways
      involved are not known. Here, we demonstrated that the RhoA GEF Arhgef1 is
      essential for Ang II-induced inflammation. Specifically, we showed that deletion 
      of Arhgef1 in a murine model prevents Ang II-induced integrin activation in
      leukocytes, thereby preventing Ang II-induced recruitment of leukocytes to the
      endothelium. Mice lacking both LDL receptor (LDLR) and Arhgef1 were protected
      from high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. Moreover, reconstitution of Ldlr-/-
      mice with Arhgef1-deficient BM prevented high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis,
      while reconstitution of Ldlr-/- Arhgef1-/- with WT BM exacerbated atherosclerotic
      lesion formation, supporting Arhgef1 activation in leukocytes as causal in the
      development of atherosclerosis. Thus, our data highlight the importance of
      Arhgef1 in cardiovascular disease and suggest targeting Arhgef1 as a potential
      therapeutic strategy against atherosclerosis.

AB  - The NLRP3 inflammasome is a protein complex responsible for caspase-1-dependent
      maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18. Gain-of-function 
      missense mutations in NLRP3 cause the disease spectrum known as the
      cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). In this study, we generated
      Nlrp3-knockin mice on various KO backgrounds including Il1b/Il18-, caspase-1-,
      caspase-11- (Casp1/11-), and Tnf-deficient strains. The Nlrp3L351P Il1b-/-
      Il18-/- mutant mice survived and grew normally until adulthood and, at 6 months
      of age, exhibited marked splenomegaly and leukophilia. Injection of these mice
      with low-dose LPS resulted in elevated serum TNF levels compared with Nlrp3L351P 
      Casp1/11-/- mice and Il1b-/- Il18-/- littermates. Treatment of Nlrp3A350V mice
      with the TNF inhibitor etanercept resulted in all pups surviving to adulthood,
      with normal body and spleen/body weight ratios. Nlrp3A350V Tnf-/- mice showed a
      similar phenotypic rescue, with marked reductions in serum IL-1beta and IL-18,
      reduced myeloid inflammatory infiltrate in the skin and spleen, and substantial
      decreases in splenic mRNA expression of both inflammasome components (Nlrp3,
      Pycard, pro-Casp1) and pro-cytokines (Il1b, Il18). Likewise, we observed a
      reduction in the expression of both pro-Casp1 and pro-Il1b in cultured Nlrp3A350V
      Tnf-/- BM-derived DCs. Our data show that TNF is an important transcriptional
      regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome components in murine inflammasomopathies.
      Moreover, these results may have therapeutic implications for CAPS patients with 
      partial responses to IL-1-targeted therapies.

TI  - Loss of mTORC1 signaling alters pancreatic alpha cell mass and impairs glucagon

AB  - Glucagon plays a major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis during fed
      and fasting states. However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of
      pancreatic alpha cell mass and function are not completely understood. In the
      current study, we identified mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) as a major regulator of
      alpha cell mass and glucagon secretion. Using mice with tissue-specific deletion 
      of the mTORC1 regulator Raptor in alpha cells (alphaRaptorKO), we showed that
      mTORC1 signaling is dispensable for alpha cell development, but essential for
      alpha cell maturation during the transition from a milk-based diet to a
      chow-based diet after weaning. Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in
      alphaRaptorKO mice and in WT animals exposed to chronic rapamycin administration 
      decreased glucagon content and glucagon secretion. In alphaRaptorKO mice,
      impaired glucagon secretion occurred in response to different secretagogues and
      was mediated by alterations in KATP channel subunit expression and activity.
      Additionally, our data identify the mTORC1/FoxA2 axis as a link between mTORC1
      and transcriptional regulation of key genes responsible for alpha cell function. 
      Thus, our results reveal a potential function of mTORC1 in nutrient-dependent
      regulation of glucagon secretion and identify a role for mTORC1 in controlling
      alpha cell-mass maintenance.

LID - 96185 [pii]
AB  - Ebolaviruses and marburgviruses belong to the family Filoviridae and cause high
      lethality in infected patients. There are currently no licensed filovirus
      vaccines or antiviral therapies. The development of broad-spectrum therapies
      against members of the Marburgvirus genus, including Marburg virus (MARV) and
      Ravn virus (RAVV), is difficult because of substantial sequence variability. RNAi
      therapeutics offer a potential solution, as identification of conserved target
      nucleotide sequences may confer activity across marburgvirus variants. Here, we
      assessed the therapeutic efficacy of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of a
      single nucleoprotein-targeting (NP-targeting) siRNA in nonhuman primates at
      advanced stages of MARV or RAVV disease to mimic cases in which patients begin
      treatment for fulminant disease. Sixteen rhesus monkeys were lethally infected
      with MARV or RAVV and treated with NP siRNA-LNP, with MARV-infected animals
      beginning treatment four or five days after infection and RAVV-infected animals
      starting treatment three or six days after infection. While all untreated animals
      succumbed to disease, NP siRNA-LNP treatment conferred 100% survival of
      RAVV-infected macaques, even when treatment began just 1 day prior to the death
      of the control animals. In MARV-infected animals, day-4 treatment initiation
      resulted in 100% survival, and day-5 treatment resulted in 50% survival. These
      results identify a single siRNA therapeutic that provides broad-spectrum
      protection against both MARV and RAVV.

AB  - Astrocytes perform critical non-cell autonomous roles following CNS injury that
      involve either neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects. Yet the nature of potential
      prosurvival cues has remained unclear. In the current study, we utilized the
      close interaction between astrocytes and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye
      to characterize a secreted neuroprotective signal present in retinal astrocyte
      conditioned medium (ACM). Rather than a conventional peptide neurotrophic factor,
      we identified a prominent lipid component of the neuroprotective signal through
      metabolomics screening. The lipoxins LXA4 and LXB4 are small lipid mediators that
      act locally to dampen inflammation, but they have not been linked directly to
      neuronal actions. Here, we determined that LXA4 and LXB4 are synthesized in the
      inner retina, but their levels are reduced following injury. Injection of either 
      lipoxin was sufficient for neuroprotection following acute injury, while
      inhibition of key lipoxin pathway components exacerbated injury-induced damage.
      Although LXA4 signaling has been extensively investigated, LXB4, the less studied
      lipoxin, emerged to be more potent in protection. Moreover, LXB4 neuroprotection 
      was different from that of established LXA4 signaling, and therapeutic LXB4
      treatment was efficacious in a chronic model of the common neurodegenerative
      disease glaucoma. Together, these results identify a potential paracrine
      mechanism that coordinates neuronal homeostasis and inflammation in the CNS.

TI  - Hepatic neuregulin 4 signaling defines an endocrine checkpoint for
      steatosis-to-NASH progression.

AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by progressive liver injury,
      inflammation, and fibrosis; however, the mechanisms that govern the transition
      from hepatic steatosis, which is relatively benign, to NASH remain poorly
      defined. Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) is an adipose tissue-enriched endocrine factor that 
      elicits beneficial metabolic effects in obesity. Here, we show that Nrg4 is a key
      component of an endocrine checkpoint that preserves hepatocyte health and
      counters diet-induced NASH in mice. Nrg4 deficiency accelerated liver injury,
      fibrosis, inflammation, and cell death in a mouse model of NASH. In contrast,
      transgenic expression of Nrg4 in adipose tissue alleviated diet-induced NASH.
      Nrg4 attenuated hepatocyte death in a cell-autonomous manner by blocking
      ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of c-FLIPL, a negative regulator of
      cell death. Adeno-associated virus-mediated (AAV-mediated) rescue of hepatic
      c-FLIPL expression in Nrg4-deficent mice functionally restored the brake for
      steatosis to NASH transition. Thus, hepatic Nrg4 signaling serves as an endocrine
      checkpoint for steatosis-to-NASH progression by activating a cytoprotective
      pathway to counter stress-induced liver injury.

TI  - S-sulfocysteine/NMDA receptor-dependent signaling underlies neurodegeneration in 
      molybdenum cofactor deficiency.
PG  - 4365-4378

LID - 89885 [pii]
AB  - Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of
      metabolism characterized by neurodegeneration and death in early childhood. The
      rapid and progressive neurodegeneration in MoCD presents a major clinical
      challenge and may relate to the poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms
      involved. Recently, we reported that treating patients with cyclic pyranopterin
      monophosphate (cPMP) is a successful therapy for a subset of infants with MoCD
      and prevents irreversible brain damage. Here, we studied S-sulfocysteine (SSC), a
      structural analog of glutamate that accumulates in the plasma and urine of
      patients with MoCD, and demonstrated that it acts as an N-methyl D-aspartate
      receptor (NMDA-R) agonist, leading to calcium influx and downstream cell
      signaling events and neurotoxicity. SSC treatment activated the protease calpain,
      and calpain-dependent degradation of the inhibitory synaptic protein gephyrin
      subsequently exacerbated SSC-mediated excitotoxicity and promoted loss of
      GABAergic synapses. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA-R, calcium influx, or
      calpain activity abolished SSC and glutamate neurotoxicity in primary murine
      neurons. Finally, the NMDA-R antagonist memantine was protective against the
      manifestation of symptoms in a tungstate-induced MoCD mouse model. These findings
      demonstrate that SSC drives excitotoxic neurodegeneration in MoCD and introduce
      NMDA-R antagonists as potential therapeutics for this fatal disease.

PG  - 4421-4436
LID - 10.1172/JCI95545 [doi]
LID - 95545 [pii]
AB  - Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a leading cause of blindness in children
      worldwide and is caused by developmental defects in 2 aqueous humor outflow
      structures, Schlemm's canal (SC) and the trabecular meshwork. We previously
      identified loss-of-function mutations in the angiopoietin (ANGPT) receptor TEK in
      families with PCG and showed that ANGPT/TEK signaling is essential for SC
      development. Here, we describe roles for the major ANGPT ligands in the
      development of the aqueous outflow pathway. We determined that ANGPT1 is
      essential for SC development, and that Angpt1-knockout mice form a severely
      hypomorphic canal with elevated intraocular pressure. By contrast, ANGPT2 was
      dispensable, although mice deficient in both Angpt1 and Angpt2 completely lacked 
      SC, indicating that ANGPT2 compensates for the loss of ANGPT1. In addition, we
      identified 3 human subjects with rare ANGPT1 variants within an international
      cohort of 284 PCG patients. Loss of function in 2 of the 3 patient alleles was
      observed by functional analysis of ANGPT1 variants in a combined in silico, in
      vitro, and in vivo approach, supporting a causative role for ANGPT1 in disease.
      By linking ANGPT1 with PCG, these results highlight the importance of ANGPT/TEK
      signaling in glaucoma pathogenesis and identify a candidate target for
      therapeutic development.

AB  - Primary immunodeficiencies are often monogenic disorders characterized by
      vulnerability to specific infectious pathogens. Here, we performed whole-exome
      sequencing of a patient with disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus, Streptococcus 
      viridians bacteremia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and identified mutations 
      in 2 genes that regulate distinct IFN pathways. The patient had a homozygous
      frameshift deletion in IFNGR2, which encodes the signal transducing chain of the 
      IFN-gamma receptor, that resulted in minimal protein expression and abolished
      downstream signaling. The patient also harbored a homozygous deletion in IFNAR1
      (IFNAR1*557Gluext*46), which encodes the IFN-alpha receptor signaling subunit.
      The IFNAR1*557Gluext*46 resulted in replacement of the stop codon with 46
      additional codons at the C-terminus. The level of IFNAR1*557Gluext*46 mutant
      protein expressed in patient fibroblasts was comparable to levels of WT IFNAR1 in
      control fibroblasts. IFN-alpha-induced signaling was impaired in the patient
      fibroblasts, as evidenced by decreased STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation, nuclear
      translocation of STAT1, and expression of IFN-alpha-stimulated genes critical for
      CMV immunity. Pretreatment with IFN-alpha failed to suppress CMV protein
      expression in patient fibroblasts, whereas expression of WT IFNAR1 restored
      IFN-alpha-mediated suppression of CMV. This study identifies a human IFNAR1
      mutation and describes a digenic immunodeficiency specific to type I and type II 
      IFNs.

AB  - Deficiency in Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor GLI-similar 3 (GLIS3)
      in humans is associated with the development of congenital hypothyroidism.
      However, the functions of GLIS3 in the thyroid gland and the mechanism by which
      GLIS3 dysfunction causes hypothyroidism are unknown. In the current study, we
      demonstrate that GLIS3 acts downstream of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and
      TSH receptor (TSHR) and is indispensable for TSH/TSHR-mediated proliferation of
      thyroid follicular cells and biosynthesis of thyroid hormone. Using ChIP-Seq and 
      promoter analysis, we demonstrate that GLIS3 is critical for the transcriptional 
      activation of several genes required for thyroid hormone biosynthesis, including 
      the iodide transporters Nis and Pds, both of which showed enhanced GLIS3 binding 
      at their promoters. The repression of cell proliferation of GLIS3-deficient
      thyroid follicular cells was due to the inhibition of TSH-mediated activation of 
      the mTOR complex 1/ribosomal protein S6 (mTORC1/RPS6) pathway as well as the
      reduced expression of several cell division-related genes regulated directly by
      GLIS3. Consequently, GLIS3 deficiency in a murine model prevented the development
      of goiter as well as the induction of inflammatory and fibrotic genes during
      chronic elevation of circulating TSH. Our study identifies GLIS3 as a key
      regulator of TSH/TSHR-mediated thyroid hormone biosynthesis and proliferation of 
      thyroid follicular cells and uncovers a mechanism by which GLIS3 deficiency
      causes neonatal hypothyroidism and prevents goiter development.

LID - 95109 [pii]
AB  - Apoptosis delimits platelet life span in the circulation and leads to storage
      lesion, which severely limits the shelf life of stored platelets. Moreover,
      accumulating evidence indicates that platelet apoptosis provoked by various
      pathological stimuli results in thrombocytopenia in many common diseases.
      However, little is known about how platelet apoptosis is initiated or regulated. 
      Here, we show that PKA activity is markedly reduced in platelets aged in vitro,
      stored platelets, and platelets from patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP),
      diabetes, and bacterial infections. Inhibition or genetic ablation of PKA
      provoked intrinsic programmed platelet apoptosis in vitro and rapid platelet
      clearance in vivo. PKA inhibition resulted in dephosphorylation of the
      proapoptotic protein BAD at Ser155, resulting in sequestration of prosurvival
      protein BCL-XL in mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis. Notably, PKA activation 
      protected platelets from apoptosis induced by storage or pathological stimuli and
      elevated peripheral platelet levels in normal mice and in a murine model of ITP. 
      Therefore, these findings identify PKA as a homeostatic regulator of platelet
      apoptosis that determines platelet life span and survival. Furthermore, these
      results suggest that regulation of PKA activity represents a promising strategy
      for extending platelet shelf life and has profound implications for the treatment
      of platelet number-related diseases and disorders.

AB  - Unbiased, "nontargeted" metabolite profiling techniques hold considerable promise
      for biomarker and pathway discovery, in spite of the lack of successful
      applications to human disease. By integrating nontargeted metabolomics, genetics,
      and detailed human phenotyping, we identified dimethylguanidino valeric acid
      (DMGV) as an independent biomarker of CT-defined nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD) in the offspring cohort of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants.
      We verified the relationship between DMGV and early hepatic pathology.
      Specifically, plasma DMGV levels were correlated with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis (NASH) in a hospital cohort of individuals undergoing gastric
      bypass surgery, and DMGV levels fell in parallel with improvements in
      post-procedure cardiometabolic parameters. Further, baseline DMGV levels
      independently predicted future diabetes up to 12 years before disease onset in 3 
      distinct human cohorts. Finally, we provide all metabolite peak data consisting
      of known and unidentified peaks, genetics, and key metabolic parameters as a
      publicly available resource for investigations in cardiometabolic diseases.

AB  - Induction of the cell cycle is emerging as an intervention to treat heart
      failure. Here, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced cardiomyocyte renewal in
      transgenic mice expressing cyclin D2 would be beneficial during hemodynamic
      overload. We induced pressure overload by transthoracic aortic constriction (TAC)
      or volume overload by aortocaval shunt in cyclin D2-expressing and WT mice.
      Although cyclin D2 expression dramatically improved survival following TAC, it
      did not confer a survival advantage to mice following aortocaval shunt. Cardiac
      function decreased following TAC in WT mice, but was preserved in cyclin
      D2-expressing mice. On the other hand, cardiac structure and function were
      compromised in response to aortocaval shunt in both WT and cyclin D2-expressing
      mice. The preserved function and improved survival in cyclin D2-expressing mice
      after TAC was associated with an approximately 50% increase in cardiomyocyte
      number and exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy, as indicated by increased septum
      thickness. Aortocaval shunt did not further impact cardiomyocyte number in mice
      expressing cyclin D2. Following TAC, cyclin D2 expression attenuated
      cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, fibrosis,
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIdelta phosphorylation, brain
      natriuretic peptide expression, and sustained capillarization. Thus, we show that
      cyclin D2-induced cardiomyocyte renewal reduced myocardial remodeling and
      dysfunction after pressure overload but not after volume overload.

AB  - Adaptation to respiration at birth depends upon the synthesis of pulmonary
      surfactant, a lipid-protein complex that reduces surface tension at the
      air-liquid interface in the alveoli and prevents lung collapse during the
      ventilatory cycle. Herein, we demonstrated that the gene encoding a subunit of
      the endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex, EMC3, also known as TMEM111
      (Emc3/Tmem111), was required for murine pulmonary surfactant synthesis and lung
      function at birth. Conditional deletion of Emc3 in murine embryonic lung
      epithelial cells disrupted the synthesis and packaging of surfactant lipids and
      proteins, impaired the formation of lamellar bodies, and induced the unfolded
      protein response in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. EMC3 was essential for the
      processing and routing of surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, and the biogenesis 
      of the phospholipid transport protein ABCA3. Transcriptomic, lipidomic, and
      proteomic analyses demonstrated that EMC3 coordinates the assembly of lipids and 
      proteins in AT2 cells that is necessary for surfactant synthesis and function at 
      birth.

AB  - The transcription factor PU.1 is often impaired in patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). Here, we used AML cells that already had low PU.1 levels and
      further inhibited PU.1 using either RNA interference or, to our knowledge,
      first-in-class small-molecule inhibitors of PU.1 that we developed specifically
      to allosterically interfere with PU.1-chromatin binding through interaction with 
      the DNA minor groove that flanks PU.1-binding motifs. These small molecules of
      the heterocyclic diamidine family disrupted the interaction of PU.1 with target
      gene promoters and led to downregulation of canonical PU.1 transcriptional
      targets. shRNA or small-molecule inhibition of PU.1 in AML cells from either
      PU.1lo mutant mice or human patients with AML-inhibited cell growth and
      clonogenicity and induced apoptosis. In murine and human AML
      (xeno)transplantation models, treatment with our PU.1 inhibitors decreased tumor 
      burden and resulted in increased survival. Thus, our study provides proof of
      concept that PU.1 inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for the
      treatment of AML and for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of PU.1.

TI  - HIV-antibody complexes enhance production of type I interferon by plasmacytoid
      dendritic cells.
PG  - 4352-4364

AB  - Type I IFN production is essential for innate control of acute viral infection;
      however, prolonged high-level IFN production is associated with chronic immune
      activation in HIV-infected individuals. Although plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are a
      primary source of IFN, the mechanisms that regulate IFN levels following the
      acute phase are unknown. We hypothesized that HIV-specific Ab responses regulate 
      late IFN production. We evaluated the mechanism through which HIV-activated pDCs 
      produce IFN as well as how both monoclonal HIV-specific Abs and Abs produced in
      natural HIV infection modulated normal pDC sensing of HIV. We found that
      HIV-induced IFN production required TLR7 signaling, receptor-mediated entry,
      fusion, and viral uncoating, but not endocytosis or HIV life cycle stages after
      uncoating. Abs directed against the HIV envelope that do not interfere with CD4
      binding markedly enhanced the IFN response, irrespective of their ability to
      neutralize CD4+ T cell infection. Ab-mediated enhancement of IFN production
      required Fc gamma receptor engagement, bypassed fusion, and initiated signaling
      through both TLR7 and TLR9, which was not utilized in the absence of Ab.
      Polyclonal Abs isolated from HIV-infected subjects also enhanced pDC production
      of IFN in response to HIV. Our data provide an explanation for high levels of IFN
      production and immune activation in chronic HIV infection.

AB  - Angiocrine factors, such as Notch ligands, supplied by the specialized
      endothelial cells (ECs) within the bone marrow and splenic vascular niche play an
      essential role in modulating the physiology of adult hematopoietic stem and
      progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the relative contribution of various Notch
      ligands, specifically jagged-2, to the homeostasis of HSPCs is unknown. Here, we 
      show that under steady state, jagged-2 is differentially expressed in
      tissue-specific vascular beds, but its expression is induced in hematopoietic
      vascular niches after myelosuppressive injury. We used mice with EC-specific
      deletion of the gene encoding jagged-2 (Jag2) to demonstrate that while
      EC-derived jagged-2 was dispensable for maintaining the capacity of HSPCs to
      repopulate under steady-state conditions, by activating Notch2 it did contribute 
      to the recovery of HSPCs in response to myelosuppressive conditions. Engraftment 
      and/or expansion of HSPCs was dependent on the expression of endothelial-derived 
      jagged-2 following myeloablation. Additionally, jagged-2 expressed in bone marrow
      ECs regulated HSPC cell cycle and quiescence during regeneration.
      Endothelial-deployed jagged-2 triggered Notch2/Hey1, while tempering Notch2/Hes1 
      signaling in HSPCs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that EC-derived jagged-2
      activates Notch2 signaling in HSPCs to promote hematopoietic recovery and has
      potential as a therapeutic target to accelerate balanced hematopoietic
      reconstitution after myelosuppression.

TI  - Advillin acts upstream of phospholipase C 1 in steroid-resistant nephrotic
      syndrome.

AB  - Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a frequent cause of chronic kidney
      disease. Here, we identified recessive mutations in the gene encoding the
      actin-binding protein advillin (AVIL) in 3 unrelated families with SRNS. While
      all AVIL mutations resulted in a marked loss of its actin-bundling ability,
      truncation of AVIL also disrupted colocalization with F-actin, thereby leading to
      impaired actin binding and severing. Additionally, AVIL colocalized and
      interacted with the phospholipase enzyme PLCE1 and with the ARP2/3
      actin-modulating complex. Knockdown of AVIL in human podocytes reduced actin
      stress fibers at the cell periphery, prevented recruitment of PLCE1 to the
      ARP3-rich lamellipodia, blocked EGF-induced generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by
      PLCE1, and attenuated the podocyte migration rate (PMR). These effects were
      reversed by overexpression of WT AVIL but not by overexpression of any of the 3
      patient-derived AVIL mutants. The PMR was increased by overexpression of WT Avil 
      or PLCE1, or by EGF stimulation; however, this increased PMR was ameliorated by
      inhibition of the ARP2/3 complex, indicating that ARP-dependent lamellipodia
      formation occurs downstream of AVIL and PLCE1 function. Together, these results
      delineate a comprehensive pathogenic axis of SRNS that integrates loss of AVIL
      function with alterations in the action of PLCE1, an established SRNS protein.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent psychiatric
      disorder in children. Although an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs
      has been proposed as contributing to this disorder, the mechanisms underlying
      this highly heterogeneous disease remain largely unknown. Here, we show that
      N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) deficiency is involved in the
      development of ADHD in both mice and humans. Ndrg2-knockout (Ndrg2-/-) mice
      exhibited ADHD-like symptoms characterized by attention deficits, hyperactivity, 
      impulsivity, and impaired memory. Furthermore, interstitial glutamate levels and 
      excitatory transmission were markedly increased in the brains of Ndrg2-/- mice
      due to reduced astroglial glutamate clearance. We developed an NDRG2 peptide that
      rescued astroglial glutamate clearance and reduced excitatory glutamate
      transmission in NDRG2-deficient astrocytes. Additionally, NDRG2 peptide treatment
      rescued ADHD-like hyperactivity in the Ndrg2-/- mice, while routine
      methylphenidate treatment had no effect on hyperactivity in these animals.
      Finally, children who were heterozygous for rs1998848, a SNP in NDRG2, had a
      higher risk of ADHD than children who were homozygous for rs1998848. Our results 
      indicate that NDRG2 deficiency leads to ADHD phenotypes and that impaired
      astroglial glutamate clearance, a mechanism distinct from the well-established
      dopamine deficit hypothesis for ADHD, underlies the resultant behavioral
      abnormalities.

TI  - Small GTPase ARF6 controls VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling in diabetic
      retinopathy.

AB  - The devastating sequelae of diabetes mellitus include microvascular permeability,
      which results in retinopathy. Despite clinical and scientific advances, there
      remains a need for new approaches to treat retinopathy. Here, we have presented a
      possible treatment strategy, whereby targeting the small GTPase ARF6 alters
      VEGFR2 trafficking and reverses signs of pathology in 4 animal models that
      represent features of diabetic retinopathy and in a fifth model of ocular
      pathological angiogenesis. Specifically, we determined that the same signaling
      pathway utilizes distinct GEFs to sequentially activate ARF6, and these GEFs
      exert distinct but complementary effects on VEGFR2 trafficking and signal
      transduction. ARF6 activation was independently regulated by 2 different ARF GEFs
      - ARNO and GEP100. Interaction between VEGFR2 and ARNO activated ARF6 and
      stimulated VEGFR2 internalization, whereas a VEGFR2 interaction with GEP100
      activated ARF6 to promote VEGFR2 recycling via coreceptor binding. Intervening in
      either pathway inhibited VEGFR2 signal output. Finally, using a combination of in
      vitro, cellular, genetic, and pharmacologic techniques, we demonstrated that ARF6
      is pivotal in VEGFR2 trafficking and that targeting ARF6-mediated VEGFR2
      trafficking has potential as a therapeutic approach for retinal vascular diseases
      such as diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - Liver triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and secretion are closely linked to
      nutrient availability. After a meal, hepatic TAG formation from fatty acids is
      decreased, largely due to a reduction in circulating free fatty acids (FFA).
      Despite the postprandial decrease in FFA-driven esterification and oxidation,
      VLDL-TAG secretion is maintained to support peripheral lipid delivery and
      metabolism. The regulatory mechanisms underlying the postprandial control of
      VLDL-TAG secretion remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the mTOR complex 1 
      (mTORC1) is essential for this sustained VLDL-TAG secretion and lipid
      homeostasis. In murine models, the absence of hepatic mTORC1 reduced circulating 
      TAG, despite hepatosteatosis, while activation of mTORC1 depleted liver TAG
      stores. Additionally, mTORC1 promoted TAG secretion by regulating phosphocholine 
      cytidylyltransferase alpha (CCTalpha), the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the
      synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). Increasing PC synthesis in mice lacking
      mTORC1 rescued hepatosteatosis and restored TAG secretion. These data identify
      mTORC1 as a major regulator of phospholipid biosynthesis and subsequent VLDL-TAG 
      secretion, leading to increased postprandial TAG secretion.

LID - 93940 [pii]
AB  - Age-related changes in the hematopoietic compartment are primarily attributed to 
      cell-intrinsic alterations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); however, the
      contribution of the aged microenvironment has not been adequately evaluated.
      Understanding the role of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in supporting HSC
      function may prove to be beneficial in treating age-related functional
      hematopoietic decline. Here, we determined that aging of endothelial cells (ECs),
      a critical component of the BM microenvironment, was sufficient to drive
      hematopoietic aging phenotypes in young HSCs. We used an ex vivo hematopoietic
      stem and progenitor cell/EC (HSPC/EC) coculture system as well as in vivo EC
      infusions following myelosuppressive injury in mice to demonstrate that aged ECs 
      impair the repopulating activity of young HSCs and impart a myeloid bias.
      Conversely, young ECs restored the repopulating capacity of aged HSCs but were
      unable to reverse the intrinsic myeloid bias. Infusion of young, HSC-supportive
      BM ECs enhanced hematopoietic recovery following myelosuppressive injury and
      restored endogenous HSC function in aged mice. Coinfusion of young ECs augmented 
      aged HSC engraftment and enhanced overall survival in lethally irradiated mice by
      mitigating damage to the BM vascular microenvironment. These data lay the
      groundwork for the exploration of EC therapies that can serve as adjuvant
      modalities to enhance HSC engraftment and accelerate hematopoietic recovery in
      the elderly population following myelosuppressive regimens.

AB  - The hematopoietic system declines with age, resulting in decreased hematopoietic 
      stem cell (HSC) self-renewal capacity, myeloid skewing, and immune cell
      depletion. Aging of the hematopoietic system is associated with an increased
      incidence of myeloid malignancies and a decline in adaptive immunity. Therefore, 
      strategies to rejuvenate the hematopoietic system have important clinical
      implications. In this issue of the JCI, Poulos and colleagues demonstrate that
      infusions of bone marrow (BM) endothelial cells (ECs) from young mice promoted
      HSC self-renewal and restored immune cell content in aged mice. Additionally,
      delivery of young BM ECs along with HSCs following total body irradiation
      improved HSC engraftment and enhanced survival. These results suggest an
      important role for BM endothelial cells (ECs) in regulating hematopoietic aging
      and support further research to identify the rejuvenating factors elaborated by
      BM ECs that restore HSC function and the immune repertoire in aged mice.

AB  - Dysregulated adipocyte physiology leads to imbalanced energy storage, obesity,
      and associated diseases, imposing a costly burden on current health care.
      Cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) plays a crucial role in controlling energy
      metabolism through central and peripheral mechanisms. In this work,
      adipocyte-specific inducible deletion of the CB1 gene (Ati-CB1-KO) was sufficient
      to protect adult mice from diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic
      alterations and to reverse the phenotype in already obese mice. Compared with
      controls, Ati-CB1-KO mice showed decreased body weight, reduced total adiposity, 
      improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced energy expenditure, and fat depot-specific
      cellular remodeling toward lowered energy storage capacity and browning of white 
      adipocytes. These changes were associated with an increase in alternatively
      activated macrophages concomitant with enhanced sympathetic tone in adipose
      tissue. Remarkably, these alterations preceded the appearance of differences in
      body weight, highlighting the causal relation between the loss of CB1 and the
      triggering of metabolic reprogramming in adipose tissues. Finally, the lean
      phenotype of Ati-CB1-KO mice and the increase in alternatively activated
      macrophages in adipose tissue were also present at thermoneutral conditions. Our 
      data provide compelling evidence for a crosstalk among adipocytes, immune cells, 
      and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), wherein CB1 plays a key regulatory
      role.

AB  - Cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) is known to have a substantial impact on the
      regulation of energy metabolism via central and peripheral mechanisms. In this
      issue of the JCI, Ruiz de Azua and colleagues provide important insights into the
      regulation of adipocyte physiology by CB1. Mice with adipocyte-specific deletion 
      of the CB1-encoding gene had an overall improved metabolic profile in addition to
      reduced body weight and total adiposity. These changes were associated with an
      increase in sympathetic tone of the adipose tissue and expansion of activated
      macrophages, both of which occurred prior to changes in body weight, lending
      support to a causal relationship between loss of CB1 in adipocytes and systemic
      metabolic changes. This work identifies adipocyte CB1s as a potential novel
      peripheral target for affecting systemic metabolism with diminished CNS effects.

TI  - Hdac3 regulates lymphovenous and lymphatic valve formation.
PG  - 4193-4206

LID - 92852 [pii]
AB  - Lymphedema, the most common lymphatic anomaly, involves defective lymphatic valve
      development; yet the epigenetic modifiers underlying lymphatic valve
      morphogenesis remain elusive. Here, we showed that during mouse development, the 
      histone-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) regulates the formation of
      both lymphovenous valves, which maintain the separation of the blood and
      lymphatic vascular systems, and the lymphatic valves. Endothelium-specific
      ablation of Hdac3 in mice led to blood-filled lymphatic vessels, edema, defective
      lymphovenous valve morphogenesis, improper lymphatic drainage, defective
      lymphatic valve maturation, and complete lethality. Hdac3-deficient lymphovenous 
      valves and lymphatic vessels exhibited reduced expression of the transcription
      factor Gata2 and its target genes. In response to oscillatory shear stress, the
      transcription factors Tal1, Gata2, and Ets1/2 physically interacted with and
      recruited Hdac3 to the evolutionarily conserved E-box-GATA-ETS composite element 
      of a Gata2 intragenic enhancer. In turn, Hdac3 recruited histone
      acetyltransferase Ep300 to form an enhanceosome complex that promoted Gata2
      expression. Together, these results identify Hdac3 as a key epigenetic modifier
      that maintains blood-lymph separation and integrates both extrinsic forces and
      intrinsic cues to regulate lymphatic valve development.

TI  - MNK1/2 inhibition limits oncogenicity and metastasis of KIT-mutant melanoma.
PG  - 4179-4192
LID - 10.1172/JCI91258 [doi]
LID - 91258 [pii]
AB  - Melanoma can be stratified into unique subtypes based on distinct pathologies.
      The acral/mucosal melanoma subtype is characterized by aberrant and constitutive 
      activation of the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase C-KIT, which drives
      tumorigenesis. Treatment of these melanoma patients with C-KIT inhibitors has
      proven challenging, prompting us to investigate the downstream effectors of the
      C-KIT receptor. We determined that C-KIT stimulates MAP kinase-interacting
      serine/threonine kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1/2), which phosphorylate eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and render it oncogenic. Depletion of
      MNK1/2 in melanoma cells with oncogenic C-KIT inhibited cell migration and mRNA
      translation of the transcriptional repressor SNAI1 and the cell cycle gene CCNE1.
      This suggested that blocking MNK1/2 activity may inhibit tumor progression, at
      least in part, by blocking translation initiation of mRNAs encoding cell
      migration proteins. Moreover, we developed an MNK1/2 inhibitor (SEL201), and
      found that SEL201-treated KIT-mutant melanoma cells had lower oncogenicity and
      reduced metastatic ability. Clinically, tumors from melanoma patients harboring
      KIT mutations displayed a marked increase in MNK1 and phospho-eIF4E. Thus, our
      studies indicate that blocking MNK1/2 exerts potent antimelanoma effects and
      support blocking MNK1/2 as a potential strategy to treat patients positive for
      KIT mutations.

TI  - Olfactory receptor 544 reduces adiposity by steering fuel preference toward fats.
PG  - 4118-4123
LID - 10.1172/JCI89344 [doi]
LID - 89344 [pii]
AB  - Olfactory receptors (ORs) are present in tissues outside the olfactory system;
      however, the function of these receptors remains relatively unknown. Here, we
      determined that olfactory receptor 544 (Olfr544) is highly expressed in the liver
      and adipose tissue of mice and regulates cellular energy metabolism and obesity. 
      Azelaic acid (AzA), an Olfr544 ligand, specifically induced PKA-dependent
      lipolysis in adipocytes and promoted fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis
      in liver, thus shifting the fuel preference to fats. After 6 weeks of
      administration, mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited a marked reduction in
      adiposity. AzA treatment induced expression of PPAR-alpha and genes required for 
      FAO in the liver and induced the expression of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1-alpha
      (Ppargc1a) and uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) genes in brown adipose tissue (BAT).
      Moreover, treatment with AzA increased insulin sensitivity and ketone body
      levels. This led to a reduction in the respiratory quotient and an increase in
      the FAO rate, as indicated by indirect calorimetry. AzA treatment had similar
      antiobesogenic effects in HFD-fed ob/ob mice. Importantly, AzA-associated
      metabolic changes were completely abrogated in HFD-fed Olfr544-/- mice. To our
      knowledge, this is the first report to show that Olfr544 orchestrates the
      metabolic interplay between the liver and adipose tissue, mobilizing stored fats 
      from adipose tissue and shifting the fuel preference to fats in the liver and
      BAT.

TI  - Caspase-11-mediated endothelial pyroptosis underlies endotoxemia-induced lung
      injury.
PG  - 4124-4135

LID - 94495 [pii]
AB  - Acute lung injury is a leading cause of death in bacterial sepsis due to the
      wholesale destruction of the lung endothelial barrier, which results in
      protein-rich lung edema, influx of proinflammatory leukocytes, and intractable
      hypoxemia. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed lytic cell death that is triggered 
      by inflammatory caspases, but little is known about its role in EC death and
      acute lung injury. Here, we show that systemic exposure to the bacterial
      endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes severe endothelial pyroptosis that is
      mediated by the inflammatory caspases, human caspases 4/5 in human ECs, or the
      murine homolog caspase-11 in mice in vivo. In caspase-11-deficient mice, BM
      transplantation with WT hematopoietic cells did not abrogate endotoxemia-induced 
      acute lung injury, indicating a central role for nonhematopoietic caspase-11 in
      endotoxemia. Additionally, conditional deletion of caspase-11 in ECs reduced
      endotoxemia-induced lung edema, neutrophil accumulation, and death. These results
      establish the requisite role of endothelial pyroptosis in endotoxemic tissue
      injury and suggest that endothelial inflammatory caspases are an important
      therapeutic target for acute lung injury.

AB  - Mast cells are classically thought to play an important role in protection
      against helminth infections and in the induction of allergic diseases; however,
      recent studies indicate that these cells also contribute to neovascularization,
      which is critical for tissue remodeling, chronic inflammation, and
      carcinogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that mast cells are essential for sprouting 
      angiogenesis in a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Although
      mouse strains lacking mast cells did not exhibit retinal neovascularization
      following hypoxia, these mice developed OIR following infusion of mast cells or
      after injection of mast cell tryptase (MCT). Relative hypoxia stimulated mast
      cell degranulation via transient receptor potential ankyrin 1. Subsequent surges 
      in MCT stimulated retinal endothelial cells to produce monocyte chemotactic
      protein-1 (MCP1) and angiogenic factors, leading to sprouting angiogenesis. Mast 
      cell stabilizers as well as specific tryptase and MCP1 inhibitors prevented the
      development of OIR in WT mice. Preterm infants with early retinopathy of
      prematurity had markedly higher plasma MCT levels than age-matched infants
      without disease, suggesting mast cells contribute to human disease. Together,
      these results suggest therapies that suppress mast cell activity should be
      further explored as a potential option for preventing eye diseases and subsequent
      blindness induced by neovascularization.

TI  - Circulating osteocrin stimulates bone growth by limiting C-type natriuretic
      peptide clearance.

AB  - Although peptides are safe and useful as therapeutics, they are often easily
      degraded or metabolized. Dampening the clearance system for peptide ligands is a 
      promising strategy for increasing the efficacy of peptide therapies. Natriuretic 
      peptide receptor B (NPR-B) and its naturally occurring ligand, C-type natriuretic
      peptide (CNP), are potent stimulators of endochondral bone growth, and activating
      the CNP/NPR-B system is expected to be a powerful strategy for treating impaired 
      skeletal growth. CNP is cleared by natriuretic peptide clearance receptor
      (NPR-C); therefore, we investigated the effect of reducing the rate of CNP
      clearance on skeletal growth by limiting the interaction between CNP and NPR-C.
      Specifically, we generated transgenic mice with increased circulating levels of
      osteocrin (OSTN) protein, a natural NPR-C ligand without natriuretic activity,
      and observed a dose-dependent skeletal overgrowth phenotype in these animals.
      Skeletal overgrowth in OSTN-transgenic mice was diminished in either CNP- or
      NPR-C-depleted backgrounds, confirming that CNP and NPR-C are indispensable for
      the bone growth-stimulating effect of OSTN. Interestingly, double-transgenic mice
      of CNP and OSTN had even higher levels of circulating CNP and additional
      increases in bone length, as compared with mice with elevated CNP alone.
      Together, these results support OSTN administration as an adjuvant agent for CNP 
      therapy and provide a potential therapeutic approach for diseases with impaired
      skeletal growth.

TI  - Uromodulin p.Cys147Trp mutation drives kidney disease by activating ER stress and
      apoptosis.
PG  - 3954-3969
LID - 10.1172/JCI93817 [doi]
LID - 93817 [pii]
AB  - Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) is caused by mutations in the
      uromodulin (UMOD) gene that result in a misfolded form of UMOD protein, which is 
      normally secreted by nephrons. In UAKD patients, mutant UMOD is poorly secreted
      and accumulates in the ER of distal kidney epithelium, but its role in disease
      progression is largely unknown. Here, we modeled UMOD accumulation in mice by
      expressing the murine equivalent of the human UMOD p.Cys148Trp point mutation
      (UmodC147W/+ mice). Like affected humans, these UmodC147W/+ mice developed
      spontaneous and progressive kidney disease with organ failure over 24 weeks.
      Analysis of diseased kidneys and purified UMOD-producing cells revealed early
      activation of the PKR-like ER kinase/activating transcription factor 4
      (PERK/ATF4) ER stress pathway, innate immune mediators, and increased apoptotic
      signaling, including caspase-3 activation. Unexpectedly, we also detected
      autophagy deficiency. Human cells expressing UMOD p.Cys147Trp recapitulated the
      findings in UmodC147W/+ mice, and autophagy activation with mTOR inhibitors
      stimulated the intracellular removal of aggregated mutant UMOD. Human cells
      producing mutant UMOD were susceptible to TNF-alpha- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
      due to increased expression of the ER stress mediator tribbles-3. Blocking
      TNF-alpha in vivo with the soluble recombinant fusion protein TNFR:Fc slowed
      disease progression in UmodC147W/+ mice by reducing active caspase-3, thereby
      preventing tubule cell death and loss of epithelial function. These findings
      reveal a targetable mechanism for disease processes involved in UAKD.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is the underlying etiology of cardiovascular disease, the leading
      cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis is a heterogeneous disease in which
      only a small fraction of lesions lead to heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac 
      death. A distinct type of plaque containing large necrotic cores with thin
      fibrous caps often precipitates these acute events. Here, we show that
      Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gamma (CaMKIIgamma) in macrophages plays
      a major role in the development of necrotic, thin-capped plaques. Macrophages in 
      necrotic and symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in humans as well as advanced
      atherosclerotic lesions in mice demonstrated activation of CaMKII. Western
      diet-fed LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice with myeloid-specific deletion of 
      CaMKII had smaller necrotic cores with concomitantly thicker collagen caps. These
      lesions demonstrated evidence of enhanced efferocytosis, which was associated
      with increased expression of the macrophage efferocytosis receptor MerTK.
      Mechanistic studies revealed that CaMKIIgamma-deficient macrophages and
      atherosclerotic lesions lacking myeloid CaMKIIgamma had increased expression of
      the transcription factor ATF6. We determined that ATF6 induces liver X
      receptor-alpha (LXRalpha), an Mertk-inducing transcription factor, and that
      increased MerTK expression and efferocytosis in CaMKIIgamma-deficient macrophages
      is dependent on LXRalpha. These findings identify a macrophage
      CaMKIIgamma/ATF6/LXRalpha/MerTK pathway as a key factor in the development of
      necrotic atherosclerotic plaques.

TI  - Proprotein convertase furin regulates osteocalcin and bone endocrine function.
PG  - 4104-4117
LID - 10.1172/JCI93437 [doi]
LID - 93437 [pii]
AB  - Osteocalcin (OCN) is an osteoblast-derived hormone that increases energy
      expenditure, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and glucose tolerance. The
      cDNA sequence of OCN predicts that, like many other peptide hormones, OCN is
      first synthesized as a prohormone (pro-OCN). The importance of pro-OCN maturation
      in regulating OCN and the identity of the endopeptidase responsible for pro-OCN
      cleavage in osteoblasts are still unknown. Here, we show that the proprotein
      convertase furin is responsible for pro-OCN maturation in vitro and in vivo.
      Using pharmacological and genetic experiments, we also determined that
      furin-mediated pro-OCN cleavage occurred independently of its
      gamma-carboxylation, a posttranslational modification that is known to hamper OCN
      endocrine action. However, because pro-OCN is not efficiently decarboxylated and 
      activated during bone resorption, inactivation of furin in osteoblasts in mice
      resulted in decreased circulating levels of undercarboxylated OCN, impaired
      glucose tolerance, and reduced energy expenditure. Furthermore, we show that
      Furin deletion in osteoblasts reduced appetite, a function not modulated by OCN, 
      thus suggesting that osteoblasts may secrete additional hormones that regulate
      different aspects of energy metabolism. Accordingly, the metabolic defects of the
      mice lacking furin in osteoblasts became more apparent under pair-feeding
      conditions. These findings identify furin as an important regulator of bone
      endocrine function.

TI  - CD56bright NK cells exhibit potent antitumor responses following IL-15 priming.
PG  - 4042-4058
LID - 10.1172/JCI90387 [doi]
LID - 90387 [pii]
AB  - NK cells, lymphocytes of the innate immune system, are important for defense
      against infectious pathogens and cancer. Classically, the CD56dim NK cell subset 
      is thought to mediate antitumor responses, whereas the CD56bright subset is
      involved in immunomodulation. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating
      that brief priming with IL-15 markedly enhanced the antitumor response of
      CD56bright NK cells. Priming improved multiple CD56bright cell functions:
      degranulation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine production. Primed CD56bright cells
      from leukemia patients demonstrated enhanced responses to autologous blasts in
      vitro, and primed CD56bright cells controlled leukemia cells in vivo in a murine 
      xenograft model. Primed CD56bright cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patients
      displayed superior responses to autologous myeloma targets, and furthermore,
      CD56bright NK cells from MM patients primed with the IL-15 receptor agonist
      ALT-803 in vivo displayed enhanced ex vivo functional responses to MM targets.
      Effector mechanisms contributing to IL-15-based priming included improved
      cytotoxic protein expression, target cell conjugation, and LFA-1-, CD2-, and
      NKG2D-dependent activation of NK cells. Finally, IL-15 robustly stimulated the
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways in CD56bright compared with CD56dim NK cells, 
      and blockade of these pathways attenuated antitumor responses. These findings
      identify CD56bright NK cells as potent antitumor effectors that warrant further
      investigation as a cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Mutations in signal recognition particle SRP54 cause syndromic neutropenia with

AB  - Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) (OMIM #260400) is a rare inherited bone marrow
      failure syndrome (IBMFS) that is primarily characterized by neutropenia and
      exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Seventy-five to ninety percent of patients
      have compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the
      Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (sbds) gene. Using trio whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES) in an sbds-negative SDS family and candidate gene sequencing in additional 
      SBDS-negative SDS cases or molecularly undiagnosed IBMFS cases, we identified 3
      independent patients, each of whom carried a de novo missense variant in srp54
      (encoding signal recognition particle 54 kDa). These 3 patients shared congenital
      neutropenia linked with various other SDS phenotypes. 3D protein modeling
      revealed that the 3 variants affect highly conserved amino acids within the
      GTPase domain of the protein that are critical for GTP and receptor binding.
      Indeed, we observed that the GTPase activity of the mutated proteins was
      impaired. The level of SRP54 mRNA in the bone marrow was 3.6-fold lower in
      patients with SRP54-mutations than in healthy controls. Profound reductions in
      neutrophil counts and chemotaxis as well as a diminished exocrine pancreas size
      in a SRP54-knockdown zebrafish model faithfully recapitulated the human
      phenotype. In conclusion, autosomal dominant mutations in SRP54, a key member of 
      the cotranslation protein-targeting pathway, lead to syndromic neutropenia with a
      Shwachman-Diamond-like phenotype.

AB  - Overconsumption of high-fat diet (HFD) and sugar-sweetened beverages are risk
      factors for developing obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver disease. Here
      we have dissected mechanisms underlying this association using mice fed either
      chow or HFD with or without fructose- or glucose-supplemented water. In chow-fed 
      mice, there was no major physiological difference between fructose and glucose
      supplementation. On the other hand, mice on HFD supplemented with fructose
      developed more pronounced obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatomegaly as
      compared to glucose-supplemented HFD mice, despite similar caloric intake.
      Fructose and glucose supplementation also had distinct effects on expression of
      the lipogenic transcription factors ChREBP and SREBP1c. While both sugars
      increased ChREBP-beta, fructose supplementation uniquely increased SREBP1c and
      downstream fatty acid synthesis genes, resulting in reduced liver insulin
      signaling. In contrast, glucose enhanced total ChREBP expression and triglyceride
      synthesis but was associated with improved hepatic insulin signaling. Metabolomic
      and RNA sequence analysis confirmed dichotomous effects of fructose and glucose
      supplementation on liver metabolism in spite of inducing similar hepatic lipid
      accumulation. Ketohexokinase, the first enzyme of fructose metabolism, was
      increased in fructose-fed mice and in obese humans with steatohepatitis.
      Knockdown of ketohexokinase in liver improved hepatic steatosis and glucose
      tolerance in fructose-supplemented mice. Thus, fructose is a component of dietary
      sugar that is distinctively associated with poor metabolic outcomes, whereas
      increased glucose intake may be protective.

LID - 10.1172/JCI92893 [doi]
LID - 92893 [pii]
AB  - Despite its central position in oncogenic intracellular signaling networks, the
      role of mTORC1 in epithelial development has not been studied extensively in
      vivo. Here, we have used the epidermis as a model system to elucidate the
      cellular effects and signaling feedback sequelae of mTORC1 loss of function in
      epithelial tissue. In mice with conditional epidermal loss of the mTORC1
      components Rheb or Rptor, mTORC1 loss of function unexpectedly resulted in a
      profound skin barrier defect with epidermal abrasions, blistering, and early
      postnatal lethality, due to a thinned epidermis with decreased desmosomal protein
      expression and incomplete biochemical differentiation. In mice with mTORC1 loss
      of function, we found that Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling was constitutively
      activated, resulting in increased cytoskeletal tension and impaired cell-cell
      adhesion. Inhibition or silencing of ROCK1 was sufficient to rescue keratinocyte 
      adhesion and biochemical differentiation in these mice. mTORC1 loss of function
      also resulted in marked feedback upregulation of upstream TGF-beta signaling,
      triggering ROCK activity and its downstream effects on desmosomal gene
      expression. These findings elucidate a role for mTORC1 in the regulation of
      epithelial barrier formation, cytoskeletal tension, and cell adhesion,
      underscoring the complexity of signaling feedback following mTORC1 inhibition.

AB  - Consumption of human breast milk (HBM) attenuates the incidence of necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC), which remains a leading and intractable cause of mortality
      in preterm infants. Here, we report that this diminution correlates with
      alterations in the gut microbiota, particularly enrichment of Propionibacterium
      species. Transfaunation of microbiota from HBM-fed preterm infants or a newly
      identified and cultured Propionibacterium strain, P. UF1, to germfree mice
      conferred protection against pathogen infection and correlated with profound
      increases in intestinal Th17 cells. The induction of Th17 cells was dependent on 
      bacterial dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (DlaT), a major protein expressed on
      the P. UF1 surface layer (S-layer). Binding of P. UF1 to its cognate receptor,
      SIGNR1, on dendritic cells resulted in the regulation of intestinal phagocytes.
      Importantly, transfer of P. UF1 profoundly mitigated induced NEC-like injury in
      neonatal mice. Together, these results mechanistically elucidate the protective
      effects of HBM and P. UF1-induced immunoregulation, which safeguard against
      proinflammatory diseases, including NEC.

AB  - Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae are among the most common pathogens
      of the human urinary tract. Among the genetic gains of function associated with
      urinary E. coli isolates is the Yersinia high pathogenicity island (HPI), which
      directs the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin (Ybt), a virulence-associated
      metallophore. Using a metabolomics approach, we found that E. coli and other
      Enterobacteriaceae expressing the Yersinia HPI also secrete escherichelin, a
      second metallophore whose chemical structure matches a known synthetic inhibitor 
      of the virulence-associated pyochelin siderophore system in Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. We detected escherichelin during clinical E. coli urinary tract
      infection (UTI) and experimental human colonization with a commensal, potentially
      probiotic E. coli bacteriuria strain. Escherichelin production by colonizing
      enterobacteria may help human hosts resist opportunistic infections by
      Pseudomonas and other pyochelin-expressing bacteria. This siderophore-based
      mechanism of microbial antagonism may be one of many elements contributing to the
      protective effects of the human microbiome. Future UTI-preventive probiotic
      strains may benefit by retaining the escherichelin biosynthetic capacity of the
      Yersinia HPI while eliminating the Ybt biosynthetic capacity.

AB  - In multiple sclerosis, the pathological interaction between autoreactive Th cells
      and mononuclear phagocytes in the CNS drives initiation and maintenance of
      chronic neuroinflammation. Here, we found that intrathecal transplantation of
      neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) in mice with experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE) impairs the accumulation of inflammatory monocyte-derived
      cells (MCs) in the CNS, leading to improved clinical outcome. Secretion of IL-23,
      IL-1, and TNF-alpha, the cytokines required for terminal differentiation of Th
      cells, decreased in the CNS of NPC-treated mice, consequently inhibiting the
      induction of GM-CSF-producing pathogenic Th cells. In vivo and in vitro
      transcriptome analyses showed that NPC-secreted factors inhibit MC
      differentiation and activation, favoring the switch toward an antiinflammatory
      phenotype. Tgfb2-/- NPCs transplanted into EAE mice were ineffective in impairing
      MC accumulation within the CNS and failed to drive clinical improvement.
      Moreover, intrathecal delivery of TGF-beta2 during the effector phase of EAE
      ameliorated disease severity. Taken together, these observations identify
      TGF-beta2 as the crucial mediator of NPC immunomodulation. This study provides
      evidence that intrathecally transplanted NPCs interfere with the CNS-restricted
      inflammation of EAE by reprogramming infiltrating MCs into antiinflammatory
      myeloid cells via secretion of TGF-beta2.

AB  - In psoriasis, an IL-17-mediated inflammatory skin disease, skin lesions resolve
      with therapy, but often recur in the same locations when therapy is discontinued.
      We propose that residual T cell populations in resolved psoriatic lesions
      represent the pathogenic T cells of origin in this disease. Utilizing
      high-throughput screening (HTS) of the T cell receptor (TCR) and immunostaining, 
      we found that clinically resolved psoriatic lesions contained oligoclonal
      populations of T cells that produced IL-17A in both resolved and active psoriatic
      lesions. Putative pathogenic clones preferentially utilized particular Vbeta and 
      Valpha subfamilies. We identified 15 TCRbeta and 4 TCRalpha antigen receptor
      sequences shared between psoriasis patients and not observed in healthy controls 
      or other inflammatory skin conditions. To address the relative roles of alphabeta
      versus gammadelta T cells in psoriasis, we carried out TCR/delta HTS. These
      studies demonstrated that the majority of T cells in psoriasis and healthy skin
      are alphabeta T cells. gammadelta T cells made up 1% of T cells in active
      psoriasis, less than 1% in resolved psoriatic lesions, and less than 2% in
      healthy skin. All of the 70 most frequent putative pathogenic T cell clones were 
      alphabeta T cells. In summary, IL-17-producing alphabeta T cell clones with
      psoriasis-specific antigen receptors exist in clinically resolved psoriatic skin 
      lesions. These cells likely represent the disease-initiating pathogenic T cells
      in psoriasis, suggesting that lasting control of this disease will require
      suppression of these resident T cell populations.

TI  - Mutations in the netrin-1 gene cause congenital mirror movements.
PG  - 3923-3936
LID - 10.1172/JCI95442 [doi]
LID - 95442 [pii]
AB  - Netrin-1 is a secreted protein that was first identified 20 years ago as an axon 
      guidance molecule that regulates midline crossing in the CNS. It plays critical
      roles in various tissues throughout development and is implicated in
      tumorigenesis and inflammation in adulthood. Despite extensive studies, no
      inherited human disease has been directly associated with mutations in NTN1, the 
      gene coding for netrin-1. Here, we have identified 3 mutations in exon 7 of NTN1 
      in 2 unrelated families and 1 sporadic case with isolated congenital mirror
      movements (CMM), a disorder characterized by involuntary movements of one hand
      that mirror intentional movements of the opposite hand. Given the diverse roles
      of netrin-1, the absence of manifestations other than CMM in NTN1 mutation
      carriers was unexpected. Using multimodal approaches, we discovered that the
      anatomy of the corticospinal tract (CST) is abnormal in patients with NTN1-mutant
      CMM. When expressed in HEK293 or stable HeLa cells, the 3 mutated netrin-1
      proteins were almost exclusively detected in the intracellular compartment,
      contrary to WT netrin-1, which is detected in both intracellular and
      extracellular compartments. Since netrin-1 is a diffusible extracellular cue, the
      pathophysiology likely involves its loss of function and subsequent disruption of
      axon guidance, resulting in abnormal decussation of the CST.

      cells.
PG  - 3866-3876
LID - 10.1172/JCI94639 [doi]
LID - 94639 [pii]
AB  - P-element-induced wimpy testes (Piwi) proteins are known for suppressing
      retrotransposon activation in the mammalian germline. However, whether Piwi
      protein or Piwi-dependent functions occur in the mammalian soma is unclear.
      Contrary to germline-restricted expression, we observed that Piwi-like Miwi2 mRNA
      is indeed expressed in epithelial cells of the lung in adult mice and that it is 
      induced during pneumonia. Further investigation revealed that MIWI2 protein
      localized to the cytoplasm of a discrete population of multiciliated airway
      epithelial cells. Isolation and next-generation sequencing of MIWI2-positive
      multiciliated cells revealed that they are phenotypically distinct from
      neighboring MIWI2-negative multiciliated cells. Mice lacking MIWI2 exhibited an
      altered balance of airway epithelial cells, demonstrating fewer multiciliated
      cells and an increase in club cells. During pneumococcal pneumonia,
      Miwi2-deficient mice exhibited increased expression of inflammatory mediators and
      increased immune cell recruitment, leading to enhanced bacterial clearance. Taken
      together, our data delineate MIWI2-dependent functions outside of the germline
      and demonstrate the presence of distinct subsets of airway multiciliated cells
      that can be discriminated by MIWI2 expression. By demonstrating roles for MIWI2
      in airway cell identity and pulmonary innate immunity, these studies elucidate
      unanticipated physiological functions for Piwi proteins in somatic tissues.

AB  - Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is often caused by elevated intraocular
      pressure (IOP), which arises due to increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow
      (AHO). Aqueous humor flows through Schlemm's canal (SC), a lymphatic-like vessel 
      encircling the cornea, and via intercellular spaces of ciliary muscle cells.
      However, the mechanisms underlying increased AHO resistance are poorly
      understood. Here, we demonstrate that signaling between angiopoietin (Angpt) and 
      the Angpt receptor Tie2, which is critical for SC formation, is also
      indispensable for maintaining SC integrity during adulthood. Deletion of
      Angpt1/Angpt2 or Tie2 in adult mice severely impaired SC integrity and
      transcytosis, leading to elevated IOP, retinal neuron damage, and impairment of
      retinal ganglion cell function, all hallmarks of POAG in humans. We found that SC
      integrity is maintained by interconnected and coordinated functions of Angpt-Tie2
      signaling, AHO, and Prox1 activity. These functions diminish in the SC during
      aging, leading to impaired integrity and transcytosis. Intriguingly, Tie2
      reactivation using a Tie2 agonistic antibody rescued the POAG phenotype in
      Angpt1/Angpt2-deficient mice and rejuvenated the SC in aged mice. These results
      indicate that the Angpt-Tie2 system is essential for SC integrity. The impairment
      of this system underlies POAG-associated pathogenesis, supporting the possibility
      that Tie2 agonists could be a therapeutic option for glaucoma.

AB  - Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness, with an estimated world-wide prevalence
      of 3.5% in members of the population older than 40 years of age. Elevated
      intraocular pressure as the result of abnormal resistance to aqueous humor
      drainage is a major contributing, and the only preventable, factor in glaucoma
      development. Schlemm's canal (SC), a lymphatic-like vessel encircling the
      anterior portion of the eye, plays a key role in promoting aqueous humor outflow 
      and maintenance of normal intraocular pressure. The risk of developing glaucoma
      increases with age; therefore, understanding mechanisms of SC maintenance and how
      aging affects SC function are of special importance, both for prevention and
      novel treatment approaches to glaucoma. Using a compelling array of genetic
      models, Kim et al. report in this issue of the JCI that continuous
      angiopoietin/TIE2 signaling is required for maintaining SC identity and integrity
      during adulthood and show that its age-related changes can be rescued by a TIE2
      agonistic antibody.

AB  - Skeletal muscle is a key organ in energy homeostasis owing to its high
      requirement for nutrients. Heterotrimeric G proteins converge signals from
      cell-surface receptors to potentiate or blunt responses against environmental
      changes. Here, we show that muscle-specific ablation of Galpha13 in mice promotes
      reprogramming of myofibers to the oxidative type, with resultant increases in
      mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular respiration. Mechanistically, Galpha13 and 
      its downstream effector RhoA suppressed nuclear factor of activated T cells 1
      (NFATc1), a chief regulator of myofiber conversion, by increasing Rho-associated 
      kinase 2-mediated (Rock2-mediated) phosphorylation at Ser243. Ser243
      phosphorylation of NFATc1 was reduced after exercise, but was higher in obese
      animals. Consequently, Galpha13 ablation in muscles enhanced whole-body energy
      metabolism and increased insulin sensitivity, thus affording protection from
      diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. Our results define Galpha13 as a
      switch regulator of myofiber reprogramming, implying that modulations of Galpha13
      and its downstream effectors in skeletal muscle are a potential therapeutic
      approach to treating metabolic diseases.

AB  - The short-limbed dwarfism metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS) is
      linked to mutations in type X collagen, which increase ER stress by inducing
      misfolding of the mutant protein and subsequently disrupting hypertrophic
      chondrocyte differentiation. Here, we show that carbamazepine (CBZ), an
      autophagy-stimulating drug that is clinically approved for the treatment of
      seizures and bipolar disease, reduced the ER stress induced by 4 different
      MCDS-causing mutant forms of collagen X in human cell culture. Depending on the
      nature of the mutation, CBZ application stimulated proteolysis of misfolded
      collagen X by either autophagy or proteasomal degradation, thereby reducing
      intracellular accumulation of mutant collagen. In MCDS mice expressing the
      Col10a1.pN617K mutation, CBZ reduced the MCDS-associated expansion of the growth 
      plate hypertrophic zone, attenuated enhanced expression of ER stress markers such
      as Bip and Atf4, increased bone growth, and reduced skeletal dysplasia. CBZ
      produced these beneficial effects by reducing the MCDS-associated abnormalities
      in hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. Stimulation of intracellular
      proteolysis using CBZ treatment may therefore be a clinically viable way of
      treating the ER stress-associated dwarfism MCDS.

AB  - Peptide hormones are crucial regulators of many aspects of human physiology.
      Mutations that alter these signaling peptides are associated with physiological
      imbalances that underlie diseases. However, the conformational maturation of
      peptide hormone precursors (prohormones) in the ER remains largely unexplored.
      Here, we report that conformational maturation of proAVP, the precursor for the
      antidiuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin, within the ER requires the
      ER-associated degradation (ERAD) activity of the Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex.
      Serum hyperosmolality induces expression of both ERAD components and proAVP in
      AVP-producing neurons. Mice with global or AVP neuron-specific ablation of
      Se1L-Hrd1 ERAD progressively developed polyuria and polydipsia, characteristics
      of diabetes insipidus. Mechanistically, we found that ERAD deficiency causes
      marked ER retention and aggregation of a large proportion of all proAVP protein. 
      Further, we show that proAVP is an endogenous substrate of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD. The
      inability to clear misfolded proAVP with highly reactive cysteine thiols in the
      absence of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD causes proAVP to accumulate and participate in
      inappropriate intermolecular disulfide-bonded aggregates, promoted by the
      enzymatic activity of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). This study highlights a 
      pathway linking ERAD to prohormone conformational maturation in neuroendocrine
      cells, expanding the role of ERAD in providing a conducive ER environment for
      nascent proteins to reach proper conformation.

AB  - Inadequate pancreatic beta cell function underlies type 1 and type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Strategies to expand functional cells have focused on discovering and
      controlling mechanisms that limit the proliferation of human beta cells. Here, we
      developed an engraftment strategy to examine age-associated human islet cell
      replication competence and reveal mechanisms underlying age-dependent decline of 
      beta cell proliferation in human islets. We found that exendin-4 (Ex-4), an
      agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), stimulates human beta
      cell proliferation in juvenile but not adult islets. This age-dependent
      responsiveness does not reflect loss of GLP-1R signaling in adult islets, since
      Ex-4 treatment stimulated insulin secretion by both juvenile and adult human beta
      cells. We show that the mitogenic effect of Ex-4 requires calcineurin/nuclear
      factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling. In juvenile islets, Ex-4 induced
      expression of calcineurin/NFAT signaling components as well as target genes for
      proliferation-promoting factors, including NFATC1, FOXM1, and CCNA1. By contrast,
      expression of these factors in adult islet beta cells was not affected by Ex-4
      exposure. These studies reveal age-dependent signaling mechanisms regulating
      human beta cell proliferation, and identify elements that could be adapted for
      therapeutic expansion of human beta cells.

AB  - Deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) underlies
      diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by the excretion of abnormally large
      volumes of dilute urine and persistent thirst. In this issue of the JCI, Shi et
      al. report that Sel1L-Hrd1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is responsible for
      the clearance of misfolded pro-arginine vasopressin (proAVP) in the ER.
      Additionally, mice with Sel1L deficiency, either globally or specifically within 
      AVP-expressing neurons, developed central diabetes insipidus. The results of this
      study demonstrate a role for ERAD in neuroendocrine cells and serve as a clinical
      example of the effect of misfolded ER proteins retrotranslocated through the
      membrane into the cytosol, where they are polyubiquitinated, extracted from the
      ER membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. Moreover, proAVP misfolding in
      hereditary central diabetes insipidus likely shares common physiopathological
      mechanisms with proinsulin misfolding in hereditary diabetes mellitus of youth.

TI  - Neutrophil FcgammaRIIA promotes IgG-mediated glomerular neutrophil capture via

AB  - The kidney glomerular capillaries are frequent sites of immune complex deposition
      and subsequent neutrophil accumulation in post-infectious and rapidly progressive
      glomerulonephritis. However, the mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment remain
      enigmatic, and there is no targeted therapeutic to avert this proximal event in
      glomerular inflammation. The uniquely human activating Fc receptor FcgammaRIIA
      promotes glomerular neutrophil accumulation and damage in anti-glomerular
      basement membrane-induced (anti-GBM-induced) glomerulonephritis when expressed on
      murine neutrophils. Here, we found that neutrophils are directly captured by
      immobilized IgG antibodies under physiological flow conditions in vitro through
      FcgammaRIIA-dependent, Abl/Src tyrosine kinase-mediated F-actin polymerization.
      Biophysical measurements showed that the lifetime of FcgammaRIIA-IgG bonds
      increased under mechanical force in an F-actin-dependent manner, which could
      enable the capture of neutrophils under physiological flow. Kidney intravital
      microscopy revealed that circulating neutrophils, which were similar in diameter 
      to glomerular capillaries, abruptly arrested following anti-GBM antibody
      deposition via neutrophil FcgammaRIIA and Abl/Src kinases. Accordingly,
      inhibition of Abl/Src with bosutinib reduced FcgammaRIIA-mediated glomerular
      neutrophil accumulation and renal injury in experimental, crescentic anti-GBM
      nephritis. These data identify a pathway of neutrophil recruitment within
      glomerular capillaries following IgG deposition that may be targeted by bosutinib
      to avert glomerular injury.

AB  - Tumors adapt to an unfavorable microenvironment by controlling the balance
      between cell proliferation and cell motility, but the regulators of this process 
      are largely unknown. Here, we show that an alternatively spliced isoform of
      syntaphilin (SNPH), a cytoskeletal regulator of mitochondrial movements in
      neurons, is directed to mitochondria of tumor cells. Mitochondrial SNPH buffers
      oxidative stress and maintains complex II-dependent bioenergetics, sustaining
      local tumor growth while restricting mitochondrial redistribution to the cortical
      cytoskeleton and tumor cell motility. Conversely, introduction of stress stimuli 
      to the microenvironment, including hypoxia, acutely lowered SNPH levels,
      resulting in bioenergetics defects and increased superoxide production. In turn, 
      this suppressed tumor cell proliferation but increased tumor cell invasion via
      greater mitochondrial trafficking to the cortical cytoskeleton. Loss of SNPH or
      expression of an SNPH mutant lacking the mitochondrial localization sequence
      resulted in increased metastatic dissemination in xenograft or syngeneic tumor
      models in vivo. Accordingly, tumor cells that acquired the ability to metastasize
      in vivo constitutively downregulated SNPH and exhibited higher oxidative stress, 
      reduced cell proliferation, and increased cell motility. Therefore, SNPH is a
      stress-regulated mitochondrial switch of the cell proliferation-motility balance 
      in cancer, and its pathway may represent a therapeutic target.

AB  - Bile acids function not only as detergents that facilitate lipid absorption but
      also as signaling molecules that activate the nuclear receptor farnesoid X
      receptor (FXR). FXR agonists are currently being evaluated as therapeutic agents 
      for a number of hepatic diseases due to their lipid-lowering and antiinflammatory
      properties. FXR is also essential for maintaining bile acid homeostasis and
      prevents the accumulation of bile acids. Elevated bile acids activate FXR, which 
      in turn switches off bile acid synthesis by reducing the mRNA levels of bile acid
      synthesis genes, including cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1). Here, we show
      that FXR activation triggers a rapid posttranscriptional mechanism to degrade
      Cyp7a1 mRNA. We identified the RNA-binding protein Zfp36l1 as an FXR target gene 
      and determined that gain and loss of function of ZFP36L1 reciprocally regulate
      Cyp7a1 mRNA and bile acid levels in vivo. Moreover, we found that mice lacking
      hepatic ZFP36L1 were protected from diet-induced obesity and steatosis. The
      reduced adiposity and antisteatotic effects observed in ZFP36L1-deficient mice
      were accompanied by impaired lipid absorption that was consistent with altered
      bile acid metabolism. Thus, the ZFP36L1-dependent regulation of bile acid
      metabolism is an important metabolic contributor to obesity and hepatosteatosis.

TI  - Fibroblast-specific TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signaling underlies cardiac fibrosis.
PG  - 3770-3783
LID - 10.1172/JCI94753 [doi]
LID - 94753 [pii]
AB  - The master cytokine TGF-beta mediates tissue fibrosis associated with
      inflammation and tissue injury. TGF-beta induces fibroblast activation and
      differentiation into myofibroblasts that secrete extracellular matrix proteins.
      Canonical TGF-beta signaling mobilizes Smad2 and Smad3 transcription factors that
      control fibrosis by promoting gene expression. However, the importance of
      TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signaling in fibroblast-mediated cardiac fibrosis has not been
      directly evaluated in vivo. Here, we examined pressure overload-induced cardiac
      fibrosis in fibroblast- and myofibroblast-specific inducible Cre-expressing mouse
      lines with selective deletion of the TGF-beta receptors Tgfbr1/2, Smad2, or
      Smad3. Fibroblast-specific deletion of Tgfbr1/2 or Smad3, but not Smad2, markedly
      reduced the pressure overload-induced fibrotic response as well as fibrosis
      mediated by a heart-specific, latency-resistant TGF-beta mutant transgene.
      Interestingly, cardiac fibroblast-specific deletion of Tgfbr1/2, but not Smad2/3,
      attenuated the cardiac hypertrophic response to pressure overload stimulation.
      Mechanistically, loss of Smad2/3 from tissue-resident fibroblasts attenuated
      injury-induced cellular expansion within the heart and the expression of
      fibrosis-mediating genes. Deletion of Smad2/3 or Tgfbr1/2 from cardiac
      fibroblasts similarly inhibited the gene program for fibrosis and extracellular
      matrix remodeling, although deletion of Tgfbr1/2 uniquely altered expression of
      an array of regulatory genes involved in cardiomyocyte homeostasis and disease
      compensation. These findings implicate TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signaling in activated
      tissue-resident cardiac fibroblasts as principal mediators of the fibrotic
      response.

TI  - No evidence of HIV replication in children on antiretroviral therapy.
PG  - 3827-3834
LID - 10.1172/JCI94582 [doi]
LID - 94582 [pii]
AB  - It remains controversial whether current antiretroviral therapy (ART) fully
      suppresses the cycles of HIV replication and viral evolution in vivo. If
      replication persists in sanctuary sites such as the lymph nodes, a high priority 
      should be placed on improving ART regimes to target these sites. To investigate
      the question of ongoing viral replication on current ART regimens, we analyzed
      HIV populations in longitudinal samples from 10 HIV-1-infected children who
      initiated ART when viral diversity was low. Eight children started ART at less
      than ten months of age and showed suppression of plasma viremia for seven to nine
      years. Two children had uncontrolled viremia for fifteen and thirty months,
      respectively, before viremia suppression, and served as positive controls for HIV
      replication and evolution. These latter 2 children showed clear evidence of virus
      evolution, whereas multiple methods of analysis bore no evidence of virus
      evolution in any of the 8 children with viremia suppression on ART. Phylogenetic 
      trees simulated with the recently reported evolutionary rate of HIV-1 on ART of 6
      x 10-4 substitutions/site/month bore no resemblance to the observed data. Taken
      together, these data refute the concept that ongoing HIV replication is common
      with ART and is the major barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.

TI  - Herpes simplex virus-1 evasion of CD8+ T cell accumulation contributes to viral

PG  - 3784-3795
LID - 10.1172/JCI92931 [doi]
LID - 92931 [pii]
AB  - Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of sporadic viral
      encephalitis, which can be lethal or result in severe neurological defects even
      with antiviral therapy. While HSV-1 causes encephalitis in spite of
      HSV-1-specific humoral and cellular immunity, the mechanism by which HSV-1 evades
      the immune system in the central nervous system (CNS) remains unknown. Here we
      describe a strategy by which HSV-1 avoids immune targeting in the CNS. The HSV-1 
      UL13 kinase promotes evasion of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cell accumulation in
      infection sites by downregulating expression of the CD8+ T cell attractant
      chemokine CXCL9 in the CNS of infected mice, leading to increased HSV-1 mortality
      due to encephalitis. Direct injection of CXCL9 into the CNS infection site
      enhanced HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cell accumulation, leading to marked improvements 
      in the survival of infected mice. This previously uncharacterized strategy for
      HSV-1 evasion of CD8+ T cell accumulation in the CNS has important implications
      for understanding the pathogenesis and clinical treatment of HSV-1 encephalitis.

TI  - NF-kappaB regulates GDF-15 to suppress macrophage surveillance during early tumor
      development.

AB  - Macrophages are attracted to developing tumors and can participate in immune
      surveillance to eliminate neoplastic cells. In response, neoplastic cells utilize
      NF-kappaB to suppress this killing activity, but the mechanisms underlying their 
      self-protection remain unclear. Here, we report that this dynamic interaction
      between tumor cells and macrophages is integrally linked by a soluble factor
      identified as growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). In vitro,
      tumor-derived GDF-15 signals in macrophages to suppress their proapoptotic
      activity by inhibiting TNF and nitric oxide (NO) production. In vivo, depletion
      of GDF-15 in Ras-driven tumor xenografts and in an orthotopic model of pancreatic
      cancer delayed tumor development. This delay correlated with increased
      infiltrating antitumor macrophages. Further, production of GDF-15 is directly
      regulated by NF-kappaB, and the colocalization of activated NF-kappaB and GDF-15 
      in epithelial ducts of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma supports the importance of
      this observation. Mechanistically, we found that GDF-15 suppresses macrophage
      activity by inhibiting TGF-beta-activated kinase (TAK1) signaling to NF-kappaB,
      thereby blocking synthesis of TNF and NO. Based on these results, we propose that
      the NF-kappaB/GDF-15 regulatory axis is important for tumor cells in evading
      macrophage immune surveillance during the early stages of tumorigenesis.

AB  - There is an increasing recognition that inflammation plays a critical role in
      neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and the prototypic neuroinflammatory
      disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Differential immune responses involving the
      adaptive versus the innate immune system are observed at various stages of
      neurodegenerative diseases, and may not only drive disease processes but could
      serve as therapeutic targets. Ongoing investigations into the specific
      inflammatory mechanisms that play roles in disease causation and progression have
      revealed lessons about inflammation-driven neurodegeneration that can be applied 
      to other neurodegenerative diseases. An increasing number of immunotherapeutic
      strategies that have been successful in MS are now being applied to other
      neurodegenerative diseases. Some approaches suppress CNS immune mechanisms, while
      others harness the immune system to clear deleterious products and cells. This
      Review focuses on the mechanisms by which inflammation, mediated either by the
      peripheral immune response or by endogenous CNS immune mechanisms, can affect CNS
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - mTORC1 hyperactivation arrests bone growth in lysosomal storage disorders by
      suppressing autophagy.
PG  - 3717-3729
LID - 10.1172/JCI94130 [doi]
LID - 94130 [pii]
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase promotes cell growth 
      by activating biosynthetic pathways and suppressing catabolic pathways,
      particularly that of macroautophagy. A prerequisite for mTORC1 activation is its 
      translocation to the lysosomal surface. Deregulation of mTORC1 has been
      associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases, but its role in skeletal
      disorders is largely unknown. Here, we show that enhanced mTORC1 signaling
      arrests bone growth in lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). We found that
      lysosomal dysfunction induces a constitutive lysosomal association and consequent
      activation of mTORC1 in chondrocytes, the cells devoted to bone elongation.
      mTORC1 hyperphosphorylates the protein UV radiation resistance-associated gene
      (UVRAG), reducing the activity of the associated Beclin 1-Vps34 complex and
      thereby inhibiting phosphoinositide production. Limiting phosphoinositide
      production leads to a blockage of the autophagy flux in LSD chondrocytes. As a
      consequence, LSD chondrocytes fail to properly secrete collagens, the main
      components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. In mouse models of LSD,
      normalization of mTORC1 signaling or stimulation of the Beclin 1-Vps34-UVRAG
      complex rescued the autophagy flux, restored collagen levels in cartilage, and
      ameliorated the bone phenotype. Taken together, these data unveil a role for
      mTORC1 and autophagy in the pathogenesis of skeletal disorders and suggest
      potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of LSDs.

TI  - Haploinsufficiency for DNA methyltransferase 3A predisposes hematopoietic cells
      to myeloid malignancies.
PG  - 3657-3674
LID - 10.1172/JCI93041 [doi]
LID - 93041 [pii]
AB  - The gene that encodes de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is frequently
      mutated in acute myeloid leukemia genomes. Point mutations at position R882 have 
      been shown to cause a dominant negative loss of DNMT3A methylation activity, but 
      15% of DNMT3A mutations are predicted to produce truncated proteins that could
      either have dominant negative activities or cause loss of function and
      haploinsufficiency. Here, we demonstrate that 3 of these mutants produce
      truncated, inactive proteins that do not dimerize with WT DNMT3A, strongly
      supporting the haploinsufficiency hypothesis. We therefore evaluated
      hematopoiesis in mice heterozygous for a constitutive null Dnmt3a mutation. With 
      no other manipulations, Dnmt3a+/- mice developed myeloid skewing over time, and
      their hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells exhibited a long-term competitive
      transplantation advantage. Dnmt3a+/- mice also spontaneously developed
      transplantable myeloid malignancies after a long latent period, and 3 of 12
      tumors tested had cooperating mutations in the Ras/MAPK pathway. The residual
      Dnmt3a allele was neither mutated nor downregulated in these tumors. The bone
      marrow cells of Dnmt3a+/- mice had a subtle but statistically significant DNA
      hypomethylation phenotype that was not associated with gene dysregulation. These 
      data demonstrate that haploinsufficiency for Dnmt3a alters hematopoiesis and
      predisposes mice (and probably humans) to myeloid malignancies by a mechanism
      that is not yet clear.

AB  - TGF-beta1 signaling is a critical driver of collagen accumulation and fibrotic
      disease but also a vital suppressor of inflammation and epithelial cell
      proliferation. The nature of this multifunctional cytokine has limited the
      development of global TGF-beta1 signaling inhibitors as therapeutic agents. We
      conducted phenotypic screens for small molecules that inhibit TGF-beta1-induced
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition without immediate TGF-beta1 receptor (TbetaR)
      kinase inhibition. We identified trihydroxyphenolic compounds as potent blockers 
      of TGF-beta1 responses (IC50 ~50 nM), Snail1 expression, and collagen deposition 
      in vivo in models of pulmonary fibrosis and collagen-dependent lung cancer
      metastasis. Remarkably, the functional effects of trihydroxyphenolics required
      the presence of active lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), thereby limiting effects to 
      fibroblasts or cancer cells, the major LOXL2 producers. Mechanistic studies
      revealed that trihydroxyphenolics induce auto-oxidation of a LOXL2/3-specific
      lysine (K731) in a time-dependent reaction that irreversibly inhibits LOXL2 and
      converts the trihydrophenolic to a previously undescribed metabolite that
      directly inhibits TbetaRI kinase. Combined inhibition of LOXL2 and TbetaRI
      activities by trihydrophenolics resulted in potent blockade of pathological
      collagen accumulation in vivo without the toxicities associated with global
      inhibitors. These findings elucidate a therapeutic approach to attenuate fibrosis
      and the disease-promoting effects of tissue stiffness by specifically targeting
      TbetaRI kinase in LOXL2-expressing cells.

AB  - Maintenance of muscle structure and function depends on the precise organization 
      of contractile proteins into sarcomeres and coupling of the contractile apparatus
      to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which serves as the reservoir for calcium
      required for contraction. Several members of the Kelch superfamily of proteins,
      which modulate protein stability as substrate-specific adaptors for
      ubiquitination, have been implicated in sarcomere formation. The Kelch protein
      Klhl31 is expressed in a muscle-specific manner under control of the
      transcription factor MEF2. To explore its functions in vivo, we created a mouse
      model of Klhl31 loss of function using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Mice lacking
      Klhl31 exhibited stunted postnatal skeletal muscle growth, centronuclear
      myopathy, central cores, Z-disc streaming, and SR dilation. We used proteomics to
      identify several candidate Klhl31 substrates, including Filamin-C (FlnC). In the 
      Klhl31-knockout mice, FlnC protein levels were highly upregulated with no change 
      in transcription, and we further demonstrated that Klhl31 targets FlnC for
      ubiquitination and degradation. These findings highlight a role for Klhl31 in the
      maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and provide insight into the mechanisms 
      underlying congenital myopathies.

      organ-specific autoimmunity.

AB  - Autoreactive CD4 T cells that differentiate into pathogenic Th17 cells can
      trigger autoimmune diseases. Therefore, investigating the regulatory network that
      modulates Th17 differentiation may yield important therapeutic insights. miR-146a
      has emerged as a critical modulator of immune reactions, but its role in
      regulating autoreactive Th17 cells and organ-specific autoimmunity remains
      largely unknown. Here, we have reported that miR-146a-deficient mice developed
      more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of
      human multiple sclerosis (MS). We bred miR-146a-deficient mice with 2D2 T cell
      receptor-Tg mice to generate 2D2 CD4 T cells that are deficient in miR-146a and
      specific for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an autoantigen in the EAE
      model. miR-146a-deficient 2D2 T cells induced more severe EAE and were more prone
      to differentiate into Th17 cells. Microarray analysis revealed enhancements in
      IL-6- and IL-21-induced Th17 differentiation pathways in these T cells. Further
      study showed that miR-146a inhibited the production of autocrine IL-6 and IL-21
      in 2D2 T cells, which in turn reduced their Th17 differentiation. Thus, our study
      identifies miR-146a as an important molecular brake that blocks the autocrine
      IL-6- and IL-21-induced Th17 differentiation pathways in autoreactive CD4 T
      cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating autoimmune
      diseases.

PG  - 3598-3608
LID - 10.1172/JCI92171 [doi]
LID - 92171 [pii]
AB  - The tumor suppressor p53, a master regulator of the cellular response to stress, 
      is tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 via an autoregulatory
      feedback loop. In addition to its well-established role in tumorigenesis, p53 has
      also been associated with aging in mice. Several mouse models with aberrantly
      increased p53 activity display signs of premature aging. However, the
      relationship between dysfunction of the MDM2/p53 axis and human aging remains
      elusive. Here, we have identified an antiterminating homozygous germline mutation
      in MDM2 in a patient affected by a segmental progeroid syndrome. We show that
      this mutation abrogates MDM2 activity, thereby resulting in enhanced levels and
      stability of p53. Analysis of the patient's primary cells, genome-edited cells,
      and in vitro and in vivo analyses confirmed the MDM2 mutation's aberrant
      regulation of p53 activity. Functional data from a zebrafish model further
      demonstrated that mutant Mdm2 was unable to rescue a p53-induced apoptotic
      phenotype. Altogether, our findings indicate that mutant MDM2 is a likely driver 
      of the observed segmental form of progeria.

AB  - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a pediatric myeloproliferative
      neoplasm that bears distinct characteristics associated with abnormal fetal
      development. JMML has been extensively modeled in mice expressing the oncogenic
      KrasG12D mutation. However, these models have struggled to recapitulate the
      defining features of JMML due to in utero lethality, nonhematopoietic expression,
      and the pervasive emergence of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we have
      developed a model of JMML using mice that express KrasG12D in multipotent
      progenitor cells (Flt3Cre+ KrasG12D mice). These mice express KrasG12D in utero, 
      are born at normal Mendelian ratios, develop hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and
      thrombocytopenia, and succumb to a rapidly progressing and fully penetrant
      neonatal myeloid disease. Mutant mice have altered hematopoietic stem and
      progenitor cell populations in the BM and spleen that are hypersensitive to
      granulocyte macrophage-CSF due to hyperactive RAS/ERK signaling. Biased
      differentiation in these progenitors results in an expansion of neutrophils and
      DCs and a concomitant decrease in T lymphocytes. Flt3Cre+ KrasG12D fetal liver
      hematopoietic progenitors give rise to a myeloid disease upon transplantation. In
      summary, we describe a KrasG12D mouse model that reproducibly develops JMML-like 
      disease. This model will prove useful for preclinical drug studies and for
      elucidating the developmental origins of pediatric neoplasms.

PG  - 3640-3651
LID - 10.1172/JCI93616 [doi]
LID - 93616 [pii]
AB  - Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) is a central regulator of
      lipogenesis whose activity is controlled by proteolytic cleavage. The metabolic
      factors that affect its processing are incompletely understood. Here, we show
      that dynamic changes in the acyl chain composition of ER phospholipids affect
      SREBP-1c maturation in physiology and disease. The abundance of polyunsaturated
      phosphatidylcholine in liver ER is selectively increased in response to feeding
      and in the setting of obesity-linked insulin resistance. Exogenous delivery of
      polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine to ER accelerated SREBP-1c processing through
      a mechanism that required an intact SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)
      pathway. Furthermore, induction of the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme LPCAT3 in
      response to liver X receptor (LXR) activation promoted SREBP-1c processing by
      driving the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into ER. Conversely,
      LPCAT3 deficiency increased membrane saturation, reduced nuclear SREBP-1c
      abundance, and blunted the lipogenic response to feeding, LXR agonist treatment, 
      or obesity-linked insulin resistance. Desaturation of the ER membrane may serve
      as an auxiliary signal of the fed state that promotes lipid synthesis in response
      to nutrient availability.

LID - 90895 [pii]
AB  - During an immune response, CD8+ T lymphocytes can undergo asymmetric division,
      giving rise to daughter cells that exhibit distinct tendencies to adopt terminal 
      effector and memory cell fates. Here we show that "pre-effector" and "pre-memory"
      cells resulting from the first CD8+ T cell division in vivo exhibited low and
      high rates of endogenous proteasome activity, respectively. Pharmacologic
      reduction of proteasome activity in CD8+ T cells early during differentiation
      resulted in acquisition of terminal effector cell characteristics, whereas
      enhancement of proteasome activity conferred attributes of memory lymphocytes.
      Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that modulating proteasome
      activity in CD8+ T cells affected cellular metabolism. These metabolic changes
      were mediated, in part, through differential expression of Myc, a transcription
      factor that controls glycolysis and metabolic reprogramming. Taken together,
      these results demonstrate that proteasome activity is an important regulator of
      CD8+ T cell fate and raise the possibility that increasing proteasome activity
      may be a useful therapeutic strategy to enhance the generation of memory
      lymphocytes.

TI  - Secreted protein Del-1 regulates myelopoiesis in the hematopoietic stem cell
      niche.
PG  - 3624-3639
LID - 10.1172/JCI92571 [doi]
LID - 92571 [pii]
AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain mostly quiescent under steady-state
      conditions but switch to a proliferative state following hematopoietic stress,
      e.g., bone marrow (BM) injury, transplantation, or systemic infection and
      inflammation. The homeostatic balance between quiescence, self-renewal, and
      differentiation of HSCs is strongly dependent on their interactions with cells
      that constitute a specialized microanatomical environment in the BM known as the 
      HSC niche. Here, we identified the secreted extracellular matrix protein Del-1 as
      a component and regulator of the HSC niche. Specifically, we found that Del-1 was
      expressed by several cellular components of the HSC niche, including arteriolar
      endothelial cells, CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, and cells of the
      osteoblastic lineage. Del-1 promoted critical functions of the HSC niche, as it
      regulated long-term HSC (LT-HSC) proliferation and differentiation toward the
      myeloid lineage. Del-1 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced LT-HSC
      proliferation and infringed preferentially upon myelopoiesis under both
      steady-state and stressful conditions, such as hematopoietic cell transplantation
      and G-CSF- or inflammation-induced stress myelopoiesis. Del-1-induced HSC
      proliferation and myeloid lineage commitment were mediated by beta3 integrin on
      hematopoietic progenitors. This hitherto unknown Del-1 function in the HSC niche 
      represents a juxtacrine homeostatic adaptation of the hematopoietic system in
      stress myelopoiesis.

TI  - Pericyte-targeting prodrug overcomes tumor resistance to vascular disrupting
      agents.

AB  - Blood vessels in the tumor periphery have high pericyte coverage and are
      resistant to vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). VDA treatment resistance leads to
      a viable peripheral tumor rim that contributes to treatment failure and disease
      recurrence. Here, we provide evidence to support a hypothesis that shifting the
      target of VDAs from tumor vessel endothelial cells to pericytes disrupts tumor
      peripheral vessels and the viable rim, circumventing VDA treatment resistance.
      Through chemical engineering, we developed Z-GP-DAVLBH (from the tubulin-binding 
      VDA desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide [DAVLBH]) as a prodrug that can be
      selectively activated by fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPalpha) in tumor 
      pericytes. Z-GP-DAVLBH selectively destroys the cytoskeleton of
      FAPalpha-expressing tumor pericytes, disrupting blood vessels both within the
      core and around the periphery of tumors. As a result, Z-GP-DAVLBH treatment
      eradicated the otherwise VDA-resistant tumor rim and led to complete regression
      of tumors in multiple lines of xenografts without producing the drug-related
      toxicity that is associated with similar doses of DAVLBH. This study demonstrates
      that targeting tumor pericytes with an FAPalpha-activated VDA prodrug represents 
      a potential vascular disruption strategy in overcoming tumor resistance to VDA
      treatments.

TI  - Understanding the functions and relationships of the glymphatic system and
      meningeal lymphatics.
PG  - 3210-3219
LID - 10.1172/JCI90603 [doi]
LID - 90603 [pii]
AB  - Recent discoveries of the glymphatic system and of meningeal lymphatic vessels
      have generated a lot of excitement, along with some degree of skepticism. Here,
      we summarize the state of the field and point out the gaps of knowledge that
      should be filled through further research. We discuss the glymphatic system as a 
      system that allows CNS perfusion by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      interstitial fluid (ISF). We also describe the recently characterized meningeal
      lymphatic vessels and their role in drainage of the brain ISF, CSF, CNS-derived
      molecules, and immune cells from the CNS and meninges to the peripheral
      (CNS-draining) lymph nodes. We speculate on the relationship between the two
      systems and their malfunction that may underlie some neurological diseases.
      Although much remains to be investigated, these new discoveries have changed our 
      understanding of mechanisms underlying CNS immune privilege and CNS drainage.
      Future studies should explore the communications between the glymphatic system
      and meningeal lymphatics in CNS disorders and develop new therapeutic modalities 
      targeting these systems.

TI  - Oligodendroglia: metabolic supporters of neurons.
PG  - 3271-3280

LID - 90610 [pii]
AB  - Oligodendrocytes are glial cells that populate the entire CNS after they have
      differentiated from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. From birth onward,
      oligodendrocytes initiate wrapping of neuronal axons with a multilamellar lipid
      structure called myelin. Apart from their well-established function in action
      potential propagation, more recent data indicate that oligodendrocytes are
      essential for providing metabolic support to neurons. Oligodendrocytes transfer
      energy metabolites to neurons through cytoplasmic "myelinic" channels and
      monocarboxylate transporters, which allow for the fast delivery of
      short-carbon-chain energy metabolites like pyruvate and lactate to neurons. These
      substrates are metabolized and contribute to ATP synthesis in neurons. This
      Review will discuss our current understanding of this metabolic supportive
      function of oligodendrocytes and its potential impact in human neurodegenerative 
      disease and related animal models.

AB  - Microglia are brain-resident myeloid cells that mediate key functions to support 
      the CNS. Microglia express a wide range of receptors that act as molecular
      sensors, which recognize exogenous or endogenous CNS insults and initiate an
      immune response. In addition to their classical immune cell function, microglia
      act as guardians of the brain by promoting phagocytic clearance and providing
      trophic support to ensure tissue repair and maintain cerebral homeostasis.
      Conditions associated with loss of homeostasis or tissue changes induce several
      dynamic microglial processes, including changes of cellular morphology, surface
      phenotype, secretory mediators, and proliferative responses (referred to as an
      "activated state"). Activated microglia represent a common pathological feature
      of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Cumulative evidence suggests that microglial inflammatory activity in AD is
      increased while microglial-mediated clearance mechanisms are compromised.
      Microglia are perpetually engaged in a mutual interaction with the surrounding
      environment in CNS; thus, diverse microglial reactions at different disease
      stages may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention and modification of
      inflammatory activities. In this Review, the role of microglia in the
      pathogenesis of AD and the modulation of microglia activity as a therapeutic
      modality will be discussed.

AB  - Transplantation of human neural stem cells has long been proposed as a potential 
      strategy for treating CNS injury and disease; however, application of this
      approach has had limited therapeutic benefit. Yet compared with rodents and other
      experimental mammals, humans have a relatively long time window for development
      of the brain and spinal cord. In this issue of the JCI, Lu and colleagues asked
      whether the results of neural stem cell transplantation might be improved by
      accommodating the protracted development of human neural cells. They used a
      rodent model of spinal cord injury, in which human neural progenitor cells were
      transplanted at the site of damage. While there was no observable benefit at
      early time points after transplantation, both anatomic and functional
      improvements in the injured animals emerged over the course of a year. In
      particular, the human progenitor cell population differentiated, matured, and
      integrated into the rodent spinal cords over a time frame that aligned with the
      normal development of these cells in humans. This study demonstrates that neural 
      stem cells may offer significant therapeutic benefit after CNS injury; however,
      this process may take time and demands patience on the part of investigators,
      patients, and clinicians alike.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) differentiate into both neurons and glia, and strategies
      using human NSCs have the potential to restore function following spinal cord
      injury (SCI). However, the time period of maturation for human NSCs in adult
      injured CNS is not well defined, posing fundamental questions about the design
      and implementation of NSC-based therapies. This work assessed human H9 NSCs that 
      were implanted into sites of SCI in immunodeficient rats over a period of 1.5
      years. Notably, grafts showed evidence of continued maturation over the entire
      assessment period. Markers of neuronal maturity were first expressed 3 months
      after grafting. However, neurogenesis, neuronal pruning, and neuronal enlargement
      continued over the next year, while total graft size remained stable over time.
      Axons emerged early from grafts in very high numbers, and half of these
      projections persisted by 1.5 years. Mature astrocyte markers first appeared after
      6 months, while more mature oligodendrocyte markers were not present until 1 year
      after grafting. Astrocytes slowly migrated from grafts. Notably, functional
      recovery began more than 1 year after grafting. Thus, human NSCs retain an
      intrinsic human rate of maturation, despite implantation into the injured rodent 
      spinal cord, yet they support delayed functional recovery, a finding of great
      importance in planning human clinical trials.

TI  - Treg depletion potentiates checkpoint inhibition in claudin-low breast cancer.
PG  - 3472-3483
LID - 10.1172/JCI90499 [doi]
LID - 90499 [pii]
AB  - Claudin-low breast cancer is an aggressive subtype that confers poor prognosis
      and is found largely within the clinical triple-negative group of breast cancer
      patients. Here, we have shown that intrinsic and immune cell gene signatures
      distinguish the claudin-low subtype clinically as well as in mouse models of
      other breast cancer subtypes. Despite adaptive immune cell infiltration in
      claudin-low tumors, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitory antibodies
      against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death
      receptor 1 (PD-1) were ineffective in controlling tumor growth. CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs 
      represented a large proportion of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in
      claudin-low tumors, and Tregs isolated from tumor-bearing mice were able to
      suppress effector T cell responses. Tregs in the tumor microenvironment highly
      expressed PD-1 and were recruited partly through tumor generation of the
      chemokine CXCL12. Antitumor efficacy required stringent Treg depletion combined
      with checkpoint inhibition; delays in tumor growth were not observed using
      therapies that modestly diminished the number of Tregs in the tumor
      microenvironment. This study provides evidence that the recruitment of Tregs to
      the tumor microenvironment inhibits an effective antitumor immune response and
      highlights early Treg recruitment as a possible mechanism for the lack of
      response to immune checkpoint blockade antibodies in specific subtypes of cancer 
      that are heavily infiltrated with adaptive immune cells.

TI  - Peripherally derived FGF21 promotes remyelination in the central nervous system.
PG  - 3496-3509
LID - 10.1172/JCI94337 [doi]
LID - 94337 [pii]
AB  - Demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) leads to severe neurological
      deficits that can be partially reversed by spontaneous remyelination. Because the
      CNS is isolated from the peripheral milieu by the blood-brain barrier,
      remyelination is thought to be controlled by the CNS microenvironment. However,
      in this work we found that factors derived from peripheral tissue leak into the
      CNS after injury and promote remyelination in a murine model of toxin-induced
      demyelination. Mechanistically, leakage of circulating fibroblast growth factor
      21 (FGF21), which is predominantly expressed by the pancreas, drives
      proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) through interactions with
      beta-klotho, an essential coreceptor of FGF21. We further confirmed that human
      OPCs expressed beta-klotho and proliferated in response to FGF21 in vitro.
      Vascular barrier disruption is a common feature of many CNS disorders; thus, our 
      findings reveal a potentially important role for the peripheral milieu in
      promoting CNS regeneration.

AB  - Chromatin modification influences gene expression by either repressing or
      activating genes, depending on the specific histone mark. Chromatin structure can
      also influence alternative splicing of transcripts; however, the mechanisms by
      which epigenetic marks influence splicing are poorly understood. A report in the 
      current issue of the JCI highlights the biological importance of the coordinated 
      control of alternative pre-mRNA splicing by chromatin structure and
      transcriptional elongation. Yuan et al. found that mutation of the histone methyl
      transferase SEDT2 affects alternative splicing fates of several key regulatory
      genes, including those involved in Wnt signaling. As a consequence, loss of SEDT2
      in the intestine aggravated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling effects, thereby leading
      to colorectal cancer.

AB  - Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) frequently relapses after complete remission
      (CR), necessitating improved detection and phenotypic characterization of
      treatment-resistant residual disease. In this work, we have optimized droplet
      digital PCR to broadly measure mutated alleles of recurrently mutated genes in CR
      marrows of AML patients at levels as low as 0.002% variant allele frequency. Most
      gene mutations persisted in CR, albeit at highly variable and gene-dependent
      levels. The majority of AML cases demonstrated residual aberrant oligoclonal
      hematopoiesis. Importantly, we detected very rare cells (as few as 1 in 15,000)
      that were genomically similar to the dominant blast populations at diagnosis and 
      were fully clonally represented at relapse, identifying these rare cells as one
      common source of AML relapse. Clinically, the mutant allele burden was associated
      with overall survival in AML, and our findings narrow the repertoire of gene
      mutations useful in minimal residual disease-based prognostication in AML.
      Overall, this work delineates rare cell populations that cause AML relapse, with 
      direct implications for AML research directions and strategies to improve AML
      therapies and outcome.

TI  - Histone methyltransferase SETD2 modulates alternative splicing to inhibit
      intestinal tumorigenesis.
PG  - 3375-3391
LID - 10.1172/JCI94292 [doi]
LID - 94292 [pii]
AB  - The histone H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 is frequently mutated or deleted in a
      variety of human tumors. Nevertheless, the role of SETD2 loss in oncogenesis
      remains largely undefined. Here, we found that SETD2 counteracts Wnt signaling
      and its inactivation promotes intestinal tumorigenesis in mouse models of
      colorectal cancer (CRC). SETD2 was not required for intestinal homeostasis under 
      steady state; however, upon irradiation, genetic inactivation of Setd2 in mouse
      intestinal epithelium facilitated the self-renewal of intestinal stem/progenitor 
      cells as well as tissue regeneration. Furthermore, depletion of SETD2 enhanced
      the susceptibility to tumorigenesis in the context of dysregulated Wnt signaling.
      Mechanistic characterizations indicated that SETD2 downregulation affects the
      alternative splicing of a subset of genes implicated in tumorigenesis.
      Importantly, we uncovered that SETD2 ablation reduces intron retention of
      dishevelled segment polarity protein 2 (DVL2) pre-mRNA, which would otherwise be 
      degraded by nonsense-mediated decay, thereby augmenting Wnt signaling. The
      signaling cascades mediated by SETD2 were further substantiated by a CRC patient 
      cohort analysis. Together, our studies highlight SETD2 as an integral regulator
      of Wnt signaling through epigenetic regulation of RNA processing during tissue
      regeneration and tumorigenesis.

TI  - YAP/TAZ regulates sprouting angiogenesis and vascular barrier maturation.
PG  - 3441-3461
LID - 10.1172/JCI93825 [doi]
LID - 93825 [pii]
AB  - Angiogenesis is a multistep process that requires coordinated migration,
      proliferation, and junction formation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to form
      new vessel branches in response to growth stimuli. Major intracellular signaling 
      pathways that regulate angiogenesis have been well elucidated, but key
      transcriptional regulators that mediate these signaling pathways and control EC
      behaviors are only beginning to be understood. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ, a
      transcriptional coactivator that acts as an end effector of Hippo signaling, is
      critical for sprouting angiogenesis and vascular barrier formation and
      maturation. In mice, endothelial-specific deletion of Yap/Taz led to blunted-end,
      aneurysm-like tip ECs with fewer and dysmorphic filopodia at the vascular front, 
      a hyper-pruned vascular network, reduced and disarranged distributions of tight
      and adherens junction proteins, disrupted barrier integrity, subsequent
      hemorrhage in growing retina and brain vessels, and reduced pathological
      choroidal neovascularization. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ activates actin
      cytoskeleton remodeling, an important component of filopodia formation and
      junction assembly. Moreover, YAP/TAZ coordinates EC proliferation and metabolic
      activity by upregulating MYC signaling. Overall, these results show that YAP/TAZ 
      plays multifaceted roles for EC behaviors, proliferation, junction assembly, and 
      metabolism in sprouting angiogenesis and barrier formation and maturation and
      could be a potential therapeutic target for treating neovascular diseases.

TI  - Clinical and immunological responses after CD30-specific chimeric antigen
      receptor-redirected lymphocytes.
PG  - 3462-3471

AB  - BACKGROUND: Targeting CD30 with monoclonal antibodies in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)
      and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) has had profound clinical success.
      However, adverse events, mainly mediated by the toxin component of the conjugated
      antibodies, cause treatment discontinuation in many patients. Targeting CD30 with
      T cells expressing a CD30-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) may reduce the
      side effects and augment antitumor activity. METHODS: We conducted a phase I dose
      escalation study in which 9 patients with relapsed/refractory HL or ALCL were
      infused with autologous T cells that were gene-modified with a retroviral vector 
      to express the CD30-specific CAR (CD30.CAR-Ts) encoding the CD28 costimulatory
      endodomain. Three dose levels, from 0.2 x 108 to 2 x 108 CD30.CAR-Ts/m2, were
      infused without a conditioning regimen. All other therapy for malignancy was
      discontinued at least 4 weeks before CD30.CAR-T infusion. Seven patients had
      previously experienced disease progression while being treated with brentuximab. 
      RESULTS: No toxicities attributable to CD30.CAR-Ts were observed. Of 7 patients
      with relapsed HL, 1 entered complete response (CR) lasting more than 2.5 years
      after the second infusion of CD30.CAR-Ts, 1 remained in continued CR for almost 2
      years, and 3 had transient stable disease. Of 2 patients with ALCL, 1 had a CR
      that persisted 9 months after the fourth infusion of CD30.CAR-Ts. CD30.CAR-T
      expansion in peripheral blood peaked 1 week after infusion, and CD30.CAR-Ts
      remained detectable for over 6 weeks. Although CD30 may also be expressed by
      normal activated T cells, no patients developed impaired virus-specific immunity.
      CONCLUSION: CD30.CAR-Ts are safe and can lead to clinical responses in patients
      with HL and ALCL, indicating that further assessment of this therapy is
      warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01316146. FUNDING: National

TI  - The FOXN3-NEAT1-SIN3A repressor complex promotes progression of hormonally

AB  - The pathophysiological function of the forkhead transcription factor FOXN3
      remains to be explored. Here we report that FOXN3 is a transcriptional repressor 
      that is physically associated with the SIN3A repressor complex in estrogen
      receptor-positive (ER+) cells. RNA immunoprecipitation-coupled high-throughput
      sequencing identified that NEAT1, an estrogen-inducible long noncoding RNA, is
      required for FOXN3 interactions with the SIN3A complex. ChIP-Seq and deep
      sequencing of RNA genomic targets revealed that the FOXN3-NEAT1-SIN3A complex
      represses genes including GATA3 that are critically involved in
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We demonstrated that the
      FOXN3-NEAT1-SIN3A complex promotes EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells in
      vitro as well as dissemination and metastasis of breast cancer in vivo.
      Interestingly, the FOXN3-NEAT1-SIN3A complex transrepresses ER itself, forming a 
      negative-feedback loop in transcription regulation. Elevation of both FOXN3 and
      NEAT1 expression during breast cancer progression corresponded to diminished
      GATA3 expression, and high levels of FOXN3 and NEAT1 strongly correlated with
      higher histological grades and poor prognosis. Our experiments uncovered that
      NEAT1 is a facultative component of the SIN3A complex, shedding light on the
      mechanistic actions of NEAT1 and the SIN3A complex. Further, our study identified
      the ERalpha-NEAT1-FOXN3/NEAT1/SIN3A-GATA3 axis that is implicated in breast
      cancer metastasis, providing a mechanistic insight into the pathophysiological
      function of FOXN3.

      excessive neutrophilic responses.

LID - 90848 [pii]
AB  - Fully activated innate immune cells are required for effective responses to
      infection, but their prompt deactivation and removal are essential for limiting
      tissue damage. Here, we have identified a critical role for the prolyl
      hydroxylase enzyme Phd2 in maintaining the balance between appropriate,
      predominantly neutrophil-mediated pathogen clearance and resolution of the innate
      immune response. We demonstrate that myeloid-specific loss of Phd2 resulted in an
      exaggerated inflammatory response to Streptococcus pneumonia, with increases in
      neutrophil motility, functional capacity, and survival. These enhanced neutrophil
      responses were dependent upon increases in glycolytic flux and glycogen stores.
      Systemic administration of a HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor replicated the
      Phd2-deficient phenotype of delayed inflammation resolution. Together, these data
      identify Phd2 as the dominant HIF-hydroxylase in neutrophils under normoxic
      conditions and link intrinsic regulation of glycolysis and glycogen stores to the
      resolution of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses. These results
      demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting metabolic pathways in the
      treatment of inflammatory disease.

TI  - The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine causes weight gain by targeting serotonin
      receptor 2C.

AB  - Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine often induce excessive weight gain and
      type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms underlying these drug-induced metabolic 
      perturbations remain poorly understood. Here, we used an experimental model that 
      reproduces olanzapine-induced hyperphagia and obesity in female C57BL/6 mice. We 
      found that olanzapine treatment acutely increased food intake, impaired glucose
      tolerance, and altered physical activity and energy expenditure in mice.
      Furthermore, olanzapine-induced hyperphagia and weight gain were blunted in mice 
      lacking the serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C). Finally, we showed that treatment with
      the HTR2C-specific agonist lorcaserin suppressed olanzapine-induced hyperphagia
      and weight gain. Lorcaserin treatment also improved glucose tolerance in
      olanzapine-fed mice. Collectively, our studies suggest that olanzapine exerts
      some of its untoward metabolic effects via antagonism of HTR2C.

AB  - The EGFR belongs to the well-studied ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases.
      EGFR is activated by numerous endogenous ligands that promote cellular growth,
      proliferation, and tissue regeneration. In the present study, we have
      demonstrated a role for EGFR and its natural ligand, epiregulin (EREG), in pain
      processing. We show that inhibition of EGFR with clinically available compounds
      strongly reduced nocifensive behavior in mouse models of inflammatory and chronic
      pain. EREG-mediated activation of EGFR enhanced nociception through a mechanism
      involving the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Moreover,
      EREG application potentiated capsaicin-induced calcium influx in a subset of
      sensory neurons. Both the EGFR and EREG genes displayed a genetic association
      with the development of chronic pain in several clinical cohorts of
      temporomandibular disorder. Thus, EGFR and EREG may be suitable therapeutic
      targets for persistent pain conditions.

TI  - Macrophage-derived IL-10 mediates mucosal repair by epithelial WISP-1 signaling.
PG  - 3510-3520
LID - 10.1172/JCI90229 [doi]
LID - 90229 [pii]
AB  - In response to injury, epithelial cells migrate and proliferate to cover denuded 
      mucosal surfaces and repair the barrier defect. This process is orchestrated by
      dynamic crosstalk between immune cells and the epithelium; however, the
      mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that IL-10
      was rapidly induced following intestinal mucosal injury and was required for
      optimal intestinal mucosal wound closure. Conditional deletion of IL-10
      specifically in CD11c-expressing cells in vivo implicated macrophages as a
      critical innate immune contributor to IL-10-induced wound closure. Consistent
      with these findings, wound closure in T cell- and B cell-deficient Rag1-/- mice
      was unimpaired, demonstrating that adaptive immune cells are not absolutely
      required for this process. Further, following mucosal injury, macrophage-derived 
      IL-10 resulted in epithelial cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
      activation and subsequent synthesis and secretion of the pro-repair
      WNT1-inducible signaling protein 1 (WISP-1). WISP-1 induced epithelial cell
      proliferation and wound closure by activating epithelial pro-proliferative
      pathways. These findings define the involvement of macrophages in regulating an
      IL-10/CREB/WISP-1 signaling axis, with broad implications in linking innate
      immune activation to mucosal wound repair.

AB  - Thiazide diuretics are among the most widely used treatments for hypertension,
      but thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH), a clinically significant adverse effect,
      is poorly understood. Here, we have studied the phenotypic and genetic
      characteristics of patients hospitalized with TIH. In a cohort of 109 TIH
      patients, those with severe TIH displayed an extended phenotype of intravascular 
      volume expansion, increased free water reabsorption, urinary prostaglandin E2
      excretion, and reduced excretion of serum chloride, magnesium, zinc, and
      antidiuretic hormone. GWAS in a separate cohort of 48 TIH patients and 2,922
      controls from the 1958 British birth cohort identified an additional 14 regions
      associated with TIH. We identified a suggestive association with a variant in
      SLCO2A1, which encodes a prostaglandin transporter in the distal nephron.
      Resequencing of SLCO2A1 revealed a nonsynonymous variant, rs34550074 (p.A396T),
      and association with this SNP was replicated in a second cohort of TIH cases. TIH
      patients with the p.A396T variant demonstrated increased urinary excretion of
      prostaglandin E2 and metabolites. Moreover, the SLCO2A1 phospho-mimic p.A396E
      showed loss of transporter function in vitro. These findings indicate that the
      phenotype of TIH involves a more extensive metabolic derangement than previously 
      recognized. We propose one mechanism underlying TIH development in a subgroup of 
      patients in which SLCO2A1 regulation is altered.

AB  - Mutations in the human NBEAL2 gene cause gray platelet syndrome (GPS), a bleeding
      diathesis characterized by a lack of alpha granules in platelets. The functions
      of the NBEAL2 protein have not been explored outside platelet biology, but there 
      are reports of increased frequency of infection and abnormal neutrophil
      morphology in patients with GPS. We therefore investigated the role of NBEAL2 in 
      immunity by analyzing the phenotype of Nbeal2-deficient mice. We found profound
      abnormalities in the Nbeal2-deficient immune system, particularly in the function
      of neutrophils and NK cells. Phenotyping of Nbeal2-deficient neutrophils showed a
      severe reduction in granule contents across all granule subsets. Despite this,
      Nbeal2-deficient neutrophils had an enhanced phagocyte respiratory burst relative
      to Nbeal2-expressing neutrophils. This respiratory burst was associated with
      increased expression of cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase complex.
      Nbeal2-deficient NK cells were also dysfunctional and showed reduced
      degranulation. These abnormalities were associated with increased susceptibility 
      to both bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus) and viral (murine CMV) infection in
      vivo. These results define an essential role for NBEAL2 in mammalian immunity.

AB  - Varicella zoster virus (VZV) typically causes chickenpox upon primary infection. 
      In rare cases, VZV can give rise to life-threatening disease in otherwise healthy
      people, but the immunological basis for this remains unexplained. We report 4
      cases of acute severe VZV infection affecting the central nervous system or the
      lungs in unrelated, otherwise healthy children who are heterozygous for rare
      missense mutations in POLR3A (one patient), POLR3C (one patient), or both (two
      patients). POLR3A and POLR3C encode subunits of RNA polymerase III. Leukocytes
      from all 4 patients tested exhibited poor IFN induction in response to synthetic 
      or VZV-derived DNA. Moreover, leukocytes from 3 of the patients displayed
      defective IFN production upon VZV infection and reduced control of VZV
      replication. These phenotypes were rescued by transduction with relevant WT
      alleles. This work demonstrates that monogenic or digenic POLR3A and POLR3C
      deficiencies confer increased susceptibility to severe VZV disease in otherwise
      healthy children, providing evidence for an essential role of a DNA sensor in
      human immunity.

TI  - 27-Hydroxycholesterol induces hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and

PG  - 3392-3401
LID - 10.1172/JCI94027 [doi]
LID - 94027 [pii]
AB  - Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is induced during pregnancy to support rapid
      expansion of maternal blood volume. EMH activation requires hematopoietic stem
      cell (HSC) proliferation and mobilization, processes that depend upon estrogen
      receptor alpha (ERalpha) in HSCs. Here we show that treating mice with estradiol 
      to model estradiol increases during pregnancy induced HSC proliferation in the
      bone marrow but not HSC mobilization. Treatment with the alternative ERalpha
      ligand 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) induced ERalpha-dependent HSC mobilization
      and EMH but not HSC division in the bone marrow. During pregnancy, 27HC levels
      increased in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as a result of CYP27A1, a
      cholesterol hydroxylase. Cyp27a1-deficient mice had significantly reduced 27HC
      levels, HSC mobilization, and EMH during pregnancy but normal bone marrow
      hematopoiesis and EMH in response to bleeding or G-CSF treatment. Distinct
      hematopoietic stresses thus induce EMH through different mechanisms. Two
      different ERalpha ligands, estradiol and 27HC, work together to promote EMH
      during pregnancy, revealing a collaboration of hormonal and metabolic mechanisms 
      as well as a physiological function for 27HC in normal mice.

TI  - Activin-A enhances mTOR signaling to promote aberrant chondrogenesis in

PG  - 3339-3352
LID - 10.1172/JCI93521 [doi]
LID - 93521 [pii]
AB  - Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare and intractable disease
      characterized by extraskeletal bone formation through endochondral ossification. 
      Patients with FOP harbor point mutations in ACVR1, a type I receptor for BMPs.
      Although mutated ACVR1 (FOP-ACVR1) has been shown to render hyperactivity in BMP 
      signaling, we and others have uncovered a mechanism by which FOP-ACVR1
      mistransduces BMP signaling in response to Activin-A, a molecule that normally
      transduces TGF-beta signaling. Although Activin-A evokes enhanced chondrogenesis 
      in vitro and heterotopic ossification (HO) in vivo, the underlying mechanisms
      have yet to be revealed. To this end, we developed a high-throughput screening
      (HTS) system using FOP patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (FOP-iPSCs)
      to identify pivotal pathways in enhanced chondrogenesis that are initiated by
      Activin-A. In a screen of 6,809 small-molecule compounds, we identified mTOR
      signaling as a critical pathway for the aberrant chondrogenesis of mesenchymal
      stromal cells derived from FOP-iPSCs (FOP-iMSCs). Two different HO mouse models, 
      an FOP model mouse expressing FOP-ACVR1 and an FOP-iPSC-based HO model mouse,
      revealed critical roles for mTOR signaling in vivo. Moreover, we identified
      ENPP2, an enzyme that generates lysophosphatidic acid, as a linker of FOP-ACVR1
      and mTOR signaling in chondrogenesis. These results uncovered the crucial role of
      the Activin-A/FOP-ACVR1/ENPP2/mTOR axis in FOP pathogenesis.

TI  - Parathyroid hormone regulates fates of murine osteoblast precursors in vivo.
PG  - 3327-3338
LID - 10.1172/JCI91699 [doi]
LID - 91699 [pii]
AB  - Teriparatide, a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone (PTH), is the only
      approved treatment for osteoporosis that increases the rate of bone formation.
      Teriparatide increases osteoblast numbers by suppressing osteoblast apoptosis and
      activating bone-lining cells. No direct evidence for teriparatide's actions on
      early cells of the osteoblast lineage has been demonstrated. Here, we have
      employed a lineage-tracing strategy that uses a tamoxifen-dependent,
      promoter-driven cre to mark early cells of the osteoblast lineage in adult mice. 
      We show that teriparatide increases the numbers of osteoblast precursors and
      drives their differentiation into mature osteoblasts. Unexpectedly, following
      withdrawal of teriparatide therapy, bone marrow adipocytes increased dramatically
      in number. Some of these adipocytes derived from cells marked by Sox9-cre
      expression weeks earlier. Continued therapy with teriparatide prevented the
      appearance of adipocytes. Selective, inducible deletion of the PTH receptor in
      Sox9-cre cells demonstrated that PTH receptor expression is required for
      teriparatide-mediated increases in early osteoblast precursors. The increase in
      early precursors after teriparatide administration was associated with robust
      suppression of precursor apoptosis without affecting their rate of proliferation.
      Thus, teriparatide increases the numbers of early cells of the osteoblast
      lineage, hastens their differentiation into osteoblasts, and suppresses their
      differentiation into adipocytes in vivo.

PG  - 3220-3229

LID - 90604 [pii]
AB  - Microglia are the main resident macrophage population of the CNS and perform
      numerous functions required for CNS development, homeostasis, immunity, and
      repair. Many lines of evidence also indicate that dysregulation of microglia
      contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases.
      These observations provide a compelling argument to more clearly define the
      mechanisms that control microglia identity and function in health and disease. In
      this Review, we present a conceptual framework for how different classes of
      transcription factors interact to select and activate regulatory elements that
      control microglia development and their responses to internal and external
      signals. We then describe functions of specific transcription factors in normal
      and pathological contexts and conclude with a consideration of open questions to 
      be addressed in the future.

TI  - GATA4 loss of function in liver cancer impedes precursor to hepatocyte
      transition.
PG  - 3527-3542
LID - 10.1172/JCI93488 [doi]
LID - 93488 [pii]
AB  - The most frequent chromosomal structural loss in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      is of the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p). Genes on the remaining homologous
      chromosome, however, are not recurrently mutated, and the identity of key 8p
      tumor-suppressor genes (TSG) is unknown. In this work, analysis of minimal
      commonly deleted 8p segments to identify candidate TSG implicated GATA4, a master
      transcription factor driver of hepatocyte epithelial lineage fate. In a murine
      model, liver-conditional deletion of 1 Gata4 allele to model the
      haploinsufficiency seen in HCC produced enlarged livers with a gene expression
      profile of persistent precursor proliferation and failed hepatocyte epithelial
      differentiation. HCC mimicked this gene expression profile, even in cases that
      were morphologically classified as well differentiated. HCC with intact
      chromosome 8p also featured GATA4 loss of function via GATA4 germline mutations
      that abrogated GATA4 interactions with a coactivator, MED12, or by inactivating
      mutations directly in GATA4 coactivators, including ARID1A. GATA4 reintroduction 
      into GATA4-haploinsufficient HCC cells or ARID1A reintroduction into
      ARID1A-mutant/GATA4-intact HCC cells activated hundreds of hepatocyte genes and
      quenched the proliferative precursor program. Thus, disruption of GATA4-mediated 
      transactivation in HCC suppresses hepatocyte epithelial differentiation to
      sustain replicative precursor phenotype.

AB  - M2 macrophages, innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2s), eosinophils, Tregs, and
      invariant NK T cells (iNKT cells) all help to control adipose tissue
      inflammation, while M1 macrophages, TNF, and other inflammatory cytokines drive
      inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. Stromal cells regulate leukocyte 
      responses in lymph nodes, but the role of stromal cells in adipose tissue
      inflammation is unknown. PDGFRalpha+ stromal cells are major producers of IL-33
      in adipose tissue. Here, we show that mesenchymal cadherin-11 modulates stromal
      fibroblast function. Cadherin-11-deficient mice displayed increased stromal
      production of IL-33, with concomitant enhancements in ILC2s and M2 macrophages
      that helped control adipose tissue inflammation. Higher expression levels of
      IL-33 in cadherin-11-deficient mice mediated ILC2 activation, resulting in higher
      IL-13 expression levels and M2 macrophage expansion in adipose tissue. Consistent
      with reduced adipose tissue inflammation, cadherin-11-deficient mice were
      protected from obesity-induced glucose intolerance and adipose tissue fibrosis.
      Importantly, anti-cadherin-11 mAb blockade similarly improved inflammation and
      glycemic control in obese WT mice. These results suggest that stromal fibroblasts
      expressing cadherin-11 regulate adipose tissue inflammation and thus highlight
      cadherin-11 as a potential therapeutic target for the management of obesity.

AB  - Asthma is associated with exposure to a wide variety of allergens and adjuvants. 
      The extent to which overlap exists between the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
      triggered by these various agents is poorly understood, but it might explain the 
      differential responsiveness of patients to specific therapies. In particular, it 
      is unclear why some, but not all, patients benefit from blockade of TNF. Here, we
      characterized signaling pathways triggered by distinct types of adjuvants during 
      allergic sensitization. Mice sensitized to an innocuous protein using TLR ligands
      or house dust extracts as adjuvants developed mixed eosinophilic and neutrophilic
      airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) following allergen
      challenge, whereas mice sensitized using proteases as adjuvants developed
      predominantly eosinophilic inflammation and AHR. TLR ligands, but not proteases, 
      induced TNF during allergic sensitization. TNF signaled through airway epithelial
      cells to reprogram them and promote Th2, but not Th17, development in lymph
      nodes. TNF was also required during the allergen challenge phase for neutrophilic
      and eosinophilic inflammation. In contrast, TNF was dispensable for allergic
      airway disease in a protease-mediated model of asthma. These findings might help 
      to explain why TNF blockade improves lung function in only some patients with
      asthma.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions present diverse challenges for repair
      strategies. Anatomically complete injuries require restoration of neural
      connectivity across lesions. Anatomically incomplete injuries may benefit from
      augmentation of spontaneous circuit reorganization. Here, we review SCI cell
      biology, which varies considerably across three different lesion-related tissue
      compartments: (a) non-neural lesion core, (b) astrocyte scar border, and (c)
      surrounding spared but reactive neural tissue. After SCI, axon growth and circuit
      reorganization are determined by neuron-cell-autonomous mechanisms and by
      interactions among neurons, glia, and immune and other cells. These interactions 
      are shaped by both the presence and the absence of growth-modulating molecules,
      which vary markedly in different lesion compartments. The emerging understanding 
      of how SCI cell biology differs across lesion compartments is fundamental to
      developing rationally targeted repair strategies.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder that is
      characterized by loss of motor neurons and shows clinical, pathological, and
      genetic overlap with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Activated microglia are a
      universal feature of ALS/FTD pathology; however, their role in disease
      pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. The recent discovery that ORF 72 on
      chromosome 9 (C9orf72), the gene most commonly mutated in ALS/FTD, has an
      important role in myeloid cells opened the possibility that altered microglial
      function plays an active role in disease. This Review highlights the contribution
      of microglia to ALS/FTD pathogenesis, discusses the connection between
      autoimmunity and ALS/FTD, and explores the possibility that C9orf72 and other
      ALS/FTD genes may have a "dual effect" on both neuronal and myeloid cell function
      that could explain a shared propensity for altered systemic immunity and
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - Microglia in prion diseases.
PG  - 3230-3239
LID - 10.1172/JCI90605 [doi]
LID - 90605 [pii]
AB  - Prion diseases are a group of progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorders
      characterized by deposition of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) in the CNS. This
      deposition is accompanied by neuronal loss, spongiform change, astrogliosis, and 
      conspicuous microglial activation. Here, we argue that microglia play an overall 
      neuroprotective role in prion pathogenesis. Several microglia-related molecules, 
      such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the complement system, cytokines, chemokines,
      inflammatory regulators, and phagocytosis mediators, are involved in prion
      pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the microglial
      response to prion infection are largely unknown. Consequently, we lack a
      comprehensive understanding of the regulatory network of microglial activation.
      On the positive side, recent findings suggest that therapeutic strategies
      modulating microglial activation and function may have merit in prion disease.
      Moreover, studies on the role of microglia in prion disease could deepen our
      understanding of neuroinflammation in a broad range of neurodegenerative
      disorders.

AB  - Microglial cells are the resident tissue macrophages of the CNS and are widely
      recognized for their immune surveillance of the healthy CNS. In addition to this 
      well-accepted function, recent findings point to major roles for microglia in
      instructing and regulating the proper function of the neuronal networks in the
      adult CNS, but these cells are also involved in creating neuronal networks by
      orchestrating construction of the whole network during development. In this
      Review, we highlight recent findings about the steady-state functions of
      microglial cells, the factors that are important for physiological microglial
      function, and how microglia help to maintain tissue homeostasis in the CNS.

TI  - Autoreactive T cells in type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 2881-2891

LID - 94549 [pii]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes severe loss of 
      pancreatic beta cells. Autoreactive T cells are key mediators of beta cell
      destruction. Studies of organ donors with T1D that have examined T cells in
      pancreas, the diabetogenic insulitis lesion, and lymphoid tissues have revealed a
      broad repertoire of target antigens and T cell receptor (TCR) usage, with initial
      evidence of public TCR sequences that are shared by individuals with T1D.
      Neoepitopes derived from post-translational modifications of native antigens are 
      emerging as novel targets that are more likely to evade self-tolerance. Further
      studies will determine whether T cell responses to neoepitopes are major disease 
      drivers that could impact prediction, prevention, and therapy. This Review
      provides an overview of recent progress in our knowledge of autoreactive T cells 
      that has emerged from experimental and clinical research as well as pathology
      investigations.

LID - 95839 [pii]
AB  - Proteinopathies are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins,
      which ultimately interfere with normal cell function. While neurological
      diseases, such as Huntington disease and Alzheimer disease, are
      well-characterized proteinopathies, cardiac diseases have recently been
      associated with alterations in proteostasis. In this issue of the JCI, Fang and
      colleagues demonstrate that mice with cardiac-specific deficiency of the
      co-chaperone protein BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) develop dilated
      cardiomyopathy that is associated with a destabilization of small HSPs as the
      result of a disrupted interaction between BAG3 and HSP70. Together, the results
      of this study suggest that strategies to upregulate BAG3 during cardiac
      dysfunction may be beneficial.

TI  - Loss-of-function mutations in co-chaperone BAG3 destabilize small HSPs and cause 
      cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 3189-3200
LID - 10.1172/JCI94310 [doi]
LID - 94310 [pii]
AB  - Defective protein quality control (PQC) systems are implicated in multiple
      diseases. Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones play a central role in
      functioning PQC. Constant mechanical and metabolic stress in cardiomyocytes
      places great demand on the PQC system. Mutation and downregulation of the
      co-chaperone protein BCL-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) are associated with
      cardiac myopathy and heart failure, and a BAG3 E455K mutation leads to dilated
      cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the role of BAG3 in the heart and the mechanisms
      by which the E455K mutation leads to DCM remain obscure. Here, we found that
      cardiac-specific Bag3-KO and E455K-knockin mice developed DCM. Comparable
      phenotypes in the 2 mutants demonstrated that the E455K mutation resulted in loss
      of function. Further experiments revealed that the E455K mutation disrupted the
      interaction between BAG3 and HSP70. In both mutants, decreased levels of small
      heat shock proteins (sHSPs) were observed, and a subset of proteins required for 
      cardiomyocyte function was enriched in the insoluble fraction. Together, these
      observations suggest that interaction between BAG3 and HSP70 is essential for
      BAG3 to stabilize sHSPs and maintain cardiomyocyte protein homeostasis. Our
      results provide insight into heart failure caused by defects in BAG3 pathways and
      suggest that increasing BAG3 protein levels may be of therapeutic benefit in
      heart failure.

TI  - Thrombin promotes diet-induced obesity through fibrin-driven inflammation.
PG  - 3152-3166

LID - 92744 [pii]
AB  - Obesity promotes a chronic inflammatory and hypercoagulable state that drives
      cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and several
      cancers. Elevated thrombin activity underlies obesity-linked thromboembolic
      events, but the mechanistic links between the thrombin/fibrin(ogen) axis and
      obesity-associated pathologies are incompletely understood. In this work,
      immunohistochemical studies identified extravascular fibrin deposits within white
      adipose tissue and liver as distinct features of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD)
      as well as obese patients. Fibgamma390-396A mice carrying a mutant form of
      fibrinogen incapable of binding leukocyte alphaMbeta2-integrin were protected
      from HFD-induced weight gain and elevated adiposity. Fibgamma390-396A mice had
      markedly diminished systemic, adipose, and hepatic inflammation with reduced
      macrophage counts within white adipose tissue, as well as near-complete
      protection from development of fatty liver disease and glucose dysmetabolism.
      Homozygous thrombomodulin-mutant ThbdPro mice, which have elevated thrombin
      procoagulant function, gained more weight and developed exacerbated fatty liver
      disease when fed a HFD compared with WT mice. In contrast, treatment with
      dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, limited HFD-induced obesity development 
      and suppressed progression of sequelae in mice with established obesity.
      Collectively, these data provide proof of concept that targeting thrombin or
      fibrin(ogen) may limit pathologies in obese patients.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the glia limitans serve to prevent the
      migration of cells and other large molecules from the blood into the CNS.
      Neuroinflammatory diseases are characterized by disruption of the BBB and
      increased leukocyte infiltration into the CNS. In this issue of the JCI, Horng
      and colleagues demonstrate that astrocytes of the glia limitans induce tight
      junction formation in response to inflammatory cues, thereby tightening the
      border to limit the number of activated T cells infiltrating the CNS. Moreover,
      preventing the formation of this inducible barrier in mice increased disease
      severity in models of neuroinflammation. Together, the results of this study
      indicate that the inducible barrier of the glia limitans should be further
      explored as a therapeutic target.

AB  - Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express a hepatitis B virus-specific
      (HBV-specific) T cell receptor (TCR) may supplement HBV-specific immune responses
      in chronic HBV patients and facilitate HBV control. However, the risk of
      triggering unrestrained proliferation of permanently engineered T cells raises
      safety concerns that have hampered testing of this approach in patients. The aim 
      of the present study was to generate T cells that transiently express
      HBV-specific TCRs using mRNA electroporation and to assess their antiviral and
      pathogenetic activity in vitro and in HBV-infected human liver chimeric mice. We 
      assessed virological and gene-expression changes using quantitative
      reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and Luminex technology. 
      HBV-specific T cells lysed HBV-producing hepatoma cells in vitro. In vivo, 3
      injections of HBV-specific T cells caused progressive viremia reduction within 12
      days of treatment in animals reconstituted with haplotype-matched hepatocytes,
      whereas viremia remained stable in mice receiving irrelevant T cells redirected
      toward hepatitis C virus-specific TCRs. Notably, increases in alanine
      aminotransferase levels, apoptotic markers, and human inflammatory cytokines
      returned to pretreatment levels within 9 days after the last injection. T cell
      transfer did not trigger inflammation in uninfected mice. These data support the 
      feasibility of using mRNA electroporation to engineer HBV TCR-redirected T cells 
      in patients with chronic HBV infection.

AB  - Lesions and neurologic disability in inflammatory CNS diseases such as multiple
      sclerosis (MS) result from the translocation of leukocytes and humoral factors
      from the vasculature, first across the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) and 
      then across the astrocytic glia limitans (GL). Factors secreted by reactive
      astrocytes open the BBB by disrupting endothelial tight junctions (TJs), but the 
      mechanisms that control access across the GL are unknown. Here, we report that in
      inflammatory lesions, a second barrier composed of reactive astrocyte TJs of
      claudin 1 (CLDN1), CLDN4, and junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) subunits is 
      induced at the GL. In a human coculture model, CLDN4-deficient astrocytes were
      unable to control lymphocyte segregation. In models of CNS inflammation and MS,
      mice with astrocyte-specific Cldn4 deletion displayed exacerbated leukocyte and
      humoral infiltration, neuropathology, motor disability, and mortality. These
      findings identify a second inducible barrier to CNS entry at the GL. This barrier
      may be therapeutically targetable in inflammatory CNS disease.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that glioma stem cells (GSCs) are important
      therapeutic targets in glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we identified
      NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) as a functional binding protein of enhancer of zeste
      homolog 2 (EZH2) that plays a critical role in the posttranslational regulation
      of EZH2 protein in GSCs. NEK2 was among the most differentially expressed
      kinase-encoding genes in GSC-containing cultures (glioma spheres), and it was
      required for in vitro clonogenicity, in vivo tumor propagation, and
      radioresistance. Mechanistically, the formation of a protein complex comprising
      NEK2 and EZH2 in glioma spheres phosphorylated and then protected EZH2 from
      ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation in a NEK2 kinase activity-dependent 
      manner. Clinically, NEK2 expression in patients with glioma was closely
      associated with EZH2 expression and correlated with a poor prognosis. NEK2
      expression was also substantially elevated in recurrent tumors after therapeutic 
      failure compared with primary untreated tumors in matched GBM patients. We
      designed a NEK2 kinase inhibitor, compound 3a (CMP3a), which efficiently
      attenuated GBM growth in a mouse model and exhibited a synergistic effect with
      radiotherapy. These data demonstrate a key role for NEK2 in maintaining GSCs in
      GBM by stabilizing the EZH2 protein and introduce the small-molecule inhibitor
      CMP3a as a potential therapeutic agent for GBM.

LID - 95717 [pii]
AB  - Leukotrienes are proinflammatory lipid mediators that have been shown to be
      upregulated in several diseases, including asthma, aspirin-exacerbated
      respiratory disease (AERD), inflammatory bowel disease, and acute respiratory
      distress syndrome. Leukotrienes have been explored as therapeutic targets for
      these diseases and others; however, leukotriene inhibitors have had limited
      success in the clinic. There are noted differences in the incidence of
      leukotriene-mediated diseases in males and females, but sex as a factor in the
      response to leukotriene inhibitors has not been fully explored. In this issue of 
      the JCI, Pace and colleagues present evidence that there are sex-specific
      differences in the effectiveness of certain leukotriene inhibitors and link the
      differences in response to the presence of androgens. The results of this study
      indicate that sex needs to be taken into consideration in the future evaluation
      of leukotriene inhibitors to treat disease.

AB  - Proinflammatory leukotrienes (LTs) are produced by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) aided by
      5-LO-activating protein (FLAP). LT biosynthesis inhibitors are currently under
      clinical investigation as treatments for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
      Here, we have revealed a sex bias in the efficiency of clinically relevant LT
      biosynthesis inhibitors, showing that their effects are superior in females. We
      found that androgens cause these sex differences by impeding the LT-biosynthetic 
      5-LO/FLAP complex assembly. Lower doses of the FLAP inhibitor MK886 were required
      to reduce LTB4 levels in exudates of female versus male mice and rats. Following 
      platelet-activating factor-induced shock, MK886 increased survival exclusively in
      female mice, and this effect was abolished by testosterone administration. FLAP
      inhibitors and the novel-type 5-LO inhibitors licofelone and sulindac sulfide
      exhibited higher potencies in human blood from females, and bioactive 5-LO/FLAP
      complexes were formed in female, but not male, human and murine leukocytes.
      Supplementation of female blood or leukocytes with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
      abolished the observed sex differences. Our data suggest that females may benefit
      from anti-LT therapy to a greater extent than males, prompting consideration of
      sex issues in LT modifier development.

      latency.
PG  - 3126-3135

LID - 92684 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat (VOR) can
      increase HIV RNA expression in vivo within resting CD4+ T cells of aviremic HIV+ 
      individuals. However, while studies of VOR or other HDAC inhibitors have reported
      reversal of latency, none has demonstrated clearance of latent infection. We
      sought to identify the optimal dosing of VOR for effective serial reversal of HIV
      latency. METHODS: In a study of 16 HIV-infected, aviremic individuals, we
      measured resting CD4+ T cell-associated HIV RNA ex vivo and in vivo following a
      single exposure to VOR, and then in vivo after a pair of doses separated by 48 or
      72 hours, and finally following a series of 10 doses given at 72-hour intervals. 
      RESULTS: Serial VOR exposures separated by 72 hours most often resulted in an
      increase in cell-associated HIV RNA within circulating resting CD4+ T cells. VOR 
      was well tolerated by all participants. However, despite serial reversal of
      latency over 1 month of VOR dosing, we did not observe a measurable decrease
      (>0.3 log10) in the frequency of latent infection within resting CD4+ T cells.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings outline parameters for the experimental use of VOR to
      clear latent infection. Latency reversal can be achieved by VOR safely and
      repeatedly, but effective depletion of persistent HIV infection will require
      additional advances. In addition to improvements in latency reversal, these
      advances may include the sustained induction of potent antiviral immune responses
      capable of recognizing and clearing the rare cells in which HIV latency has been 
      reversed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01319383. FUNDING: NIH grants

      injury.
PG  - 3114-3125

AB  - After traumatic brain injury (TBI), glial cells have both beneficial and
      deleterious roles in injury progression and recovery. However, few studies have
      examined the influence of reactive astrocytes in the tripartite synapse following
      TBI. Here, we have demonstrated that hippocampal synaptic damage caused by
      controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in mice results in a switch from neuronal
      to astrocytic d-serine release. Under nonpathological conditions, d-serine
      functions as a neurotransmitter and coagonist for NMDA receptors and is involved 
      in mediating synaptic plasticity. The phasic release of neuronal d-serine is
      important in maintaining synaptic function, and deficiencies lead to reductions
      in synaptic function and plasticity. Following CCI injury, hippocampal neurons
      downregulated d-serine levels, while astrocytes enhanced production and release
      of d-serine. We further determined that this switch in the cellular source of
      d-serine, together with the release of basal levels of glutamate, contributes to 
      synaptic damage and dysfunction. Astrocyte-specific elimination of the astrocytic
      d-serine-synthesizing enzyme serine racemase after CCI injury improved synaptic
      plasticity, brain oscillations, and learning behavior. We conclude that the
      enhanced tonic release of d-serine from astrocytes after TBI underlies much of
      the synaptic damage associated with brain injury.

TI  - Ibrutinib treatment improves T cell number and function in CLL patients.
PG  - 3052-3064
LID - 10.1172/JCI89756 [doi]
LID - 89756 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects by
      inhibiting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK).
      The relative importance of inhibiting these 2 kinases has not been examined
      despite its relevance to immune-based therapies. METHODS: Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients on clinical
      trials of ibrutinib (BTK/ITK inhibitor; n = 19) or acalabrutinib (selective BTK
      inhibitor; n = 13) were collected serially. T cell phenotype, immune function,
      and CLL cell immunosuppressive capacity were evaluated. RESULTS: Ibrutinib
      markedly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in CLL patients. This effect was 
      more prominent in effector/effector memory subsets and was not observed with
      acalabrutinib. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that this may be due to diminished
      activation-induced cell death through ITK inhibition. PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression 
      was significantly markedly reduced in T cells by both agents. While the number of
      Treg cells remained unchanged, the ratio of these to conventional CD4+ T cells
      was reduced with ibrutinib, but not acalabrutinib. Both agents reduced expression
      of the immunosuppressive molecules CD200 and BTLA as well as IL-10 production by 
      CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib treatment increased the in vivo persistence of 
      activated T cells, decreased the Treg/CD4+ T cell ratio, and diminished the
      immune-suppressive properties of CLL cells through BTK-dependent and -independent
      mechanisms. These features provide a strong rationale for combination
      immunotherapy approaches with ibrutinib in CLL and other cancers. TRIAL

AB  - The lack of mechanistic explanations for many genotype-phenotype associations
      identified by GWAS precludes thorough assessment of their impact on human health.
      Here, we conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping analysis
      in erythroblasts and found erythroid-specific eQTLs for ATP2B4, the main calcium 
      ATPase of red blood cells (rbc). The same SNPs were previously associated with
      mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and susceptibility to severe
      malaria infection. We showed that Atp2b4-/- mice demonstrate increased MCHC,
      confirming ATP2B4 as the causal gene at this GWAS locus. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we
      fine mapped the genetic signal to an erythroid-specific enhancer of ATP2B4.
      Erythroid cells with a deletion of the ATP2B4 enhancer had abnormally high
      intracellular calcium levels. These results illustrate the power of combined
      transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genome-editing approaches in characterizing
      noncoding regulatory elements in phenotype-relevant cells. Our study supports
      ATP2B4 as a potential target for modulating rbc hydration in erythroid disorders 
      and malaria infection.

TI  - DNA methylation-based immune response signature improves patient diagnosis in
      multiple cancers.
PG  - 3090-3102

AB  - BACKGROUND: The tumor immune response is increasingly associated with better
      clinical outcomes in breast and other cancers. However, the evaluation of
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) relies on histopathological measurements
      with limited accuracy and reproducibility. Here, we profiled DNA methylation
      markers to identify a methylation of TIL (MeTIL) signature that recapitulates TIL
      evaluations and their prognostic value for long-term outcomes in breast cancer
      (BC). METHODS: MeTIL signature scores were correlated with clinical endpoints
      reflecting overall or disease-free survival and a pathologic complete response to
      preoperative anthracycline therapy in 3 BC cohorts from the Jules Bordet
      Institute in Brussels and in other cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
      RESULTS: The MeTIL signature measured TIL distributions in a sensitive manner and
      predicted survival and response to chemotherapy in BC better than did
      histopathological assessment of TILs or gene expression-based immune markers,
      respectively. The MeTIL signature also improved the prediction of survival in
      other malignancies, including melanoma and lung cancer. Furthermore, the MeTIL
      signature predicted differences in survival for malignancies in which TILs were
      not known to have a prognostic value. Finally, we showed that MeTIL markers can
      be determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing of small amounts of DNA from
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, supporting clinical applications 
      for this methodology. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the power of DNA
      methylation to evaluate tumor immune responses and the potential of this approach
      to improve the diagnosis and treatment of breast and other cancers. FUNDING: This
      work was funded by the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) and

LID - 90147 [pii]
AB  - Adipocytes secrete the hormone leptin to signal the sufficiency of energy stores.
      Reductions in circulating leptin concentrations reflect a negative energy
      balance, which augments sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation in response
      to metabolically demanding emergencies. This process ensures adequate glucose
      mobilization despite low energy stores. We report that leptin receptor-expressing
      neurons (LepRb neurons) in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the largest population 
      of LepRb neurons in the brain stem, mediate this process. Application of noxious 
      stimuli, which often signal the need to mobilize glucose to support an
      appropriate response, activated PAG LepRb neurons, which project to and activate 
      parabrachial nucleus (PBN) neurons that control SNS activation and glucose
      mobilization. Furthermore, activating PAG LepRb neurons increased SNS activity
      and blood glucose concentrations, while ablating LepRb in PAG neurons augmented
      glucose mobilization in response to noxious stimuli. Thus, decreased leptin
      action on PAG LepRb neurons augments the autonomic response to noxious stimuli,
      ensuring sufficient glucose mobilization during periods of acute demand in the
      face of diminished energy stores.

TI  - Gentamicin induces functional type VII collagen in recessive dystrophic
      epidermolysis bullosa patients.
PG  - 3028-3038

LID - 92707 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an incurable
      disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding type VII collagen, the major
      component of anchoring fibrils (AF). We previously demonstrated that gentamicin
      produced functional type VII collagen in RDEB cells harboring nonsense mutations.
      Herein, we determined whether topical or intradermal gentamicin administration
      induces type VII collagen and AFs in RDEB patients. METHODS: A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled pilot trial assessed safety and efficacy of topical and
      intradermal gentamicin in 5 RDEB patients with nonsense mutations. The topical
      arm tested 0.1% gentamicin ointment or placebo application 3 times daily at 2
      open erosion sites for 2 weeks. The intradermal arm tested daily intradermal
      injection of gentamicin solution (8 mg) or placebo into 2 intact skin sites for 2
      days in 4 of 5 patients. Primary outcomes were induction of type VII collagen and
      AFs at the test sites and safety assessment. A secondary outcome assessed wound
      closure of topically treated erosions. RESULTS: Both topical and intradermal
      gentamicin administration induced type VII collagen and AFs at the
      dermal-epidermal junction of treatment sites. Newly created type VII collagen
      varied from 20% to 165% of that expressed in normal human skin and persisted for 
      3 months. Topical gentamicin corrected dermal-epidermal separation, improved
      wound closure, and reduced blister formation. There were no untoward side effects
      from gentamicin treatments. Type VII collagen induction did not generate
      anti-type VII collagen autoantibodies in patients' blood or skin. CONCLUSION:
      Topical and intradermal gentamicin suppresses nonsense mutations and induces type
      VII collagen and AFs in RDEB patients. Gentamicin therapy may provide a readily
      available treatment for RDEB patients with nonsense mutations. TRIAL

AB  - Current anti-VEGF therapies for colorectal cancer (CRC) provide limited survival 
      benefit, as tumors rapidly develop resistance to these agents. Here, we have
      uncovered an immunosuppressive role for nonclassical Ly6Clo monocytes that
      mediates resistance to anti-VEGFR2 treatment. We found that the chemokine CX3CL1 
      was upregulated in both human and murine tumors following VEGF signaling
      blockade, resulting in recruitment of CX3CR1+Ly6Clo monocytes into the tumor. We 
      also found that treatment with VEGFA reduced expression of CX3CL1 in endothelial 
      cells in vitro. Intravital microscopy revealed that CX3CR1 is critical for Ly6Clo
      monocyte transmigration across the endothelium in murine CRC tumors. Moreover,
      Ly6Clo monocytes recruit Ly6G+ neutrophils via CXCL5 and produce IL-10, which
      inhibits adaptive immunity. Preventing Ly6Clo monocyte or Ly6G+ neutrophil
      infiltration into tumors enhanced inhibition of tumor growth with anti-VEGFR2
      therapy. Furthermore, a gene therapy using a nanoparticle formulated with an
      siRNA against CX3CL1 reduced Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment and improved outcome of 
      anti-VEGFR2 therapy in mouse CRCs. Our study unveils an immunosuppressive
      function of Ly6Clo monocytes that, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in
      any context. We also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying antiangiogenic
      treatment resistance, suggesting potential immunomodulatory strategies to enhance
      the long-term clinical outcome of anti-VEGF therapies.

TI  - Biallelic mutations in the ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 cause Fanconi anemia.
PG  - 3013-3027
LID - 10.1172/JCI92069 [doi]
LID - 92069 [pii]
AB  - The WD40-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 has been recently linked to the
      repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination (HR). Here we have shown that an
      RFWD3 mutation within the WD40 domain is connected to the genetic disease Fanconi
      anemia (FA). An individual presented with congenital abnormalities characteristic
      of FA. Cells from the patient carrying the compound heterozygous mutations
      c.205_206dupCC and c.1916T>A in RFWD3 showed increased sensitivity to DNA
      interstrand cross-linking agents in terms of increased chromosomal breakage,
      reduced survival, and cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. The cellular phenotype was
      mirrored in genetically engineered human and avian cells by inactivation of RFWD3
      or introduction of the patient-derived missense mutation, and the phenotype was
      rescued by expression of wild-type RFWD3 protein. HR was disrupted in
      RFWD3-mutant cells as a result of impaired relocation of mutant RFWD3 to
      chromatin and defective physical interaction with replication protein A. Rfwd3
      knockout mice appear to have increased embryonic lethality, are subfertile, show 
      ovarian and testicular atrophy, and have a reduced lifespan resembling that of
      other FA mouse models. Although RFWD3 mutations have thus far been detected in a 
      single child with FA, we propose RFWD3 as an FA gene, FANCW, supported by
      cellular paradigm systems and an animal model.

AB  - Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) represents a distinct, aggressive form 
      of peripheral T cell lymphoma with a dismal prognosis. Recent exome sequencing in
      patients with AITL has revealed the frequent coexistence of somatic mutations in 
      the Rho GTPase RhoA (RhoAG17V) and loss-of-function mutations in the
      5-methylcytosine oxidase TET2. Here, we have demonstrated that TET2 loss and
      RhoAG17V expression in mature murine T cells cooperatively cause abnormal CD4+ T 
      cell proliferation and differentiation by perturbing FoxO1 gene expression,
      phosphorylation, and subcellular localization, an abnormality that is also
      detected in human primary AITL tumor samples. Reexpression of FoxO1 attenuated
      aberrant immune responses induced in mouse models adoptively transferred with T
      cells and bearing genetic lesions in both TET2 and RhoA. Our findings suggest a
      mutational cooperativity between epigenetic factors and GTPases in adult CD4+ T
      cells that may account for immunoinflammatory responses associated with AITL
      patients.

TI  - Ubiquitination of tumor suppressor PML regulates prometastatic and
      immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

AB  - The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in tumor growth and
      metastasis. However, the mechanism by which tumor cells regulate the cell and
      non-cell constituents of surrounding stroma remains incompletely understood.
      Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) is a pleiotropic tumor suppressor, but its role in
      tumor microenvironment regulation is poorly characterized. PML is frequently
      downregulated in many cancer types, including lung cancer. Here, we identify a
      PML ubiquitination pathway that is mediated by WD repeat 4-containing cullin-RING
      ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4WDR4). Clinically, this PML degradation pathway is
      hyperactivated in lung cancer and correlates with poor prognosis. The WDR4/PML
      axis induces a set of cell-surface or secreted factors, including CD73,
      urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and serum amyloid A2
      (SAA2), which elicit paracrine effects to stimulate migration, invasion, and
      metastasis in multiple lung cancer models. In xenograft and genetically
      engineered mouse models, the WDR4/PML axis elevates intratumoral Tregs and
      M2-like macrophages and reduces CD8+ T cells to promote lung tumor growth. These 
      immunosuppressive effects were all reversed by CD73 blockade. Our study
      identifies WDR4 as an oncoprotein that negatively regulates PML via
      ubiquitination to promote lung cancer progression by fostering an
      immunosuppressive and prometastatic tumor microenvironment, suggesting the
      potential of immune-modulatory approaches for treating lung cancer with aberrant 
      PML degradation.

TI  - Preexisting endothelial cells mediate cardiac neovascularization after injury.
PG  - 2968-2981
LID - 10.1172/JCI93868 [doi]
LID - 93868 [pii]
AB  - The mechanisms that promote the generation of new coronary vasculature during
      cardiac homeostasis and after injury remain a fundamental and clinically
      important area of study in the cardiovascular field. Recently, it was reported
      that mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition (MEndoT) contributes to substantial
      numbers of coronary endothelial cells after myocardial infarction. Therefore, the
      MEndoT has been proposed as a paradigm mediating neovascularization and is
      considered a promising therapeutic target in cardiac regeneration. Here, we show 
      that preexisting endothelial cells mainly beget new coronary vessels in the adult
      mouse heart, with essentially no contribution from other cell sources through
      cell-lineage transdifferentiation. Genetic-lineage tracing revealed that cardiac 
      fibroblasts expand substantially after injury, but do not contribute to the
      formation of new coronary blood vessels, indicating no contribution of MEndoT to 
      neovascularization. Moreover, genetic-lineage tracing with a pulse-chase labeling
      strategy also showed that essentially all new coronary vessels in the injured
      heart are derived from preexisting endothelial cells, but not from other cell
      lineages. These data indicate that therapeutic strategies for inducing
      neovascularization should not be based on targeting presumptive lineage
      transdifferentiation such as MEndoT. Instead, preexisting endothelial cells
      appear more likely to be the therapeutic target for promoting neovascularization 
      and driving heart regeneration after injury.

AB  - Coronary revascularization is an effective means of treating ischemic heart
      disease; however, current therapeutic revascularization strategies are limited to
      large caliber vessels. Because the mammalian heart scars following cardiac
      injury, recent work showing that cardiac fibroblasts can transdifferentiate into 
      new coronary endothelium raises a new and exciting approach to promoting
      endogenous revascularization following cardiac injury. In this issue of the JCI, 
      He et al. report on their employment of a battery of lineage-tracing tools to
      address the developmental origins of fibroblasts that give rise to new
      endothelial cells. Surprisingly, cardiac fibroblasts did not appear to contribute
      appreciably to regeneration of cardiac endothelium. Instead, cardiac endothelial 
      cells were likely to proliferate and generate new endothelium following injury.
      As these conclusions diverge from prior findings, additional work will be
      required to understand the sources that generate cardiac endothelium in new blood
      vessels after injury. Clarification of the origins of coronary endothelial cells 
      during cardiac repair is essential for identifying improved approaches to
      revascularizing damaged myocardium in patients with ischemic heart disease.

PG  - 2957-2967

LID - 93472 [pii]
AB  - Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is an oncolytic picornavirus with selective tropism for
      neuroendocrine cancers. It has shown promise as a cancer therapeutic in
      preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials. Here, we have identified
      anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1) as the receptor for SVV using genome-wide
      loss-of-function screens. ANTXR1 is necessary for permissivity in vitro and in
      vivo. However, robust SVV replication requires an additional innate immune
      defect. We found that SVV interacts directly and specifically with ANTXR1, that
      this interaction is required for SVV binding to permissive cells, and that ANTXR1
      expression is necessary and sufficient for infection in cell lines with decreased
      expression of antiviral IFN genes at baseline. Finally, we identified the region 
      of the SVV capsid that is responsible for receptor recognition using cryoelectron
      microscopy of the SVV-ANTXR1-Fc complex. These studies identify ANTXR1, a class
      of receptor that is shared by a mammalian virus and a bacterial toxin, as the
      cellular receptor for SVV.

TI  - Inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes and their conversion to M2 macrophages drive
      atherosclerosis regression.
PG  - 2904-2915
LID - 10.1172/JCI75005 [doi]
LID - 75005 [pii]
AB  - Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, and developing therapies to
      promote its regression is an important clinical goal. We previously established
      that atherosclerosis regression is characterized by an overall decrease in plaque
      macrophages and enrichment in markers of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. 
      We have now investigated the origin and functional requirement for M2 macrophages
      in regression in normolipidemic mice that received transplants of atherosclerotic
      aortic segments. We compared plaque regression in WT normolipidemic recipients
      and those deficient in chemokine receptors necessary to recruit inflammatory
      Ly6Chi (Ccr2-/- or Cx3cr1-/-) or patrolling Ly6Clo (Ccr5-/-) monocytes.
      Atherosclerotic plaques transplanted into WT or Ccr5-/- recipients showed reduced
      macrophage content and increased M2 markers consistent with plaque regression,
      whereas plaques transplanted into Ccr2-/- or Cx3cr1-/- recipients lacked this
      regression signature. The requirement of recipient Ly6Chi monocyte recruitment
      was confirmed in cell trafficking studies. Fate-mapping and single-cell RNA
      sequencing studies also showed that M2-like macrophages were derived from newly
      recruited monocytes. Furthermore, we used recipient mice deficient in STAT6 to
      demonstrate a requirement for this critical component of M2 polarization in
      atherosclerosis regression. Collectively, these results suggest that continued
      recruitment of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes and their STAT6-dependent
      polarization to the M2 state are required for resolution of atherosclerotic
      inflammation and plaque regression.

TI  - Two rheumatoid arthritis-specific autoantigens correlate microbial immunity with 
      autoimmune responses in joints.
PG  - 2946-2956
LID - 10.1172/JCI93450 [doi]
LID - 93450 [pii]
AB  - In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), immunological triggers at mucosal sites, such as
      the gut microbiota, may promote autoimmunity that affects joints. Here, we used
      discovery-based proteomics to detect HLA-DR-presented peptides in synovia or
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and identified 2 autoantigens,
      N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS) and filamin A (FLNA), as targets of T and B
      cell responses in 52% and 56% of RA patients, respectively. Both GNS and FLNA
      were highly expressed in synovia. GNS appeared to be citrullinated, and GNS
      antibody values correlated with anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)
      levels. FLNA did not show the same results. The HLA-DR-presented GNS peptide has 
      marked sequence homology with epitopes from sulfatase proteins of the Prevotella 
      sp. and Parabacteroides sp., whereas the HLA-DR-presented FLNA peptide has
      homology with epitopes from proteins of the Prevotella sp. and Butyricimonas sp.,
      another gut commensal. Patients with T cell reactivity with each self-peptide
      also had responses to the corresponding microbial peptides, and the levels were
      directly correlated. Furthermore, HLA-DR molecules encoded by shared-epitope (SE)
      alleles were predicted to bind these self- and microbial peptides strongly, and
      these responses were more common in RA patients with SE alleles. Thus, sequence
      homology between T cell epitopes of 2 self-proteins and a related order of gut
      microbes may provide a link between mucosal and joint immunity in patients with
      RA.

TI  - Hepatic beta-arrestin 2 is essential for maintaining euglycemia.
PG  - 2941-2945

LID - 92913 [pii]
AB  - An increase in hepatic glucose production (HGP) represents a key feature of type 
      2 diabetes. This deficiency in metabolic control of glucose production critically
      depends on enhanced signaling through hepatic glucagon receptors (GCGRs). Here,
      we have demonstrated that selective inactivation of the GPCR-associated protein
      beta-arrestin 2 in hepatocytes of adult mice results in greatly increased hepatic
      GCGR signaling, leading to striking deficits in glucose homeostasis. However,
      hepatocyte-specific beta-arrestin 2 deficiency did not affect hepatic insulin
      sensitivity or beta-adrenergic signaling. Adult mice lacking beta-arrestin 1
      selectively in hepatocytes did not show any changes in glucose homeostasis.
      Importantly, hepatocyte-specific overexpression of beta-arrestin 2 greatly
      reduced hepatic GCGR signaling and protected mice against the metabolic deficits 
      caused by the consumption of a high-fat diet. Our data support the concept that
      strategies aimed at enhancing hepatic beta-arrestin 2 activity could prove useful
      for suppressing HGP for therapeutic purposes.

TI  - ILC2-modulated T cell-to-MDSC balance is associated with bladder cancer
      recurrence.

AB  - Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a highly recurrent tumor despite
      intravesical immunotherapy instillation with the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
      vaccine. In a prospective longitudinal study, we took advantage of BCG
      instillations, which increase local immune infiltration, to characterize immune
      cell populations in the urine of patients with NMIBC as a surrogate for the
      bladder tumor microenvironment. We observed an infiltration of neutrophils, T
      cells, monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs), and group 2 innate
      lymphoid cells (ILC2). Notably, patients with a T cell-to-MDSC ratio of less than
      1 showed dramatically lower recurrence-free survival than did patients with a
      ratio of greater than 1. Analysis of early and later time points indicated that
      this patient dichotomy existed prior to BCG treatment. ILC2 frequency was
      associated with detectable IL-13 in the urine and correlated with the level of
      recruited M-MDSCs, which highly expressed IL-13 receptor alpha1. In vitro, ILC2
      were increased and potently expressed IL-13 in the presence of BCG or tumor
      cells. IL-13 induced the preferential recruitment and suppressive function of
      monocytes. Thus, the T cell-to-MDSC balance, associated with a skewing toward
      type 2 immunity, may predict bladder tumor recurrence and influence the mortality
      of patients with muscle-invasive cancer. Moreover, these results underline the
      ILC2/IL-13 axis as a targetable pathway to curtail the M-MDSC compartment and
      improve bladder cancer treatment.

AB  - Programmed death-1-directed (PD-1-directed) immune checkpoint blockade results in
      durable antitumor activity in many advanced malignancies. Recent studies suggest 
      that IFN-gamma is a critical driver of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
      expression in cancer and host cells, and baseline intratumoral T cell
      infiltration may improve response likelihood to anti-PD-1 therapies, including
      pembrolizumab. However, whether quantifying T cell-inflamed microenvironment is a
      useful pan-tumor determinant of PD-1-directed therapy response has not been
      rigorously evaluated. Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles (GEPs) using RNA
      from baseline tumor samples of pembrolizumab-treated patients. We identified
      immune-related signatures correlating with clinical benefit using a
      learn-and-confirm paradigm based on data from different clinical studies of
      pembrolizumab, starting with a small pilot of 19 melanoma patients and eventually
      defining a pan-tumor T cell-inflamed GEP in 220 patients with 9 cancers.
      Predictive value was independently confirmed and compared with that of PD-L1
      immunohistochemistry in 96 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
      The T cell-inflamed GEP contained IFN-gamma-responsive genes related to antigen
      presentation, chemokine expression, cytotoxic activity, and adaptive immune
      resistance, and these features were necessary, but not always sufficient, for
      clinical benefit. The T cell-inflamed GEP has been developed into a
      clinical-grade assay that is currently being evaluated in ongoing pembrolizumab
      trials.

LID - 90598 [pii]
AB  - Modern immunosuppression regimens effectively control acute rejection and
      decrease graft loss in the first year after transplantation; however, these
      regimens do not have a durable effect on long-term graft survival owing to a
      combination of drug toxicities and the emergence of chronic alloimmune responses.
      Eliminating drugs and their toxicities while maintaining graft acceptance has
      been the primary aim of cellular therapies. Tregs suppress both autoimmune and
      alloimmune responses and are particularly effective in protecting allografts in
      experimental transplant models. Further, Treg-based therapies are selective, do
      not require harsh conditioning, and do not have a risk of graft-versus-host
      disease. Trial designs should consider the distinct immunological features of
      each transplanted organ, Treg preparations, dose, and frequency, and the ability 
      to detect and quantify Treg effects in a given transplant environment. In this
      Review, we detail the ongoing clinical trials of Treg therapy in liver and kidney
      transplantation. Integration of Treg biology gleaned from preclinical models and 
      experiences in human organ transplantation should allow for optimization of trial
      design that will determine the potential efficacy of a given therapy and provide 
      guidelines for further therapeutic development.

AB  - Substantial preclinical and clinical research into chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (cGVHD) has come to fruition in the last five years, generating a clear
      understanding of a complex cytokine-driven cellular network. cGVHD is mediated by
      naive T cells differentiating within IL-17-secreting T cell and follicular Th
      cell paradigms to generate IL-21 and IL-17A, which drive pathogenic germinal
      center (GC) B cell reactions and monocyte-macrophage differentiation,
      respectively. cGVHD pathogenesis includes thymic damage, impaired antigen
      presentation, and a failure in IL-2-dependent Treg homeostasis. Pathogenic GC B
      cell and macrophage reactions culminate in antibody formation and TGF-beta
      secretion, respectively, leading to fibrosis. This new understanding permits the 
      design of rational cytokine and intracellular signaling pathway-targeted
      therapeutics, reviewed herein.

AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections following
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are a major cause of
      morbidity and mortality. Early clinical trials demonstrate that adoptive transfer
      of donor-derived virus-specific T cells to restore virus-specific immunity is an 
      effective strategy to control CMV and EBV infection after HSCT, conferring
      protection in 70%-90% of patients. The field has evolved rapidly to develop
      solutions to some of the manufacturing challenges identified in early clinical
      studies, such as prolonged in vitro culture, optimization of the purity of the
      virus-specific T cell product, the potential limitations of targeting a single
      viral antigen, and how to manage the patient with a virus-naive donor. This
      Review both discusses the seminal early studies and explores cutting-edge novel
      technologies that broaden the feasibility of and the scope for delivering
      virus-specific T cells to patients after HSCT.

AB  - Preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) is a cancer-testis antigen
      that is expressed in many cancers and leukemias. In healthy tissue, PRAME
      expression is limited to the testes and ovaries, making it a highly attractive
      cancer target. PRAME is an intracellular protein that cannot currently be
      drugged. After proteasomal processing, the PRAME300-309 peptide ALYVDSLFFL (ALY) 
      is presented in the context of human leukocyte antigen HLA-A*02:01 molecules for 
      recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR) of cytotoxic T cells. Here, we have
      described Pr20, a TCR mimic (TCRm) human IgG1 antibody that recognizes the
      cell-surface ALY peptide/HLA-A2 complex. Pr20 is an immunological tool and
      potential therapeutic agent. Pr20 bound to PRAME+HLA-A2+ cancers. An afucosylated
      Fc form (Pr20M) directed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against
      PRAME+HLA-A2+ leukemia cells and was therapeutically effective against mouse
      xenograft models of human leukemia. In some tumors, Pr20 binding markedly
      increased upon IFN-gamma treatment, mediated by induction of the immunoproteasome
      catalytic subunit beta5i. The immunoproteasome reduced internal destructive
      cleavages within the ALY epitope compared with the constitutive proteasome. The
      data provide rationale for developing TCRm antibodies as therapeutic agents for
      cancer, offer mechanistic insight on proteasomal regulation of tumor-associated
      peptide/HLA antigen complexes, and yield possible therapeutic solutions to target
      antigens with ultra-low surface presentation.

AB  - While antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce HIV-1 to undetectable levels, the
      virus generally reappears if treatment is stopped. Resurgence of the virus is due
      to the reactivation of T cells harboring latent integrated provirus, and recent
      studies indicate that proliferation of these latently infected cells helps
      maintain the HIV-1 reservoir. In this issue of the JCI, Lee et al. evaluated CD4+
      T cell subsets to determine whether certain populations are more likely to harbor
      full-length, replication-competent provirus. The authors identified an enrichment
      of clonally expanded Th1 cells containing intact HIV-1 proviruses, suggesting
      that this polarized subset contributes to the persistence of the reservoir.
      Strategies to target these provirus-harboring cells need to be considered for
      future therapies aimed toward HIV-1 cure.

AB  - Epidemiologic and animal studies implicate overconsumption of fructose in the
      development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but the molecular mechanisms
      underlying fructose-induced chronic liver diseases remain largely unknown. Here, 
      we have presented evidence supporting the essential function of the lipogenic
      transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) in
      mediating adaptive responses to fructose and protecting against fructose-induced 
      hepatotoxicity. In WT mice, a high-fructose diet (HFrD) activated hepatic
      lipogenesis in a ChREBP-dependent manner; however, in Chrebp-KO mice, a HFrD
      induced steatohepatitis. In Chrebp-KO mouse livers, a HFrD reduced levels of
      molecular chaperones and activated the C/EBP homologous protein-dependent
      (CHOP-dependent) unfolded protein response, whereas administration of a chemical 
      chaperone or Chop shRNA rescued liver injury. Elevated expression levels of
      cholesterol biosynthesis genes in HFrD-fed Chrebp-KO livers were paralleled by an
      increased nuclear abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2
      (SREBP2). Atorvastatin-mediated inhibition of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis or
      depletion of hepatic Srebp2 reversed fructose-induced liver injury in Chrebp-KO
      mice. Mechanistically, we determined that ChREBP binds to nuclear SREBP2 to
      promote its ubiquitination and destabilization in cultured cells. Therefore, our 
      findings demonstrate that ChREBP provides hepatoprotection against a HFrD by
      preventing overactivation of cholesterol biosynthesis and the subsequent
      CHOP-mediated, proapoptotic unfolded protein response. Our findings also
      identified a role for ChREBP in regulating SREBP2-dependent cholesterol
      metabolism.

AB  - Overconsumption of fructose and other sugars has been linked to nonalcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the sugar-associated effects that lead to
      disease are poorly defined. In this issue of the JCI, Zhang and colleagues show
      that the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) coordinates an
      adaptive response to a high-fructose diet in mice and that loss of this
      transcription factor leads to hepatic inflammation and early signs of fibrosis.
      Intriguingly, ChREBP-dependent effects were due to an exaggerated activation of
      the proapoptotic arms of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response that is
      probably secondary to inappropriate derepression of cholesterol biosynthesis.
      These findings suggest that a previously unknown link exists between ChREBP and
      the regulation of cholesterol synthesis that affects liver injury.

LID - 92087 [pii]
AB  - Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine
      repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Although suppressing the expression of
      mutant HTT (mHTT) has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to treat
      Huntington's disease, considerable efforts have gone into developing
      allele-specific suppression of mHTT expression, given that loss of Htt in mice
      can lead to embryonic lethality. It remains unknown whether depletion of HTT in
      the adult brain, regardless of its allele, could be a safe therapy. Here, we
      report that permanent suppression of endogenous mHTT expression in the striatum
      of mHTT-expressing mice (HD140Q-knockin mice) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
      inactivation effectively depleted HTT aggregates and attenuated early
      neuropathology. The reduction of mHTT expression in striatal neuronal cells in
      adult HD140Q-knockin mice did not affect viability, but alleviated motor
      deficits. Our studies suggest that non-allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene 
      editing could be used to efficiently and permanently eliminate polyglutamine
      expansion-mediated neuronal toxicity in the adult brain.

AB  - Alloimmune T cells are central mediators of rejection and graft-versus-host
      disease in both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Unique
      among immune responses in terms of its strength and diversity, the T cell
      alloresponse reflects extensive genetic polymorphisms between allogeneic donors
      and recipients, most prominently within the major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC), which encodes human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) in humans. The repertoire of
      alloreactive T cell clones is distinct for every donor-recipient pair and
      includes potentially thousands of unique HLA/peptide specificities. The
      extraordinary magnitude of the primary alloresponse and diversity of the T cell
      population mediating it have presented technical challenges to its study in
      humans. High-throughput T cell receptor sequencing approaches have opened up new 
      possibilities for tackling many fundamental questions about this important
      immunologic phenomenon.

      requires simultaneous withdrawal of tonic neuropeptide Y (NPY)
      sympathoinhibition. However, the sites and neurocircuitry by which NPY decreases 
      SNA are unclear. Here, using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer
      drugs (DREADDs) to selectively activate or inhibit ArcN NPY neurons expressing
      agouti-related peptide (AgRP) in mice, we have demonstrated that this neuronal
      population tonically suppresses splanchnic SNA (SSNA), arterial pressure, and
      heart rate via projections to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and dorsomedial
      hypothalamus (DMH). First, we found that ArcN NPY/AgRP fibers closely appose PVN 
      and DMH presympathetic neurons. Second, nanoinjections of NPY or an NPY receptor 
      Y1 (NPY1R) antagonist into PVN or DMH decreased or increased SSNA, respectively. 
      Third, blockade of DMH NPY1R reversed the sympathoinhibition elicited by
      selective, DREADD-mediated activation of ArcN NPY/AgRP neurons. Finally,
      stimulation of ArcN NPY/AgRP terminal fields in the PVN and DMH decreased SSNA.
      Considering that chronic obesity decreases ArcN NPY content, we propose that the 
      ArcN NPY neuropathway to the PVN and DMH is pivotal in obesity-induced elevations
      in SNA.

AB  - WNT proteins drive the development and maintenance of many tissues, including
      bone. It is less clear which of the many WNT proteins act on bone or where these 
      WNTs act in the skeleton; however, loss-of-function mutations in WNT1 cause bone 
      fragility in children and adults. In this issue of the JCI, Joeng and colleagues 
      demonstrate that bone formation is under the control of WNT1 produced by
      osteocytes, the cells that reside deep in the bone matrix and form dendritic
      networks. The implication of WNT1 in the control of bone formation identifies a
      potential new target for the treatment of low bone mass disorders, such as
      osteoporosis.

TI  - Clonal expansion of genome-intact HIV-1 in functionally polarized Th1 CD4+ T
      cells.
PG  - 2689-2696
LID - 10.1172/JCI93289 [doi]
LID - 93289 [pii]
AB  - HIV-1 causes a chronic, incurable disease due to its persistence in CD4+ T cells 
      that contain replication-competent provirus, but exhibit little or no active
      viral gene expression and effectively resist combination antiretroviral therapy
      (cART). These latently infected T cells represent an extremely small proportion
      of all circulating CD4+ T cells but possess a remarkable long-term stability and 
      typically persist throughout life, for reasons that are not fully understood.
      Here we performed massive single-genome, near-full-length next-generation
      sequencing of HIV-1 DNA derived from unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells, ex vivo-isolated CD4+ T cells, and subsets of functionally polarized
      memory CD4+ T cells. This approach identified multiple sets of independent,
      near-full-length proviral sequences from cART-treated individuals that were
      completely identical, consistent with clonal expansion of CD4+ T cells harboring 
      intact HIV-1. Intact, near-full-genome HIV-1 DNA sequences that were derived from
      such clonally expanded CD4+ T cells constituted 62% of all analyzed genome-intact
      sequences in memory CD4 T cells, were preferentially observed in Th1-polarized
      cells, were longitudinally detected over a duration of up to 5 years, and were
      fully replication- and infection-competent. Together, these data suggest that
      clonal proliferation of Th1-polarized CD4+ T cells encoding for intact HIV-1
      represents a driving force for stabilizing the pool of latently infected CD4+ T
      cells.

TI  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with cirrhosis increases familial risk for
      advanced fibrosis.
PG  - 2697-2704
LID - 10.1172/JCI93465 [doi]
LID - 93465 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of advanced fibrosis in first-degree relatives of patients
      with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cirrhosis (NAFLD-cirrhosis) is unknown 
      and needs to be systematically quantified. We aimed to prospectively assess the
      risk of advanced fibrosis in first-degree relatives of probands with
      NAFLD-cirrhosis. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective
      cohort of 26 probands with NAFLD-cirrhosis and 39 first-degree relatives. The
      control population included 69 community-dwelling twin, sib-sib, or
      parent-offspring pairs (n = 138), comprising 69 individuals randomly ascertained 
      to be without evidence of NAFLD and 69 of their first-degree relatives. The
      primary outcome was presence of advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4 fibrosis). NAFLD 
      was assessed clinically and quantified by MRI proton density fat fraction
      (MRI-PDFF). Advanced fibrosis was diagnosed by liver stiffness greater than 3.63 
      kPa using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). RESULTS: The prevalence of
      advanced fibrosis in first-degree relatives of probands with NAFLD-cirrhosis was 
      significantly higher than that in the control population (17.9% vs. 1.4%, P =
      0.0032). Compared with controls, the odds of advanced fibrosis among the
      first-degree relatives of probands with NAFLD-cirrhosis were odds ratio 14.9 (95%
      CI, 1.8-126.0, P = 0.0133). Even after multivariable adjustment by age, sex,
      Hispanic ethnicity, BMI, and diabetes status, the risk of advanced fibrosis
      remained both statistically and clinically significant (multivariable-adjusted
      odds ratio 12.5; 95% CI, 1.1-146.1, P = 0.0438). CONCLUSION: Using a
      well-phenotyped familial cohort, we demonstrated that first-degree relatives of
      probands with NAFLD-cirrhosis have a 12 times higher risk of advanced fibrosis.
      Advanced fibrosis screening may be considered in first-degree relatives of
      NAFLD-cirrhosis patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UCSD IRB: 140084. FUNDING: National

TI  - Osteocyte-specific WNT1 regulates osteoblast function during bone homeostasis.
PG  - 2678-2688
LID - 10.1172/JCI92617 [doi]
LID - 92617 [pii]
AB  - Mutations in WNT1 cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and early-onset
      osteoporosis, identifying it as a key Wnt ligand in human bone homeostasis.
      However, how and where WNT1 acts in bone are unclear. To address this mechanism, 
      we generated late-osteoblast-specific and osteocyte-specific WNT1 loss- and
      gain-of-function mouse models. Deletion of Wnt1 in osteocytes resulted in low
      bone mass with spontaneous fractures similar to that observed in OI patients.
      Conversely, Wnt1 overexpression from osteocytes stimulated bone formation by
      increasing osteoblast number and activity, which was due in part to activation of
      mTORC1 signaling. While antiresorptive therapy is the mainstay of OI treatment,
      it has limited efficacy in WNT1-related OI. In this study, anti-sclerostin
      antibody (Scl-Ab) treatment effectively improved bone mass and dramatically
      decreased fracture rate in swaying mice, a model of global Wnt1 loss.
      Collectively, our data suggest that WNT1-related OI and osteoporosis are caused
      in part by decreased mTORC1-dependent osteoblast function resulting from loss of 
      WNT1 signaling in osteocytes. As such, this work identifies an anabolic function 
      of osteocytes as a source of Wnt in bone development and homoeostasis,
      complementing their known function as targets of Wnt signaling in regulating
      osteoclastogenesis. Finally, this study suggests that Scl-Ab is an effective
      genotype-specific treatment option for WNT1-related OI and osteoporosis.

AB  - The mechanisms that regulate cell death and inflammation play an important role
      in liver disease and cancer. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)
      induces apoptosis and necroptosis via kinase-dependent mechanisms and exhibits
      kinase-independent prosurvival and proinflammatory functions. Here, we have used 
      genetic mouse models to study the role of RIPK1 in liver homeostasis, injury, and
      cancer. While ablating either RIPK1 or RelA in liver parenchymal cells (LPCs) did
      not cause spontaneous liver pathology, mice with combined deficiency of RIPK1 and
      RelA in LPCs showed increased hepatocyte apoptosis and developed spontaneous
      chronic liver disease and cancer that were independent of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) 
      signaling. In contrast, mice with LPC-specific knockout of Ripk1 showed reduced
      diethylnitrosamine-induced (DEN-induced) liver tumorigenesis that correlated with
      increased DEN-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. Lack of RIPK1 kinase activity did not
      inhibit DEN-induced liver tumor formation, showing that kinase-independent
      functions of RIPK1 promote DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, mice
      lacking both RIPK1 and TNFR1 in LPCs displayed normal tumor formation in response
      to DEN, demonstrating that RIPK1 deficiency decreases DEN-induced liver tumor
      formation in a TNFR1-dependent manner. Therefore, these findings indicate that
      RIPK1 cooperates with NF-kappaB signaling to prevent TNFR1-independent hepatocyte
      apoptosis and the development of chronic liver disease and cancer, but acts
      downstream of TNFR1 signaling to promote DEN-induced liver tumorigenesis.

AB  - Somatostatin secreted by pancreatic delta cells mediates important paracrine
      interactions in Langerhans islets, including maintenance of glucose metabolism
      through the control of reciprocal insulin and glucagon secretion. Disruption of
      this circuit contributes to the development of diabetes. However, the precise
      mechanisms that control somatostatin secretion from islets remain elusive. Here, 
      we found that a super-complex comprising the cullin 4B-RING E3 ligase (CRL4B) and
      polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetically regulates somatostatin
      secretion in islets. Constitutive ablation of CUL4B, the core component of the
      CRL4B-PRC2 complex, in delta cells impaired glucose tolerance and decreased
      insulin secretion through enhanced somatostatin release. Moreover, mechanistic
      studies showed that the CRL4B-PRC2 complex, under the control of the delta
      cell-specific transcription factor hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX),
      determines the levels of intracellular calcium and cAMP through histone
      posttranslational modifications, thereby altering expression of the Cav1.2
      calcium channel and adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6) and modulating somatostatin
      secretion. In response to high glucose levels or urocortin 3 (UCN3) stimulation, 
      increased expression of cullin 4B (CUL4B) and the PRC2 subunit histone-lysine
      N-methyltransferase EZH2 and reciprocal decreases in Cav1.2 and AC6 expression
      were found to regulate somatostatin secretion. Our results reveal an epigenetic
      regulatory mechanism of delta cell paracrine interactions in which CRL4B-PRC2
      complexes, Cav1.2, and AC6 expression fine-tune somatostatin secretion and
      facilitate glucose homeostasis in pancreatic islets.

AB  - The progressive death of retinal ganglion cells and resulting visual deficits are
      hallmarks of glaucoma, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In many
      neurodegenerative diseases, cell death induced by primary insult is followed by a
      wave of secondary loss. Gap junctions (GJs), intercellular channels composed of
      subunit connexins, can play a major role in secondary cell death by forming
      conduits through which toxic molecules from dying cells pass to and injure
      coupled neighbors. Here we have shown that pharmacological blockade of GJs or
      genetic ablation of connexin 36 (Cx36) subunits, which are highly expressed by
      retinal neurons, markedly reduced loss of neurons and optic nerve axons in a
      mouse model of glaucoma. Further, functional parameters that are negatively
      affected in glaucoma, including the electroretinogram, visual evoked potential,
      visual spatial acuity, and contrast sensitivity, were maintained at control
      levels when Cx36 was ablated. Neuronal GJs may thus represent potential
      therapeutic targets to prevent the progressive neurodegeneration and visual
      impairment associated with glaucoma.

AB  - Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) are benign tumors of the adrenal gland that
      constitutively produce the salt-retaining steroid hormone aldosterone and cause
      millions of cases of severe hypertension worldwide. Either of 2 somatic mutations
      in the potassium channel KCNJ5 (G151R and L168R, hereafter referred to as
      KCNJ5MUT) in adrenocortical cells account for half of APAs worldwide. These
      mutations alter channel selectivity to allow abnormal Na+ conductance, resulting 
      in membrane depolarization, calcium influx, aldosterone production, and cell
      proliferation. Because APA diagnosis requires a difficult invasive procedure,
      patients often remain undiagnosed and inadequately treated. Inhibitors of
      KCNJ5MUT could allow noninvasive diagnosis and therapy of APAs carrying KCNJ5
      mutations. Here, we developed a high-throughput screen for rescue of
      KCNJ5MUT-induced lethality and identified a series of macrolide antibiotics,
      including roxithromycin, that potently inhibit KCNJ5MUT, but not KCNJ5WT.
      Electrophysiology demonstrated direct KCNJ5MUT inhibition. In human
      aldosterone-producing adrenocortical cancer cell lines, roxithromycin inhibited
      KCNJ5MUT-induced induction of CYP11B2 (encoding aldosterone synthase) expression 
      and aldosterone production. Further exploration of macrolides showed that
      KCNJ5MUT was similarly selectively inhibited by idremcinal, a macrolide motilin
      receptor agonist, and by synthesized macrolide derivatives lacking antibiotic or 
      motilide activity. Macrolide-derived selective KCNJ5MUT inhibitors thus have the 
      potential to advance the diagnosis and treatment of APAs harboring KCNJ5MUT.

TI  - Lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 promotes cyst growth in autosomal dominant
      polycystic kidney disease.

AB  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is driven by mutations in
      PKD1 and PKD2 genes. Recent work suggests that epigenetic modulation of gene
      expression and protein function may play a role in ADPKD pathogenesis. In this
      study, we identified SMYD2, a SET and MYND domain protein with lysine
      methyltransferase activity, as a regulator of renal cyst growth. SMYD2 was
      upregulated in renal epithelial cells and tissues from Pkd1-knockout mice as well
      as in ADPKD patients. SMYD2 deficiency delayed renal cyst growth in postnatal
      kidneys from Pkd1 mutant mice. Pkd1 and Smyd2 double-knockout mice lived longer
      than Pkd1-knockout mice. Targeting SMYD2 with its specific inhibitor, AZ505,
      delayed cyst growth in both early- and later-stage Pkd1 conditional knockout
      mouse models. SMYD2 carried out its function via methylation and activation of
      STAT3 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, leading to increased cystic renal
      epithelial cell proliferation and survival. We further identified two positive
      feedback loops that integrate epigenetic regulation and renal inflammation in
      cyst development: SMYD2/IL-6/STAT3/SMYD2 and SMYD2/TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB/SMYD2.
      These pathways provide mechanisms by which SMYD2 might be induced by cyst fluid
      IL-6 and TNF-alpha in ADPKD kidneys. The SMYD2 transcriptional target gene Ptpn13
      also linked SMYD2 to other PKD-associated signaling pathways, including ERK,
      mTOR, and Akt signaling, via PTPN13-mediated phosphorylation.

AB  - The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (alloSCT) is potent against chronic phase chronic myelogenous
      leukemia (CP-CML), but blast crisis CML (BC-CML) and acute myeloid leukemias
      (AML) are GVL resistant. To understand GVL resistance, we studied GVL against
      mouse models of CP-CML, BC-CML, and AML generated by the transduction of mouse BM
      with fusion cDNAs derived from human leukemias. Prior work has shown that CD4+ T 
      cell-mediated GVL against CP-CML and BC-CML required intact leukemia MHCII;
      however, stem cells from both leukemias were MHCII negative. Here, we show that
      CP-CML, BC-CML, and AML stem cells upregulate MHCII in alloSCT recipients. Using 
      gene-deficient leukemias, we determined that BC-CML and AML MHC upregulation
      required IFN-gamma stimulation, whereas CP-CML MHC upregulation was independent
      of both the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) and the IFN-alpha/beta receptor
      IFNAR1. Importantly, IFN-gammaR-deficient BC-CML and AML were completely
      resistant to CD4- and CD8-mediated GVL, whereas IFN-gammaR/IFNAR1
      double-deficient CP-CML was fully GVL sensitive. Mouse AML and BC-CML stem cells 
      were MHCI+ without IFN-gamma stimulation, suggesting that IFN-gamma sensitizes
      these leukemias to T cell killing by mechanisms other than MHC upregulation. Our 
      studies identify the requirement of IFN-gamma stimulation as a mechanism for
      BC-CML and AML GVL resistance, whereas independence from IFN-gamma renders CP-CML
      more GVL sensitive, even with a lower-level alloimmune response.

AB  - Solid organ transplantation is a curative therapy for hundreds of thousands of
      patients with end-stage organ failure. However, long-term outcomes have not
      improved, and nearly half of transplant recipients will lose their allografts by 
      10 years after transplant. One of the major challenges facing clinical
      transplantation is antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) caused by anti-donor HLA
      antibodies. AMR is highly associated with graft loss, but unfortunately there are
      few efficacious therapies to prevent and reverse AMR. This Review describes the
      clinical and histological manifestations of AMR, and discusses the
      immunopathological mechanisms contributing to antibody-mediated allograft injury 
      as well as current and emerging therapies.

AB  - Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are at high risk for reactivation of 
      the varicella zoster virus (VZV) and development of herpes zoster (HZ). Here, we 
      found that macrophages from patients with CAD actively suppress T cell activation
      and expansion, leading to defective VZV-specific T cell immunity.
      Monocyte-derived and plaque-infiltrating macrophages from patients with CAD
      spontaneously expressed high surface density of the immunoinhibitory ligand
      programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), thereby providing negative signals to
      programmed death-1+ (PD-1+) T cells. We determined that aberrant PD-L1 expression
      in patient-derived macrophages was metabolically controlled. Oversupply of the
      glycolytic intermediate pyruvate in mitochondria from CAD macrophages promoted
      expression of PD-L1 via induction of the bone morphogenetic protein
      4/phosphorylated SMAD1/5/IFN regulatory factor 1 (BMP4/p-SMAD1/5/IRF1) signaling 
      pathway. Thus, CAD macrophages respond to nutrient excess by activating the
      immunoinhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint, leading to impaired T cell immunity. This
      finding indicates that metabolite-based immunotherapy may be a potential strategy
      for restoring adaptive immunity in CAD.

AB  - Design of efficacious Treg-based therapies and establishment of clinical
      tolerance in autoimmune diseases have proven to be challenging. The clinical
      implementation of Treg immunotherapy has been hampered by various impediments
      related to the stability and isolation procedures of Tregs as well as the
      specific in vivo targets of Treg modalities. Herein, we have demonstrated that
      Foxp3+ Tregs potently suppress autoimmune responses in vivo through inhibition of
      the autophagic machinery in DCs in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein
      4-dependent (CTLA4-dependent) manner. Autophagy-deficient DCs exhibited reduced
      immunogenic potential and failed to prime autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells to
      mediate autoimmunity. Mechanistically, CTLA4 binding promoted activation of the
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis and FoxO1 nuclear exclusion in DCs, leading to decreased
      transcription of the autophagy component microtubule-associated protein 1 light
      chain 3beta (Lc3b). Human DCs treated with CTLA4-Ig, a fusion protein composed of
      the Fc region of IgG1 and the extracellular domain of CTLA4 (also known as
      abatacept, marketed as Orencia), demonstrated reduced levels of autophagosome
      formation, while DCs from CTLA4-Ig-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients
      displayed diminished LC3B transcripts. Collectively, our data identify the
      canonical autophagy pathway in DCs as a molecular target of Foxp3+ Treg-mediated 
      suppression that leads to amelioration of autoimmune responses. These findings
      may pave the way for the development of therapeutic protocols that exploit Tregs 
      for the treatment of autoimmunity as well as diseases in which disturbed
      tolerance is a common denominator.

AB  - Chronic viral infections are difficult to treat, and new approaches are needed,
      particularly those aimed at reducing reactivation by enhancing immune responses. 
      Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency and reactivates frequently, and
      breakthrough reactivation can occur despite suppressive antiviral therapy.
      Virus-specific T cells are important to control HSV, and proliferation of
      activated T cells requires increased metabolism of glutamine. Here, we found that
      supplementation with oral glutamine reduced virus reactivation in latently
      HSV-1-infected mice and HSV-2-infected guinea pigs. Transcriptome analysis of
      trigeminal ganglia from latently HSV-1-infected, glutamine-treated WT mice showed
      upregulation of several IFN-gamma-inducible genes. In contrast to WT mice,
      supplemental glutamine was ineffective in reducing the rate of HSV-1 reactivation
      in latently HSV-1-infected IFN-gamma-KO mice. Mice treated with glutamine also
      had higher numbers of HSV-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD8 T cells in latently
      infected ganglia. Thus, glutamine may enhance the IFN-gamma-associated immune
      response and reduce the rate of reactivation of latent virus infection.

TI  - Altered homeostatic regulation of innate and adaptive immunity in lower
      gastrointestinal tract GVHD pathogenesis.
PG  - 2441-2451
LID - 10.1172/JCI90592 [doi]
LID - 90592 [pii]
AB  - Lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the
      predominant cause of morbidity and mortality from GVHD after allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation. Recent data indicate that lower GI tract GVHD is a complicated
      process mediated by donor/host antigenic disparities. This process is exacerbated
      by significant changes to the microbiome, and innate and adaptive immune
      responses that are critical to the induction of disease, persistence of
      inflammation, and a lack of response to therapy. Here, we discuss new insights
      into the biology of lower GI tract GVHD and focus on intrinsic pathways and
      regulatory mechanisms crucial to normal intestinal function. We then describe
      multiple instances in which these homeostatic mechanisms are altered by donor T
      cells or conditioning therapy, resulting in exacerbation of GVHD. We also discuss
      data suggesting that some of these mechanisms produce biomarkers that could be
      informative as to the severity of GVHD and its response to therapy. Finally,
      novel therapies that might restore homeostasis in the GI tract during GVHD are
      highlighted.

TI  - Neuropeptide FF increases M2 activation and self-renewal of adipose tissue
      macrophages.
PG  - 2842-2854
LID - 10.1172/JCI90152 [doi]
LID - 90152 [pii]
AB  - The quantity and activation state of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) impact the
      development of obesity-induced metabolic diseases. Appetite-controlling hormones 
      play key roles in obesity; however, our understanding of their effects on ATMs is
      limited. Here, we have shown that human and mouse ATMs express NPFFR2, a receptor
      for the appetite-reducing neuropeptide FF (NPFF), and that NPFFR2 expression is
      upregulated by IL-4, an M2-polarizing cytokine. Plasma levels of NPFF decreased
      in obese patients and high-fat diet-fed mice and increased following caloric
      restriction. NPFF promoted M2 activation and increased the proliferation of
      murine and human ATMs. Both M2 activation and increased ATM proliferation were
      abolished in NPFFR2-deficient ATMs. Mechanistically, the effects of NPFF involved
      the suppression of E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF128 expression, resulting in enhanced
      stability of phosphorylated STAT6 and increased transcription of the M2
      macrophage-associated genes IL-4 receptor alpha (Il4ra), arginase 1 (Arg1), IL-10
      (Il10), and alkylglycerol monooxygenase (Agmo). NPFF induced ATM proliferation
      concomitantly with the increase in N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (Ndrg2)
      expression and suppressed the transcription of Ifi200 cell-cycle inhibitor family
      members and MAF bZIP transcription factor B (Mafb), a negative regulator of
      macrophage proliferation. NPFF thus plays an important role in supporting healthy
      adipose tissue via the maintenance of metabolically beneficial ATMs.

AB  - Photopharmacological control of neuronal activity using synthetic photochromic
      ligands, or photoswitches, is a promising approach for restoring visual function 
      in patients suffering from degenerative retinal diseases. Azobenzene
      photoswitches, such as AAQ and DENAQ, have been shown to restore the responses of
      retinal ganglion cells to light in mouse models of retinal degeneration but do
      not recapitulate native retinal signal processing. Here, we describe
      diethylamino-azo-diethylamino (DAD), a third-generation photoswitch that is
      capable of restoring retinal ganglion cell light responses to blue or white
      light. In acute brain slices of murine layer 2/3 cortical neurons, we determined 
      that the photoswitch quickly relaxes to its inactive form in the dark. DAD is not
      permanently charged, and the uncharged form enables the photoswitch to rapidly
      and effectively cross biological barriers and thereby access and photosensitize
      retinal neurons. Intravitreal injection of DAD restored retinal light responses
      and light-driven behavior to blind mice. Unlike DENAQ, DAD acts upstream of
      retinal ganglion cells, primarily conferring light sensitivity to bipolar cells. 
      Moreover, DAD was capable of generating ON and OFF visual responses in the blind 
      retina by utilizing intrinsic retinal circuitry, which may be advantageous for
      restoring visual function.

AB  - NK cells are highly efficient at preventing cancer metastasis but are
      infrequently found in the core of primary tumors. Here, have we demonstrated that
      freshly isolated mouse and human NK cells express low levels of the
      endo-beta-D-glucuronidase heparanase that increase upon NK cell activation.
      Heparanase deficiency did not affect development, differentiation, or tissue
      localization of NK cells under steady-state conditions. However, mice lacking
      heparanase specifically in NK cells (Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice) were highly tumor
      prone when challenged with the carcinogen methylcholanthrene (MCA). Hpsefl/fl
      NKp46-iCre mice were also more susceptible to tumor growth than were their
      littermate controls when challenged with the established mouse lymphoma cell line
      RMA-S-RAE-1beta, which overexpresses the NK cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand
      RAE-1beta, or when inoculated with metastatic melanoma, prostate carcinoma, or
      mammary carcinoma cell lines. NK cell invasion of primary tumors and recruitment 
      to the site of metastasis were strictly dependent on the presence of heparanase. 
      Cytokine and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for metastases was
      compromised when NK cells lacked heparanase. Our data suggest that heparanase
      plays a critical role in NK cell invasion into tumors and thereby tumor
      progression and metastases. This should be considered when systemically treating 
      cancer patients with heparanase inhibitors, since the potential adverse effect on
      NK cell infiltration might limit the antitumor activity of the inhibitors.

AB  - Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant human disorder
      characterized by abnormal bone development that is mainly due to defective
      intramembranous bone formation by osteoblasts. Here, we describe a mouse strain
      lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146 that shows phenotypic similarities to CCD.
      Loss of RNF146 stabilized its substrate AXIN1, leading to impairment of
      WNT3a-induced beta-catenin activation and reduced Fgf18 expression in
      osteoblasts. We show that FGF18 induces transcriptional coactivator with
      PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) expression, which is required for osteoblast
      proliferation and differentiation through transcriptional enhancer associate
      domain (TEAD) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) transcription
      factors, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that adipogenesis is enhanced in
      Rnf146-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Moreover, mice with loss of RNF146 within 
      the osteoblast lineage had increased fat stores and were glucose intolerant with 
      severe osteopenia because of defective osteoblastogenesis and subsequent impaired
      osteocalcin production. These findings indicate that RNF146 is required to
      coordinate beta-catenin signaling within the osteoblast lineage during embryonic 
      and postnatal bone development.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disorder associated with compromised bone
      strength and an increased risk of fracture. Inhibition of the differentiation of 
      bone-resorbing osteoclasts is an effective strategy for the treatment of
      osteoporosis. Prior work by our laboratory and others has shown that MYC promotes
      osteoclastogenesis in vitro, but the underlying mechanisms are not well
      understood. In addition, the in vivo importance of osteoclast-expressed MYC in
      physiological and pathological bone loss is not known. Here, we have demonstrated
      that deletion of Myc in osteoclasts increases bone mass and protects mice from
      ovariectomy-induced (OVX-induced) osteoporosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 
      that MYC drives metabolic reprogramming during osteoclast differentiation and
      functions as a metabolic switch to an oxidative state. We identified a role for
      MYC action in the transcriptional induction of estrogen receptor-related receptor
      alpha (ERRalpha), a nuclear receptor that cooperates with the transcription
      factor nuclear factor of activated T cells, c1 (NFATc1) to drive
      osteoclastogenesis. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of ERRalpha
      attenuated OVX-induced bone loss in mice. Our findings highlight a MYC/ERRalpha
      pathway that contributes to physiological and pathological bone loss by
      integrating the MYC/ERRalpha axis to drive metabolic reprogramming during
      osteoclast differentiation.

PG  - 2829-2841

LID - 90562 [pii]
AB  - Chronic liver disease with cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the
      United States, and alcoholic liver disease accounts for approximately half of all
      cirrhosis deaths. Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with intestinal
      bacterial dysbiosis, yet we understand little about the contribution of
      intestinal fungi, or mycobiota, to alcoholic liver disease. Here we have
      demonstrated that chronic alcohol administration increases mycobiota populations 
      and translocation of fungal beta-glucan into systemic circulation in mice.
      Treating mice with antifungal agents reduced intestinal fungal overgrowth,
      decreased beta-glucan translocation, and ameliorated ethanol-induced liver
      disease. Using bone marrow chimeric mice, we found that beta-glucan induces liver
      inflammation via the C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC7A on Kupffer cells and
      possibly other bone marrow-derived cells. Subsequent increases in IL-1beta
      expression and secretion contributed to hepatocyte damage and promoted
      development of ethanol-induced liver disease. We observed that alcohol-dependent 
      patients displayed reduced intestinal fungal diversity and Candida overgrowth.
      Compared with healthy individuals and patients with non-alcohol-related
      cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis patients had increased systemic exposure and
      immune response to mycobiota. Moreover, the levels of extraintestinal exposure
      and immune response correlated with mortality. Thus, chronic alcohol consumption 
      is associated with an altered mycobiota and translocation of fungal products.
      Manipulating the intestinal mycobiome might be an effective strategy for
      attenuating alcohol-related liver disease.

AB  - Endogenous danger signals, or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are
      generated in response to cell stress and activate innate immunity to provide a
      pivotal mechanism by which an organism can respond to damaged self. Accumulating 
      experimental and clinical data have established the importance of DAMPs, which
      signal through innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) or DAMP-specific
      receptors, in regulating the alloresponse to solid organ transplantation (SOT).
      Moreover, DAMPs may incite distinct downstream cellular responses that could
      specifically contribute to the development of allograft fibrosis and chronic
      graft dysfunction. A growing understanding of the role of DAMPs in directing the 
      immune response to transplantation has suggested novel avenues for the treatment 
      or prevention of allograft rejection that complement contemporary
      immunosuppression and could lead to improved outcomes for solid organ recipients.

TI  - RASA1 regulates the function of lymphatic vessel valves in mice.
PG  - 2569-2585
LID - 10.1172/JCI89607 [doi]
LID - 89607 [pii]
AB  - Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) is a blood and
      lymphatic vessel (LV) disorder that is caused by inherited inactivating mutations
      of the RASA1 gene, which encodes p120 RasGAP (RASA1), a negative regulator of the
      Ras small GTP-binding protein. How RASA1 mutations lead to the LV leakage defects
      that occur in CM-AVM is not understood. Here, we report that disruption of the
      Rasa1 gene in adult mice resulted in loss of LV endothelial cells (LECs)
      specifically from the leaflets of intraluminal valves in collecting LVs. As a
      result, valves were unable to prevent fluid backflow and the vessels were
      ineffective pumps. Furthermore, disruption of Rasa1 in midgestation resulted in
      LEC apoptosis in developing LV valves and consequently failed LV valvulogenesis. 
      Similar phenotypes were observed in induced RASA1-deficient adult mice and
      embryos expressing a catalytically inactive RASA1R780Q mutation. Thus, RASA1
      catalytic activity is essential for the function and development of LV valves.
      These data provide a partial explanation for LV leakage defects and potentially
      other LV abnormalities observed in CM-AVM.

TI  - The many ways of osteoclast activation.
PG  - 2530-2532
LID - 10.1172/JCI94606 [doi]
LID - 94606 [pii]
AB  - Osteoclasts are the cells responsible for bone resorption, a process that is
      essential for the maintenance of healthy bones. Bone diseases, such as
      osteoporosis, which are characterized by high rates of bone resorption and loss
      of bone mass, may benefit from treatments that inhibit osteoclast formation
      and/or function. The RANKL/RANK pathway is critical for both osteoclast formation
      and function, and these effects are thought to be mediated by the transcription
      factor nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). In this issue
      of the JCI, Bae et al. challenge the convention that NFATc1 is the sole critical 
      regulator of RANKL/RANK-dependent osteoclast activation. Specifically, the
      authors show that MYC drives metabolic reprogramming in osteoclasts and that MYC 
      induces estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) to regulate
      osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, both loss of MYC and pharmacological inhibition 
      of ERRalpha attenuated bone loss in a mouse model of osteoporosis. Together, the 
      results of this study suggest that the MYC/ERRalpha pathway should be further
      explored as a drug target for bone diseases.

TI  - Genetic regulation of the RUNX transcription factor family has antitumor effects.
PG  - 2815-2828
LID - 10.1172/JCI91788 [doi]
LID - 91788 [pii]
AB  - Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is generally considered to function
      as a tumor suppressor in the development of leukemia, but a growing body of
      evidence suggests that it has pro-oncogenic properties in acute myeloid leukemia 
      (AML). Here we have demonstrated that the antileukemic effect mediated by RUNX1
      depletion is highly dependent on a functional p53-mediated cell death pathway.
      Increased expression of other RUNX family members, including RUNX2 and RUNX3,
      compensated for the antitumor effect elicited by RUNX1 silencing, and
      simultaneous attenuation of all RUNX family members as a cluster led to a much
      stronger antitumor effect relative to suppression of individual RUNX members.
      Switching off the RUNX cluster using alkylating agent-conjugated
      pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides, which were designed to specifically bind to
      consensus RUNX-binding sequences, was highly effective against AML cells and
      against several poor-prognosis solid tumors in a xenograft mouse model of AML
      without notable adverse events. Taken together, these results identify a crucial 
      role for the RUNX cluster in the maintenance and progression of cancer cells and 
      suggest that modulation of the RUNX cluster using the PI polyamide gene-switch
      technology is a potential strategy to control malignancies.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with a prevalence of
      1 million persons worldwide. The fibrosis spreads from affected alveoli into
      contiguous alveoli and leads to death by asphyxiation. We previously discovered
      that the IPF lung harbors fibrogenic mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) that
      serve as a cell of origin for disease-mediating myofibroblasts. In a prior
      genomewide transcriptional analysis, we found that IPF MPCs displayed increased
      expression of S100 calcium-binding A4 (S100A4), a protein linked to cancer cell
      proliferation and invasiveness. Here, we have examined whether S100A4 mediates
      MPC fibrogenicity. Ex vivo analysis revealed that IPF MPCs had increased levels
      of nuclear S100A4, which interacts with L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase to
      promote p53 degradation and MPC self-renewal. In vivo, injection of human IPF
      MPCs converted a self-limited bleomycin-induced mouse model of lung fibrosis to a
      model of persistent fibrosis in an S100A4-dependent manner. S100A4 gain of
      function was sufficient to confer fibrotic properties to non-IPF MPCs. In IPF
      tissue, fibroblastic foci contained cells expressing Ki67 and the MPC markers
      SSEA4 and S100A4. The expression colocalized in an interface region between
      myofibroblasts in the focus core and normal alveolar structures, defining this
      region as an active fibrotic front. Our findings indicate that IPF MPCs are
      intrinsically fibrogenic and that S100A4 confers MPCs with fibrogenicity.

AB  - Voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) mutations cause genetic pain disorders that
      range from severe paroxysmal pain to a congenital inability to sense pain.
      Previous studies on NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 established clear relationships between
      perturbations in channel function and divergent clinical phenotypes. By contrast,
      studies of NaV1.9 mutations have not revealed a clear relationship of channel
      dysfunction with the associated and contrasting clinical phenotypes. Here, we
      have elucidated the functional consequences of a NaV1.9 mutation (L1302F) that is
      associated with insensitivity to pain. We investigated the effects of L1302F and 
      a previously reported mutation (L811P) on neuronal excitability. In transfected
      heterologous cells, the L1302F mutation caused a large hyperpolarizing shift in
      the voltage-dependence of activation, leading to substantially enhanced overlap
      between activation and steady-state inactivation relationships. In transfected
      small rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, expression of L1302F and L811P evoked
      large depolarizations of the resting membrane potential and impaired action
      potential generation. Therefore, our findings implicate a cellular loss of
      function as the basis for impaired pain sensation. We further demonstrated that a
      U-shaped relationship between the resting potential and the neuronal action
      potential threshold explains why NaV1.9 mutations that evoke small degrees of
      membrane depolarization cause hyperexcitability and familial episodic pain
      disorder or painful neuropathy, while mutations evoking larger membrane
      depolarizations cause hypoexcitability and insensitivity to pain.

LID - 88696 [pii]
AB  - TGF-beta is considered a master switch in the pathogenesis of organ fibrosis. The
      primary mediators of this activity are the SMAD proteins, particularly SMAD3. In 
      the current study, we have developed a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) conjugate
      of the HIV TAT protein that is fused to an aminoterminal sequence of sorting
      nexin 9 (SNX9), which was previously shown to bind phosphorylated SMAD3 (pSMAD3).
      We determined that specifically preventing the nuclear import of pSMAD3 using the
      TAT-SNX9 peptide inhibited profibrotic TGF-beta activity in murine cells and
      human lung fibroblasts as well as in vivo with no demonstrable toxicity. TGF-beta
      signaling mediated by pSMAD2, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), EGF, or PDGF
      was unaffected by the TAT-SNX9 peptide. Furthermore, while the TAT-SNX9 peptide
      prevented TGF-beta's profibrotic activity in vitro as well as in 2 murine
      treatment models of pulmonary fibrosis, a 3-amino acid point mutant that was
      unable to bind pSMAD3 proved ineffective. These findings indicate that
      specifically targeting pSMAD3 can ameliorate both the direct and indirect
      fibroproliferative actions of TGF-beta.

AB  - An increasing number of older people receive organ transplants for various
      end-stage conditions. Although organ transplantation is an effective therapy for 
      older patients (i.e., older than 65 years of age), such as in end-stage renal
      disease, this therapy has not been optimized for older patients because of our
      lack of understanding of the effect of aging and the immune response to organ
      transplantation. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of aging on both the 
      allograft and the recipient and its effect on the immune response to organ
      transplantation. We describe what has been determined to date, discuss existing
      gaps in our knowledge, and make suggestions on necessary future studies to
      optimize organ transplantation for older people.

LID - 90596 [pii]
AB  - Although gene-environment interactions have been investigated for many years to
      understand people's susceptibility to autoimmune diseases or cancer, a role for
      environmental factors in modulating alloimmune responses and transplant outcomes 
      is only now beginning to emerge. New data suggest that diet, hyperlipidemia,
      pollutants, commensal microbes, and pathogenic infections can all affect T cell
      activation, differentiation, and the kinetics of graft rejection. These
      observations reveal opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions to improve 
      graft outcomes as well as for noninvasive biomarker discovery to predict or
      diagnose graft deterioration before it becomes irreversible. In this Review, we
      will focus on the impact of these environmental factors on immune function and,
      when known, on alloimmune function, as well as on transplant fate.

AB  - There are many causes of inflammatory osteolysis, but regardless of etiology and 
      cellular contexts, the osteoclast is the bone-degrading cell. Thus, the impact of
      inflammatory cytokines on osteoclast formation and function was among the most
      important discoveries advancing the treatment of focal osteolysis, leading to
      development of therapeutic agents that either directly block the bone-resorptive 
      cell or do so indirectly via cytokine arrest. Despite these advances, a
      substantial number of patients with inflammatory arthritis remain resistant to
      current therapies, and even effective anti-inflammatory drugs frequently do not
      repair damaged bone. Thus, insights into events such as those impacted by
      inflammasomes, which signal through cytokine-dependent and -independent
      mechanisms, are needed to optimize treatment of inflammatory osteolysis.

TI  - Inflammasomes and IL-1 biology in the pathogenesis of allograft dysfunction.
PG  - 2022-2029
LID - 10.1172/JCI93537 [doi]
LID - 93537 [pii]
AB  - Inflammasomes are high-molecular-weight cytosolic complexes that mediate the
      activation of caspases. There are many inflammasomes, and each is influenced by a
      unique pattern-recognition receptor response. Two signals are typically involved 
      in the inflammasome pathways. Signal one involves recognition of
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as LPS or other
      colonizing/invading microbes, that interact with TLRs, which induce the
      downstream production of pro-IL-1beta. This is followed by signal two, which
      involves recognition of PAMPs or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs),
      such as uric acid or ATP, via NLRP3, which leads to caspase-1-dependent cleavage 
      of pro-IL-1beta to active IL-1beta and pyroptosis. Ultimately, these two signals 
      cause the release of multiple proinflammatory cytokines. Both PAMPs and DAMPs can
      be liberated by early insults to the allograft, including ischemia/reperfusion
      injury, infections, and rejection. The consequence of inflammasome activation and
      IL-1 expression is the upregulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines, which
      leads to allograft neutrophil sequestration, mononuclear phagocyte recruitment,
      and T cell activation, all of which are key steps in the continuum from allograft
      insult to chronic allograft dysfunction.

AB  - Following migration of primordial germ cells to the genital ridge, oogonia
      undergo several rounds of mitotic division and enter meiosis at approximately
      E13.5. Most oocytes arrest in the dictyate (diplotene) stage of meiosis circa
      E18.5. The genes necessary to drive oocyte differentiation in parallel with
      meiosis are unknown. Here, we have investigated whether expression of
      spermatogenesis and oogenesis bHLH transcription factor 1 (Sohlh1) and Sohlh2
      coordinates oocyte differentiation within the embryonic ovary. We found that
      SOHLH2 protein was expressed in the mouse germline as early as E12.5 and preceded
      SOHLH1 protein expression, which occurred circa E15.5. SOHLH1 protein appearance 
      at E15.5 correlated with SOHLH2 translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus
      and was dependent on SOHLH1 expression. NOBOX oogenesis homeobox (NOBOX) and LIM 
      homeobox protein 8 (LHX8), two important regulators of postnatal oogenesis, were 
      coexpressed with SOHLH1. Single deficiency of Sohlh1 or Sohlh2 disrupted the
      expression of LHX8 and NOBOX in the embryonic gonad without affecting meiosis.
      Sohlh1-KO infertility was rescued by conditional expression of the Sohlh1
      transgene after the onset of meiosis. However, Sohlh1 or Sohlh2 transgene
      expression could not rescue Sohlh2-KO infertility due to a lack of Sohlh1 or
      Sohlh2 expression in rescued mice. Our results indicate that Sohlh1 and Sohlh2
      are essential regulators of oocyte differentiation but do not affect meiosis I.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular
      disease, but the link between hyperglycemia and atherothrombotic disease is not
      completely understood. Patients with diabetes often show hyporesponsiveness to
      antiplatelet therapies, and it has been suggested that hyperreactive reticulated 
      platelets underlie this altered therapeutic response. In this issue of the JCI,
      Kraakman et al. uncover a previously unknown link between hyperglycemia and
      enhanced platelet production and reactivity. The authors demonstrate that high
      blood glucose levels trigger neutrophil release of S100 calcium-binding protein
      A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), which binds to the receptor for advanced glycation end
      products (RAGE) on Kupffer cells, ultimately leading to increased thrombopoietin 
      (TPO) production in the liver. TPO causes megakaryocyte proliferation and
      increased platelet production. This study demonstrates the importance of glycemic
      control and identifies potential therapeutic targets in the normalization of
      platelet numbers and function in diabetes.

TI  - Metabolic shifts in residual breast cancer drive tumor recurrence.
PG  - 2091-2105

LID - 89914 [pii]
AB  - Tumor recurrence is the leading cause of breast cancer-related death. Recurrences
      are largely driven by cancer cells that survive therapeutic intervention. This
      poorly understood population is referred to as minimal residual disease. Here,
      using mouse models that faithfully recapitulate human disease together with
      organoid cultures, we have demonstrated that residual cells acquire a
      transcriptionally distinct state from normal epithelium and primary tumors. Gene 
      expression changes and functional characterization revealed altered lipid
      metabolism and elevated ROS as hallmarks of the cells that survive tumor
      regression. These residual cells exhibited increased oxidative DNA damage,
      potentiating the acquisition of somatic mutations during hormonal-induced
      expansion of the mammary cell population. Inhibition of either cellular fatty
      acid synthesis or fatty acid transport into mitochondria reduced cellular ROS
      levels and DNA damage, linking these features to lipid metabolism. Direct
      perturbation of these hallmarks in vivo, either by scavenging ROS or by halting
      the cyclic mammary cell population expansion, attenuated tumor recurrence.
      Finally, these observations were mirrored in transcriptomic and histological
      signatures of residual cancer cells from neoadjuvant-treated breast cancer
      patients. These results highlight the potential of lipid metabolism and ROS as
      therapeutic targets for reducing tumor recurrence in breast cancer patients.

AB  - Observed deficits in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) function in a variety of human
      cancers have stimulated drug discovery efforts aimed at restoring PP2A function
      to inhibit tumor growth. Work published by Sangodkar et al. in this issue of the 
      JCI describes the characterization of orally available small molecule activators 
      of PP2A (SMAPs). These SMAPs attenuated mitogenic signaling and triggered
      apoptosis in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and inhibited tumor growth in murine
      models. Tumors with mutations in the SMAP-binding site of the PP2A A subunit
      displayed resistance to SMAPs. Future studies that identify the PP2A-regulated
      events targeted by SMAPs should guide critical decisions about which cancers
      might be best treated with these molecules. This study provides encouraging
      evidence in favor of SMAPs as potential anticancer drugs.

TI  - Neutrophil-derived S100 calcium-binding proteins A8/A9 promote reticulated
      thrombocytosis and atherogenesis in diabetes.

LID - 92450 [pii]
AB  - Platelets play a critical role in atherogenesis and thrombosis-mediated
      myocardial ischemia, processes that are accelerated in diabetes. Whether
      hyperglycemia promotes platelet production and whether enhanced platelet
      production contributes to enhanced atherothrombosis remains unknown. Here we
      found that in response to hyperglycemia, neutrophil-derived S100 calcium-binding 
      proteins A8/A9 (S100A8/A9) interact with the receptor for advanced glycation end 
      products (RAGE) on hepatic Kupffer cells, resulting in increased production of
      IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine that is implicated in inflammatory thrombocytosis.
      IL-6 acts on hepatocytes to enhance the production of thrombopoietin, which in
      turn interacts with its cognate receptor c-MPL on megakaryocytes and bone marrow 
      progenitor cells to promote their expansion and proliferation, resulting in
      reticulated thrombocytosis. Lowering blood glucose using a sodium-glucose
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin), depleting neutrophils or Kupffer
      cells, or inhibiting S100A8/A9 binding to RAGE (using paquinimod), all reduced
      diabetes-induced thrombocytosis. Inhibiting S100A8/A9 also decreased
      atherogenesis in diabetic mice. Finally, we found that patients with type 2
      diabetes have reticulated thrombocytosis that correlates with glycated hemoglobin
      as well as increased plasma S100A8/A9 levels. These studies provide insights into
      the mechanisms that regulate platelet production and may aid in the development
      of strategies to improve on current antiplatelet therapies and to reduce
      cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes.

AB  - Targeted cancer therapies, which act on specific cancer-associated molecular
      targets, are predominantly inhibitors of oncogenic kinases. While these drugs
      have achieved some clinical success, the inactivation of kinase signaling via
      stimulation of endogenous phosphatases has received minimal attention as an
      alternative targeted approach. Here, we have demonstrated that activation of the 
      tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a negative regulator of multiple 
      oncogenic signaling proteins, is a promising therapeutic approach for the
      treatment of cancers. Our group previously developed a series of orally
      bioavailable small molecule activators of PP2A, termed SMAPs. We now report that 
      SMAP treatment inhibited the growth of KRAS-mutant lung cancers in mouse
      xenografts and transgenic models. Mechanistically, we found that SMAPs act by
      binding to the PP2A Aalpha scaffold subunit to drive conformational changes in
      PP2A. These results show that PP2A can be activated in cancer cells to inhibit
      proliferation. Our strategy of reactivating endogenous PP2A may be applicable to 
      the treatment of other diseases and represents an advancement toward the
      development of small molecule activators of tumor suppressor proteins.

AB  - The spermatogenesis/oogenesis helix-loop-helix (SOHLH) proteins SOHLH1 and SOHLH2
      play important roles in male and female reproduction. Although previous studies
      indicate that these transcriptional regulators are expressed in and have in vivo 
      roles in postnatal ovaries, their expression and function in the embryonic ovary 
      remain largely unknown. Because oocyte differentiation is tightly coupled with
      the onset of meiosis, it is of significant interest to determine how early oocyte
      transcription factors regulate these two processes. In this issue of the JCI,
      Shin and colleagues report that SOHLH1 and SOHLH2 demonstrate distinct expression
      patterns in the embryonic ovary and interact with each other and other
      oocyte-specific transcription factors to regulate oocyte differentiation.
      Interestingly, even though there is a rapid loss of oocytes postnatally in
      ovaries with combined loss of Sohlh1 and Sohlh2, meiosis is not affected and
      proceeds normally.

AB  - Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a largely incurable malignancy of B cell
      origin with plasmacytic differentiation. Here, we report the identification of a 
      highly effective inhibitor of PEL. This compound, 6-ethylthioinosine (6-ETI), is 
      a nucleoside analog with toxicity to PEL in vitro and in vivo, but not to other
      lymphoma cell lines tested. We developed and performed resistome analysis, an
      unbiased approach based on RNA sequencing of resistant subclones, to discover the
      molecular mechanisms of sensitivity. We found different adenosine
      kinase-inactivating (ADK-inactivating) alterations in all resistant clones and
      determined that ADK is required to phosphorylate and activate 6-ETI. Further, we 
      observed that 6-ETI induces ATP depletion and cell death accompanied by S phase
      arrest and DNA damage only in ADK-expressing cells. Immunohistochemistry for ADK 
      served as a biomarker approach to identify 6-ETI-sensitive tumors, which we
      documented for other lymphoid malignancies with plasmacytic features. Notably,
      multiple myeloma (MM) expresses high levels of ADK, and 6-ETI was toxic to MM
      cell lines and primary specimens and had a robust antitumor effect in a
      disseminated MM mouse model. Several nucleoside analogs are effective in treating
      leukemias and T cell lymphomas, and 6-ETI may fill this niche for the treatment
      of PEL, plasmablastic lymphoma, MM, and other ADK-expressing cancers.

TI  - The RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin schedules apoptosis of pathogen-engaged

LID - 10.1172/JCI80631 [doi]
LID - 80631 [pii]
AB  - Protective responses against pathogens require a rapid mobilization of resting
      neutrophils and the timely removal of activated ones. Neutrophils are
      exceptionally short-lived leukocytes, yet it remains unclear whether the lifespan
      of pathogen-engaged neutrophils is regulated differently from that in the
      circulating steady-state pool. Here, we have found that under homeostatic
      conditions, the mRNA-destabilizing protein tristetraprolin (TTP) regulates
      apoptosis and the numbers of activated infiltrating murine neutrophils but not
      neutrophil cellularity. Activated TTP-deficient neutrophils exhibited decreased
      apoptosis and enhanced accumulation at the infection site. In the context of
      myeloid-specific deletion of Ttp, the potentiation of neutrophil deployment
      protected mice against lethal soft tissue infection with Streptococcus pyogenes
      and prevented bacterial dissemination. Neutrophil transcriptome analysis revealed
      that decreased apoptosis of TTP-deficient neutrophils was specifically associated
      with elevated expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1) but not other
      antiapoptotic B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family members. Higher Mcl1
      expression resulted from stabilization of Mcl1 mRNA in the absence of TTP. The
      low apoptosis rate of infiltrating TTP-deficient neutrophils was comparable to
      that of transgenic Mcl1-overexpressing neutrophils. Our study demonstrates that
      posttranscriptional gene regulation by TTP schedules the termination of the
      antimicrobial engagement of neutrophils. The balancing role of TTP comes at the
      cost of an increased risk of bacterial infections.

TI  - Molecular isoforms of high-mobility group box 1 are mechanistic biomarkers for
      epilepsy.
PG  - 2118-2132
LID - 10.1172/JCI92001 [doi]
LID - 92001 [pii]
AB  - Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients do not respond to antiepileptic drugs,
      representing an unmet medical need. There is evidence that neuroinflammation
      plays a pathogenic role in drug-resistant epilepsy. The high-mobility group box 1
      (HMGB1)/TLR4 axis is a key initiator of neuroinflammation following epileptogenic
      injuries, and its activation contributes to seizure generation in animal models. 
      However, further work is required to understand the role of HMGB1 and its
      isoforms in epileptogenesis and drug resistance. Using a combination of animal
      models and sera from clinically well-characterized patients, we have demonstrated
      that there are dynamic changes in HMGB1 isoforms in the brain and blood of
      animals undergoing epileptogenesis. The pathologic disulfide HMGB1 isoform
      progressively increased in blood before epilepsy onset and prospectively
      identified animals that developed the disease. Consistent with animal data, we
      observed early expression of disulfide HMGB1 in patients with newly diagnosed
      epilepsy, and its persistence was associated with subsequent seizures. In
      contrast with patients with well-controlled epilepsy, patients with chronic,
      drug-refractory epilepsy persistently expressed the acetylated, disulfide HMGB1
      isoforms. Moreover, treatment of animals with antiinflammatory drugs during
      epileptogenesis prevented both disease progression and blood increase in HMGB1
      isoforms. Our data suggest that HMGB1 isoforms are mechanistic biomarkers for
      epileptogenesis and drug-resistant epilepsy in humans, necessitating evaluation
      in larger-scale prospective studies.

LID - 10.1172/JCI88941 [doi]

AB  - The esophageal lumen is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium comprised of
      proliferative basal cells that differentiate while migrating toward the luminal
      surface and eventually desquamate. Rapid epithelial renewal occurs, but the
      specific cell of origin that supports this high proliferative demand remains
      unknown. Herein, we have described a long-lived progenitor cell population in the
      mouse esophageal epithelium that is characterized by expression of keratin 15
      (Krt15). Genetic in vivo lineage tracing revealed that the Krt15 promoter marks a
      long-lived basal cell population able to self-renew, proliferate, and generate
      differentiated cells, consistent with a progenitor/stem cell population.
      Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Krt15+ basal cells are molecularly
      distinct from Krt15- basal cells. Depletion of Krt15-derived cells resulted in
      decreased proliferation, thereby leading to atrophy of the esophageal epithelium.
      Further, Krt15+ cells were radioresistant and contributed to esophageal
      epithelial regeneration following radiation-induced injury. These results
      establish the presence of a long-lived and indispensable Krt15+ progenitor cell
      population that provides additional perspective on esophageal epithelial biology 
      and the widely prevalent diseases that afflict this epithelium.

      fetal-adult megakaryocyte transition.

AB  - Hematopoietic transitions that accompany fetal development, such as erythroid
      globin chain switching, play important roles in normal physiology and disease
      development. In the megakaryocyte lineage, human fetal progenitors do not execute
      the adult morphogenesis program of enlargement, polyploidization, and proplatelet
      formation. Although these defects decline with gestational stage, they remain
      sufficiently severe at birth to predispose newborns to thrombocytopenia. These
      defects may also contribute to inferior platelet recovery after cord blood stem
      cell transplantation and may underlie inefficient platelet production by
      megakaryocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells. In this study, comparison of 
      neonatal versus adult human progenitors has identified a blockade in the
      specialized positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) activation
      mechanism that is known to drive adult megakaryocyte morphogenesis. This blockade
      resulted from neonatal-specific expression of an oncofetal RNA-binding protein,
      IGF2BP3, which prevented the destabilization of the nuclear RNA 7SK, a process
      normally associated with adult megakaryocytic P-TEFb activation. Knockdown of
      IGF2BP3 sufficed to confer both phenotypic and molecular features of adult-type
      cells on neonatal megakaryocytes. Pharmacologic inhibition of IGF2BP3 expression 
      via bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibition also elicited adult
      features in neonatal megakaryocytes. These results identify IGF2BP3 as a human
      ontogenic master switch that restricts megakaryocyte development by modulating a 
      lineage-specific P-TEFb activation mechanism, revealing potential strategies
      toward enhancing platelet production.

TI  - Intermittent glucocorticoid steroid dosing enhances muscle repair without
      eliciting muscle atrophy.
PG  - 2418-2432
LID - 10.1172/JCI91445 [doi]
LID - 91445 [pii]
AB  - Glucocorticoid steroids such as prednisone are prescribed for chronic muscle
      conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where their use is associated
      with prolonged ambulation. The positive effects of chronic steroid treatment in
      muscular dystrophy are paradoxical because these steroids are also known to
      trigger muscle atrophy. Chronic steroid use usually involves once-daily dosing,
      although weekly dosing in children has been suggested for its reduced side
      effects on behavior. In this work, we tested steroid dosing in mice and found
      that a single pulse of glucocorticoid steroids improved sarcolemmal repair
      through increased expression of annexins A1 and A6, which mediate myofiber
      repair. This increased expression was dependent on glucocorticoid response
      elements upstream of annexins and was reinforced by the expression of forkhead
      box O1 (FOXO1). We compared weekly versus daily steroid treatment in mouse models
      of acute muscle injury and in muscular dystrophy and determined that both
      regimens provided comparable benefits in terms of annexin gene expression and
      muscle repair. However, daily dosing activated atrophic pathways, including F-box
      protein 32 (Fbxo32), which encodes atrogin-1. Conversely, weekly steroid
      treatment in mdx mice improved muscle function and histopathology and
      concomitantly induced the ergogenic transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 15
      (Klf15) while decreasing Fbxo32. These findings suggest that intermittent, rather
      than daily, glucocorticoid steroid regimen promotes sarcolemmal repair and muscle
      recovery from injury while limiting atrophic remodeling.

TI  - Ca2+ channel clustering with insulin-containing granules is disturbed in type 2
      diabetes.
PG  - 2353-2364
LID - 10.1172/JCI88491 [doi]
LID - 88491 [pii]
AB  - Loss of first-phase insulin secretion is an early sign of developing type 2
      diabetes (T2D). Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels triggers
      exocytosis of insulin-containing granules in pancreatic beta cells and is
      required for the postprandial spike in insulin secretion. Using high-resolution
      microscopy, we have identified a subset of docked insulin granules in human beta 
      cells and rat-derived clonal insulin 1 (INS1) cells for which localized Ca2+
      influx triggers exocytosis with high probability and minimal latency. This
      immediately releasable pool (IRP) of granules, identified both structurally and
      functionally, was absent in beta cells from human T2D donors and in INS1 cells
      cultured in fatty acids that mimic the diabetic state. Upon arrival at the plasma
      membrane, IRP granules slowly associated with 15 to 20 L-type channels. We
      determined that recruitment depended on a direct interaction with the synaptic
      protein Munc13, because expression of the II-III loop of the channel, the C2
      domain of Munc13-1, or of Munc13-1 with a mutated C2 domain all disrupted L-type 
      channel clustering at granules and ablated fast exocytosis. Thus, rapid insulin
      secretion requires Munc13-mediated recruitment of L-type Ca2+ channels in close
      proximity to insulin granules. Loss of this organization underlies disturbed
      insulin secretion kinetics in T2D.

AB  - Genetic variants at the solute carrier family 39 member 8 (SLC39A8) gene locus
      are associated with the regulation of whole-blood manganese (Mn) and multiple
      physiological traits. SLC39A8 encodes ZIP8, a divalent metal ion transporter best
      known for zinc transport. Here, we hypothesized that ZIP8 regulates Mn
      homeostasis and Mn-dependent enzymes to influence metabolism. We generated
      Slc39a8-inducible global-knockout (ZIP8-iKO) and liver-specific-knockout
      (ZIP8-LSKO) mice and observed markedly decreased Mn levels in multiple organs and
      whole blood of both mouse models. By contrast, liver-specific overexpression of
      human ZIP8 (adeno-associated virus-ZIP8 [AAV-ZIP8]) resulted in increased tissue 
      and whole blood Mn levels. ZIP8 expression was localized to the hepatocyte
      canalicular membrane, and bile Mn levels were increased in ZIP8-LSKO and
      decreased in AAV-ZIP8 mice. ZIP8-LSKO mice also displayed decreased liver and
      kidney activity of the Mn-dependent enzyme arginase. Both ZIP8-iKO and ZIP8-LSKO 
      mice had defective protein N-glycosylation, and humans homozygous for the minor
      allele at the lead SLC39A8 variant showed hypogalactosylation, consistent with
      decreased activity of another Mn-dependent enzyme,
      beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase. In summary, hepatic ZIP8 reclaims Mn from bile
      and regulates whole-body Mn homeostasis, thereby modulating the activity of
      Mn-dependent enzymes. This work provides a mechanistic basis for the association 
      of SLC39A8 with whole-blood Mn, potentially linking SLC39A8 variants with other
      physiological traits.

      (DNA-PK-mediated) nonhomologous end-joining, whereas DNA repair pathways mediated
      by poly(ADP)ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) serve as backups. Here we have designed a
      personalized medicine approach called gene expression and mutation analysis
      (GEMA) to identify BRCA- and DNA-PK-deficient leukemias either directly, using
      reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, microarrays, and flow cytometry, or
      indirectly, by the presence of oncogenes such as BCR-ABL1. DNA-PK-deficient
      quiescent leukemia cells and BRCA/DNA-PK-deficient proliferating leukemia cells
      were sensitive to PARP1 inhibitors that were administered alone or in combination
      with current antileukemic drugs. In conclusion, GEMA-guided targeting of PARP1
      resulted in dual cellular synthetic lethality in quiescent and proliferating
      immature leukemia cells, and is thus a potential approach to eradicate leukemia
      stem and progenitor cells that are responsible for initiation and manifestation
      of the disease. Further, an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database
      indicated that this personalized medicine approach could also be applied to treat
      numerous solid tumors from individual patients.

AB  - Generation of functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from
      human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has been a long-sought-after goal for use in 
      hematopoietic cell production, disease modeling, and eventually transplantation
      medicine. Homing of HSPCs from bloodstream to bone marrow (BM) is an important
      aspect of HSPC biology that has remained unaddressed in efforts to derive
      functional HSPCs from human PSCs. We have therefore examined the BM homing
      properties of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived HSPCs (hiPS-HSPCs). We 
      found that they express molecular effectors of BM extravasation, such as the
      chemokine receptor CXCR4 and the integrin dimer VLA-4, but lack expression of
      E-selectin ligands that program HSPC trafficking to BM. To overcome this
      deficiency, we expressed human fucosyltransferase 6 using modified mRNA.
      Expression of fucosyltransferase 6 resulted in marked increases in levels of cell
      surface E-selectin ligands. The glycoengineered cells exhibited enhanced
      tethering and rolling interactions on E-selectin-bearing endothelium under flow
      conditions in vitro as well as increased BM trafficking and extravasation when
      transplanted into mice. However, glycoengineered hiPS-HSPCs did not engraft
      long-term, indicating that additional functional deficiencies exist in these
      cells. Our results suggest that strategies toward increasing E-selectin ligand
      expression could be applicable as part of a multifaceted approach to optimize the
      production of HSPCs from human PSCs.

PG  - 2249-2261

LID - 89652 [pii]
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of severe infections that lead to
      bacteremia and high patient mortality. P. aeruginosa has evolved numerous evasion
      and subversion mechanisms that work in concert to overcome immune recognition and
      effector functions in hospitalized and immunosuppressed individuals. Here, we
      have used multilaser spinning-disk intravital microscopy to monitor the
      blood-borne stage in a murine bacteremic model of P. aeruginosa infection. P.
      aeruginosa adhered avidly to lung vasculature, where patrolling neutrophils and
      other immune cells were virtually blind to the pathogen's presence. This cloaking
      phenomenon was attributed to expression of Psl exopolysaccharide. Although an
      anti-Psl mAb activated complement and enhanced neutrophil recognition of P.
      aeruginosa, neutrophil-mediated clearance of the pathogen was suboptimal owing to
      a second subversion mechanism, namely the type 3 secretion (T3S) injectisome.
      Indeed, T3S prevented phagosome acidification and resisted killing inside these
      compartments. Antibody-mediated inhibition of the T3S protein PcrV did not
      enhance bacterial phagocytosis but did enhance killing of the few bacteria
      ingested by neutrophils. A bispecific mAb targeting both Psl and PcrV enhanced
      neutrophil uptake of P. aeruginosa and also greatly increased inhibition of T3S
      function, allowing for phagosome acidification and bacterial killing. These data 
      highlight the need to block multiple evasion and subversion mechanisms in tandem 
      to kill P. aeruginosa.

TI  - Disruption of lineage specification in adult pulmonary mesenchymal progenitor
      cells promotes microvascular dysfunction.
PG  - 2262-2276
LID - 10.1172/JCI88629 [doi]
LID - 88629 [pii]
AB  - Pulmonary vascular disease is characterized by remodeling and loss of
      microvessels and is typically attributed to pathological responses in vascular
      endothelium or abnormal smooth muscle cell phenotypes. We have challenged this
      understanding by defining an adult pulmonary mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC)
      that regulates both microvascular function and angiogenesis. The current
      understanding of adult MPCs and their roles in homeostasis versus disease has
      been limited by a lack of genetic markers with which to lineage label multipotent
      mesenchyme and trace the differentiation of these MPCs into vascular lineages.
      Here, we have shown that lineage-labeled lung MPCs expressing the ATP-binding
      cassette protein ABCG2 (ABCG2+) are pericyte progenitors that participate in
      microvascular homeostasis as well as adaptive angiogenesis. Activation of
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, either autonomously or downstream of decreased BMP
      receptor signaling, enhanced ABCG2+ MPC proliferation but suppressed MPC
      differentiation into a functional pericyte lineage. Thus, enhanced
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ABCG2+ MPCs drives a phenotype of persistent
      microvascular dysfunction, abnormal angiogenesis, and subsequent exacerbation of 
      bleomycin-induced fibrosis. ABCG2+ MPCs may, therefore, account in part for the
      aberrant microvessel function and remodeling that are associated with chronic
      lung diseases.

AB  - A large proportion of human T cells are autoreactive to group 1 CD1 proteins,
      which include CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c. However, the physiological role of the CD1
      proteins remains poorly defined. Here, we have generated a double-transgenic
      mouse model that expresses human CD1b and CD1c molecules (hCD1Tg) as well as a
      CD1b-autoreactive TCR (HJ1Tg) in the ApoE-deficient background (hCD1Tg HJ1Tg
      Apoe-/- mice) to determine the role of CD1-autoreactive T cells in
      hyperlipidemia-associated inflammatory diseases. We found that hCD1Tg HJ1Tg
      Apoe-/- mice spontaneously developed psoriasiform skin inflammation characterized
      by T cell and neutrophil infiltration and a Th17-biased cytokine response.
      Anti-IL-17A treatment ameliorated skin inflammation in vivo. Additionally,
      phospholipids and cholesterol preferentially accumulated in diseased skin and
      these autoantigens directly activated CD1b-autoreactive HJ1 T cells. Furthermore,
      hyperlipidemic serum enhanced IL-6 secretion by CD1b+ DCs and increased IL-17A
      production by HJ1 T cells. In psoriatic patients, the frequency of
      CD1b-autoreactive T cells was increased compared with that in healthy controls.
      Thus, this study has demonstrated the pathogenic role of CD1b-autoreactive T
      cells under hyperlipidemic conditions in a mouse model of spontaneous skin
      inflammation. As a large proportion of psoriatic patients are dyslipidemic, this 
      finding is of clinical significance and indicates that self-lipid-reactive T
      cells might serve as a possible link between hyperlipidemia and psoriasis.

TI  - Comparative oncogenomics identifies tyrosine kinase FES as a tumor suppressor in 
      melanoma.
PG  - 2310-2325
LID - 10.1172/JCI91291 [doi]
LID - 91291 [pii]
AB  - Identification and functional validation of oncogenic drivers are essential steps
      toward advancing cancer precision medicine. Here, we have presented a
      comprehensive analysis of the somatic genomic landscape of the widely used
      BRAFV600E- and NRASQ61K-driven mouse models of melanoma. By integrating the data 
      with publically available genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic information
      from human clinical samples, we confirmed the importance of several genes and
      pathways previously implicated in human melanoma, including the tumor-suppressor 
      genes phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A
      (CDKN2A), LKB1, and others. Importantly, this approach also identified additional
      putative melanoma drivers with prognostic and therapeutic relevance.
      Surprisingly, one of these genes encodes the tyrosine kinase FES. Whereas FES is 
      highly expressed in normal human melanocytes, FES expression is strongly
      decreased in over 30% of human melanomas. This downregulation correlates with
      poor overall survival. Correspondingly, engineered deletion of Fes accelerated
      tumor progression in a BRAFV600E-driven mouse model of melanoma. Together, these 
      data implicate FES as a driver of melanoma progression and demonstrate the
      potential of cross-species oncogenomic approaches combined with mouse modeling to
      uncover impactful mutations and oncogenic driver alleles with clinical importance
      in the treatment of human cancer.

TI  - Endocannabinoid signaling in hypothalamic circuits regulates arousal from general
      anesthesia in mice.
PG  - 2295-2309
LID - 10.1172/JCI91038 [doi]
LID - 91038 [pii]
AB  - Consciousness can be defined by two major attributes: awareness of environment
      and self, and arousal, which reflects the level of awareness. The return of
      arousal after general anesthesia presents an experimental tool for probing the
      neural mechanisms that control consciousness. Here we have identified that
      systemic or intracerebral injection of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R)
      antagonist AM281 into the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) - but not
      the adjacent perifornical area (Pef) or the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus of the
      hypothalamus (VLPO) - accelerates arousal in mice recovering from general
      anesthesia. Anesthetics selectively activated endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at 
      DMH glutamatergic but not GABAergic synapses, leading to suppression of both
      glutamatergic DMH-Pef and GABAergic DMH-VLPO projections. Deletion of CB1R from
      widespread cerebral cortical or prefrontal cortical (PFC) glutamatergic neurons, 
      including those innervating the DMH, mimicked the arousal-accelerating effects of
      AM281. In contrast, CB1R deletion from brain GABAergic neurons or hypothalamic
      glutamatergic neurons did not affect recovery time from anesthesia. Inactivation 
      of PFC-DMH, DMH-VLPO, or DMH-Pef projections blocked AM281-accelerated arousal,
      whereas activation of these projections mimicked the effects of AM281. We propose
      that decreased eCB signaling at glutamatergic terminals of the PFC-DMH projection
      accelerates arousal from general anesthesia through enhancement of the excitatory
      DMH-Pef projection, the inhibitory DMH-VLPO projection, or both.

TI  - Androgen receptor antagonism drives cytochrome P450 17A1 inhibitor efficacy in
      prostate cancer.

AB  - The clinical utility of inhibiting cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17), a cytochrome
      p450 enzyme that is required for the production of androgens, has been
      exemplified by the approval of abiraterone for the treatment of
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recently, however, it has been
      reported that CYP17 inhibitors can interact directly with the androgen receptor
      (AR). A phase I study recently reported that seviteronel, a CYP17 lyase-selective
      inhibitor, aedemonstrated a sustained reduction in prostate-specific antigen in a
      patient with CRPC, and another study showed seviteronel's direct effects on AR
      function. This suggested that seviteronel may have therapeutically relevant
      activities in addition to its ability to inhibit androgen production. Here, we
      have demonstrated that CYP17 inhibitors, with the exception of orteronel, can
      function as competitive AR antagonists. Conformational profiling revealed that
      the CYP17 inhibitor-bound AR adopted a conformation that resembled the unliganded
      AR (apo-AR), precluding nuclear localization and DNA binding. Further, we
      observed that seviteronel and abiraterone inhibited the growth of tumor
      xenografts expressing the clinically relevant mutation AR-F876L and that this
      activity could be attributed entirely to competitive AR antagonism. The results
      of this study suggest that the ability of CYP17 inhibitors to directly antagonize
      the AR may contribute to their clinical efficacy in CRPC.

AB  - It has been postulated that during human fetal development, all cells of the lung
      epithelium derive from embryonic, endodermal, NK2 homeobox 1-expressing (NKX2-1+)
      precursor cells. However, this hypothesis has not been formally tested owing to
      an inability to purify or track these progenitors for detailed characterization. 
      Here we have engineered and developmentally differentiated NKX2-1GFP reporter
      pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro to generate and isolate human primordial
      lung progenitors that express NKX2-1 but are initially devoid of differentiated
      lung lineage markers. After sorting to purity, these primordial lung progenitors 
      exhibited lung epithelial maturation. In the absence of mesenchymal coculture
      support, this NKX2-1+ population was able to generate epithelial-only spheroids
      in defined 3D cultures. Alternatively, when recombined with fetal mouse lung
      mesenchyme, the cells recapitulated epithelial-mesenchymal developing lung
      interactions. We imaged these progenitors in real time and performed time-series 
      global transcriptomic profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing as they moved
      through the earliest moments of lung lineage specification. The profiles
      indicated that evolutionarily conserved, stage-dependent gene signatures of early
      lung development are expressed in primordial human lung progenitors and revealed 
      a CD47hiCD26lo cell surface phenotype that allows their prospective isolation
      from untargeted, patient-specific PSCs for further in vitro differentiation and
      future applications in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Congenital heart disease (CHD) represents the most prevalent inborn anomaly. Only
      a minority of CHD cases are attributed to genetic causes, suggesting a major role
      of environmental factors. Nonphysiological hypoxia during early pregnancy induces
      CHD, but the underlying reasons are unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that
      cells in the mouse heart tube are hypoxic, while cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) 
      expressing islet 1 (ISL1) in the secondary heart field (SHF) are normoxic. In
      ISL1+ CPCs, induction of hypoxic responses caused CHD by repressing Isl1 and
      activating NK2 homeobox 5 (Nkx2.5), resulting in decreased cell proliferation and
      enhanced cardiomyocyte specification. We found that HIF1alpha formed a complex
      with the Notch effector hes family bHLH transcription factor 1 (HES1) and the
      protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) at the Isl1 gene. This complex repressed
      Isl1 in the hypoxic heart tube or following induction of ectopic hypoxic
      responses. Subsequently, reduced Isl1 expression abrogated ISL1-dependent
      recruitment of histone deacetylases HDAC1/5, inhibiting Nkx2.5 expression.
      Inactivation of Sirt1 in ISL1+ CPCs blocked Isl1 suppression via the
      HIF1alpha/HES1/SIRT1 complex and prevented CHDs induced by pathological hypoxia. 
      Our results indicate that spatial differences in oxygenation of the developing
      heart serve as signals to control CPC expansion and cardiac morphogenesis. We
      propose that physiological hypoxia coordinates homeostasis of CPCs, providing
      mechanistic explanations for some nongenetic causes of CHD.

TI  - An inflammatory bowel disease-risk variant in INAVA decreases pattern recognition
      receptor-induced outcomes.
PG  - 2192-2205
LID - 10.1172/JCI86282 [doi]
LID - 86282 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by dysregulation in both
      cytokines and responses to intestinal microbes, and proper regulation of pattern 
      recognition receptor (PRR) signaling is critical for intestinal immune
      homeostasis. Altered functions for the IBD risk locus containing rs7554511, which
      encompasses the C1orf106 gene (recently named INAVA), and roles for the protein
      encoded by the INAVA gene are unknown. Here, we investigated the role of INAVA
      and INAVA genotype in regulating PRR-initiated outcomes in primary human cells.
      Both peripheral and intestinal myeloid cells expressed INAVA. Upon PRR
      stimulation, INAVA was required for optimal MAPK and NF-kappaB activation,
      cytokine secretion, and intracellular bacterial clearance. INAVA recruited
      14-3-3tau, thereby contributing to recruitment of a signaling complex that
      amplified downstream signals and cytokines. Further, INAVA enhanced bacterial
      clearance by regulating reactive oxygen, reactive nitrogen, and autophagy
      pathways. Macrophages from rs7554511 C risk carriers expressed lower levels of
      INAVA RNA and protein. Lower expression was attributed in part to decreased
      transcription mediated directly by the intronic region containing the rs7554511 C
      variant. In rs7554511 C risk carrier macrophages, lower INAVA expression led to
      decreased PRR-induced activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways, cytokines, and
      bacterial clearance pathways. Thus, IBD-associated polymorphisms in INAVA
      modulate PRR-initiated signaling, cytokines, and intracellular bacterial
      clearance, likely contributing to intestinal immune homeostasis.

AB  - Geminin expression is essential for embryonic development and the maintenance of 
      chromosomal integrity. In spite of this protective role, geminin is also
      frequently overexpressed in human cancers and the molecular mechanisms underlying
      its role in tumor progression remain unclear. The histone deacetylase HDAC3
      modulates transcription factors to activate or suppress transcription. Little is 
      known about how HDAC3 specifies substrates for modulation among highly homologous
      transcription factor family members. Here, we have demonstrated that geminin
      selectively couples the transcription factor forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) to HDAC3,
      thereby specifically facilitating FoxO3 deacetylation. We determined that
      geminin-associated HDAC3 deacetylates FoxO3 to block its transcriptional
      activity, leading to downregulation of the downstream FoxO3 target Dicer, an
      RNase that suppresses metastasis. Breast cancer cells depleted of geminin or
      HDAC3 exhibited poor metastatic potential that was attributed to reduced
      suppression of the FoxO3-Dicer axis. Moreover, elevated levels of geminin, HDAC3,
      or both together with decreased FoxO3 acetylation and reduced Dicer expression
      were detected in aggressive human breast cancer specimens. These results
      underscore a prominent role for geminin in promoting breast cancer metastasis via
      the enzyme-substrate-coupling mechanism in HDAC3-FoxO3 complex formation.

TI  - Efficacy of anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody BPS804 in adult patients with
      hypophosphatasia.
PG  - 2148-2158
LID - 10.1172/JCI83731 [doi]
LID - 83731 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare genetic disorder resulting in
      variable alterations of bone formation and mineralization that are caused by
      mutations in the ALPL gene, encoding the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase 
      (ALP) enzyme. METHODS: In this phase IIA open-label, single-center,
      intra-patient, dose-escalating study, adult patients with HPP received 3
      ascending intravenous doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg BPS804, a fully human
      anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody, on days 1, 15, and 29, respectively.
      Patients were followed for 16 weeks after the last dose. We assessed the
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, preliminary efficacy, and safety of BPS804
      administrations at specified intervals during treatment and follow-up. RESULTS:
      Eight patients (mean age 47.8 years) were enrolled in the study (6 females, 2
      males). BPS804 treatment increased mean ALP and bone-specific ALP enzymatic
      activity between days 2 and 29. Transient increases in the bone formation markers
      procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), osteocalcin, and parathyroid
      hormone as well as a transient decrease in the bone resorption marker
      C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1) were observed. Lumbar spine bone mineral
      density showed a mean increase by day 85 and at end of study.
      Treatment-associated adverse events were mild and transient. CONCLUSION: BPS804
      treatment was well tolerated and resulted in increases in bone formation
      biomarkers and bone mineral density, suggesting that sclerostin inhibition could 
      be applied to enhance bone mineral density, stability, and regeneration in
      non-life-threatening clinical situations in adults with HPP. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - The U2AF1S34F mutation induces lineage-specific splicing alterations in
      myelodysplastic syndromes.
PG  - 2206-2221
LID - 10.1172/JCI91363 [doi]
LID - 91363 [pii]
AB  - Mutations of the splicing factor-encoding gene U2AF1 are frequent in the
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a myeloid malignancy, and other cancers.
      Patients with MDS suffer from peripheral blood cytopenias, including anemia, and 
      an increasing percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts. We studied the impact of the
      common U2AF1S34F mutation on cellular function and mRNA splicing in the main cell
      lineages affected in MDS. We demonstrated that U2AF1S34F expression in human
      hematopoietic progenitors impairs erythroid differentiation and skews
      granulomonocytic differentiation toward granulocytes. RNA sequencing of erythroid
      and granulomonocytic colonies revealed that U2AF1S34F induced a higher number of 
      cassette exon splicing events in granulomonocytic cells than in erythroid cells. 
      U2AF1S34F altered mRNA splicing of many transcripts that were expressed in both
      cell types in a lineage-specific manner. In hematopoietic progenitors, the
      introduction of isoform changes identified in the U2AF1S34F target genes H2AFY,
      encoding an H2A histone variant, and STRAP, encoding serine/threonine kinase
      receptor-associated protein, recapitulated phenotypes associated with U2AF1S34F
      expression in erythroid and granulomonocytic cells, suggesting a causal link.
      Furthermore, we showed that isoform modulation of H2AFY and STRAP rescues the
      erythroid differentiation defect in U2AF1S34F MDS cells, suggesting that splicing
      modulators could be used therapeutically. These data have critical implications
      for understanding MDS phenotypic heterogeneity and support the development of
      therapies targeting splicing abnormalities.

TI  - TNF superfamily receptor OX40 triggers invariant NKT cell pyroptosis and liver
      injury.
PG  - 2222-2234
LID - 10.1172/JCI91075 [doi]
LID - 91075 [pii]
AB  - Tissue-resident immune cells play a key role in local and systemic immune
      responses. The liver, in particular, hosts a large number of invariant natural
      killer T (iNKT) cells, which are involved in diverse immune responses. However,
      the mechanisms that regulate survival and homeostasis of liver iNKT cells are
      poorly defined. Here we have found that liver iNKT cells constitutively express
      the costimulatory TNF superfamily receptor OX40 and that OX40 stimulation results
      in massive pyroptotic death of iNKT cells, characterized by the release of potent
      proinflammatory cytokines that induce liver injury. This OX40/NKT pyroptosis
      pathway also plays a key role in concanavalin A-induced murine hepatitis.
      Mechanistically, we demonstrated that liver iNKT cells express high levels of
      caspase 1 and that OX40 stimulation activates caspase 1 via TNF
      receptor-associated factor 6-mediated recruitment of the paracaspase MALT1. We
      also found that activation of caspase 1 in iNKT cells results in processing of
      pro-IL-1beta to mature IL-1beta as well as cleavage of the pyroptotic protein
      gasdermin D, which generates a membrane pore-forming fragment to produce
      pyroptotic cell death. Thus, our study has identified OX40 as a death receptor
      for iNKT cells and uncovered a molecular mechanism of pyroptotic cell death.
      These findings may have important clinical implications in the development of
      OX40-directed therapies.

AB  - Therapies using T cells that are programmed to express chimeric antigen receptors
      (CAR T cells) consistently produce positive results in patients with hematologic 
      malignancies. However, CAR T cell treatments are less effective in solid tumors
      for several reasons. First, lymphocytes do not efficiently target CAR T cells;
      second, solid tumors create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that
      inactivates T cell responses; and third, solid cancers are typified by phenotypic
      diversity and thus include cells that do not express proteins targeted by the
      engineered receptors, enabling the formation of escape variants that elude CAR T 
      cell targeting. Here, we have tested implantable biopolymer devices that deliver 
      CAR T cells directly to the surfaces of solid tumors, thereby exposing them to
      high concentrations of immune cells for a substantial time period. In
      immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of pancreatic cancer and melanoma, we
      found that CAR T cells can migrate from biopolymer scaffolds and eradicate tumors
      more effectively than does systemic delivery of the same cells. We have also
      demonstrated that codelivery of stimulator of IFN genes (STING) agonists
      stimulates immune responses to eliminate tumor cells that are not recognized by
      the adoptively transferred lymphocytes. Thus, these devices may improve the
      effectiveness of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors and help protect against the 
      emergence of escape variants.

AB  - The cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) not only provides mechanical support, but 
      also transduces essential molecular signals in health and disease. Following
      myocardial infarction, dynamic ECM changes drive inflammation and repair. Early
      generation of bioactive matrix fragments activates proinflammatory signaling. The
      formation of a highly plastic provisional matrix facilitates leukocyte
      infiltration and activates infarct myofibroblasts. Deposition of matricellular
      proteins modulates growth factor signaling and contributes to the spatial and
      temporal regulation of the reparative response. Mechanical stress due to pressure
      and volume overload and metabolic dysfunction also induce profound changes in ECM
      composition that contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure. This manuscript
      reviews the role of the ECM in cardiac repair and remodeling and discusses
      matrix-based therapies that may attenuate remodeling while promoting repair and
      regeneration.

AB  - In the mid-1990s, my research group began to devise a method to establish
      endothelial cell cultures from human peripheral blood, with an ultimate goal of
      examining interindividual heterogeneity of endothelial biology. The initial work,
      published in the JCI in 2000, described the method enabling successful attainment
      of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC). Truly endothelial, BOEC are progeny 
      of a transplantable cell that originates in bone marrow, a putative endothelial
      progenitor. Our subsequent experimental work focused upon practical applications 
      of BOEC: their use for gene therapy, tissue engineering, assessment of mutant
      gene effect, and discovery of heterogeneity in endothelial biology.

PG  - 1591-1599
LID - 87490 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87490 [doi]
AB  - Despite the prevalence of viral infections in the American population, we still
      have a limited understanding of how they affect pregnancy and fetal development. 
      Viruses can gain access to the decidua and placenta by ascending from the lower
      reproductive tract or via hematogenous transmission. Viral tropism for the
      decidua and placenta is then dependent on viral entry receptor expression in
      these tissues as well as on the maternal immune response to the virus. These
      factors vary by cell type and gestational age and can be affected by changes to
      the in utero environment and maternal immunity. Some viruses can directly infect 
      the fetus at specific times during gestation, while some only infect the
      placenta. Both scenarios can result in severe birth defects or pregnancy loss.
      Systemic maternal viral infections can also affect the pregnancy, and these can
      be especially dangerous, because pregnant women suffer higher virus-associated
      morbidity and mortality than do nonpregnant counterparts. In this Review, we
      discuss the potential contributions of maternal, placental, and fetal viral
      infection to pregnancy outcome, fetal development, and maternal well-being.

TI  - Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid
      intake.
PG  - 1932-1943
LID - 88530 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88530 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The idea that increasing salt intake increases drinking and urine
      volume is widely accepted. We tested the hypothesis that an increase in salt
      intake of 6 g/d would change fluid balance in men living under ultra-long-term
      controlled conditions. METHODS: Over the course of 2 separate space flight
      simulation studies of 105 and 205 days' duration, we exposed 10 healthy men to 3 
      salt intake levels (12, 9, or 6 g/d). All other nutrients were maintained
      constant. We studied the effect of salt-driven changes in mineralocorticoid and
      glucocorticoid urinary excretion on day-to-day osmolyte and water balance.
      RESULTS: A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but 
      reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine
      concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the
      12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and
      weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via 
      the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free
      water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release,
      with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine
      dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical
      mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The
      projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded well with 
      the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with
      surplus osmolyte excretion. CONCLUSION: Humans regulate osmolyte and water
      balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, endogenous
      accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion. FUNDING: Federal

TI  - Striatopallidal dysfunction underlies repetitive behavior in Shank3-deficient
      model of autism.
PG  - 1978-1990
LID - 87997 [pii]

AB  - The postsynaptic scaffolding protein SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3
      (SHANK3) is critical for the development and function of glutamatergic synapses. 
      Disruption of the SHANK3-encoding gene has been strongly implicated as a
      monogenic cause of autism, and Shank3 mutant mice show repetitive grooming and
      social interaction deficits. Although basal ganglia dysfunction has been proposed
      to underlie repetitive behaviors, few studies have provided direct evidence to
      support this notion and the exact cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown.
      Here, we utilized the Shank3B mutant mouse model of autism to investigate how
      Shank3 mutation may differentially affect striatonigral (direct pathway) and
      striatopallidal (indirect pathway) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and its relevance 
      to repetitive grooming behavior in Shank3B mutant mice. We found that Shank3
      deletion preferentially affects synapses onto striatopallidal MSNs.
      Striatopallidal MSNs showed profound defects, including alterations in synaptic
      transmission, synaptic plasticity, and spine density. Importantly, the repetitive
      grooming behavior was rescued by selectively enhancing the striatopallidal MSN
      activity via a Gq-coupled human M3 muscarinic receptor (hM3Dq), a type of
      designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD). Our findings
      directly demonstrate the existence of distinct changes between 2 striatal
      pathways in a mouse model of autism and indicate that the indirect striatal
      pathway disruption might play a causative role in repetitive behavior of Shank3B 
      mutant mice.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) represents a potentially
      curative treatment for a variety of hematologic malignancies due to the
      well-recognized graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect that is mediated by
      donor-derived alloreactive T cells. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is 
      mediated by the same T cells and remains a significant clinical problem
      associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. In this issue of the JCI, Ni
      and colleagues used several murine models of GVHD to evaluate the effect of CD4+ 
      T cell depletion on GVL versus GVHD and revealed that depletion of CD4+ T cells
      leads to the upregulation of PD-L1 by recipient tissues and donor CD8+ T cells.
      Interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 in GVHD-targeted tissues resulted in CD8+ T cell
      exhaustion and apoptosis, thereby preventing GVHD, whereas PD-L1 interactions
      with CD80 in lymphoid tissue promoted CD8+ T cell survival and expansion, thereby
      enhancing the GVL response. By separating these seemingly similar alloreactive T 
      cell responses based on the context of interaction, the results of this study may
      lay the groundwork for the development of effective clinical strategies to
      enhance GVL while minimizing GVHD following allogeneic HCT.

AB  - It is increasingly evident that there is a genetic contribution to autism
      spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other neural disorders involving excessive
      repetition of action sequences. Among the implicated genes in these disorders are
      those encoding postsynaptic scaffolding proteins with roles in synaptic
      transmission and plasticity. Several mouse models harboring synonymous mutations 
      have shown alterations in synaptic transmission within the striatum, which has
      key roles in controlling actions and action sequences. In this issue of the JCI, 
      Wang and coworkers show that glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto striatal
      projection neurons is weakened in mutant mice lacking the SH3 and multiple
      ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3B) scaffolding protein, defective expression of
      which has been implicated in ASDs. This synaptic alteration gives rise to
      stronger activity in the indirect pathway accompanied by decreased dendritic
      spines on the indirect pathway medium spiny projection neuron, indicative of
      decreased numbers of glutamatergic synapses. Selectively enhancing activity in
      this pathway reduced excessive repetitive grooming in the mutant mice. Changes in
      glutamatergic input to striatal projection neurons have been observed in several 
      other murine ASD models and associated disorders. Thus, manipulation of the
      function of the striatal indirect pathway may be a useful therapeutic target for 
      treating disorders characterized by excessive repetitive behaviors.

AB  - In this issue of the JCI, Liu et al. use irinotecan-loaded nanoparticles to treat
      pancreatic adenocarcinomas in mice. Encapsulating drugs into nanoparticles has
      distinct advantages: it can improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug, enhance
      efficacy, and reduce unwanted side effects. A drawback is that the large size of 
      nanoparticles restricts their access to the tumor interior. Liu and colleagues
      show that the cyclic tumor-penetrating peptide iRGD, reported to be capable of
      enhancing tumor penetration by drugs, can overcome this limitation to a
      substantial degree when administered together with the nanoparticles. Pancreatic 
      adenocarcinoma is a challenging malignancy to treat and in desperate need for
      improved treatments; therefore, advances like this are most welcome.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is almost uniformly fatal; however, some 
      improvement in overall survival has been achieved with the introduction of
      nanocarriers that deliver irinotecan or paclitaxel. Although it is generally
      assumed that nanocarriers rely principally on abnormal leaky vasculature for
      tumor access, a transcytosis transport pathway that is regulated by neuropilin-1 
      (NRP-1) has recently been reported. NRP-1-mediated transport can be triggered by 
      the cyclic tumor-penetrating peptide iRGD. In a KRAS-induced orthotopic PDAC
      model, coadministration of iRGD enhanced the uptake of an irinotecan-loaded
      silicasome carrier that comprises lipid bilayer-coated mesoporous silica
      nanoparticles (MSNPs); this uptake resulted in enhanced survival and markedly
      reduced metastasis. Further, ultrastructural imaging of the treated tumors
      revealed that iRGD coadministration induced a vesicular transport pathway that
      carried Au-labeled silicacomes from the blood vessel lumen to a perinuclear site 
      within cancer cells. iRGD-mediated enhancement of silicasome uptake was also
      observed in patient-derived xenografts, commensurate with the level of NRP-1
      expression on tumor blood vessels. These results demonstrate that iRGD enhances
      the efficacy of irinotecan-loaded silicasome-based therapy and may be a suitable 
      adjuvant in nanoparticle-based treatments for PDAC.

      CD8+ T cells.

AB  - Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) and
      the immunostimulatory molecule CD80 and functions as a checkpoint to regulate
      immune responses. The interaction of PD-L1 with CD80 alone has been shown to
      exacerbate the severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas
      costimulation of CD80 and PD-1 ameliorates GVHD. Here we have demonstrated that
      temporary depletion of donor CD4+ T cells early after hematopoietic cell
      transplantation effectively prevents GVHD while preserving strong
      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in allogeneic and xenogeneic murine GVHD
      models. Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells increased serum IFN-gamma but reduced
      IL-2 concentrations, leading to upregulation of PD-L1 expression by recipient
      tissues and donor CD8+ T cells. In GVHD target tissues, the interactions of PD-L1
      with PD-1 on donor CD8+ T cells cause anergy, exhaustion, and apoptosis, thereby 
      preventing GVHD. In lymphoid tissues, the interactions of PD-L1 with CD80 augment
      CD8+ T cell expansion without increasing anergy, exhaustion, or apoptosis,
      resulting in strong GVL effects. These results indicate that the outcome of
      PD-L1-mediated signaling in CD8+ T cells depends on the presence or absence of
      CD4+ T cells, the nature of the interacting receptor expressed by CD8+ T cells,
      and the tissue environment in which the signaling occurs.

LID - 88532 [pii]

AB  - Natriuretic regulation of extracellular fluid volume homeostasis includes
      suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, pressure natriuresis,
      and reduced renal nerve activity, actions that concomitantly increase urinary Na+
      excretion and lead to increased urine volume. The resulting natriuresis-driven
      diuretic water loss is assumed to control the extracellular volume. Here, we have
      demonstrated that urine concentration, and therefore regulation of water
      conservation, is an important control system for urine formation and
      extracellular volume homeostasis in mice and humans across various levels of salt
      intake. We observed that the renal concentration mechanism couples natriuresis
      with correspondent renal water reabsorption, limits natriuretic osmotic diuresis,
      and results in concurrent extracellular volume conservation and concentration of 
      salt excreted into urine. This water-conserving mechanism of dietary salt
      excretion relies on urea transporter-driven urea recycling by the kidneys and on 
      urea production by liver and skeletal muscle. The energy-intense nature of
      hepatic and extrahepatic urea osmolyte production for renal water conservation
      requires reprioritization of energy and substrate metabolism in liver and
      skeletal muscle, resulting in hepatic ketogenesis and glucocorticoid-driven
      muscle catabolism, which are prevented by increasing food intake. This
      natriuretic-ureotelic, water-conserving principle relies on metabolism-driven
      extracellular volume control and is regulated by concerted liver, muscle, and
      renal actions.

AB  - It has long been viewed that the maintenance of osmotic balance in response to
      high salt intake is a passive process that is mediated largely by increased water
      consumption to balance the salt load. Two studies in this issue of the JCI
      challenge this notion and demonstrate that osmotic balance in response to high
      salt intake involves a complex regulatory process that is influenced by hormone
      fluctuation, metabolism, food consumption, water intake, and renal salt and water
      excretion. Rakova et al. report the unexpected observation that long-term high
      salt intake did not increase water consumption in humans but instead increased
      water retention. Moreover, salt and water balance was influenced by
      glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid fluctuations. Kitada et al. extend upon
      these findings in mouse models and determined that increased urea and a
      corresponding increase in urea transporters in the renal medulla as the result of
      increased protein intake promote the water retention that is needed to achieve
      osmotic homeostasis. Together, the results of these two studies lay the
      groundwork for future studies to determine how, in the face of chronic changes in
      salt intake, humans maintain volume and osmotic homeostasis.

AB  - Inborn errors of DNA repair or replication underlie a variety of clinical
      phenotypes. We studied 5 patients from 4 kindreds, all of whom displayed
      intrauterine growth retardation, chronic neutropenia, and NK cell deficiency.
      Four of the 5 patients also had postnatal growth retardation. The association of 
      neutropenia and NK cell deficiency, which is unusual among primary
      immunodeficiencies and bone marrow failures, was due to a blockade in the bone
      marrow and was mildly symptomatic. We discovered compound heterozygous rare
      mutations in Go-Ichi-Ni-San (GINS) complex subunit 1 (GINS1, also known as PSF1) 
      in the 5 patients. The GINS complex is essential for eukaryotic DNA replication, 
      and homozygous null mutations of GINS component-encoding genes are embryonic
      lethal in mice. The patients' fibroblasts displayed impaired GINS complex
      assembly, basal replication stress, impaired checkpoint signaling, defective cell
      cycle control, and genomic instability, which was rescued by WT GINS1. The
      residual levels of GINS1 activity reached 3% to 16% in patients' cells, depending
      on their GINS1 genotype, and correlated with the severity of growth retardation
      and the in vitro cellular phenotype. The levels of GINS1 activity did not
      influence the immunological phenotype, which was uniform. Autosomal recessive,
      partial GINS1 deficiency impairs DNA replication and underlies intra-uterine (and
      postnatal) growth retardation, chronic neutropenia, and NK cell deficiency.

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokine overproduction and excessive cell death, coupled with
      impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, have been implicated as causes of failure 
      to resolve gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases. Here we have found
      that dendritic cells expressing the apoptotic cell-recognizing receptor CD300f
      play a crucial role in regulating gut inflammatory responses in a murine model of
      colonic inflammation. CD300f-deficient mice failed to resolve dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced colonic inflammation as a result of defects in dendritic cell
      function that were associated with abnormal accumulation of apoptotic cells in
      the gut. CD300f-deficient dendritic cells displayed hyperactive phagocytosis of
      apoptotic cells, which stimulated excessive TNF-alpha secretion predominantly
      from dendritic cells. This, in turn, induced secondary IFN-gamma overproduction
      by colonic T cells, leading to prolonged gut inflammation. Our data highlight a
      previously unappreciated role for dendritic cells in controlling gut homeostasis 
      and show that CD300f-dependent regulation of apoptotic cell uptake is essential
      for suppressing overactive dendritic cell-mediated inflammatory responses,
      thereby controlling the development of chronic gut inflammation.

      restriction, facial deformities, and a history of bacterial and viral infection. 
      Further characterization revealed that these patients were neutropenic and NK

AB  - Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)
      cause Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder affecting cognitive
      development, respiration, and motor function. Genetic restoration of MeCP2
      expression reverses RTT-like phenotypes in mice, highlighting the need to search 
      for therapeutic approaches. Here, we have developed knockin mice recapitulating
      the most common RTT-associated missense mutation, MeCP2 T158M. We found that the 
      T158M mutation impaired MECP2 binding to methylated DNA and destabilized MeCP2
      protein in an age-dependent manner, leading to the development of RTT-like
      phenotypes in these mice. Genetic elevation of MeCP2 T158M expression ameliorated
      multiple RTT-like features, including motor dysfunction and breathing
      irregularities, in both male and female mice. These improvements were accompanied
      by increased binding of MeCP2 T158M to DNA. Further, we found that the
      ubiquitin/proteasome pathway was responsible for MeCP2 T158M degradation and that
      proteasome inhibition increased MeCP2 T158M levels. Together, these findings
      demonstrate that increasing MeCP2 T158M protein expression is sufficient to
      mitigate RTT-like phenotypes and support the targeting of MeCP2 T158M expression 
      or stability as an alternative therapeutic approach.

TI  - Mutant p53 establishes targetable tumor dependency by promoting unscheduled
      replication.
PG  - 1839-1855
LID - 87724 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87724 [doi]
AB  - Gain-of-function (GOF) p53 mutations are observed frequently in most intractable 
      human cancers and establish dependency for tumor maintenance and progression.
      While some of the genes induced by GOF p53 have been implicated in more rapid
      cell proliferation compared with p53-null cancer cells, the mechanism for
      dependency of tumor growth on mutant p53 is unknown. This report reveals a
      therapeutically targetable mechanism for GOF p53 dependency. We have shown that
      GOF p53 increases DNA replication origin firing, stabilizes replication forks,
      and promotes micronuclei formation, thus facilitating the proliferation of cells 
      with genomic abnormalities. In contrast, absence or depletion of GOF p53 leads to
      decreased origin firing and a higher frequency of fork collapse in isogenic
      cells, explaining their poorer proliferation rate. Following genome-wide analyses
      utilizing ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, GOF p53-induced origin firing, micronuclei
      formation, and fork protection were traced to the ability of GOF p53 to
      transactivate cyclin A and CHK1. Highlighting the therapeutic potential of CHK1's
      role in GOF p53 dependency, experiments in cell culture and mouse xenografts
      demonstrated that inhibition of CHK1 selectively blocked proliferation of cells
      and tumors expressing GOF p53. Our data suggest the possibility that checkpoint
      inhibitors could efficiently and selectively target cancers expressing GOF p53
      alleles.

TI  - Folate cycle enzyme MTHFD1L confers metabolic advantages in hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

AB  - Cancer cells preferentially utilize glucose and glutamine, which provide
      macromolecules and antioxidants that sustain rapid cell division. Metabolic
      reprogramming in cancer drives an increased glycolytic rate that supports maximal
      production of these nutrients. The folate cycle, through transfer of a carbon
      unit between tetrahydrofolate and its derivatives in the cytoplasmic and
      mitochondrial compartments, produces other metabolites that are essential for
      cell growth, including nucleotides, methionine, and the antioxidant NADPH. Here, 
      using hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a cancer model, we have observed a
      reduction in growth rate upon withdrawal of folate. We found that an enzyme in
      the folate cycle, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1-like (MTHFD1L), plays
      an essential role in support of cancer growth. We determined that MTHFD1L is
      transcriptionally activated by NRF2, a master regulator of redox homeostasis. Our
      observations further suggest that MTHFD1L contributes to the production and
      accumulation of NADPH to levels that are sufficient to combat oxidative stress in
      cancer cells. The elevation of oxidative stress through MTHFD1L knockdown or the 
      use of methotrexate, an antifolate drug, sensitizes cancer cells to sorafenib, a 
      targeted therapy for HCC. Taken together, our study identifies MTHFD1L in the
      folate cycle as an important metabolic pathway in cancer cells with the potential
      for therapeutic targeting.

TI  - Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha suppresses steatosis-associated liver cancer by 
      inhibiting PPARgamma transcription.

AB  - Worldwide epidemics of metabolic diseases, including liver steatosis, are
      associated with an increased frequency of malignancies, showing the highest
      positive correlation for liver cancer. The heterogeneity of liver cancer
      represents a clinical challenge. In liver, the transcription factor PPARgamma
      promotes metabolic adaptations of lipogenesis and aerobic glycolysis under the
      control of Akt2 activity, but the role of PPARgamma in liver tumorigenesis is
      unknown. Here we have combined preclinical mouse models of liver cancer and
      genetic studies of a human liver biopsy atlas with the aim of identifying
      putative therapeutic targets in the context of liver steatosis and cancer. We
      have revealed a protumoral interaction of Akt2 signaling with hepatocyte nuclear 
      factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and PPARgamma, transcription factors that are master
      regulators of hepatocyte and adipocyte differentiation, respectively. Akt2
      phosphorylates and inhibits HNF1alpha, thus relieving the suppression of hepatic 
      PPARgamma expression and promoting tumorigenesis. Finally, we observed that
      pharmacological inhibition of PPARgamma is therapeutically effective in a
      preclinical murine model of steatosis-associated liver cancer. Taken together,
      our studies in humans and mice reveal that Akt2 controls hepatic tumorigenesis
      through crosstalk between HNF1alpha and PPARgamma.

TI  - A proangiogenic signaling axis in myeloid cells promotes malignant progression of
      glioma.
PG  - 1826-1838
LID - 86443 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI86443 [doi]
AB  - Tumors are capable of coopting hematopoietic cells to create a suitable
      microenvironment to support malignant growth. Here, we have demonstrated that
      upregulation of kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), also known as VEGFR2, in a
      myeloid cell sublineage is necessary for malignant progression of gliomas in
      transgenic murine models and is associated with high-grade tumors in patients.
      KDR expression increased in myeloid cells as myeloid-derived suppressor cells
      (MDSCs) accumulated, which was associated with the transformation and progression
      of low-grade fibrillary astrocytoma to high-grade anaplastic gliomas. KDR
      deficiency in murine BM-derived cells (BMDCs) suppressed the differentiation of
      myeloid lineages and reduced granulocytic/monocytic populations. The depletion of
      myeloid-derived KDR compromised its proangiogenic function, which inhibited the
      angiogenic switch necessary for malignant progression of low-grade to high-grade 
      tumors. We also identified inhibitor of DNA binding protein 2 (ID2) as a key
      upstream regulator of KDR activation during myeloid differentiation. Deficiency
      of ID2 in BMDCs led to downregulation of KDR, suppression of proangiogenic
      myeloid cells, and prevention of low-grade to high-grade transition.
      Tumor-secreted TGF-beta and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) enhanced the
      KDR/ID2 signaling axis in BMDCs. Our results suggest that modulation of KDR/ID2
      signaling may restrict tumor-associated myeloid cells and could potentially be a 
      therapeutic strategy for preventing transformation of premalignant gliomas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the genetic architecture of cardiac structure and
      function may help to prevent and treat heart disease. This investigation sought
      to identify common genetic variations associated with inter-individual
      variability in cardiac structure and function. METHODS: A GWAS meta-analysis of
      echocardiographic traits was performed, including 46,533 individuals from 30
      studies (EchoGen consortium). The analysis included 16 traits of left ventricular
      (LV) structure, and systolic and diastolic function. RESULTS: The discovery
      analysis included 21 cohorts for structural and systolic function traits (n =
      32,212) and 17 cohorts for diastolic function traits (n = 21,852). Replication
      was performed in 5 cohorts (n = 14,321) and 6 cohorts (n = 16,308), respectively.
      Besides 5 previously reported loci, the combined meta-analysis identified 10
      additional genome-wide significant SNPs: rs12541595 near MTSS1 and rs10774625 in 
      ATXN2 for LV end-diastolic internal dimension; rs806322 near KCNRG, rs4765663 in 
      CACNA1C, rs6702619 near PALMD, rs7127129 in TMEM16A, rs11207426 near FGGY,
      rs17608766 in GOSR2, and rs17696696 in CFDP1 for aortic root diameter; and
      rs12440869 in IQCH for Doppler transmitral A-wave peak velocity. Findings were in
      part validated in other cohorts and in GWAS of related disease traits. The
      genetic loci showed associations with putative signaling pathways, and with gene 
      expression in whole blood, monocytes, and myocardial tissue. CONCLUSION: The
      additional genetic loci identified in this large meta-analysis of cardiac
      structure and function provide insights into the underlying genetic architecture 
      of cardiac structure and warrant follow-up in future functional studies. FUNDING:

TI  - Cooperative gene activation by AF4 and DOT1L drives MLL-rearranged leukemia.
PG  - 1918-1931
LID - 91406 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI91406 [doi]
AB  - The eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) protein family, composed of ENL and AF9, is a 
      common component of 3 transcriptional modulators: AF4-ENL-P-TEFb complex (AEP),
      DOT1L-AF10-ENL complex (referred to as the DOT1L complex) and polycomb-repressive
      complex 1 (PRC1). Each complex associates with chromatin via distinct mechanisms,
      conferring different transcriptional properties including activation,
      maintenance, and repression. The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene often fuses
      with ENL and AF10 family genes in leukemia. However, the functional
      interrelationship among those 3 complexes in leukemic transformation remains
      largely elusive. Here, we have shown that MLL-ENL and MLL-AF10 constitutively
      activate transcription by aberrantly inducing both AEP-dependent transcriptional 
      activation and DOT1L-dependent transcriptional maintenance, mostly in the absence
      of PRC1, to fully transform hematopoietic progenitors. These results reveal a
      cooperative transcriptional activation mechanism of AEP and DOT1L and suggest a
      molecular rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of the MLL fusion-AF4 complex
      and DOT1L for more effective treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia.

TI  - Local GABAergic signaling within sensory ganglia controls peripheral nociceptive 
      transmission.
PG  - 1741-1756
LID - 86812 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI86812 [doi]
AB  - The integration of somatosensory information is generally assumed to be a
      function of the central nervous system (CNS). Here we describe fully functional
      GABAergic communication within rodent peripheral sensory ganglia and show that it
      can modulate transmission of pain-related signals from the peripheral sensory
      nerves to the CNS. We found that sensory neurons express major proteins necessary
      for GABA synthesis and release and that sensory neurons released GABA in response
      to depolarization. In vivo focal infusion of GABA or GABA reuptake inhibitor to
      sensory ganglia dramatically reduced acute peripherally induced nociception and
      alleviated neuropathic and inflammatory pain. In addition, focal application of
      GABA receptor antagonists to sensory ganglia triggered or exacerbated
      peripherally induced nociception. We also demonstrated that chemogenetic or
      optogenetic depolarization of GABAergic dorsal root ganglion neurons in vivo
      reduced acute and chronic peripherally induced nociception. Mechanistically, GABA
      depolarized the majority of sensory neuron somata, yet produced a net inhibitory 
      effect on the nociceptive transmission due to the filtering effect at nociceptive
      fiber T-junctions. Our findings indicate that peripheral somatosensory ganglia
      represent a hitherto underappreciated site of somatosensory signal integration
      and offer a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - CCT6A suppresses SMAD2 and promotes prometastatic TGF-beta signaling.
PG  - 1725-1740
LID - 90439 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90439 [doi]
AB  - Paradoxically, during early tumor development in many cancer types, TGF-beta acts
      as a tumor suppressor, whereas in the advanced stages of these cancers, increased
      TGF-beta expression is linked to high metastasis and poor prognosis. These
      findings suggest that unidentified mechanisms may function to rewire TGF-beta
      signaling toward its prometastatic role in cancer cells. Our current study using 
      non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines, animal models, and clinical
      specimens demonstrates that suppression of SMAD2, with SMAD3 function intact,
      switches TGF-beta-induced transcriptional responses to a prometastatic state.
      Importantly, we identified chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 6A (CCT6A) as an
      inhibitor and direct binding protein of SMAD2 and found that CCT6A suppresses
      SMAD2 function in NSCLC cells and promotes metastasis. Furthermore, selective
      inhibition of SMAD3 or CCT6A efficiently suppresses TGF-beta-mediated metastasis.
      Our findings provide a mechanism that directs TGF-beta signaling toward its
      prometastatic arm and may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies
      targeting TGF-beta for NSCLC.

TI  - Isolated polycystic liver disease genes define effectors of polycystin-1
      function.
PG  - 1772-1785
LID - 90129 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90129 [doi]
AB  - Dominantly inherited isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) consists of liver
      cysts that are radiologically and pathologically identical to those seen in
      autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, but without clinically relevant
      kidney cysts. The causative genes are known for fewer than 40% of PCLD index
      cases. Here, we have used whole exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 102
      unrelated patients who were excluded for mutations in the 2 most common PCLD
      genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, to identify heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in 3
      additional genes, ALG8, GANAB, and SEC61B. Similarly to PRKCSH and SEC63, these
      genes encode proteins that are integral to the protein biogenesis pathway in the 
      endoplasmic reticulum. We inactivated these candidate genes in cell line models
      to show that loss of function of each results in defective maturation and
      trafficking of polycystin-1, the central determinant of cyst pathogenesis.
      Despite acting in a common pathway, each PCLD gene product demonstrated distinct 
      effects on polycystin-1 biogenesis. We also found enrichment on a genome-wide
      basis of heterozygous mutations in the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney
      disease gene PKHD1, indicating that adult PKHD1 carriers can present with
      clinical PCLD. These findings define genetic and biochemical modulators of
      polycystin-1 function and provide a more complete definition of the spectrum of
      dominant human polycystic diseases.

TI  - omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ameliorate type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity.

AB  - Despite the benefit of insulin, blockade of autoimmune attack and regeneration of
      pancreatic islets are ultimate goals for the complete cure of type 1 diabetes
      (T1D). Long-term consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is
      known to suppress inflammatory processes, making these fatty acids candidates for
      the prevention and amelioration of autoimmune diseases. Here, we explored the
      preventative and therapeutic effects of omega-3 PUFAs on T1D. In NOD mice,
      dietary intervention with omega-3 PUFAs sharply reduced the incidence of T1D,
      modulated the differentiation of Th cells and Tregs, and decreased the levels of 
      IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. omega-3 PUFAs exerted similar effects on
      the differentiation of CD4+ T cells isolated from human peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells. The regulation of CD4+ T cell differentiation was mediated at 
      least in part through omega-3 PUFA eicosanoid derivatives and by mTOR complex 1
      (mTORC1) inhibition. Importantly, therapeutic intervention in NOD mice through
      nutritional supplementation or lentivirus-mediated expression of an omega-3 fatty
      acid desaturase, mfat-1, normalized blood glucose and insulin levels for at least
      182 days, blocked the development of autoimmunity, prevented lymphocyte
      infiltration into regenerated islets, and sharply elevated the expression of the 
      beta cell markers pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) and paired box 4
      (Pax4). The findings suggest that omega-3 PUFAs could potentially serve as a
      therapeutic modality for T1D.

PG  - 1714-1724

LID - 10.1172/JCI84598 [doi]
AB  - The growth factor receptor Kit is involved in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic 
      development. Mice bearing Kit defects lack mast cells; however, strains bearing
      different Kit alleles exhibit diverse phenotypes. Herein, we investigated factors
      underlying differential sensitivity to IgG-mediated arthritis in 2 mast
      cell-deficient murine lines: KitWsh/Wsh, which develops robust arthritis, and
      KitW/Wv, which does not. Reciprocal bone marrow transplantation between KitW/Wv
      and KitWsh/Wsh mice revealed that arthritis resistance reflects a hematopoietic
      defect in addition to mast cell deficiency. In KitW/Wv mice, restoration of
      susceptibility to IgG-mediated arthritis was neutrophil independent but required 
      IL-1 and the platelet/megakaryocyte markers NF-E2 and glycoprotein VI. In KitW/Wv
      mice, platelets were present in numbers similar to those in WT animals and
      functionally intact, and transfer of WT platelets did not restore arthritis
      susceptibility. These data implicated a platelet-independent role for the
      megakaryocyte, a Kit-dependent lineage that is selectively deficient in KitW/Wv
      mice. Megakaryocytes secreted IL-1 directly and as a component of circulating
      microparticles, which activated synovial fibroblasts in an IL-1-dependent manner.
      Transfer of WT but not IL-1-deficient megakaryocytes restored arthritis
      susceptibility to KitW/Wv mice. These findings identify functional redundancy
      among Kit-dependent hematopoietic lineages and establish an unanticipated
      capacity of megakaryocytes to mediate IL-1-driven systemic inflammatory disease.

AB  - Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is the most common complication for
      patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Despite extremely
      aggressive therapy targeting donor T cells, patients with grade III or greater
      aGVHD of the lower GI tract, who do not respond to therapy with corticosteroids, 
      have a dismal prognosis. Thus, efforts to improve understanding of the function
      of local immune and non-immune cells in regulating the inflammatory process in
      the GI tract during aGVHD are needed. Here, we demonstrate, using murine models
      of allogeneic BMT, that type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the lower GI
      tract are sensitive to conditioning therapy and show very limited ability to
      repopulate from donor bone marrow. Infusion of donor ILC2s was effective in
      reducing the lethality of aGVHD and in treating lower GI tract disease. ILC2
      infusion was associated with reduced donor proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells,
      accumulation of donor myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) mediated by ILC2
      production of IL-13, improved GI tract barrier function, and a preserved
      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response. Collectively, these findings suggest that
      infusion of donor ILC2s to restore gastrointestinal tract homeostasis may improve
      treatment of severe lower GI tract aGVHD.

TI  - PCBP1 and NCOA4 regulate erythroid iron storage and heme biosynthesis.
PG  - 1786-1797
LID - 90519 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90519 [doi]
AB  - Developing erythrocytes take up exceptionally large amounts of iron, which must
      be transferred to mitochondria for incorporation into heme. This massive iron
      flux must be precisely controlled to permit the coordinated synthesis of heme and
      hemoglobin while avoiding the toxic effects of chemically reactive iron. In
      cultured animal cells, iron chaperones poly rC-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) and
      PCBP2 deliver iron to ferritin, the sole cytosolic iron storage protein, and
      nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) mediates the autophagic turnover of
      ferritin. The roles of PCBP, ferritin, and NCOA4 in erythroid development remain 
      unclear. Here, we show that PCBP1, NCOA4, and ferritin are critical for murine
      red cell development. Using a cultured cell model of erythroid differentiation,
      depletion of PCBP1 or NCOA4 impaired iron trafficking through ferritin, which
      resulted in reduced heme synthesis, reduced hemoglobin formation, and
      perturbation of erythroid regulatory systems. Mice lacking Pcbp1 exhibited
      microcytic anemia and activation of compensatory erythropoiesis via the
      regulators erythropoietin and erythroferrone. Ex vivo differentiation of
      erythroid precursors from Pcbp1-deficient mice confirmed defects in ferritin iron
      flux and heme synthesis. These studies demonstrate the importance of ferritin for
      the vectorial transfer of imported iron to mitochondria in developing red cells
      and of PCBP1 and NCOA4 in mediating iron flux through ferritin.

LID - 10.1172/JCI87800 [doi]
AB  - Many cancer-associated mutations that deregulate cellular metabolic responses to 
      hypoxia also reprogram carbon metabolism to promote utilization of glutamine. In 
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC), cells deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor 
      suppressor gene use glutamine to generate citrate and lipids through reductive
      carboxylation (RC) of alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG). Glutamine can also generate 
      aspartate, the carbon source for pyrimidine biosynthesis, and glutathione for
      redox balance. Here we have shown that VHL-/- RCC cells rely on RC-derived
      aspartate to maintain de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Glutaminase 1 (GLS1)
      inhibitors depleted pyrimidines and increased ROS in VHL-/- cells but not in
      VHL+/+ cells, which utilized glucose oxidation for glutamate and aspartate
      production. GLS1 inhibitor-induced nucleoside depletion and ROS enhancement led
      to DNA replication stress and activation of an intra-S phase checkpoint, and
      suppressed the growth of VHL-/- RCC cells. These effects were rescued by
      administration of glutamate, alphaKG, or nucleobases with N-acetylcysteine.
      Further, we observed that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
      olaparib synergizes with GLS1 inhibitors to suppress the growth of VHL-/- cells
      in vitro and in vivo. This work describes a mechanism that explains the
      sensitivity of RCC tumor growth to GLS1 inhibitors and supports the development
      of therapeutic strategies for targeting VHL-deficient RCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) of
      gene-modified cells is an alternative to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and
      allogeneic HSCT that has shown clinical benefit for adenosine deaminase-deficient
      (ADA-deficient) SCID when combined with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and 
      ERT cessation. Clinical safety and therapeutic efficacy were evaluated in a phase
      II study. METHODS: Ten subjects with confirmed ADA-deficient SCID and no
      available matched sibling or family donor were enrolled between 2009 and 2012 and
      received transplantation with autologous hematopoietic CD34+ cells that were
      modified with the human ADA cDNA (MND-ADA) gamma-retroviral vector after
      conditioning with busulfan (90 mg/m2) and ERT cessation. Subjects were followed
      from 33 to 84 months at the time of data analysis. Safety of the procedure was
      assessed by recording the number of adverse events. Efficacy was assessed by
      measuring engraftment of gene-modified hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, ADA
      gene expression, and immune reconstitution. RESULTS: With the exception of the
      oldest subject (15 years old at enrollment), all subjects remained off ERT with
      normalized peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) ADA activity, improved
      lymphocyte numbers, and normal proliferative responses to mitogens. Three of nine
      subjects were able to discontinue intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy.
      The MND-ADA vector was persistently detected in PBMCs (vector copy number [VCN] =
      0.1-2.6) and granulocytes (VCN = 0.01-0.3) through the most recent visits at the 
      time of this writing. No patient has developed a leukoproliferative disorder or
      other vector-related clinical complication since transplant. CONCLUSION: These
      results demonstrate clinical therapeutic efficacy from gene therapy for
      ADA-deficient SCID, with an excellent clinical safety profile. TRIAL

TI  - Somatic mutations and progressive monosomy modify SAMD9-related phenotypes in
      humans.
PG  - 1700-1713
LID - 91913 [pii]

AB  - It is well established that somatic genomic changes can influence phenotypes in
      cancer, but the role of adaptive changes in developmental disorders is less well 
      understood. Here we have used next-generation sequencing approaches to identify
      de novo heterozygous mutations in sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 9
      (SAMD9, located on chromosome 7q21.2) in 8 children with a multisystem disorder
      termed MIRAGE syndrome that is characterized by intrauterine growth restriction
      (IUGR) with gonadal, adrenal, and bone marrow failure, predisposition to
      infections, and high mortality. These mutations result in gain of function of the
      growth repressor product SAMD9. Progressive loss of mutated SAMD9 through the
      development of monosomy 7 (-7), deletions of 7q (7q-), and secondary somatic
      loss-of-function (nonsense and frameshift) mutations in SAMD9 rescued the
      growth-restricting effects of mutant SAMD9 proteins in bone marrow and was
      associated with increased length of survival. However, 2 patients with -7 and 7q-
      developed myelodysplastic syndrome, most likely due to haploinsufficiency of
      related 7q21.2 genes. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that
      progressive somatic changes can occur in specific tissues and can subsequently
      modify disease phenotype and influence survival. Such tissue-specific
      adaptability may be a more common mechanism modifying the expression of human
      genetic conditions than is currently recognized.

LID - 10.1172/JCI85504 [doi]
AB  - Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein may cause synapse degeneration and
      cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by reactivating expression of
      the developmental synapse repressor protein Ephexin5 (also known as ARHGEF15).
      Here, we have reported that Abeta is sufficient to acutely promote the production
      of Ephexin5 in mature hippocampal neurons and in mice expressing human amyloid
      precursor protein (hAPP mice), a model for familial AD that produces high brain
      levels of Abeta. Ephexin5 expression was highly elevated in the hippocampi of
      human AD patients, indicating its potential relevance to AD. We also observed
      elevated Ephexin5 expression in the hippocampi of hAPP mice. Removal of Ephexin5 
      expression eliminated hippocampal dendritic spine loss and rescued AD-associated 
      behavioral deficits in the hAPP mice. Furthermore, selective reduction of
      Ephexin5 expression using shRNA in the dentate gyrus of presymptomatic adolescent
      hAPP mice was sufficient to protect these mice from developing cognitive
      impairment. Thus, pathological elevation of Ephexin5 expression critically drives
      Abeta-induced memory impairment, and strategies aimed at reducing Ephexin5 levels
      may represent an effective approach to treating AD.

TI  - A TLR9-dependent checkpoint governs B cell responses to DNA-containing antigens.
PG  - 1651-1663
LID - 89931 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89931 [doi]
AB  - Mature B cell pools retain a substantial proportion of polyreactive and
      self-reactive clonotypes, suggesting that activation checkpoints exist to reduce 
      the initiation of autoreactive B cell responses. Here, we have described a
      relationship among the B cell receptor (BCR), TLR9, and cytokine signals that
      regulate B cell responses to DNA-containing antigens. In both mouse and human B
      cells, BCR ligands that deliver a TLR9 agonist induce an initial proliferative
      burst that is followed by apoptotic death. The latter mechanism involves
      p38-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest and subsequent intrinsic mitochondrial
      apoptosis and is shared by all preimmune murine B cell subsets and CD27- human B 
      cells. Survival or costimulatory signals rescue B cells from this fate, but the
      outcome varies depending on the signals involved. B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) 
      engenders survival and antibody secretion, whereas CD40 costimulation with IL-21 
      or IFN-gamma promotes a T-bet+ B cell phenotype. Finally, in vivo immunization
      studies revealed that when protein antigens are conjugated with DNA, the humoral 
      immune response is blunted and acquires features associated with T-bet+ B cell
      differentiation. We propose that this mechanism integrating BCR, TLR9, and
      cytokine signals provides a peripheral checkpoint for DNA-containing antigens
      that, if circumvented by survival and differentiative cues, yields B cells with
      the autoimmune-associated T-bet+ phenotype.

AB  - Diseases caused by gene haploinsufficiency in humans commonly lack a phenotype in
      mice that are heterozygous for the orthologous factor, impeding the study of
      complex phenotypes and critically limiting the discovery of therapeutics.
      Laboratory mice have longer telomeres relative to humans, potentially protecting 
      against age-related disease caused by haploinsufficiency. Here, we demonstrate
      that telomere shortening in NOTCH1-haploinsufficient mice is sufficient to elicit
      age-dependent cardiovascular disease involving premature calcification of the
      aortic valve, a phenotype that closely mimics human disease caused by NOTCH1
      haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, progressive telomere shortening correlated with 
      severity of disease, causing cardiac valve and septal disease in the neonate that
      was similar to the range of valve disease observed within human families. Genes
      that were dysregulated due to NOTCH1 haploinsufficiency in mice with shortened
      telomeres were concordant with proosteoblast and proinflammatory gene network
      alterations in human NOTCH1 heterozygous endothelial cells. These dysregulated
      genes were enriched for telomere-contacting promoters, suggesting a potential
      mechanism for telomere-dependent regulation of homeostatic gene expression. These
      findings reveal a critical role for telomere length in a mouse model of
      age-dependent human disease and provide an in vivo model in which to test
      therapeutic candidates targeting the progression of aortic valve disease.

      retraction syndrome.

AB  - Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is the most common form of congenital paralytic
      strabismus in humans and can result from alpha2-chimaerin (CHN1) missense
      mutations. We report a knockin alpha2-chimaerin mouse (Chn1KI/KI) that models
      DRS. Whole embryo imaging of Chn1KI/KI mice revealed stalled abducens nerve
      growth and selective trochlear and first cervical spinal nerve guidance
      abnormalities. Stalled abducens nerve bundles did not reach the orbit, resulting 
      in secondary aberrant misinnervation of the lateral rectus muscle by the
      oculomotor nerve. By contrast, Chn1KO/KO mice did not have DRS, and embryos
      displayed abducens nerve wandering distinct from the Chn1KI/KI phenotype. Murine 
      embryos lacking EPH receptor A4 (Epha4KO/KO), which is upstream of
      alpha2-chimaerin in corticospinal neurons, exhibited similar abducens wandering
      that paralleled previously reported gait alterations in Chn1KO/KO and Epha4KO/KO 
      adult mice. Findings from Chn1KI/KI Epha4KO/KO mice demonstrated that mutant
      alpha2-chimaerin and EphA4 have different genetic interactions in distinct motor 
      neuron pools: abducens neurons use bidirectional ephrin signaling via mutant
      alpha2-chimaerin to direct growth, while cervical spinal neurons use only ephrin 
      forward signaling, and trochlear neurons do not use ephrin signaling. These
      findings reveal a role for ephrin bidirectional signaling upstream of mutant
      alpha2-chimaerin in DRS, which may contribute to the selective vulnerability of
      abducens motor neurons in this disorder.

      transcription factors play important roles in reproduction, development, and
      physiology. In humans, genetic mutations in NRs are causes of rare diseases,
      while hormones and drugs that target NRs are in widespread therapeutic use. The
      present issue of the JCI includes a series of Review articles focused on specific
      NRs and their wide range of biological functions. Here I reflect on the past,
      present, and potential future highlights of research on the NR superfamily.

AB  - Steroid hormones mediate critical lineage-specific developmental and physiologic 
      responses. They function by binding their cognate receptors, which are
      transcription factors that drive specific gene expression programs. The
      requirement of most prostate cancers for androgen and most breast cancers for
      estrogen has led to the development of endocrine therapies that block the action 
      of these hormones in these tumors. While initial endocrine interventions are
      successful, resistance to therapy often arises. We will review how steroid
      receptor-dependent genomic signaling is affected by genetic alterations in
      endocrine therapy resistance. The detailed understanding of these interactions
      will not only provide improved treatment options to overcome resistance, but, in 
      the future, will also be the basis for implementing precision cancer medicine
      approaches.

AB  - Following the first isolation of nuclear receptor (NR) genes, genetic disorders
      caused by NR gene mutations were initially discovered by a candidate gene
      approach based on their known roles in endocrine pathways and physiologic
      processes. Subsequently, the identification of disorders has been informed by
      phenotypes associated with gene disruption in animal models or by genetic linkage
      studies. More recently, whole exome sequencing has associated pathogenic genetic 
      variants with unexpected, often multisystem, human phenotypes. To date, defects
      in 20 of 48 human NR genes have been associated with human disorders, with
      different mutations mediating phenotypes of varying severity or several distinct 
      conditions being associated with different changes in the same gene. Studies of
      individuals with deleterious genetic variants can elucidate novel roles of human 
      NRs, validating them as targets for drug development or providing new insights
      into structure-function relationships. Importantly, human genetic discoveries
      enable definitive disease diagnosis and can provide opportunities to
      therapeutically manage affected individuals. Here we review germline changes in
      human NR genes associated with "monogenic" conditions, including a discussion of 
      the structural basis of mutations that cause distinctive changes in NR function
      and the molecular mechanisms mediating pathogenesis.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) regulate energy metabolism
      and hence are therapeutic targets in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes
      and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. While they share anti-inflammatory
      activities, the PPAR isotypes distinguish themselves by differential actions on
      lipid and glucose homeostasis. In this Review we discuss the complementary and
      distinct metabolic effects of the PPAR isotypes together with the underlying
      cellular and molecular mechanisms, as well as the synthetic PPAR ligands that are
      used in the clinic or under development. We highlight the potential of new PPAR
      ligands with improved efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of complex
      metabolic disorders.

      morphine.

AB  - Extensive 3' alternative splicing of the mu opioid receptor gene OPRM1 creates
      multiple C-terminal splice variants. However, their behavioral relevance remains 
      unknown. The present study generated 3 mutant mouse models with truncated C
      termini in 2 different mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and 129/SvEv (129). One mouse
      truncated all C termini downstream of Oprm1 exon 3 (mE3M mice), while the other
      two selectively truncated C-terminal tails encoded by either exon 4 (mE4M mice)
      or exon 7 (mE7M mice). Studies of these mice revealed divergent roles for the C
      termini in morphine-induced behaviors, highlighting the importance of C-terminal 
      variants in complex morphine actions. In mE7M-B6 mice, the exon 7-associated
      truncation diminished morphine tolerance and reward without altering physical
      dependence, whereas the exon 4-associated truncation in mE4M-B6 mice facilitated 
      morphine tolerance and reduced morphine dependence without affecting morphine
      reward. mE7M-B6 mutant mice lost morphine-induced receptor desensitization in the
      brain stem and hypothalamus, consistent with exon 7 involvement in morphine
      tolerance. In cell-based studies, exon 7-associated variants shifted the bias of 
      several mu opioids toward beta-arrestin 2 over G protein activation compared with
      the exon 4-associated variant, suggesting an interaction of exon 7-associated
      C-terminal tails with beta-arrestin 2 in morphine-induced desensitization and
      tolerance. Together, the differential effects of C-terminal truncation illustrate
      the pharmacological importance of OPRM1 3' alternative splicing.

AB  - Opioids are the gold-standard treatment for severe pain. However, potentially
      life-threatening side effects decrease the safety and effectiveness of these
      compounds. The addiction liability of these drugs has led to the current epidemic
      of opioid abuse in the US. Extensive research efforts have focused on trying to
      dissociate the analgesic properties of opioids from their undesirable side
      effects. Splice variants of the mu opioid receptor (MOR), which mediates opioid
      actions, have unique pharmacological properties and anatomic distributions that
      make them attractive candidates for therapeutic pain relief. In this issue of the
      JCI, Xu et al. show that specific C-terminal regions of the MOR can modulate side
      effects without altering analgesia. This discovery greatly improves our
      understanding of opioid side effects and suggests intriguing therapeutic
      approaches that could improve both the safety and long-term effectiveness of
      opioids.

AB  - In transplantation, there is a critical need for noninvasive biomarker platforms 
      for monitoring immunologic rejection. We hypothesized that transplanted tissues
      release donor-specific exosomes into recipient circulation and that the
      quantitation and profiling of donor intra-exosomal cargoes may constitute a
      biomarker platform for monitoring rejection. Here, we have tested this hypothesis
      in a human-into-mouse xenogeneic islet transplant model and validated the concept
      in clinical settings of islet and renal transplantation. In the xenogeneic model,
      we quantified islet transplant exosomes in recipient blood over long-term
      follow-up using anti-HLA antibody, which was detectable only in xenoislet
      recipients of human islets. Transplant islet exosomes were purified using
      anti-HLA antibody-conjugated beads, and their cargoes contained the islet
      endocrine hormone markers insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. Rejection led to a
      marked decrease in transplant islet exosome signal along with distinct changes in
      exosomal microRNA and proteomic profiles prior to appearance of hyperglycemia. In
      the clinical settings of islet and renal transplantation, donor exosomes with
      respective tissue specificity for islet beta cells and renal epithelial cells
      were reliably characterized in recipient plasma over follow-up periods of up to 5
      years. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the biomarker potential of
      transplant exosome characterization for providing a noninvasive window into the
      conditional state of transplant tissue.

PG  - 1546-1560

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of patients with high-risk atherosclerotic plaques
      prior to the manifestation of clinical events remains challenging. Recent
      findings question histology- and imaging-based definitions of the "vulnerable
      plaque," necessitating an improved approach for predicting onset of symptoms.
      METHODS: We performed a proteomics comparison of the vascular extracellular
      matrix and associated molecules in human carotid endarterectomy specimens from 6 
      symptomatic versus 6 asymptomatic patients to identify a protein signature for
      high-risk atherosclerotic plaques. Proteomics data were integrated with gene
      expression profiling of 121 carotid endarterectomies and an analysis of protein
      secretion by lipid-loaded human vascular smooth muscle cells. Finally,
      epidemiological validation of candidate biomarkers was performed in two
      community-based studies. RESULTS: Proteomics and at least one of the other two
      approaches identified a molecular signature of plaques from symptomatic patients 
      that comprised matrix metalloproteinase 9, chitinase 3-like-1, S100 calcium
      binding protein A8 (S100A8), S100A9, cathepsin B, fibronectin, and
      galectin-3-binding protein. Biomarker candidates measured in 685 subjects in the 
      Bruneck study were associated with progression to advanced atherosclerosis and
      incidence of cardiovascular disease over a 10-year follow-up period. A
      4-biomarker signature (matrix metalloproteinase 9, S100A8/S100A9, cathepsin D,
      and galectin-3-binding protein) improved risk prediction and was successfully
      replicated in an independent cohort, the SAPHIR study. CONCLUSION: The identified
      4-biomarker signature may improve risk prediction and diagnostics for the
      management of cardiovascular disease. Further, our study highlights the strength 
      of tissue-based proteomics for biomarker discovery. FUNDING: UK: British Heart

AB  - Immunotherapy has emerged as a potent approach for treating aggressive cancers,
      such as non-small-cell lung tumors and metastatic melanoma. Clinical trials are
      now in progress for patients with malignant gliomas; however, a better
      understanding of how these tumors escape immune surveillance is required to
      enhance antitumor immune responses. With gliomas, the recruitment of CD8+ T cells
      to the tumor is impaired, in part preventing containment or elimination of the
      tumor. In this issue of the JCI, Kohanbash and colleagues present an elegant
      dissection of how gliomas exploit an enzymatic activity acquired through a common
      mutation to abrogate the migration of CD8+ T cells to the tumor. They show that
      the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), generated by mutated forms of
      isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2), reduces the expression of STAT1,
      thereby limiting the production of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. As a result, 
      IDH1-mutated tumors are less effectively infiltrated by CD8+ T cells,
      contributing to tumor escape. Finally, in mice harboring syngeneic gliomas, an
      inhibitor of 2HG synthesis complemented vaccination to ameliorate tumor control. 
      Understanding how to increase immune infiltration of gliomas represents a key
      first step in achieving tumor destruction through immunotherapy.

AB  - The mTOR pathway is a critical determinant of cell persistence and growth wherein
      mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) mediates a balance between growth factor stimuli and
      nutrient availability. Amino acids or glucose facilitates mTORC1 activation by
      inducing RagA GTPase recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal outer surface,
      enabling activation of mTOR by the Ras homolog Rheb. Thereby, RagA alters
      mTORC1-driven growth in times of nutrient abundance or scarcity. Here, we have
      evaluated differential nutrient-sensing dependence through RagA and mTORC1 in
      hematopoietic progenitors, which dynamically drive mature cell production, and
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which provide a quiescent cellular reserve. In
      nutrient-abundant conditions, RagA-deficient HSC were functionally unimpaired and
      upregulated mTORC1 via nutrient-insensitive mechanisms. RagA was also dispensable
      for HSC function under nutritional stress conditions. Similarly, hyperactivation 
      of RagA did not affect HSC function. In contrast, RagA deficiency markedly
      altered progenitor population function and mature cell output. Therefore, RagA is
      a molecular mechanism that distinguishes the functional attributes of reactive
      progenitors from a reserve stem cell pool. The indifference of HSC to nutrient
      sensing through RagA contributes to their molecular resilience to nutritional
      stress, a characteristic that is relevant to organismal viability in evolution
      and in modern HSC transplantation approaches.

      gliomas.

AB  - Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 are among the first
      genetic alterations observed during the development of lower-grade glioma (LGG). 
      LGG-associated IDH mutations confer gain-of-function activity by converting
      alpha-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Clinical
      samples and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate 
      reduced expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated genes and
      IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines, including CXCL10, in IDH-mutated (IDH-MUT) tumors
      compared with IDH-WT tumors. Given these findings, we have investigated the
      impact of IDH mutations on the immunological milieu in LGG. In immortalized
      normal human astrocytes (NHAs) and syngeneic mouse glioma models, the
      introduction of mutant IDH1 or treatment with 2HG reduced levels of CXCL10, which
      was associated with decreased production of STAT1, a regulator of CXCL10.
      Expression of mutant IDH1 also suppressed the accumulation of T cells in tumor
      sites. Reductions in CXCL10 and T cell accumulation were reversed by IDH-C35, a
      specific inhibitor of mutant IDH1. Furthermore, IDH-C35 enhanced the efficacy of 
      vaccine immunotherapy in mice bearing IDH-MUT gliomas. Our findings demonstrate a
      mechanism of immune evasion in IDH-MUT gliomas and suggest that specific
      inhibitors of mutant IDH may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients
      with IDH-MUT gliomas.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only
      treatment option for several severe hematological malignancies. The development
      of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of the procedure and
      results when donor T cells become activated against recipient-specific antigens. 
      The factors that drive the alloreactive T cell response are not completely
      understood. In this issue of the JCI, Chung and colleagues present evidence that 
      stromal cells within lymphoid tissue express the Notch ligands Delta-like 1/4
      (DLL1 and DLL4), which in turn directly activate T cells. Importantly, inhibition
      of DLL1/DLL4-mediated Notch signaling in murine HSCT models dramatically reduced 
      GVHD and improved graft survival.

TI  - AKT-mediated stabilization of histone methyltransferase WHSC1 promotes prostate
      cancer metastasis.
PG  - 1284-1302
LID - 91144 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI91144 [doi]
AB  - Loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activation of the PI3K/AKT
      signaling pathway are hallmarks of prostate cancer (PCa). However, these
      alterations alone are insufficient for cells to acquire metastatic traits. Here, 
      we have shown that the histone dimethyl transferase WHSC1 critically drives
      indolent PTEN-null tumors to become metastatic PCa. In a PTEN-null murine PCa
      model, WHSC1 overexpression in prostate epithelium cooperated with Pten deletion 
      to produce a metastasis-prone tumor. Conversely, genetic ablation of Whsc1
      prevented tumor progression in PTEN-null mice. Molecular characterization
      revealed that increased AKT activity due to PTEN loss directly phosphorylates
      WHSC1 at S172, preventing WHSC1 degradation by CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase. Increased
      WHSC1 expression transcriptionally upregulates expression of RICTOR, a pivotal
      component of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), to further enhance AKT activity. Therefore,
      the AKT/WHSC1/mTORC2 signaling cascade represents a vicious feedback loop that
      elicits unrestrained AKT signaling. Furthermore, we determined that WHSC1
      positively regulates Rac1 transcription to increase tumor cell motility. The
      biological importance of a WHSC1-mediated signaling cascade is substantiated by
      patient sample analysis in which WHSC1 signaling is tightly correlated with
      disease progression and recurrence. Taken together, our findings highlight a
      pivotal link between an epigenetic regulator, WHSC1, and key intracellular
      signaling molecules, AKT, RICTOR, and Rac1, to drive PCa metastasis.

AB  - Alloimmune T cell responses induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious
      complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Although Notch
      signaling mediated by Delta-like 1/4 (DLL1/4) Notch ligands has emerged as a
      major regulator of GVHD pathogenesis, little is known about the timing of
      essential Notch signals and the cellular source of Notch ligands after allo-BMT. 
      Here, we have shown that critical DLL1/4-mediated Notch signals are delivered to 
      donor T cells during a short 48-hour window after transplantation in a mouse
      allo-BMT model. Stromal, but not hematopoietic, cells were the essential source
      of Notch ligands during in vivo priming of alloreactive T cells. GVHD could be
      prevented by selective inactivation of Dll1 and Dll4 in subsets of fibroblastic
      stromal cells that were derived from chemokine Ccl19-expressing host cells,
      including fibroblastic reticular cells and follicular dendritic cells. However,
      neither T cell recruitment into secondary lymphoid organs nor initial T cell
      activation was affected by Dll1/4 loss. Thus, we have uncovered a pathogenic
      function for fibroblastic stromal cells in alloimmune reactivity that can be
      dissociated from their homeostatic functions. Our results reveal what we believe 
      to be a previously unrecognized Notch-mediated immunopathogenic role for stromal 
      cell niches in secondary lymphoid organs after allo-BMT and define a framework of
      early cellular and molecular interactions that regulate T cell alloimmunity.

AB  - Glucocorticoids (GCs; referred to clinically as corticosteroids) are steroid
      hormones with potent anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory profiles. Depending 
      on the context, these hormones can also mediate pro-inflammatory activities,
      thereby serving as primers of the immune system. Their target receptor, the GC
      receptor (GR), is a multi-tasking transcription factor, changing its role and
      function depending on cellular and organismal needs. To get a clearer idea of how
      to improve the safety profile of GCs, recent studies have investigated the
      complex mechanisms underlying GR functions. One of the key findings includes both
      pro- and anti-inflammatory roles of GR, and a future challenge will be to
      understand how such paradoxical findings can be reconciled and how GR ultimately 
      shifts the balance to a net anti-inflammatory profile. As such, there is
      consensus that GR deserves a second life as a drug target, with either refined
      classic GCs or a novel generation of nonsteroidal GR-targeting molecules, to meet
      the increasing clinical needs of today to treat inflammation and cancer.

TI  - Sirtuin 2 regulates cellular iron homeostasis via deacetylation of transcription 
      factor NRF2.
PG  - 1505-1516
LID - 88574 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88574 [doi]
AB  - SIRT2 is a cytoplasmic sirtuin that plays a role in various cellular processes,
      including tumorigenesis, metabolism, and inflammation. Since these processes
      require iron, we hypothesized that SIRT2 directly regulates cellular iron
      homeostasis. Here, we have demonstrated that SIRT2 depletion results in a
      decrease in cellular iron levels both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we
      determined that SIRT2 maintains cellular iron levels by binding to and
      deacetylating nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) on
      lysines 506 and 508, leading to a reduction in total and nuclear NRF2 levels. The
      reduction in nuclear NRF2 leads to reduced ferroportin 1 (FPN1) expression, which
      in turn results in decreased cellular iron export. Finally, we observed that
      Sirt2 deletion reduced cell viability in response to iron deficiency. Moreover,
      livers from Sirt2-/- mice had decreased iron levels, while this effect was
      reversed in Sirt2-/- Nrf2-/- double-KO mice. Taken together, our results uncover 
      a link between sirtuin proteins and direct control over cellular iron homeostasis
      via regulation of NRF2 deacetylation and stability.

      balance.

AB  - The nuclear receptors PPARalpha (encoded by NR1C1) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR,
      encoded by NR1H4) are activated in the liver in the fasted and fed state,
      respectively. PPARalpha activation induces fatty acid oxidation, while FXR
      controls bile acid homeostasis, but both nuclear receptors also regulate numerous
      other metabolic pathways relevant to liver energy balance. Here we review
      evidence that they function coordinately to control key nutrient pathways,
      including fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis in the fasted state and
      lipogenesis and glycolysis in the fed state. We have also recently reported that 
      these receptors have mutually antagonistic impacts on autophagy, which is induced
      by PPARalpha but suppressed by FXR. Secretion of multiple blood proteins is a
      major drain on liver energy and nutrient resources, and we present preliminary
      evidence that the liver secretome may be directly suppressed by PPARalpha, but
      induced by FXR. Finally, previous studies demonstrated a striking deficiency in
      bile acid levels in malnourished mice that is consistent with results in
      malnourished children. We present evidence that hepatic targets of PPARalpha and 
      FXR are dysregulated in chronic undernutrition. We conclude that PPARalpha and
      FXR function coordinately to integrate liver energy balance.

TI  - Membrane-organizing protein moesin controls Treg differentiation and antitumor
      immunity via TGF-beta signaling.
PG  - 1321-1337
LID - 89281 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89281 [doi]
AB  - Moesin is a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of proteins that are 
      important for organizing membrane domains and receptor signaling and regulating
      the migration of effector T cells. Whether moesin plays any role during the
      generation of TGF-beta-induced Tregs (iTregs) is unknown. Here, we have
      discovered that moesin is translationally regulated by TGF-beta and is also
      required for optimal TGF-beta signaling that promotes efficient development of
      iTregs. Loss of moesin impaired the development and function of both peripherally
      derived iTregs and in vitro-induced Tregs. Mechanistically, we identified an
      interaction between moesin and TGF-beta receptor II (TbetaRII) that allows moesin
      to control the surface abundance and stability of TbetaRI and TbetaRII. We also
      found that moesin is required for iTreg conversion in the tumor microenvironment,
      and the deletion of moesin from recipient mice supported the rapid expansion of
      adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells against melanoma. Our study establishes
      moesin as an important regulator of the surface abundance and stability of
      TbetaRII and identifies moesin's role in facilitating the efficient generation of
      iTregs. It also provides an advancement to our understanding about the role of
      the ERM proteins in regulating signal transduction pathways and suggests that
      modulation of moesin is a potential therapeutic target for Treg-related immune
      disorders.

      cholestatic liver fibrosis.
PG  - 1254-1270
LID - 88845 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88845 [doi]
AB  - Cholestatic liver fibrosis is caused by obstruction of the biliary tract and is
      associated with early activation of portal fibroblasts (PFs) that express Thy-1, 
      fibulin 2, and the recently identified marker mesothelin (MSLN). Here, we have
      demonstrated that activated PFs (aPFs) and myofibroblasts play a critical role in
      the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL).
      Conditional ablation of MSLN+ aPFs in BDL-injured mice attenuated liver fibrosis 
      by approximately 50%. Similar results were observed in MSLN-deficient mice
      (Msln-/- mice) or mice deficient in the MSLN ligand mucin 16 (Muc16-/- mice). In 
      vitro analysis revealed that MSLN regulates TGF-beta1-inducible activation of WT 
      PFs by disrupting the formation of an inhibitory Thy-1-TGFbetaRI complex. MSLN
      also facilitated the FGF-mediated proliferation of WT aPFs. Therapeutic
      administration of anti-MSLN-blocking Abs attenuated BDL-induced fibrosis in WT
      mice. Liver specimens from patients with cholestatic liver fibrosis had increased
      numbers of MSLN+ aPFs/myofibroblasts, suggesting that MSLN may be a potential
      target for antifibrotic therapy.

AB  - Vaccines targeting glycan structures at the surface of pathogenic microbes must
      overcome the inherent T cell-independent nature of immune responses against
      glycans. Carbohydrate conjugate vaccines achieve this by coupling bacterial
      polysaccharides to a carrier protein that recruits heterologous CD4 T cells to
      help B cell maturation. Yet they most often produce low- to medium-affinity
      immune responses of limited duration in immunologically fit individuals and
      disappointing results in the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Here, we
      hypothesized that these limitations result from suboptimal T cell help. To
      produce the next generation of more efficacious conjugate vaccines, we have
      explored a synthetic design aimed at focusing both B cell and T cell recognition 
      to a single short glycan displayed at the surface of a virus-like particle. We
      tested and established the proof of concept of this approach for 2 serotypes of
      Streptococcus pneumoniae. In both cases, these vaccines elicited
      serotype-specific, protective, and long-lasting IgG antibodies of nanomolar
      affinity against the target glycans in mice. We further identified a requirement 
      for CD4 T cells in the anti-glycan antibody response. Our findings establish the 
      design principles for improved glycan conjugate vaccines. We surmise that the
      same approach can be used for any microbial glycan of interest.

TI  - Mutations in gamma-secretase subunit-encoding PSENEN underlie Dowling-Degos
      disease associated with acne inversa.

AB  - Dowling-Degos disease (DDD) is an autosomal-dominant disorder of skin
      pigmentation associated with mutations in keratin 5 (KRT5), protein
      O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), or protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1).
      Here, we have identified 6 heterozygous truncating mutations in PSENEN, encoding 
      presenilin enhancer protein 2, in 6 unrelated patients and families with DDD in
      whom mutations in KRT5, POFUT1, and POGLUT1 have been excluded. Further
      examination revealed that the histopathologic feature of follicular
      hyperkeratosis distinguished these 6 patients from previously studied individuals
      with DDD. Knockdown of psenen in zebrafish larvae resulted in a phenotype with
      scattered pigmentation that mimicked human DDD. In the developing zebrafish
      larvae, in vivo monitoring of pigment cells suggested that disturbances in
      melanocyte migration and differentiation underlie the DDD pathogenesis associated
      with PSENEN. Six of the PSENEN mutation carriers presented with comorbid acne
      inversa (AI), an inflammatory hair follicle disorder, and had a history of
      nicotine abuse and/or obesity, which are known trigger factors for AI.
      Previously, PSENEN mutations were identified in familial AI, and comanifestation 
      of DDD and AI has been reported for decades. The present work suggests that
      PSENEN mutations can indeed cause a comanifestation of DDD and AI that is likely 
      triggered by predisposing factors for AI. Thus, the present report describes a
      DDD subphenotype in PSENEN mutation carriers that is associated with increased
      susceptibility to AI.

TI  - RANKL coordinates multiple osteoclastogenic pathways by regulating expression of 
      ubiquitin ligase RNF146.
PG  - 1303-1315
LID - 90527 [pii]

AB  - Bone undergoes continuous remodeling due to balanced bone formation and
      resorption mediated by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Osteoclasts
      arise from the macrophage lineage, and their differentiation is dependent on
      RANKL, a member of the TNF family of cytokines. Here, we have provided evidence
      that RANKL controls the expression of 3BP2, an adapter protein that is required
      for activation of SRC tyrosine kinase and simultaneously coordinates the
      attenuation of beta-catenin, both of which are required to execute the osteoclast
      developmental program. We found that RANKL represses the transcription of the E3 
      ubiquitin ligase RNF146 through an NF-kappaB-related inhibitory element in the
      RNF146 promoter. RANKL-mediated suppression of RNF146 results in the
      stabilization of its substrates, 3BP2 and AXIN1, which consequently triggers the 
      activation of SRC and attenuates the expression of beta-catenin, respectively.
      Depletion of RNF146 caused hypersensitivity to LPS-induced TNF-alpha production
      in vivo. RNF146 thus acts as an inhibitory switch to control osteoclastogenesis
      and cytokine production and may be a control point underlying the pathogenesis of
      chronic inflammatory diseases.

TI  - HDAC6-mediated acetylation of lipid droplet-binding protein CIDEC regulates
      fat-induced lipid storage.
PG  - 1353-1369
LID - 85963 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI85963 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is characterized by aberrant fat accumulation. However, the intracellular
      signaling pathway that senses dietary fat and leads to fat storage remains
      elusive. Here, we have observed that the levels of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) 
      and the related family member HDAC10 are markedly reduced in adipose tissues of
      obese animals and humans. Mice with adipocyte-specific depletion of Hdac6
      exhibited increased fat accumulation and reduced insulin sensitivity. In normal
      adipocytes, we found that reversal of P300/CBP-associated factor-induced
      (PCAF-induced) acetylation at K56 on cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C
      (CIDEC, also known as FSP27) critically regulated lipid droplet fusion and lipid 
      storage. Importantly, HDAC6 deacetylates CIDEC, leading to destabilization and
      reduced lipid droplet fusion. Accordingly, we observed elevated levels of CIDEC
      and its acetylated form in HDAC-deficient adipocytes as well as the adipose
      tissue of obese animals and humans. Fatty acids (FAs) prevented CIDEC
      deacetylation by promoting the dissociation of CIDEC from HDAC6, which resulted
      in increased association of CIDEC with PCAF on the endoplasmic reticulum. Control
      of CIDEC acetylation required the conversion of FAs to triacylglycerols. Thus, we
      have revealed a signaling axis that is involved in the coordination of nutrient
      availability, protein acetylation, and cellular lipid metabolic responses.

PG  - 1370-1374
LID - 90678 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90678 [doi]
AB  - Pain is fundamentally unpleasant and induces a negative affective state. The
      affective component of pain is mediated by circuits that are distinct from those 
      mediating the sensory-discriminative component. Here, we have investigated the
      role of prostaglandins in the affective dimension of pain using a rodent pain
      assay based on conditioned place aversion to formalin injection, an inflammatory 
      noxious stimulus. We found that place aversion induced by inflammatory pain
      depends on prostaglandin E2 that is synthesized by cyclooxygenase 2 in neural
      cells. Further, mice lacking the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3 selectively on
      serotonergic cells or selectively in the area of the dorsal raphe nucleus failed 
      to form an aversion to formalin-induced pain, as did mice lacking the serotonin
      transporter. Chemogenetic manipulations revealed that EP3 receptor activation
      elicited conditioned place aversion to pain via inhibition of serotonergic
      neurons. In contrast to their role in inflammatory pain aversion, EP3 receptors
      on serotonergic cells were dispensable for acute nociceptive behaviors and for
      aversion induced by thermal pain or a kappa opioid receptor agonist.
      Collectively, our findings show that prostaglandin-mediated modulation of
      serotonergic transmission controls the affective component of inflammatory pain.

      reduced CD11b activity and the chronically increased inflammatory status in
      patients. Treatment with the small-molecule CD11b agonist LA1 led to partial
      integrin activation, reduced IFN-I responses in WT but not CD11b-deficient mice, 
      and protected lupus-prone MRL/Lpr mice from end-organ injury. CD11b activation
      reduced TLR-dependent proinflammatory signaling in leukocytes and suppressed
      IFN-I signaling via an AKT/FOXO3/IFN regulatory factor 3/7 pathway.
      TLR-stimulated macrophages from CD11B SNP carriers showed increased basal
      expression of IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and IFN-beta, as well as increased
      nuclear exclusion of FOXO3, which was suppressed by LA1-dependent activation of
      CD11b. This suggests that pharmacologic activation of CD11b could be a potential 
      mechanism for developing SLE therapeutics.

TI  - Estrogens enhance myoblast differentiation in facioscapulohumeral muscular
      dystrophy by antagonizing DUX4 activity.
PG  - 1531-1545
LID - 89401 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89401 [doi]
AB  - Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant
      neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by extreme variability in symptoms, 
      with females being less severely affected than males and presenting a higher
      proportion of asymptomatic carriers. The sex-related factors involved in the
      disease are not known. Here, we have utilized myoblasts isolated from FSHD
      patients (FSHD myoblasts) to investigate the effect of estrogens on muscle
      properties. Our results demonstrated that estrogens counteract the
      differentiation impairment of FSHD myoblasts without affecting cell proliferation
      or survival. Estrogen effects are mediated by estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta),
      which reduces chromatin occupancy and transcriptional activity of double homeobox
      4 (DUX4), a protein whose aberrant expression has been implicated in FSHD
      pathogenesis. During myoblast differentiation, we observed that the levels and
      activity of DUX4 increased progressively and were associated with its enhanced
      recruitment in the nucleus. ERbeta interfered with this recruitment by
      relocalizing DUX4 in the cytoplasm. This work identifies estrogens as a potential
      disease modifier that underlie sex-related differences in FSHD by protecting
      against myoblast differentiation impairments in this disease.

TI  - Aggregation of scaffolding protein DISC1 dysregulates phosphodiesterase 4 in
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1438-1450
LID - 85594 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI85594 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a polyglutamine (polyQ) disease caused by aberrant
      expansion of the polyQ tract in Huntingtin (HTT). While motor impairment mediated
      by polyQ-expanded HTT has been intensively studied, molecular mechanisms for
      nonmotor symptoms in HD, such as psychiatric manifestations, remain elusive. Here
      we have demonstrated that HTT forms a ternary protein complex with the
      scaffolding protein DISC1 and cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) to
      regulate PDE4 activity. We observed pathological cross-seeding between DISC1 and 
      mutant HTT aggregates in the brains of HD patients as well as in a murine model
      that recapitulates the polyQ pathology of HD (R6/2 mice). In R6/2 mice,
      consequent reductions in soluble DISC1 led to dysregulation of DISC1-PDE4
      complexes, aberrantly increasing the activity of PDE4. Importantly, exogenous
      expression of a modified DISC1, which binds to PDE4 but not mutant HTT,
      normalized PDE4 activity and ameliorated anhedonia in the R6/2 mice. We propose
      that cross-seeding of mutant HTT and DISC1 and the resultant changes in PDE4
      activity may underlie the pathology of a specific subset of mental manifestations
      of HD, which may provide an insight into molecular signaling in mental illness in
      general.

TI  - Loss of DDRGK1 modulates SOX9 ubiquitination in spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia.
PG  - 1475-1484
LID - 90193 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90193 [doi]
AB  - Shohat-type spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) is a skeletal dysplasia that 
      affects cartilage development. Similar skeletal disorders, such as
      spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias, are linked to mutations in type II collagen
      (COL2A1), but the causative gene in SEMD is not known. Here, we have performed
      whole-exome sequencing to identify a recurrent homozygous c.408+1G>A donor splice
      site loss-of-function mutation in DDRGK domain containing 1 (DDRGK1) in 4
      families affected by SEMD. In zebrafish, ddrgk1 deficiency disrupted craniofacial
      cartilage development and led to decreased levels of the chondrogenic master
      transcription factor sox9 and its downstream target, col2a1. Overexpression of
      sox9 rescued the zebrafish chondrogenic and craniofacial phenotype generated by
      ddrgk1 knockdown, thus identifying DDRGK1 as a regulator of SOX9. Consistent with
      these results, Ddrgk1-/- mice displayed delayed limb bud chondrogenic
      condensation, decreased SOX9 protein expression and Col2a1 transcript levels, and
      increased apoptosis. Furthermore, we determined that DDRGK1 can directly bind to 
      SOX9 to inhibit its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Taken together,
      these data indicate that loss of DDRGK1 decreases SOX9 expression and causes a
      human skeletal dysplasia, identifying a mechanism that regulates chondrogenesis
      via modulation of SOX9 ubiquitination.

TI  - Laminar flow downregulates Notch activity to promote lymphatic sprouting.
PG  - 1225-1240
LID - 87442 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87442 [doi]
AB  - The major function of the lymphatic system is to drain interstitial fluid from
      tissue. Functional drainage causes increased fluid flow that triggers lymphatic
      expansion, which is conceptually similar to hypoxia-triggered angiogenesis. Here,
      we have identified a mechanotransduction pathway that translates laminar
      flow-induced shear stress to activation of lymphatic sprouting. While low-rate
      laminar flow commonly induces the classic shear stress responses in blood
      endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), only LECs display
      reduced Notch activity and increased sprouting capacity. In response to flow, the
      plasma membrane calcium channel ORAI1 mediates calcium influx in LECs and
      activates calmodulin to facilitate a physical interaction between Kruppel-like
      factor 2 (KLF2), the major regulator of shear responses, and PROX1, the master
      regulator of lymphatic development. The PROX1/KLF2 complex upregulates the
      expression of DTX1 and DTX3L. DTX1 and DTX3L, functioning as a heterodimeric
      Notch E3 ligase, concertedly downregulate NOTCH1 activity and enhance lymphatic
      sprouting. Notably, overexpression of the calcium reporter GCaMP3 unexpectedly
      inhibited lymphatic sprouting, presumably by disturbing calcium signaling.
      Endothelial-specific knockouts of Orai1 and Klf2 also markedly impaired lymphatic
      sprouting. Moreover, Dtx3l loss of function led to defective lymphatic sprouting,
      while Dtx3l gain of function rescued impaired sprouting in Orai1 KO embryos.
      Together, the data reveal a molecular mechanism underlying laminar flow-induced
      lymphatic sprouting.

TI  - Angiotensin AT1A receptors on leptin receptor-expressing cells control resting
      metabolism.

AB  - Leptin contributes to the control of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and blood
      pressure (BP) through its actions in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). The
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin AT1 receptors within the brain are
      also involved in the control of RMR and BP, but whether this regulation overlaps 
      with leptin's actions is unclear. Here, we have demonstrated the selective
      requirement of the AT1A receptor in leptin-mediated control of RMR. We observed
      that AT1A receptors colocalized with leptin receptors (LEPRs) in the ARC.
      Cellular coexpression of AT1A and LEPR was almost exclusive to the ARC and
      occurred primarily within neurons expressing agouti-related peptide (AgRP). Mice 
      lacking the AT1A receptor specifically in LEPR-expressing cells failed to show an
      increase in RMR in response to a high-fat diet and deoxycorticosterone
      acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) treatments, but BP control remained intact. Accordingly,
      loss of RMR control was recapitulated in mice lacking AT1A in AgRP-expressing
      cells. We conclude that angiotensin activates divergent mechanisms to control BP 
      and RMR and that the brain RAS functions as a major integrator for RMR control
      through its actions at leptin-sensitive AgRP cells of the ARC.

TI  - Downregulation of GATA1 drives impaired hematopoiesis in primary myelofibrosis.
PG  - 1316-1320
LID - 82905 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI82905 [doi]
AB  - Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal hematologic malignancy characterized by
      BM fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, circulating CD34+ cells, splenomegaly,
      and a propensity to evolve to acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, the spleen and BM
      of patients harbor atypical, clustered megakaryocytes, which contribute to the
      disease by secreting profibrotic cytokines. Here, we have revealed that
      megakaryocytes in PMF show impaired maturation that is associated with reduced
      GATA1 protein. In investigating the cause of GATA1 downregulation, our
      gene-expression study revealed the presence of the RPS14-deficient gene
      signature, which is associated with defective ribosomal protein function and
      linked to the erythroid lineage in 5q deletion myelodysplastic syndrome.
      Surprisingly, reduced GATA1 expression and impaired differentiation were limited 
      to megakaryocytes, consistent with a proproliferative effect of a GATA1
      deficiency on this lineage. Importantly, expression of GATA1 effectively rescued 
      maturation of PMF megakaryocytes. Together, these results suggest that ribosomal 
      deficiency contributes to impaired megakaryopoiesis in myeloproliferative
      neoplasms.

LID - 89857 [pii]

AB  - Global health is threatened by emerging viral infections, which largely lack
      effective vaccines or therapies. Targeting host pathways that are exploited by
      multiple viruses could offer broad-spectrum solutions. We previously reported
      that AAK1 and GAK, kinase regulators of the host adaptor proteins AP1 and AP2,
      are essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the underlying mechanism
      and relevance to other viruses or in vivo infections remained unknown. Here, we
      have discovered that AP1 and AP2 cotraffic with HCV particles in live cells.
      Moreover, we found that multiple viruses, including dengue and Ebola, exploit
      AAK1 and GAK during entry and infectious virus production. In cultured cells,
      treatment with sunitinib and erlotinib, approved anticancer drugs that inhibit
      AAK1 or GAK activity, or with more selective compounds inhibited intracellular
      trafficking of HCV and multiple unrelated RNA viruses with a high barrier to
      resistance. In murine models of dengue and Ebola infection, sunitinib/erlotinib
      combination protected against morbidity and mortality. We validated sunitinib-
      and erlotinib-mediated inhibition of AAK1 and GAK activity as an important
      mechanism of antiviral action. Additionally, we revealed potential roles for
      additional kinase targets. These findings advance our understanding of virus-host
      interactions and establish a proof of principle for a repurposed, host-targeted
      approach to combat emerging viruses.

AB  - Obesity causes insulin resistance, and PPARgamma ligands such as rosiglitazone
      are insulin sensitizing, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. In C57BL/6 (B6) mice,
      obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) has major effects on visceral epididymal
      adipose tissue (eWAT). Here, we report that HFD-induced obesity in B6 mice also
      altered the activity of gene regulatory elements and genome-wide occupancy of
      PPARgamma. Rosiglitazone treatment restored insulin sensitivity in obese B6 mice,
      yet, surprisingly, had little effect on gene expression in eWAT. However, in
      subcutaneous inguinal fat (iWAT), rosiglitazone markedly induced molecular
      signatures of brown fat, including the key thermogenic gene Ucp1.
      Obesity-resistant 129S1/SvImJ mice (129 mice) displayed iWAT browning, even in
      the absence of rosiglitazone. The 129 Ucp1 locus had increased PPARgamma binding 
      and gene expression that were preserved in the iWAT of B6x129 F1-intercrossed
      mice, with an imbalance favoring the 129-derived alleles, demonstrating a
      cis-acting genetic difference. Thus, B6 mice have genetically defective Ucp1
      expression in iWAT. However, when Ucp1 was activated by rosiglitazone, or by iWAT
      browning in cold-exposed or young mice, expression of the B6 version of Ucp1 was 
      no longer defective relative to the 129 version, indicating epigenomic rescue.
      These results provide a framework for understanding how environmental influences 
      like drugs can affect the epigenome and potentially rescue genetically determined
      disease phenotypes.

      lung allograft fibrosis.

AB  - Tissue fibrosis is the primary cause of long-term graft failure after organ
      transplantation. In lung allografts, progressive terminal airway fibrosis leads
      to an irreversible decline in lung function termed bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome (BOS). Here, we have identified an autocrine pathway linking nuclear
      factor of activated T cells 2 (NFAT1), autotaxin (ATX), lysophosphatidic acid
      (LPA), and beta-catenin that contributes to progression of fibrosis in lung
      allografts. Mesenchymal cells (MCs) derived from fibrotic lung allografts (BOS
      MCs) demonstrated constitutive nuclear beta-catenin expression that was dependent
      on autocrine ATX secretion and LPA signaling. We found that NFAT1 upstream of ATX
      regulated expression of ATX as well as beta-catenin. Silencing NFAT1 in BOS MCs
      suppressed ATX expression, and sustained overexpression of NFAT1 increased ATX
      expression and activity in non-fibrotic MCs. LPA signaling induced NFAT1 nuclear 
      translocation, suggesting that autocrine LPA synthesis promotes NFAT1
      transcriptional activation and ATX secretion in a positive feedback loop. In an
      in vivo mouse orthotopic lung transplant model of BOS, antagonism of the LPA
      receptor (LPA1) or ATX inhibition decreased allograft fibrosis and was associated
      with lower active beta-catenin and dephosphorylated NFAT1 expression. Lung
      allografts from beta-catenin reporter mice demonstrated reduced beta-catenin
      transcriptional activation in the presence of LPA1 antagonist, confirming an in
      vivo role for LPA signaling in beta-catenin activation.

AB  - The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is the single known regulatory mediator of hormonal 
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] in higher vertebrates. It acts in the
      nucleus of vitamin D target cells to regulate the expression of genes whose
      products control diverse, cell type-specific biological functions that include
      mineral homeostasis. In this Review we describe progress that has been made in
      defining new cellular sites of action of this receptor, the mechanisms through
      which this mediator controls the expression of genes, the biology that ensues,
      and the translational impact of this receptor on human health and disease. We
      conclude with a brief discussion of what comes next in understanding vitamin D
      biology and the mechanisms that underlie its actions.

AB  - B cells contribute to multiple aspects of autoimmune disorders and may play a
      role in triggering disease. Thus, targeting B cells may be a promising strategy
      for treating autoimmune disorders. Better understanding of the B cell subsets
      that are responsible for the development of autoimmunity will be critical for
      developing efficient therapies. Here we have reported that B cells expressing the
      transcription factor T-bet promote the rapid appearance of autoantibodies and
      germinal centers in spontaneous murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE). Conditional deletion of T-bet from B cells impaired the formation of
      germinal centers and mitigated the development of kidney damage and rapid
      mortality in SLE mice. B cell-specific deletion of T-bet was also associated with
      lower activation of both B cells and T cells. Taken together, our results suggest
      that targeting T-bet-expressing B cells may be a potential target for therapy for
      autoimmune diseases.

TI  - FOXP1 controls mesenchymal stem cell commitment and senescence during skeletal
      aging.
PG  - 1241-1253
LID - 89511 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89511 [doi]
AB  - A hallmark of aged mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) in bone marrow is the
      pivot of differentiation potency from osteoblast to adipocyte coupled with a
      decrease in self-renewal capacity. However, how these cellular events are
      orchestrated in the aging progress is not fully understood. In this study, we
      have used molecular and genetic approaches to investigate the role of forkhead
      box P1 (FOXP1) in transcriptional control of MSC senescence. In bone marrow MSCs,
      FOXP1 expression levels declined with age in an inverse manner with those of the 
      senescence marker p16INK4A. Conditional depletion of Foxp1 in bone marrow MSCs
      led to premature aging characteristics, including increased bone marrow
      adiposity, decreased bone mass, and impaired MSC self-renewal capacity in mice.
      At the molecular level, FOXP1 regulated cell-fate choice of MSCs through
      interactions with the CEBPbeta/delta complex and recombination signal binding
      protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPjkappa), key modulators of
      adipogenesis and osteogenesis, respectively. Loss of p16INK4A in Foxp1-deficient 
      MSCs partially rescued the defects in replication capacity and bone mass accrual.
      Promoter occupancy analyses revealed that FOXP1 directly represses transcription 
      of p16INK4A. These results indicate that FOXP1 attenuates MSC senescence by
      orchestrating their cell-fate switch while maintaining their replicative capacity
      in a dose- and age-dependent manner.

AB  - The antiviral restriction factor IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3)
      inhibits cell entry of a number of viruses, and genetic diversity within IFITM3
      determines susceptibility to viral disease in humans. Here, we used the murine
      CMV (MCMV) model of infection to determine that IFITM3 limits
      herpesvirus-associated pathogenesis without directly preventing virus
      replication. Instead, IFITM3 promoted antiviral cellular immunity through the
      restriction of virus-induced lymphopenia, apoptosis-independent NK cell death,
      and loss of T cells. Viral disease in Ifitm3-/- mice was accompanied by elevated 
      production of cytokines, most notably IL-6. IFITM3 inhibited IL-6 production by
      myeloid cells in response to replicating and nonreplicating virus as well as
      following stimulation with the TLR ligands Poly(I:C) and CpG. Although IL-6
      promoted virus-specific T cell responses, uncontrolled IL-6 expression in
      Ifitm3-/- mice triggered the loss of NK cells and subsequently impaired control
      of MCMV replication. Thus, IFITM3 represents a checkpoint regulator of antiviral 
      immunity that controls cytokine production to restrict viral pathogenesis. These 
      data suggest the utility of cytokine-targeting strategies in the treatment of
      virus-infected individuals with impaired IFITM3 activity.

AB  - Neural pathways, especially those in the hypothalamus, integrate multiple
      nutritional, hormonal, and neural signals, resulting in the coordinated control
      of body weight balance and glucose homeostasis. Nuclear receptors (NRs) sense
      changing levels of nutrients and hormones, and therefore play essential roles in 
      the regulation of energy homeostasis. Understanding the role and the underlying
      mechanisms of NRs in the context of energy balance control may facilitate the
      identification of novel targets to treat obesity. Notably, NRs are abundantly
      expressed in the brain, and emerging evidence indicates that a number of these
      brain NRs regulate multiple aspects of energy balance, including feeding, energy 
      expenditure and physical activity. In this Review we summarize some of the recent
      literature regarding effects of brain NRs on body weight regulation and discuss
      mechanisms underlying these effects.

AB  - The adult heart is uniquely designed and equipped to provide a continuous supply 
      of energy in the form of ATP to support persistent contractile function. This
      high-capacity energy transduction system is the result of a remarkable surge in
      mitochondrial biogenesis and maturation during the fetal-to-adult transition in
      cardiac development. Substantial evidence indicates that nuclear receptor
      signaling is integral to dynamic changes in the cardiac mitochondrial phenotype
      in response to developmental cues, in response to diverse postnatal physiologic
      conditions, and in disease states such as heart failure. A subset of
      cardiac-enriched nuclear receptors serve to match mitochondrial fuel preferences 
      and capacity for ATP production with changing energy demands of the heart. In
      this Review, we describe the role of specific nuclear receptors and their
      coregulators in the dynamic control of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy
      metabolism in the normal and diseased heart.

TI  - Nuclear receptors: emerging drug targets for parasitic diseases.
PG  - 1165-1171
LID - 88890 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88890 [doi]
AB  - Parasitic worms infect billions of people worldwide. Current treatments rely on a
      small group of drugs that have been used for decades. A shortcoming of these
      drugs is their inability to target the intractable infectious stage of the
      parasite. As well-known therapeutic targets in mammals, nuclear receptors have
      begun to be studied in parasitic worms, where they are widely distributed and
      play key roles in governing metabolic and developmental transcriptional networks.
      One such nuclear receptor is DAF-12, which is required for normal nematode
      development, including the all-important infectious stage. Here we review the
      emerging literature that implicates DAF-12 and potentially other nuclear
      receptors as novel anthelmintic targets.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a reemerging arbovirus, causes a crippling
      musculoskeletal inflammatory disease in humans characterized by fever,
      polyarthralgia, myalgia, rash, and headache. CHIKV is transmitted by Aedes
      species of mosquitoes and is capable of an epidemic, urban transmission cycle
      with high rates of infection. Since 2004, CHIKV has spread to new areas, causing 
      disease on a global scale, and the potential for CHIKV epidemics remains high.
      Although CHIKV has caused millions of cases of disease and significant economic
      burden in affected areas, no licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies are
      available. In this Review, we describe CHIKV epidemiology, replication cycle,
      pathogenesis and host immune responses, and prospects for effective vaccines and 
      highlight important questions for future research.

LID - 10.1172/JCI85113 [doi]
AB  - Regulatory B cells (Bregs) modulate immune responses predominantly, although not 
      exclusively, via the release of IL-10. The importance of human Bregs in the
      maintenance of immune homeostasis comes from a variety of immune-related
      pathologies, such as autoimmune diseases, cancers, and chronic infections that
      are often associated with abnormalities in Breg numbers or function. A continuous
      effort toward understanding Breg biology in healthy individuals will provide new 
      opportunities to develop Breg immunotherapy that could prove beneficial in
      treating various immune-mediated pathologies. In this Review, we discuss findings
      regarding human Bregs, including their mechanisms of suppression and role in
      different disease settings. We also propose several therapeutic strategies
      targeting Bregs for better management of immune disorders.

PG  - 750-760
LID - 89741 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89741 [doi]
AB  - Hemolysis is a fundamental feature of sickle cell anemia that contributes to its 
      pathophysiology and phenotypic variability. Decompartmentalized hemoglobin,
      arginase 1, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and adenine nucleotides are all products
      of hemolysis that promote vasomotor dysfunction, proliferative vasculopathy, and 
      a multitude of clinical complications of pulmonary and systemic vasculopathy,
      including pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, priapism, chronic kidney disease,
      and large-artery ischemic stroke. Nitric oxide (NO) is inactivated by cell-free
      hemoglobin in a dioxygenation reaction that also oxidizes hemoglobin to
      methemoglobin, a non-oxygen-binding form of hemoglobin that readily loses heme.
      Circulating hemoglobin and heme represent erythrocytic danger-associated
      molecular pattern (eDAMP) molecules, which activate the innate immune system and 
      endothelium to an inflammatory, proadhesive state that promotes sickle
      vaso-occlusion and acute lung injury in murine models of sickle cell disease.
      Intravascular hemolysis can impair NO bioavailability and cause oxidative stress,
      altering redox balance and amplifying physiological processes that govern blood
      flow, hemostasis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. These pathological responses
      promote regional vasoconstriction and subsequent blood vessel remodeling. Thus,
      intravascular hemolysis represents an intrinsic mechanism for human vascular
      disease that manifests clinical complications in sickle cell disease and other
      chronic hereditary or acquired hemolytic anemias.

AB  - In addition to being a component of innate immunity and an ancient defense
      mechanism against invading pathogens, complement activation also participates in 
      the adaptive immune response, inflammation, hemostasis, embryogenesis, and organ 
      repair and development. Activation of the complement system via classical,
      lectin, or alternative pathways generates anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and
      membrane attack complex (C5b-9) and opsonizes targeted cells. Complement
      activation end products and their receptors mediate cell-cell interactions that
      regulate several biological functions in the extravascular tissue. Signaling of
      anaphylatoxin receptors or assembly of membrane attack complex promotes cell
      dedifferentiation, proliferation, and migration in addition to reducing
      apoptosis. As a result, complement activation in the tumor microenvironment
      enhances tumor growth and increases metastasis. In this Review, I discuss immune 
      and nonimmune functions of complement proteins and the tumor-promoting effect of 
      complement activation.

AB  - Many RNA species have been identified as important players in the development of 
      chronic diseases, including cancer. Over the past decade, numerous studies have
      highlighted how regulatory RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding
      RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the development of a disease state. It is
      clear that the aberrant expression of miRNAs promotes tumor initiation and
      progression, is linked with cardiac dysfunction, allows for the improper
      physiological response in maintaining glucose and insulin levels, and can prevent
      the appropriate integration of neuronal networks, resulting in neurodegenerative 
      disorders. Because of this, there has been a major effort to therapeutically
      target these noncoding RNAs. In just the past 5 years, over 100 antisense
      oligonucleotide-based therapies have been tested in phase I clinical trials, a
      quarter of which have reached phase II/III. Most notable are fomivirsen and
      mipomersen, which have received FDA approval to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis
      and high blood cholesterol, respectively. The continued improvement of innovative
      RNA modifications and delivery entities, such as nanoparticles, will aid in the
      development of future RNA-based therapeutics for a broader range of chronic
      diseases. Here we summarize the latest promises and challenges of targeting
      noncoding RNAs in disease.

      development and embryonic hematopoiesis.

AB  - Microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) are increasingly recognized as
      organ-specific gatekeepers of their microenvironment. Microvascular ECs instruct 
      neighboring cells in their organ-specific vascular niches through angiocrine
      factors, which include secreted growth factors (angiokines), extracellular matrix
      molecules, and transmembrane proteins. However, the molecular regulators that
      drive organ-specific microvascular transcriptional programs and thereby regulate 
      angiodiversity are largely elusive. In contrast to other ECs, which form a
      continuous cell layer, liver sinusoidal ECs (LSECs) constitute discontinuous,
      permeable microvessels. Here, we have shown that the transcription factor GATA4
      controls murine LSEC specification and function. LSEC-restricted deletion of
      Gata4 caused transformation of discontinuous liver sinusoids into continuous
      capillaries. Capillarization was characterized by ectopic basement membrane
      deposition, formation of a continuous EC layer, and increased expression of
      VE-cadherin. Correspondingly, ectopic expression of GATA4 in cultured continuous 
      ECs mediated the downregulation of continuous EC-associated transcripts and
      upregulation of LSEC-associated genes. The switch from discontinuous LSECs to
      continuous ECs during embryogenesis caused liver hypoplasia, fibrosis, and
      impaired colonization by hematopoietic progenitor cells, resulting in anemia and 
      embryonic lethality. Thus, GATA4 acts as master regulator of hepatic
      microvascular specification and acquisition of organ-specific vascular
      competence, which are indispensable for liver development. The data also
      establish an essential role of the hepatic microvasculature in embryonic
      hematopoiesis.

AB  - Blood vessels have a unified mission to circulate blood throughout the body;
      however, they have additional diverse and specialized roles in various organs.
      For example, in the liver, discontinuous sinusoids, which are fenestrated
      capillaries with intercellular gaps and a fragmented basement membrane,
      facilitate delivery of macromolecules to highly metabolic hepatocytes. During
      embryonic development, discontinuous sinusoids also allow circulating
      hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells to populate the liver and promote blood
      cell differentiation. In this issue of the JCI, Geraud et al. describe an
      essential role for the transcription factor GATA4 in promoting the development of
      discontinuous sinusoids. In the absence of liver sinusoidal GATA4, mouse embryos 
      developed hepatic capillaries with upregulated endothelial cell junction proteins
      and a continuous basement membrane. These features prevented hematopoietic
      progenitor cells from transmigrating into the developing liver, and Gata4-mutant 
      embryos died from subsequent liver hypoplasia and anemia. This study highlights
      the surprising and extensive transcriptional control GATA4 exercises over
      specialized liver vascular development and function.

AB  - Autoimmune responses to meiotic germ cell antigens (MGCA) that are expressed on
      sperm and testis occur in human infertility and after vasectomy. Many MGCA are
      also expressed as cancer/testis antigens (CTA) in human cancers, but the
      tolerance status of MGCA has not been investigated. MGCA are considered to be
      uniformly immunogenic and nontolerogenic, and the prevailing view posits that
      MGCA are sequestered behind the Sertoli cell barrier in seminiferous tubules.
      Here, we have shown that only some murine MGCA are sequestered. Nonsequestered
      MCGA (NS-MGCA) egressed from normal tubules, as evidenced by their ability to
      interact with systemically injected antibodies and form localized immune
      complexes outside the Sertoli cell barrier. NS-MGCA derived from cell fragments
      that were discarded by spermatids during spermiation. They egressed as cargo in
      residual bodies and maintained Treg-dependent physiological tolerance. In
      contrast, sequestered MGCA (S-MGCA) were undetectable in residual bodies and were
      nontolerogenic. Unlike postvasectomy autoantibodies, which have been shown to
      mainly target S-MGCA, autoantibodies produced by normal mice with transient Treg 
      depletion that developed autoimmune orchitis exclusively targeted NS-MGCA. We
      conclude that spermiation, a physiological checkpoint in spermatogenesis,
      determines the egress and tolerogenicity of MGCA. Our findings will affect target
      antigen selection in testis and sperm autoimmunity and the immune responses to
      CTA in male cancer patients.

LID - 10.1172/JCI90031 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative modulators of gene expression that fine-tune
      numerous biological processes. miRNA loss-of-function rarely results in highly
      penetrant phenotypes, but rather, influences cellular responses to physiologic
      and pathophysiologic stresses. Here, we have reported that a single member of the
      evolutionarily conserved miR-7 family, miR-7a2, is essential for normal pituitary
      development and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) function in adulthood.
      Genetic deletion of mir-7a2 causes infertility, with low levels of gonadotropic
      and sex steroid hormones, small testes or ovaries, impaired spermatogenesis, and 
      lack of ovulation in male and female mice, respectively. We found that miR-7a2 is
      highly expressed in the pituitary, where it suppresses golgi glycoprotein 1
      (GLG1) expression and downstream bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) signaling
      and also reduces expression of the prostaglandin F2a receptor negative regulator 
      (PTGFRN), an inhibitor of prostaglandin signaling and follicle-stimulating
      hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Our results reveal that
      miR-7a2 critically regulates sexual maturation and reproductive function by
      interconnecting miR-7 genomic circuits that regulate FSH and LH synthesis and
      secretion through their effects on pituitary prostaglandin and BMP4 signaling.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling in the CNS has been linked to
      reduced food intake, lower body weight, improved glucose homeostasis, and
      activation of CNS stress axes. GLP-1 is produced by cells that express
      proglucagon (GCG); however, the stimuli that activate GCG+ neurons are not well
      known, which has made understanding the role of this neuronal population in the
      CNS a challenge. In this issue of the JCI, Gaykema et al. use designer receptors 
      exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) technology to specifically
      activate GCG+ neurons in mouse models. While activation of GCG+ neurons did
      reduce food intake, and variably decreased hepatic glucose production, other
      GLP-1-associated effects were not observed - e.g., activation of stress axes or
      stimulation of insulin secretion - in response to GCG+ neuron activation. The
      authors have provided a valuable model to study this set of neurons in vivo, and 
      their results provide new insights into the function of GCG+ neural activity in
      the brain and raise questions that will move research on this clinically relevant
      neural system forward.

AB  - Peptides derived from pre-proglucagon (GCG peptides) act in both the periphery
      and the CNS to change food intake, glucose homeostasis, and metabolic rate while 
      playing a role in anxiety behaviors and physiological responses to stress.
      Although the actions of GCG peptides produced in the gut and pancreas are well
      described, the role of glutamatergic GGC peptide-secreting hindbrain neurons in
      regulating metabolic homeostasis has not been investigated. Here, we have shown
      that chemogenetic stimulation of GCG-producing neurons reduces metabolic rate and
      food intake in fed and fasted states and suppresses glucose production without an
      effect on glucose uptake. Stimulation of GCG neurons had no effect on
      corticosterone secretion, body weight, or conditioned taste aversion. In the
      diet-induced obese state, the effects of GCG neuronal stimulation on
      gluconeogenesis were lost, while the food intake-lowering effects remained,
      resulting in reductions in body weight and adiposity. Our work suggests that GCG 
      peptide-expressing neurons can alter feeding, metabolic rate, and glucose
      production independent of their effects on hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis activation, aversive conditioning, or insulin secretion. We conclude that
      GCG neurons likely stimulate separate populations of downstream cells to produce 
      a change in food intake and glucose homeostasis and that these effects depend on 
      the metabolic state of the animal.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of a variety of
      biological processes and pathways. In this issue of the JCI, Ahmed et al. reveal 
      that miR-7a2 is a critical regulator of sexual maturation and reproductive
      function, as mice lacking miR-7a2 develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and
      infertility. Using a bioinformatics approach, the authors identified several
      miR-7a2 target genes and pathways that have not been previously associated with
      gonadotropin biosynthesis and/or secretion. Together, these results identify
      miR-7a2-regulated genes involved in reproductive hormone biosynthesis pathways
      and provide a framework for future studies aimed at understanding rare
      reproductive conditions.

AB  - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic disorder initiated by
      antibodies against complexes between human platelet factor 4 (hPF4) and heparin. 
      A better understanding of the events that initiate the prothrombotic state may
      improve approaches to antithrombotic management. Here, we visualized thrombus
      formation in an in vivo murine model and an endothelialized microfluidic system
      that simulate the pathogenesis of HIT. hPF4 released from platelets predominantly
      bound to peri-injury endothelium and formed HIT antigenic complexes that were
      dissociated by heparin. In mice expressing both hPF4+ and human platelet IgG Fc
      receptor IIA (FcgammaRIIA), infusion of the HIT-like monoclonal antibody KKO
      increased fibrin and platelet deposition at sites of injury, followed immediately
      by antigen formation on proximate endothelial cells. After a few minutes, HIT
      antigen was detected within the thrombus itself at the interface between the
      platelet core and the surrounding shell. We observed similar results in the
      humanized, endothelialized microfluidic system. hPF4 and KKO selectively bound to
      photochemically injured endothelium at sites where surface glycocalyx was
      reduced. These studies support the concept that the perithrombus endothelium is
      the predominant site of HIT antigen assembly. This suggests that disrupting
      antigen formation along the endothelium or protecting the endothelium may provide
      a therapeutic opportunity to prevent thrombotic complications of HIT, while
      sparing systemic hemostatic pathways.

AB  - Muscular dystrophies result from a defect in the linkage between the muscle fiber
      cytoskeleton and the basement membrane (BM). Congenital muscular dystrophy type
      MDC1A is caused by mutations in laminin alpha2 that either reduce its expression 
      or impair its ability to polymerize within the muscle fiber BM. Defects in this
      BM lead to muscle fiber damage from the force of contraction. In this issue of
      the JCI, McKee and colleagues use a laminin polymerization-competent, designer
      chimeric BM protein in vivo to restore function of a polymerization-defective
      laminin, leading to normalized muscle structure and strength in a mouse model of 
      MDC1A. Delivery of such a protein to patients could ameliorate many aspects of
      their disease.

AB  - Mutations in laminin alpha2-subunit (Lmalpha2, encoded by LAMA2) are linked to
      approximately 30% of congenital muscular dystrophy cases. Mice with a homozygous 
      mutation in Lama2 (dy2J mice) express a nonpolymerizing form of laminin-211
      (Lm211) and are a model for ambulatory-type Lmalpha2-deficient muscular
      dystrophy. Here, we developed transgenic dy2J mice with muscle-specific
      expression of alphaLNNd, a laminin/nidogen chimeric protein that provides a
      missing polymerization domain. Muscle-specific expression of alphaLNNd in dy2J
      mice resulted in strong amelioration of the dystrophic phenotype, manifested by
      the prevention of fibrosis and restoration of forelimb grip strength. alphaLNNd
      also restored myofiber shape, size, and numbers to control levels in dy2J mice.
      Laminin immunostaining and quantitation of tissue extractions revealed increased 
      Lm211 expression in alphaLNNd-transgenic dy2J mice. In cultured myotubes, we
      determined that alphaLNNd expression increased myotube surface accumulation of
      polymerization-deficient recombinant laminins, with retention of collagen IV,
      reiterating the basement membrane (BM) changes observed in vivo. Laminin LN
      domain mutations linked to several of the Lmalpha2-deficient muscular dystrophies
      are predicted to compromise polymerization. The data herein support the
      hypothesis that engineered expression of alphaLNNd can overcome polymerization
      deficits to increase laminin, stabilize BM structure, and substantially
      ameliorate muscular dystrophy.

AB  - Tissue inflammation is a key component of obesity-induced insulin resistance,
      with a variety of immune cell types accumulating in adipose tissue. Here, we have
      demonstrated increased numbers of B2 lymphocytes in obese adipose tissue and have
      shown that high-fat diet-induced (HFD-induced) insulin resistance is mitigated in
      B cell-deficient (Bnull) mice. Adoptive transfer of adipose tissue B2 cells
      (ATB2) from wild-type HFD donor mice into HFD Bnull recipients completely
      restored the effect of HFD to induce insulin resistance. Recruitment and
      activation of ATB2 cells was mediated by signaling through the chemokine
      leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and its receptor LTB4R1. Furthermore, the adverse effects
      of ATB2 cells on glucose homeostasis were partially dependent upon T cells and
      macrophages. These results demonstrate the importance of ATB2 cells in
      obesity-induced insulin resistance and suggest that inhibition of the LTB4/LTB4R1
      axis might be a useful approach for developing insulin-sensitizing therapeutics.

AB  - Defective apoptotic death of activated macrophages has been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the molecular signatures
      defining apoptotic resistance of RA macrophages are not fully understood. Here,
      global transcriptome profiling of RA macrophages revealed that the osmoprotective
      transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) critically
      regulates diverse pathologic processes in synovial macrophages including the cell
      cycle, apoptosis, and proliferation. Transcriptomic analysis of NFAT5-deficient
      macrophages revealed the molecular networks defining cell survival and
      proliferation. Proinflammatory M1-polarizing stimuli and hypoxic conditions were 
      responsible for enhanced NFAT5 expression in RA macrophages. An in vitro
      functional study demonstrated that NFAT5-deficient macrophages were more
      susceptible to apoptotic death. Specifically, CCL2 secretion in an
      NFAT5-dependent fashion bestowed apoptotic resistance to RA macrophages in vitro.
      Injection of recombinant CCL2 into one of the affected joints of Nfat5+/- mice
      increased joint destruction and macrophage infiltration, demonstrating the
      essential role of the NFAT5/CCL2 axis in arthritis progression in vivo. Moreover,
      after intra-articular injection, NFAT5-deficient macrophages were more
      susceptible to apoptosis and less efficient at promoting joint destruction than
      were NFAT5-sufficient macrophages. Thus, NFAT5 regulates macrophage survival by
      inducing CCL2 secretion. Our results provide evidence that NFAT5 expression in
      macrophages enhances chronic arthritis by conferring apoptotic resistance to
      activated macrophages.

      of adipocyte RNAs.

LID - 89484 [pii]

AB  - A highly orchestrated gene expression program establishes the properties that
      define mature adipocytes, but the contribution of posttranscriptional factors to 
      the adipocyte phenotype is poorly understood. Here we have shown that the
      RNA-binding protein PSPC1, a component of the paraspeckle complex, promotes
      adipogenesis in vitro and is important for mature adipocyte function in vivo.
      Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing revealed that
      PSPC1 binds to intronic and 3'-untranslated regions of a number of adipocyte
      RNAs, including the RNA encoding the transcriptional regulator EBF1. Purification
      of the paraspeckle complex from adipocytes further showed that PSPC1 associates
      with the RNA export factor DDX3X in a differentiation-dependent manner.
      Remarkably, PSPC1 relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during
      differentiation, coinciding with enhanced export of adipogenic RNAs. Mice lacking
      PSPC1 in fat displayed reduced lipid storage and adipose tissue mass and were
      resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance due to a compensatory
      increase in energy expenditure. These findings highlight a role for
      PSPC1-dependent RNA maturation in the posttranscriptional control of adipose
      development and function.

TI  - Somatic mutations in telomerase promoter counterbalance germline loss-of-function
      mutations.
PG  - 982-986
LID - 91161 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI91161 [doi]
AB  - Germline coding mutations in different telomere-related genes have been linked to
      autosomal-dominant familial pulmonary fibrosis. Individuals with these inherited 
      mutations demonstrate incomplete penetrance of clinical phenotypes affecting the 
      lung, blood, liver, skin, and other organs. Here, we describe the somatic
      acquisition of promoter mutations in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in
      blood leukocytes of approximately 5% of individuals with inherited
      loss-of-function coding mutations in TERT or poly(A)-specific ribonuclease
      (PARN), another gene linked to telomerase function. While these promoter
      mutations were initially identified as oncogenic drivers of cancer, individuals
      expressing the mutations have no history of cancer. Neither promoter mutation was
      found in population-based cohorts of similar or advanced age. The TERT promoter
      mutations were found more frequently in cis with the WT allele than the TERT
      coding sequence mutation. EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCLs)
      derived from subjects with TERT promoter mutations showed increased telomerase
      expression and activity compared with cell lines from family members with
      identical coding mutations. TERT promoter mutations resulted in an increased
      proliferation of LCLs and demonstrated positive selection over time. The
      persistence and recurrence of noncoding gain-of-function mutations in these cases
      suggests that telomerase activation is not only safely tolerated but also
      advantageous for clonal expansion.

TI  - A C3(H20) recycling pathway is a component of the intracellular complement
      system.
PG  - 970-981
LID - 89412 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89412 [doi]
AB  - An intracellular complement system (ICS) has recently been described in immune
      and nonimmune human cells. This system can be activated in a
      convertase-independent manner from intracellular stores of the complement
      component C3. The source of these stores has not been rigorously investigated. In
      the present study, Western blotting identified a band corresponding to C3 in
      freshly isolated human peripheral blood cells that was absent in corresponding
      cell lines. One difference between native cells and cell lines was the time
      absent from a fluid-phase complement source; therefore, we hypothesized that
      loading C3 from plasma was a route of establishing intracellular C3 stores. We
      found that many types of human cells specifically internalized C3(H2O), the
      hydrolytic product of C3, and not native C3, from the extracellular milieu.
      Uptake was rapid, saturable, and sensitive to competition with unlabeled C3(H2O),
      indicating a specific mechanism of loading. Under steady-state conditions,
      approximately 80% of incorporated C3(H2O) was returned to the extracellular
      space. These studies identify an ICS recycling pathway for C3(H2O). The loaded
      C3(H2O) represents a source of C3a, and its uptake altered the cytokine profile
      of activated CD4+ T cells. Importantly, these results indicate that the impact of
      soluble plasma factors should be considered when performing in vitro studies
      assessing cellular immune function.

TI  - Synaptic UNC13A protein variant causes increased neurotransmission and dyskinetic
      movement disorder.
PG  - 1005-1018
LID - 90259 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90259 [doi]
AB  - Munc13 proteins are essential regulators of neurotransmitter release at nerve
      cell synapses. They mediate the priming step that renders synaptic vesicles
      fusion-competent, and their genetic elimination causes a complete block of
      synaptic transmission. Here we have described a patient displaying a disorder
      characterized by a dyskinetic movement disorder, developmental delay, and autism.
      Using whole-exome sequencing, we have shown that this condition is associated
      with a rare, de novo Pro814Leu variant in the major human Munc13 paralog UNC13A
      (also known as Munc13-1). Electrophysiological studies in murine neuronal
      cultures and functional analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that the
      UNC13A variant causes a distinct dominant gain of function that is characterized 
      by increased fusion propensity of synaptic vesicles, which leads to increased
      initial synaptic vesicle release probability and abnormal short-term synaptic
      plasticity. Our study underscores the critical importance of fine-tuned
      presynaptic control in normal brain function. Further, it adds the neuronal
      Munc13 proteins and the synaptic vesicle priming process that they control to the
      known etiological mechanisms of psychiatric and neurological synaptopathies.

AB  - On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order banning the
      citizens of 7 countries from obtaining US entry visas for the next 90 days. Since
      the announcement, the news media have devoted a large portion of their coverage
      to the ban and its political ramifications. There have been arguments made by
      both sides that the ban will make our country safer, while others have argued
      that this executive order will result in the weakening of our country and
      bolstering of our enemies. As a physician-scientist who was born in Iran and
      immigrated to the US, I will stay away from the politics of this executive order;
      rather, I want to discuss the impact of the immigration ban on scientific
      discourse, education, and research programs, and how it may influence the
      dissemination of knowledge to physicians and scientists in low- and middle-income
      countries. I will use my own experience as an example of how the educational and 
      scientific systems in this country benefit those who strive to learn in a free
      and intellectually stimulating environment.

AB  - Primary adrenal insufficiency is life threatening and can present alone or in
      combination with other comorbidities. Here, we have described a primary adrenal
      insufficiency syndrome and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome caused by
      loss-of-function mutations in sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1
      executes the final decisive step of the sphingolipid breakdown pathway, mediating
      the irreversible cleavage of the lipid-signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate
      (S1P). Mutations in other upstream components of the pathway lead to harmful
      accumulation of lysosomal sphingolipid species, which are associated with a
      series of conditions known as the sphingolipidoses. In this work, we have
      identified 4 different homozygous mutations, c.665G>A (p.R222Q),
      c.1633_1635delTTC (p.F545del), c.261+1G>A (p.S65Rfs*6), and c.7dupA (p.S3Kfs*11),
      in 5 families with the condition. In total, 8 patients were investigated, some of
      whom also manifested other features, including ichthyosis, primary
      hypothyroidism, neurological symptoms, and cryptorchidism. Sgpl1-/- mice
      recapitulated the main characteristics of the human disease with abnormal adrenal
      and renal morphology. Sgpl1-/- mice displayed disrupted adrenocortical zonation
      and defective expression of steroidogenic enzymes as well as renal histology in
      keeping with a glomerular phenotype. In summary, we have identified SGPL1
      mutations in humans that perhaps represent a distinct multisystemic disorder of
      sphingolipid metabolism.

TI  - Epicardial YAP/TAZ orchestrate an immunosuppressive response following myocardial
      infarction.
PG  - 899-911
LID - 88759 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88759 [doi]
AB  - Ischemic heart disease resulting from myocardial infarction (MI) is the most
      prevalent form of heart disease in the United States. Post-MI cardiac remodeling 
      is a multifaceted process that includes activation of fibroblasts and a complex
      immune response. T-regulatory cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4+ T cells, have been 
      shown to suppress the innate and adaptive immune response and limit deleterious
      remodeling following myocardial injury. However, the mechanisms by which injured 
      myocardium recruits suppressive immune cells remain largely unknown. Here, we
      have shown a role for Hippo signaling in the epicardium in suppressing the
      post-infarct inflammatory response through recruitment of Tregs. Mice deficient
      in epicardial YAP and TAZ, two core Hippo pathway effectors, developed profound
      post-MI pericardial inflammation and myocardial fibrosis, resulting in
      cardiomyopathy and death. Mutant mice exhibited fewer suppressive Tregs in the
      injured myocardium and decreased expression of the gene encoding IFN-gamma, a
      known Treg inducer. Furthermore, controlled local delivery of IFN-gamma following
      MI rescued Treg infiltration into the injured myocardium of YAP/TAZ mutants and
      decreased fibrosis. Collectively, these results suggest that epicardial Hippo
      signaling plays a key role in adaptive immune regulation during the post-MI
      recovery phase.

TI  - Targeting the adenosine 2A receptor enhances chimeric antigen receptor T cell
      efficacy.
PG  - 929-941
LID - 89455 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89455 [doi]
AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been highly successful in treating
      hematological malignancies, including acute and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia.
      However, treatment of solid tumors using CAR T cells has been largely
      unsuccessful to date, partly because of tumor-induced immunosuppressive
      mechanisms, including adenosine production. Previous studies have shown that
      adenosine generated by tumor cells potently inhibits endogenous antitumor T cell 
      responses through activation of adenosine 2A receptors (A2ARs). Herein, we have
      observed that CAR activation resulted in increased A2AR expression and
      suppression of both murine and human CAR T cells. This was reversible using
      either A2AR antagonists or genetic targeting of A2AR using shRNA. In 2 syngeneic 
      HER2+ self-antigen tumor models, we found that either genetic or pharmacological 
      targeting of the A2AR profoundly increased CAR T cell efficacy, particularly when
      combined with PD-1 blockade. Mechanistically, this was associated with increased 
      cytokine production of CD8+ CAR T cells and increased activation of both CD8+ and
      CD4+ CAR T cells. Given the known clinical relevance of the CD73/adenosine
      pathway in several solid tumor types, and the initiation of phase I trials for
      A2AR antagonists in oncology, this approach has high translational potential to
      enhance CAR T cell efficacy in several cancer types.

AB  - Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) causes 15% of chronic kidney disease 
      cases. A mutation in 1 of over 40 monogenic genes can be detected in
      approximately 30% of individuals with SRNS whose symptoms manifest before 25
      years of age. However, in many patients, the genetic etiology remains unknown.
      Here, we have performed whole exome sequencing to identify recessive causes of
      SRNS. In 7 families with SRNS and facultative ichthyosis, adrenal insufficiency, 
      immunodeficiency, and neurological defects, we identified 9 different recessive
      mutations in SGPL1, which encodes sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase. All
      mutations resulted in reduced or absent SGPL1 protein and/or enzyme activity.
      Overexpression of cDNA representing SGPL1 mutations resulted in subcellular
      mislocalization of SGPL1. Furthermore, expression of WT human SGPL1 rescued
      growth of SGPL1-deficient dpl1Delta yeast strains, whereas expression of
      disease-associated variants did not. Immunofluorescence revealed SGPL1 expression
      in mouse podocytes and mesangial cells. Knockdown of Sgpl1 in rat mesangial cells
      inhibited cell migration, which was partially rescued by VPC23109, an S1P
      receptor antagonist. In Drosophila, Sply mutants, which lack SGPL1, displayed a
      phenotype reminiscent of nephrotic syndrome in nephrocytes. WT Sply, but not the 
      disease-associated variants, rescued this phenotype. Together, these results
      indicate that SGPL1 mutations cause a syndromic form of SRNS.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits associated with CHARGE 
      syndrome, which include cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay, coordination 
      problems, and autistic features, have not been identified. CHARGE syndrome has
      been associated with mutations in the gene encoding the ATP-dependent chromatin
      remodeler CHD7. CHD7 is expressed in neural stem and progenitor cells, but its
      role in neurogenesis during brain development remains unknown. Here we have shown
      that deletion of Chd7 from cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCps) results in 
      reduced GCp proliferation, cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay, and motor 
      deficits in mice. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed downregulated
      expression of the gene encoding the glycoprotein reelin (Reln) in Chd7-deficient 
      GCps. Recessive RELN mutations have been associated with severe cerebellar
      hypoplasia in humans. We found molecular and genetic evidence that reductions in 
      Reln expression contribute to GCp proliferative defects and cerebellar hypoplasia
      in GCp-specific Chd7 mouse mutants. Finally, we showed that CHD7 is necessary for
      maintaining an open, accessible chromatin state at the Reln locus. Taken
      together, this study shows that Reln gene expression is regulated by chromatin
      remodeling, identifies CHD7 as a previously unrecognized upstream regulator of
      Reln, and provides direct in vivo evidence that a mammalian CHD protein can
      control brain development by modulating chromatin accessibility in neuronal
      progenitors.

      reemergence.

AB  - The most frequent focal alterations in human retinoblastoma are mutations in the 
      tumor-suppressor gene retinoblastoma (RB) and amplification of the oncogene MYCN.
      Whether MYCN overexpression drives retinoblastoma has not been assessed in model 
      systems. Here, we have shown that Rb inactivation collaborates strongly with MYCN
      overexpression and leads to retinoblastoma in mice. Overexpression of human MYCN 
      in the context of Rb inactivation increased the expression of MYC-, E2F-, and
      ribosome-related gene sets, promoted excessive proliferation, and led to
      retinoblastoma with anaplastic changes. We then modeled responses to
      MYCN-directed therapy by suppressing MYCN expression in MYCN-driven
      retinoblastomas. Initially, MYCN suppression led to proliferation arrest and
      partial tumor regression with loss of anaplasia. However, over time,
      retinoblastomas reemerged, typically without reactivation of human MYCN or
      amplification of murine Mycn. A subset of returning retinoblastomas showed
      genomic amplification of a Mycn target gene encoding the miR cluster miR-17~92,
      while most retinoblastomas reemerged without clear genetic alterations in either 
      Mycn or known Mycn targets. This Rb/MYCN model recapitulates key genetic driver
      alterations seen in human retinoblastoma and reveals the emergence of MYCN
      independence in an initially MYCN-driven tumor.

AB  - Type I IFNs promote cellular responses to viruses, and IFN receptor (IFNAR)
      signaling regulates the responses of endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier
      (BBB) during neurotropic viral infection. However, the role of astrocytes in
      innate immune responses of the BBB during viral infection of the CNS remains to
      be fully elucidated. Here, we have demonstrated that type I IFNAR signaling in
      astrocytes regulates BBB permeability and protects the cerebellum from infection 
      and immunopathology. Mice with astrocyte-specific loss of IFNAR signaling showed 
      decreased survival after West Nile virus infection. Accelerated mortality was not
      due to expanded viral tropism or increased replication. Rather, viral entry
      increased specifically in the hindbrain of IFNAR-deficient mice, suggesting that 
      IFNAR signaling critically regulates BBB permeability in this brain region.
      Pattern recognition receptors and IFN-stimulated genes had higher basal and
      IFN-induced expression in human and mouse cerebellar astrocytes than did cerebral
      cortical astrocytes, suggesting that IFNAR signaling has brain region-specific
      roles in CNS immune responses. Taken together, our data identify cerebellar
      astrocytes as key responders to viral infection and highlight the existence of
      distinct innate immune programs in astrocytes from evolutionarily disparate
      regions of the CNS.

AB  - Long-acting anti-HIV products can substantively change the standard of care for
      patients with HIV/AIDS. To this end, hydrophobic antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) were
      recently developed for parenteral administration at monthly or longer intervals. 
      While shorter-acting hydrophilic drugs can be made into nanocarrier-encased
      prodrugs, the nanocarrier encasement must be boosted to establish long-acting ARV
      depots. The mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK-3) inhibitor URMC-099 provides this
      function by affecting autophagy. Here, we have shown that URMC-099 facilitates
      ARV sequestration and its antiretroviral responses by promoting the nuclear
      translocation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB). In monocyte-derived
      macrophages, URMC-099 induction of autophagy led to retention of nanoparticles
      containing the antiretroviral protease inhibitor atazanavir. These nanoparticles 
      were localized within macrophage autophagosomes, leading to a 4-fold enhancement 
      of mitochondrial and cell vitality. In rodents, URMC-099 activation of autophagy 
      led to 50-fold increases in the plasma drug concentration of the viral integrase 
      inhibitor dolutegravir. These data paralleled URMC-099-mediated induction of
      autophagy and the previously reported antiretroviral responses in HIV-1-infected 
      humanized mice. We conclude that pharmacologic induction of autophagy provides a 
      means to extend the action of a long-acting, slow, effective release of
      antiretroviral therapy.

AB  - Disruption of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway, either through
      genetic mutation of upstream regulatory components or mutation of RB1 itself, is 
      believed to be a required event in cancer. However, genetic alterations in the
      RB-regulated E2F family of transcription factors are infrequent, casting doubt on
      a direct role for E2Fs in driving cancer. In this work, a mutation analysis of
      human cancer revealed subtle but impactful copy number gains in E2F1 and E2F3 in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using a series of loss- and gain-of-function
      alleles to dial E2F transcriptional output, we have shown that copy number gains 
      in E2f1 or E2f3b resulted in dosage-dependent spontaneous HCC in mice without the
      involvement of additional organs. Conversely, germ-line loss of E2f1 or E2f3b,
      but not E2f3a, protected mice against HCC. Combinatorial mapping of chromatin
      occupancy and transcriptome profiling identified an E2F1- and E2F3B-driven
      transcriptional program that was associated with development and progression of
      HCC. These findings demonstrate a direct and cell-autonomous role for E2F
      activators in human cancer.

AB  - Elevated expression of the chemokine receptor CCR4 in tumors is associated with
      poor prognosis in several cancers. Here, we have determined that CCR4 was highly 
      expressed in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) biopsies and observed abnormal
      levels of CCR4 ligands in RCC patient plasma. An antagonistic anti-CCR4 antibody 
      had antitumor activity in the RENCA mouse model of RCC. CCR4 inhibition did not
      reduce the proportion of infiltrating leukocytes in the tumor microenvironment
      but altered the phenotype of myeloid cells, increased NK cell and Th1 cytokine
      levels, and reduced immature myeloid cell infiltrate and blood chemokine levels. 
      In spite of prominent changes in the myeloid compartment, the anti-CCR4 antibody 
      did not affect RENCA tumors in T cell-deficient mice, and treatment with an
      anti-class II MHC antibody abrogated its antitumor activity. We concluded that
      the effects of the anti-CCR4 antibody required the adaptive immune system and
      CD4+ T cells. Moreover, CCL17-induced IFN-gamma production was reduced when
      Th1-polarized normal CD4+ T cells were exposed to the CCR4 ligand, evidencing the
      involvement of CCR4 in Th1/Th2 regulation. The anti-CCR4 antibody, alone or in
      combination with other immune modulators, is a potential treatment approach to
      human solid cancers with high levels of CCR4-expressing tumor-infiltrating
      leukocytes and abnormal plasma CCR4 ligand levels.

TI  - Mutations in tropomyosin 4 underlie a rare form of human macrothrombocytopenia.

LID - 86154 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI86154 [doi]
AB  - Platelets are anuclear cells that are essential for blood clotting. They are
      produced by large polyploid precursor cells called megakaryocytes. Previous
      genome-wide association studies in nearly 70,000 individuals indicated that
      single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the gene encoding the actin cytoskeletal
      regulator tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) exert an effect on the count and volume of
      platelets. Platelet number and volume are independent risk factors for heart
      attack and stroke. Here, we have identified 2 unrelated families in the BRIDGE
      Bleeding and Platelet Disorders (BPD) collection who carry a TPM4 variant that
      causes truncation of the TPM4 protein and segregates with macrothrombocytopenia, 
      a disorder characterized by low platelet count. N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced
      (ENU-induced) missense mutations in Tpm4 or targeted inactivation of the Tpm4
      locus led to gene dosage-dependent macrothrombocytopenia in mice. All other blood
      cell counts in Tpm4-deficient mice were normal. Insufficient TPM4 expression in
      human and mouse megakaryocytes resulted in a defect in the terminal stages of
      platelet production and had a mild effect on platelet function. Together, our
      findings demonstrate a nonredundant role for TPM4 in platelet biogenesis in
      humans and mice and reveal that truncating variants in TPM4 cause a previously
      undescribed dominant Mendelian platelet disorder.

PG  - 405-414

LID - 10.1172/JCI87440 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic age-related lung disease with
      high mortality that is characterized by abnormal scarring of the lung parenchyma.
      There has been a recent attempt to define the age-associated changes predisposing
      individuals to develop IPF. Age-related perturbations that are increasingly found
      in epithelial cells and fibroblasts from IPF lungs compared with age-matched
      cells from normal lungs include defective autophagy, telomere attrition, altered 
      proteostasis, and cell senescence. These divergent processes seem to converge in 
      mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic distress, which potentiate maladaptation 
      to stress and susceptibility to age-related diseases such as IPF. Therapeutic
      approaches that target aging processes may be beneficial for halting the
      progression of disease and improving quality of life in IPF patients.

PG  - 415-426

LID - 10.1172/JCI89587 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal primary malignant brain tumor in
      adults. Patients die from recurrent tumors that have become resistant to therapy.
      New strategies are needed to design future therapies that target resistant cells.
      Recent genomic studies have unveiled the complexity of tumor heterogeneity in
      glioblastoma and provide new insights into the genomic landscape of tumor cells
      that survive and initiate tumor recurrence. Resistant cells also co-opt
      developmental pathways and display stem-like properties; hence we propose to name
      them recurrence-initiating stem-like cancer (RISC) cells. Genetic alterations and
      genomic reprogramming underlie the innate and adaptive resistance of RISC cells, 
      and both need to be targeted to prevent glioblastoma recurrence.

LID - 10.1172/JCI90328 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms play an influential role in nearly all aspects of physiology
      and behavior in the vast majority of species on Earth. The biological clockwork
      that regulates these rhythms is dynamic over the lifespan: rhythmic activities
      such as sleep/wake patterns change markedly as we age, and in many cases they
      become increasingly fragmented. Given that prolonged disruptions of normal
      rhythms are highly detrimental to health, deeper knowledge of how our biological 
      clocks change with age may create valuable opportunities to improve health and
      longevity for an aging global population. In this Review, we synthesize key
      findings from the study of circadian rhythms in later life, identify patterns of 
      change documented to date, and review potential physiological mechanisms that may
      underlie these changes.

LID - 10.1172/JCI89786 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure is a major source of morbidity and mortality. Replacing lost
      myocardium with new tissue is a major goal of regenerative medicine. Unlike adult
      mammals, zebrafish and neonatal mice are capable of heart regeneration following 
      cardiac injury. In both contexts, the regenerative program echoes molecular and
      cellular events that occur during cardiac development and morphogenesis, notably 
      muscle creation through division of cardiomyocytes. Based on studies over the
      past decade, it is now accepted that the adult mammalian heart undergoes a low
      grade of cardiomyocyte turnover. Recent data suggest that this cardiomyocyte
      turnover can be augmented in the adult mammalian heart by redeployment of
      developmental factors. These findings and others suggest that stimulating
      endogenous regenerative responses can emerge as a therapeutic strategy for human 
      cardiovascular disease.

      Parkinson's disease therapy.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experience loss of normal motor function
      (hypokinesia), but can develop uncontrollable movements known as dyskinesia upon 
      treatment with L-DOPA. Poverty or excess of movement in PD has been attributed to
      overactivity of striatal projection neurons forming either the indirect (iSPNs)
      or the direct (dSPNs) pathway, respectively. Here, we investigated the two
      pathways' contribution to different motor features using SPN type-specific
      chemogenetic stimulation in rodent models of PD (PD mice) and L-DOPA-induced
      dyskinesia (LID mice). Using the activatory Gq-coupled human M3 muscarinic
      receptor (hM3Dq), we found that chemogenetic stimulation of dSPNs mimicked, while
      stimulation of iSPNs abolished the therapeutic action of L-DOPA in PD mice. In
      LID mice, hM3Dq stimulation of dSPNs exacerbated dyskinetic responses to L-DOPA, 
      while stimulation of iSPNs inhibited these responses. In the absence of L-DOPA,
      only chemogenetic stimulation of dSPNs mediated through the Gs-coupled modified
      rat muscarinic M3 receptor (rM3Ds) induced appreciable dyskinesia in PD mice.
      Combining D2 receptor agonist treatment with rM3Ds-dSPN stimulation reproduced
      all symptoms of LID. These results demonstrate that dSPNs and iSPNs oppositely
      modulate both therapeutic and dyskinetic responses to dopamine replacement
      therapy in PD. We also show that chemogenetic stimulation of different signaling 
      pathways in dSPNs leads to markedly different motor outcomes. Our findings have
      important implications for the design of effective antiparkinsonian and
      antidyskinetic drug therapies.

      disease.
PG  - 454-456
LID - 92407 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI92407 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excess accumulation 
      of fat in the liver. In some cases, NAFLD is also accompanied by insulin
      resistance, resulting in metabolic dysfunction. Dietary fat content probably
      influences both NAFLD and insulin resistance; however, the immediate effects of
      fat consumption have not been fully explored. In this issue of the JCI, Hernandez
      et al. evaluated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in humans and mice
      following a single oral dose of saturated fat. This one bolus of fat resulted in 
      a measurable increase in insulin resistance, hepatic triglycerides, and
      gluconeogenesis. In mice, the saturated fat bolus resulted in the induction of
      several NAFLD-associated genes. Together, the results of this study indicate that
      saturated fat intake has immediate effects on metabolic function.

      response factor DNA binding.

LID - 88899 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88899 [doi]
AB  - We recently demonstrated that selective expression of the Rho GTPase-activating
      protein ARHGAP42 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) controls blood pressure by
      inhibiting RhoA-dependent contractility, providing a mechanism for the blood
      pressure-associated locus within the ARHGAP42 gene. The goals of the current
      study were to identify polymorphisms that affect ARHGAP42 expression and to
      better assess ARHGAP42's role in the development of hypertension. Using DNase I
      hypersensitivity methods and ENCODE data, we have identified a regulatory element
      encompassing the ARHGAP42 SNP rs604723 that exhibits strong SMC-selective,
      allele-specific activity. Importantly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of this
      element in cultured human SMCs markedly reduced endogenous ARHGAP42 expression.
      DNA binding and transcription assays demonstrated that the minor T allele
      variation at rs604723 increased the activity of this fragment by promoting serum 
      response transcription factor binding to a cryptic cis-element. ARHGAP42
      expression was increased by cell stretch and sphingosine 1-phosphate in a
      RhoA-dependent manner, and deletion of ARHGAP42 enhanced the progression of
      hypertension in mice treated with DOCA-salt. Our analysis of a well-characterized
      cohort of untreated borderline hypertensive patients suggested that ARHGAP42
      genotype has important implications in regard to hypertension risk. Taken
      together, our data add insight into the genetic mechanisms that control blood
      pressure and provide a potential target for individualized antihypertensive
      therapies.

AB  - Olfactory dysfunction is broadly associated with neurodevelopmental and
      neurodegenerative diseases and predicts increased mortality rates in healthy
      individuals. Conventional measurements of olfactory health assess odor processing
      pathways within the brain and provide a limited understanding of primary odor
      detection. Quantification of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which detect
      odors within the nasal cavity, would provide insight into the etiology of
      olfactory dysfunction associated with disease and mortality. Notably, OSNs are
      continually replenished by adult neurogenesis in mammals, including humans, so
      OSN measurements are primed to provide specialized insights into neurological
      disease. Here, we have evaluated a PET radiotracer, [11C]GV1-57, that
      specifically binds mature OSNs and quantifies the mature OSN population in vivo. 
      [11C]GV1-57 monitored native OSN population dynamics in rodents, detecting OSN
      generation during postnatal development and aging-associated neurodegeneration.
      [11C]GV1-57 additionally measured rates of neuron regeneration after acute injury
      and early-stage OSN deficits in a rodent tauopathy model of neurodegenerative
      disease. Preliminary assessment in nonhuman primates suggested maintained uptake 
      and saturable binding of [18F]GV1-57 in primate nasal epithelium, supporting its 
      translational potential. Future applications for GV1-57 include monitoring
      additional diseases or conditions associated with olfactory dysregulation,
      including cognitive decline, as well as monitoring effects of neuroregenerative
      or neuroprotective therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of saturated fat is a likely contributor to
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance, but the
      mechanisms that initiate these abnormalities in humans remain unclear. We
      examined the effects of a single oral saturated fat load on insulin sensitivity, 
      hepatic glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism in humans. Similarly, initiating
      mechanisms were examined after an equivalent challenge in mice. METHODS: Fourteen
      lean, healthy individuals randomly received either palm oil (PO) or vehicle
      (VCL). Hepatic metabolism was analyzed using in vivo 13C/31P/1H and ex vivo 2H
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
      clamps with isotope dilution. Mice underwent identical clamp procedures and
      hepatic transcriptome analyses. RESULTS: PO administration decreased whole-body, 
      hepatic, and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity by 25%, 15%, and 34%,
      respectively. Hepatic triglyceride and ATP content rose by 35% and 16%,
      respectively. Hepatic gluconeogenesis increased by 70%, and net glycogenolysis
      declined by 20%. Mouse transcriptomics revealed that PO differentially regulates 
      predicted upstream regulators and pathways, including LPS, members of the TLR and
      PPAR families, NF-kappaB, and TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK).
      CONCLUSION: Saturated fat ingestion rapidly increases hepatic lipid storage,
      energy metabolism, and insulin resistance. This is accompanied by regulation of
      hepatic gene expression and signaling that may contribute to development of
      NAFLD.REGISTRATION. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01736202. FUNDING: Germany: Ministry of

AB  - Insulin replacement is the cornerstone of type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment;
      however, glycemic control remains a challenge. Leptin has been shown to
      effectively restore euglycemia in rodent models of T1D; however, the mechanism or
      mechanisms by which leptin exerts glycemic control are unclear. In this issue of 
      the JCI, Perry and colleagues provide evidence that suppression of lipolysis is a
      key facet of leptin-mediated restoration of euglycemia. However, more work
      remains to be done to fully understand the antidiabetic mechanisms of leptin.

      ketoacidosis.
PG  - 657-669
LID - 88477 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88477 [doi]
AB  - The mechanism by which leptin reverses diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is unknown. We
      examined the acute insulin-independent effects of leptin replacement therapy in a
      streptozotocin-induced rat model of DKA. Leptin infusion reduced rates of
      lipolysis, hepatic glucose production (HGP), and hepatic ketogenesis by 50%
      within 6 hours and were independent of any changes in plasma glucagon
      concentrations; these effects were abrogated by coinfusion of corticosterone.
      Treating leptin- and corticosterone-infused rats with an adipose triglyceride
      lipase inhibitor blocked corticosterone-induced increases in plasma glucose
      concentrations and rates of HGP and ketogenesis. Similarly, adrenalectomized type
      1 diabetic (T1D) rats exhibited decreased rates of lipolysis, HGP, and
      ketogenesis; these effects were reversed by corticosterone infusion.
      Leptin-induced decreases in lipolysis, HGP, and ketogenesis in DKA were also
      nullified by relatively small increases (15 to 70 pM) in plasma insulin
      concentrations. In contrast, the chronic glucose-lowering effect of leptin in a
      STZ-induced mouse model of poorly controlled T1D was associated with decreased
      food intake, reduced plasma glucagon and corticosterone concentrations, and
      decreased ectopic lipid (triacylglycerol/diacylglycerol) content in liver and
      muscle. Collectively, these studies demonstrate marked differences in the acute
      insulin-independent effects by which leptin reverses fasting hyperglycemia and
      ketoacidosis in a rodent model of DKA versus the chronic pleotropic effects by
      which leptin reverses hyperglycemia in a non-DKA rodent model of T1D.

TI  - Kisspeptin modulates sexual and emotional brain processing in humans.
PG  - 709-719
LID - 89519 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89519 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex, emotion, and reproduction are fundamental and tightly entwined
      aspects of human behavior. At a population level in humans, both the desire for
      sexual stimulation and the desire to bond with a partner are important precursors
      to reproduction. However, the relationships between these processes are
      incompletely understood. The limbic brain system has key roles in sexual and
      emotional behaviors, and is a likely candidate system for the integration of
      behavior with the hormonal reproductive axis. We investigated the effects of
      kisspeptin, a recently identified key reproductive hormone, on limbic brain
      activity and behavior. METHODS: Using a combination of functional neuroimaging
      and hormonal and psychometric analyses, we compared the effects of kisspeptin
      versus vehicle administration in 29 healthy heterosexual young men. RESULTS: We
      demonstrated that kisspeptin administration enhanced limbic brain activity
      specifically in response to sexual and couple-bonding stimuli. Furthermore,
      kisspeptin's enhancement of limbic brain structures correlated with psychometric 
      measures of reward, drive, mood, and sexual aversion, providing functional
      significance. In addition, kisspeptin administration attenuated negative mood.
      CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data provide evidence of an undescribed role for
      kisspeptin in integrating sexual and emotional brain processing with reproduction
      in humans. These results have important implications for our understanding of
      reproductive biology and are highly relevant to the current pharmacological
      development of kisspeptin as a potential therapeutic agent for patients with
      common disorders of reproductive function. FUNDING: National Institute for Health

AB  - PET allows noninvasive imaging of a variety of events in the body, including the 
      activity of neuronal circuits in the brain that are involved in cognition and
      behaviors, by using radiotracers that detect relevant biological reactions. A
      major impediment to expanding PET applications to study the brain has been the
      lack of radiotracers that can identify and measure specific types of neurons or
      glial cells. In this issue of the JCI, Van de Bittner and colleagues describe a
      promising step toward solving this problem by identifying and describing a
      radiotracer, [11C]GV1-57, that appears to specifically label olfactory sensory
      neurons (OSNs), which are essential for olfaction (Figure 1). This tracer, if its
      specificity is confirmed, has the potential to become a prototype for future
      radiotracers that can identify other neuronal cell types and would allow
      visualization and in-depth characterization of these neurons and their genesis.

AB  - Orphan GPCRs provide an opportunity to identify potential pharmacological
      targets, yet their expression patterns and physiological functions remain
      challenging to elucidate. Here, we have used a genetically engineered knockin
      reporter mouse to map the expression pattern of the Gpr182 during development and
      adulthood. We observed that Gpr182 is expressed at the crypt base throughout the 
      small intestine, where it is enriched in crypt base columnar stem cells, one of
      the most active stem cell populations in the body. Gpr182 knockdown had no effect
      on homeostatic intestinal proliferation in vivo, but led to marked increases in
      proliferation during intestinal regeneration following irradiation-induced
      injury. In the ApcMin mouse model, which forms spontaneous intestinal adenomas,
      reductions in Gpr182 led to more adenomas and decreased survival. Loss of Gpr182 
      enhanced organoid growth efficiency ex vivo in an EGF-dependent manner. Gpr182
      reduction led to increased activation of ERK1/2 in basal and challenge models,
      demonstrating a potential role for this orphan GPCR in regulating the
      proliferative capacity of the intestine. Importantly, GPR182 expression was
      profoundly reduced in numerous human carcinomas, including colon adenocarcinoma. 
      Together, these results implicate Gpr182 as a negative regulator of intestinal
      MAPK signaling-induced proliferation, particularly during regeneration and
      adenoma formation.

AB  - Current strategies for HIV-1 eradication require the reactivation of latent HIV-1
      in resting CD4+ T cells (rCD4s). Global T cell activation is a well-characterized
      means of inducing HIV-1 transcription, but is considered too toxic for clinical
      applications. Here, we have explored a strategy that involves a combination of
      immune activation and the immunosuppressive mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. In purified
      rCD4s from HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy, rapamycin
      treatment downregulated markers of toxicity, including proinflammatory cytokine
      release and cellular proliferation that were induced after potent T cell
      activation using alphaCD3/alphaCD28 antibodies. Using an ex vivo assay for HIV-1 
      mRNA, we demonstrated that despite this immunomodulatory effect, rapamycin did
      not affect HIV-1 gene expression induced by T cell activation in these rCD4s. In 
      contrast, treating activated rCD4s with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin, a
      calcineurin inhibitor, robustly inhibited HIV-1 reactivation. Importantly,
      rapamycin treatment did not impair cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition and
      killing of infected cells. These findings raise the possibility of using
      rapamycin in conjunction with T cell-activating agents in HIV-1 cure strategies.

AB  - Compromised apoptotic signaling is a prerequisite for tumorigenesis. The design
      of effective therapies for cancer treatment depends on a comprehensive
      understanding of the mechanisms that govern cell survival. The antiapoptotic
      proteins of the BCL-2 family are key regulators of cell survival and are
      frequently overexpressed in malignancies, leading to increased cancer cell
      survival. Unlike BCL-2 and BCL-XL, the closest antiapoptotic relative BCL-W is
      required for spermatogenesis, but was considered dispensable for all other cell
      types. Here, however, we have exposed a critical role for BCL-W in B cell
      survival and lymphomagenesis. Loss of Bcl-w conferred sensitivity to growth
      factor deprivation-induced B cell apoptosis. Moreover, Bcl-w loss profoundly
      delayed MYC-mediated B cell lymphoma development due to increased MYC-induced B
      cell apoptosis. We also determined that MYC regulates BCL-W expression through
      its transcriptional regulation of specific miR. BCL-W expression was highly
      selected for in patient samples of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), with 88.5% expressing
      BCL-W. BCL-W knockdown in BL cell lines induced apoptosis, and its overexpression
      conferred resistance to BCL-2 family-targeting BH3 mimetics. Additionally, BCL-W 
      was overexpressed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and correlated with decreased 
      patient survival. Collectively, our results reveal that BCL-W profoundly
      contributes to B cell lymphoma, and its expression could serve as a biomarker for
      diagnosis and aid in the development of better targeted therapies.

AB  - Hepatic steatosis is caused by metabolic imbalances that could be explained in
      part by an increase in de novo lipogenesis that results from increased sterol
      element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity. The nuclear receptor liver receptor
      homolog 1 (LRH-1) is an important regulator of intermediary metabolism in the
      liver, but its role in regulating lipogenesis is not well understood. Here, we
      have assessed the contribution of LRH-1 SUMOylation to the development of
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mice expressing a SUMOylation-defective
      mutant of LRH-1 (LRH-1 K289R mice) developed NAFLD and early signs of
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) when challenged with a lipogenic, high-fat,
      high-sucrose diet. Moreover, we observed that the LRH-1 K289R mutation induced
      the expression of oxysterol binding protein-like 3 (OSBPL3), enhanced SREBP-1
      processing, and promoted de novo lipogenesis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated
      that ectopic expression of OSBPL3 facilitates SREBP-1 processing in WT mice,
      while silencing hepatic Osbpl3 reverses the lipogenic phenotype of LRH-1 K289R
      mice. These findings suggest that compromised SUMOylation of LRH-1 promotes the
      development of NAFLD under lipogenic conditions through regulation of OSBPL3.

AB  - Congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) is a severe autosomal recessive human
      diarrheal disorder with characteristic intestinal epithelial dysplasia. CTE can
      be caused by mutations in genes encoding EpCAM, a putative adhesion molecule, and
      HAI-2, a cell surface protease inhibitor. A similar phenotype occurs in mice
      whose intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) fail to express the tight
      junction-associated protein claudin-7. EpCAM stabilizes claudin-7 in IECs, and
      HAI-2 regulates the cell surface serine protease matriptase, a known modifier of 
      intestinal epithelial physiology. Therefore, we hypothesized that HAI-2,
      matriptase, EpCAM, and claudin-7 were functionally linked. Herein we have
      demonstrated that active matriptase cleaves EpCAM after Arg80 and that loss of
      HAI-2 in IECs led to unrestrained matriptase activity and efficient cleavage of
      EpCAM. Cleavage of EpCAM decreased its ability to associate with claudin-7 and
      targeted it for internalization and lysosomal degradation in conjunction with
      claudin-7. CTE-associated HAI-2 mutant proteins exhibited reduced ability to
      inhibit matriptase and also failed to efficiently stabilize claudin-7 in IECs.
      These results identify EpCAM as a substrate of matriptase and link HAI-2,
      matriptase, EpCAM, and claudin-7 in a functionally important pathway that causes 
      disease when it is dysregulated.

AB  - Sensory neurons have the capacity to produce, release, and respond to
      acetylcholine (ACh), but the functional role of cholinergic systems in adult
      mammalian peripheral sensory nerves has not been established. Here, we have
      reported that neurite outgrowth from adult sensory neurons that were maintained
      under subsaturating neurotrophic factor conditions operates under cholinergic
      constraint that is mediated by muscarinic receptor-dependent regulation of
      mitochondrial function via AMPK. Sensory neurons from mice lacking the muscarinic
      ACh type 1 receptor (M1R) exhibited enhanced neurite outgrowth, confirming the
      role of M1R in tonic suppression of axonal plasticity. M1R-deficient mice made
      diabetic with streptozotocin were protected from physiological and structural
      indices of sensory neuropathy. Pharmacological blockade of M1R using specific or 
      selective antagonists, pirenzepine, VU0255035, or muscarinic toxin 7 (MT7)
      activated AMPK and overcame diabetes-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro
      and in vivo. These antimuscarinic drugs prevented or reversed indices of
      peripheral neuropathy, such as depletion of sensory nerve terminals, thermal
      hypoalgesia, and nerve conduction slowing in diverse rodent models of diabetes.
      Pirenzepine and MT7 also prevented peripheral neuropathy induced by the
      chemotherapeutic agents dichloroacetate and paclitaxel or HIV envelope protein
      gp120. As a variety of antimuscarinic drugs are approved for clinical use against
      other conditions, prompt translation of this therapeutic approach to clinical
      trials is feasible.

TI  - MerTK receptor cleavage promotes plaque necrosis and defective resolution in
      atherosclerosis.
PG  - 564-568
LID - 90520 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90520 [doi]
AB  - Atherothrombotic vascular disease is often triggered by a distinct type of
      atherosclerotic lesion that displays features of impaired inflammation
      resolution, notably a necrotic core and thinning of a protective fibrous cap that
      overlies the core. A key cause of plaque necrosis is defective clearance of
      apoptotic cells, or efferocytosis, by lesional macrophages, but the mechanisms
      underlying defective efferocytosis and its possible links to impaired resolution 
      in atherosclerosis are incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that
      proteolytic cleavage of the macrophage efferocytosis receptor c-Mer tyrosine
      kinase (MerTK) reduces efferocytosis and promotes plaque necrosis and defective
      resolution. In human carotid plaques, MerTK cleavage correlated with plaque
      necrosis and the presence of ischemic symptoms. Moreover, in fat-fed LDL
      receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice whose myeloid cells expressed a
      cleavage-resistant variant of MerTK, atherosclerotic lesions exhibited higher
      macrophage MerTK, lower levels of the cleavage product soluble Mer, improved
      efferocytosis, smaller necrotic cores, thicker fibrous caps, and increased ratio 
      of proresolving versus proinflammatory lipid mediators. These findings provide a 
      plausible molecular-cellular mechanism that contributes to defective
      efferocytosis, plaque necrosis, and impaired resolution during the progression of
      atherosclerosis.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a disabling multisystemic disease that
      predominantly affects skeletal muscle. It is caused by expanded CTG repeats in
      the 3'-UTR of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. RNA hairpins
      formed by elongated DMPK transcripts sequester RNA-binding proteins, leading to
      mis-splicing of numerous pre-mRNAs. Here, we have investigated whether
      DM1-associated muscle pathology is related to deregulation of central metabolic
      pathways, which may identify potential therapeutic targets for the disease. In a 
      well-characterized mouse model for DM1 (HSALR mice), activation of AMPK signaling
      in muscle was impaired under starved conditions, while mTORC1 signaling remained 
      active. In parallel, autophagic flux was perturbed in HSALR muscle and in
      cultured human DM1 myotubes. Pharmacological approaches targeting AMPK/mTORC1
      signaling greatly ameliorated muscle function in HSALR mice. AICAR, an AMPK
      activator, led to a strong reduction of myotonia, which was accompanied by
      partial correction of misregulated alternative splicing. Rapamycin, an mTORC1
      inhibitor, improved muscle relaxation and increased muscle force in HSALR mice
      without affecting splicing. These findings highlight the involvement of
      AMPK/mTORC1 deregulation in DM1 muscle pathophysiology and may open potential
      avenues for the treatment of this disease.

      for degradation.

AB  - Failure of trabecular myocytes to undergo appropriate cell cycle withdrawal leads
      to ventricular noncompaction and heart failure. Signaling of growth factor
      receptor ERBB2 is critical for myocyte proliferation and trabeculation. However, 
      the mechanisms underlying appropriate downregulation of trabecular ERBB2
      signaling are little understood. Here, we have found that the endocytic adaptor
      proteins NUMB and NUMBL were required for downregulation of ERBB2 signaling in
      maturing trabeculae. Loss of NUMB and NUMBL resulted in a partial block of late
      endosome formation, resulting in sustained ERBB2 signaling and STAT5 activation. 
      Unexpectedly, activated STAT5 overrode Hippo-mediated inhibition and drove YAP1
      to the nucleus. Consequent aberrant cardiomyocyte proliferation resulted in
      ventricular noncompaction that was markedly rescued by heterozygous loss of
      function of either ERBB2 or YAP1. Further investigations revealed that NUMB and
      NUMBL interacted with small GTPase Rab7 to transition ERBB2 from early to late
      endosome for degradation. Our studies provide insight into mechanisms by which
      NUMB and NUMBL promote cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal and highlight
      previously unsuspected connections between pathways that are important for
      cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry, with relevance to ventricular noncompaction
      cardiomyopathy and regenerative medicine.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRs) are tightly regulated in the immune system, and aberrant
      expression of miRs often results in hematopoietic malignancies and autoimmune
      diseases. Previously, it was suggested that elevated levels of miR-27 in T cells 
      isolated from patients with multiple sclerosis facilitate disease progression by 
      inhibiting Th2 immunity and promoting pathogenic Th1 responses. Here we have
      demonstrated that, although mice with T cell-specific overexpression of miR-27
      harbor dysregulated Th1 responses and develop autoimmune pathology, these disease
      phenotypes are not driven by miR-27 in effector T cells in a cell-autonomous
      manner. Rather, dysregulation of Th1 responses and autoimmunity resulted from a
      perturbed Treg compartment. Excessive miR-27 expression in murine T cells
      severely impaired Treg differentiation. Moreover, Tregs with exaggerated
      miR-27-mediated gene regulation exhibited diminished homeostasis and suppressor
      function in vivo. Mechanistically, we determined that miR-27 represses several
      known as well as previously uncharacterized targets that play critical roles in
      controlling multiple aspects of Treg biology. Collectively, our data show that
      miR-27 functions as a key regulator in Treg development and function and suggest 
      that proper regulation of miR-27 is pivotal to safeguarding Treg-mediated
      immunological tolerance.

AB  - The BM niche comprises a tightly controlled microenvironment formed by specific
      tissue and cells that regulates the behavior of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). 
      Here, we have provided a 3D model that is tunable in different BM niche
      components and useful, both in vitro and in vivo, for studying the maintenance of
      normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Using scaffolds, we tested the capacity of
      different stromal cell types to support human HSCs. Scaffolds coated with human
      mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) proved to be superior in terms of HSC
      engraftment and long-term maintenance when implanted in vivo. Moreover, we found 
      that hMSC-coated scaffolds can be modulated to form humanized bone tissue, which 
      was also able to support human HSC engraftment. Importantly, hMSC-coated
      humanized scaffolds were able to support the growth of leukemia patient cells in 
      vivo, including the growth of samples that would not engraft the BM of
      immunodeficient mice. These results demonstrate that an s.c. implantation
      approach in a 3D carrier scaffold seeded with stromal cells is an effective in
      vivo niche model for studying human hematopoiesis. The various niche components
      of this model can be changed depending on the context to improve the engraftment 
      of nonengrafting acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples.

AB  - Patients with leukemia who receive a T cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell graft
      followed by postponed donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can experience
      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity, with a lower risk of graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD). Here, we have investigated the magnitude, diversity, and
      specificity of alloreactive CD8 T cells in patients who developed GVL reactivity 
      after DLI in the absence or presence of GVHD. We observed a lower magnitude and
      diversity of CD8 T cells for minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs) in
      patients with selective GVL reactivity without GVHD. Furthermore, we demonstrated
      that MiHA-specific T cell clones from patients with selective GVL reactivity
      showed lower reactivity against nonhematopoietic cells, even when pretreated with
      inflammatory cytokines. Expression analysis of MiHA-encoding genes showed that
      similar types of antigens were recognized in both patient groups, but in patients
      who developed GVHD, T cell reactivity was skewed to target broadly expressed
      MiHAs. As an inflammatory environment can render nonhematopoietic cells
      susceptible to T cell recognition, prevention of such circumstances favors
      induction of selective GVL reactivity without development of GVHD.

TI  - Gsalpha deficiency in the dorsomedial hypothalamus underlies obesity associated
      with Gsalpha mutations.

AB  - Gsalpha, encoded by Gnas, mediates hormone and neurotransmitter
      receptor-stimulated cAMP generation. Heterozygous Gsalpha-inactivating mutations 
      lead to obesity in Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) patients, but only
      when the mutations occur on the maternal allele. This parent-of-origin effect is 
      due to Gsalpha imprinting in the CNS, although the relevant CNS regions are
      unknown. We have now shown that mice with a Gnas gene deletion disrupting Gsalpha
      expression on the maternal allele, but not the paternal allele, in the
      dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) developed obesity and reduced
      energy expenditure without hyperphagia. Although maternal Gnas deletion impaired 
      activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in mice, their responses to cold
      environment remained intact. Similar findings were observed in mice with
      DMH-specific deficiency of melanocortin MC4R receptors, which are known to
      activate Gsalpha. Our results show that Gsalpha imprinting in the DMH underlies
      the parent-of-origin metabolic phenotype that results from Gsalpha mutations and 
      that DMH MC4R/Gsalpha signaling is important for regulation of energy expenditure
      and BAT activation, but not the metabolic response to cold.

TI  - Carbohydrate-binding protein CLEC14A regulates VEGFR-2- and VEGFR-3-dependent
      signals during angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.
PG  - 457-471
LID - 85145 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI85145 [doi]
AB  - Controlled angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are essential for tissue
      development, function, and repair. However, aberrant neovascularization is an
      essential pathogenic mechanism in many human diseases, including diseases
      involving tumor growth and survival. Here, we have demonstrated that mice
      deficient in C-type lectin family 14 member A (CLEC14A) display enhanced
      angiogenic sprouting and hemorrhage as well as enlarged jugular lymph sacs and
      lymphatic vessels. CLEC14A formed a complex with VEGFR-3 in endothelial cells
      (ECs), and CLEC14A KO resulted in a marked reduction in VEGFR-3 that was
      concomitant with increases in VEGFR-2 expression and downstream signaling.
      Implanted tumor growth was profoundly reduced in CLEC14A-KO mice compared with
      that seen in WT littermates, but tumor-bearing CLEC14A-KO mice died sooner.
      Tumors in CLEC14A-KO mice had increased numbers of nonfunctional blood vessels
      and severe hemorrhaging. Blockade of VEGFR-2 signaling suppressed these vascular 
      abnormalities and enhanced the survival of tumor-bearing CLEC14A-KO mice. We
      conclude that CLEC14A acts in vascular homeostasis by fine-tuning VEGFR-2 and
      VEGFR-3 signaling in ECs, suggesting its relevance in the pathogenesis of
      angiogenesis-related human disorders.

      mechanosensory hair cells.
PG  - 472-486
LID - 85052 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI85052 [doi]
AB  - Aminoglycosides (AGs) are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are associated with
      kidney damage, balance disorders, and permanent hearing loss. This damage occurs 
      primarily by killing of proximal tubule kidney cells and mechanosensory hair
      cells, though the mechanisms underlying cell death are not clear. Imaging
      molecules of interest in living cells can elucidate how molecules enter cells,
      traverse intracellular compartments, and interact with sites of activity. Here,
      we have imaged fluorescently labeled AGs in live zebrafish mechanosensory hair
      cells. We determined that AGs enter hair cells via both nonendocytic and
      endocytic pathways. Both routes deliver AGs from the extracellular space to
      lysosomes, and structural differences between AGs alter the efficiency of this
      delivery. AGs with slower delivery to lysosomes were immediately toxic to hair
      cells, and impeding lysosome delivery increased AG-induced death. Therefore,
      pro-death cascades induced at early time points of AG exposure do not appear to
      derive from the lysosome. Our findings help clarify how AGs induce hair cell
      death and reveal properties that predict toxicity. Establishing signatures for AG
      toxicity may enable more efficient evaluation of AG treatment paradigms and
      structural modifications to reduce hair cell damage. Further, this work
      demonstrates how following fluorescently labeled drugs at high resolution in
      living cells can reveal important details about how drugs of interest behave.

TI  - Astrocytic calcium release mediates peri-infarct depolarizations in a rodent
      stroke model.
PG  - 511-516
LID - 89354 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89354 [doi]
AB  - Stroke is one of the most common diseases and a leading cause of death and
      disability. Cessation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) leads to cell death in the
      infarct core, but tissue surrounding the core has the potential to recover if
      local reductions in CBF are restored. In these areas, detrimental peri-infarct
      depolarizations (PIDs) contribute to secondary infarct growth and negatively
      affect stroke outcome. However, the cellular pathways underlying PIDs have
      remained unclear. Here, we have used in vivo multiphoton microscopy, laser
      speckle imaging of CBF, and electrophysiological recordings in a mouse model of
      focal ischemia to demonstrate that PIDs are associated with a strong increase of 
      intracellular calcium in astrocytes and neurons. We found that astroglial calcium
      elevations during PIDs are mediated by inositol triphosphate receptor type
      2-dependent (IP3R2-dependent) release from internal stores. Importantly,
      Ip3r2-deficient mice displayed a reduction of PID frequency and overall PID
      burden and showed increased neuronal survival after stroke. These effects were
      not related to local CBF changes in response to PIDs. However, we showed that the
      release and extracellular accumulation of glutamate during PIDs is strongly
      curtailed in Ip3r2-deficient mice, resulting in ameliorated calcium overload in
      neurons and astrocytes. Together, these data implicate astroglial calcium
      pathways as potential targets for stroke therapy.

AB  - The current frontline symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is
      whole-body upregulation of cholinergic transmission via inhibition of
      acetylcholinesterase. This approach leads to profound dose-related adverse
      effects. An alternative strategy is to selectively target muscarinic
      acetylcholine receptors, particularly the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
      (M1 mAChR), which was previously shown to have procognitive activity. However,
      developing M1 mAChR-selective orthosteric ligands has proven challenging. Here,
      we have shown that mouse prion disease shows many of the hallmarks of human AD,
      including progressive terminal neurodegeneration and memory deficits due to a
      disruption of hippocampal cholinergic innervation. The fact that we also show
      that muscarinic signaling is maintained in both AD and mouse prion disease points
      to the latter as an excellent model for testing the efficacy of muscarinic
      pharmacological entities. The memory deficits we observed in mouse prion disease 
      were completely restored by treatment with benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid
      (BQCA) and benzoquinazoline-12 (BQZ-12), two highly selective positive allosteric
      modulators (PAMs) of M1 mAChRs. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to BQCA markedly 
      extended the lifespan of diseased mice. Thus, enhancing hippocampal muscarinic
      signaling using M1 mAChR PAMs restored memory loss and slowed the progression of 
      mouse prion disease, indicating that this ligand type may have clinical benefit
      in diseases showing defective cholinergic transmission, such as AD.

AB  - An understanding of the events that initiate metabolic inflammation
      (metainflammation) can support the identification of targets for preventing
      metabolic disease and its negative effects on health. There is ample evidence
      demonstrating that the initiating events in obesity-induced inflammation start
      early in childhood. This has significant implications on our understanding of how
      early life events in childhood influence adult disease. In this Review we frame
      the initiating events of metainflammation in the context of child development and
      discuss what this reveals about the mechanisms by which this unique form of
      chronic inflammation is initiated and sustained into adulthood.

AB  - Chronic liver inflammation leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis, which is the 12th
      leading cause of death in the United States. Hepatocyte steatosis is a component 
      of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Hepatic steatosis may be benign or 
      progress to hepatocyte injury and the initiation of inflammation, which activates
      immune cells. While Kupffer cells are the resident macrophage in the liver,
      inflammatory cells such as infiltrating macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, 
      and DCs all contribute to liver inflammation. The inflammatory cells activate
      hepatic stellate cells, which are the major source of myofibroblasts in the
      liver. Here we review the initiation of inflammation in the liver, the liver
      inflammatory cells, and their crosstalk with myofibroblasts.

AB  - Obesity and diabetes are associated with increased chronic low-grade inflammation
      and elevated plasma glucose levels. Although inflammation in the fat and liver
      are established features of obesity-associated insulin resistance, the intestine 
      is emerging as a new site for immunologic changes that affect whole-body
      metabolism. Specifically, microbial and dietary factors incurred by diet-induced 
      obesity influence underlying innate and adaptive responses of the intestinal
      immune system. These responses affect the maintenance of the intestinal barrier, 
      systemic inflammation, and glucose metabolism. In this Review we propose that an 
      understanding of the changes to the intestinal immune system, and how these
      changes influence systemic immunity and glucose metabolism in a whole-body
      integrative and a neuronal-dependent network, will unveil novel intestinal
      pathologic and therapeutic targets for diabetes and obesity.

AB  - There are currently over 1.9 billion people who are obese or overweight, leading 
      to a rise in related health complications, including insulin resistance, type 2
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration.
      The finding that obesity and metabolic disorder are accompanied by chronic
      low-grade inflammation has fundamentally changed our view of the underlying
      causes and progression of obesity and metabolic syndrome. We now know that an
      inflammatory program is activated early in adipose expansion and during chronic
      obesity, permanently skewing the immune system to a proinflammatory phenotype,
      and we are beginning to delineate the reciprocal influence of obesity and
      inflammation. Reviews in this series examine the activation of the innate and
      adaptive immune system in obesity; inflammation within diabetic islets, brain,
      liver, gut, and muscle; the role of inflammation in fibrosis and angiogenesis;
      the factors that contribute to the initiation of inflammation; and therapeutic
      approaches to modulate inflammation in the context of obesity and metabolic
      syndrome.

AB  - Obesity-related sub-acute chronic inflammation has been associated with incident 
      type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Inflammation is
      increasingly considered to be a pathologic mediator of these commonly
      co-occurring diseases. A growing number of preclinical and clinical studies
      support the inflammatory hypothesis, but clinical trials to confirm the
      therapeutic potential to target inflammation to treat or prevent cardiometabolic 
      conditions are still ongoing. There are multiple inflammatory signaling pathways.
      Regulation is complex, with substantial crosstalk across these multiple pathways.
      The activity of select pathways may be differentially regulated in different
      tissues. Pharmacologic approaches to diabetes management may have direct or
      indirect antiinflammatory effects, the latter potentially attributable to an
      improved metabolic state. Conversely, some antiinflammatory approaches may affect
      glucose metabolism and cardiovascular health. To date, clinical trials suggest
      that targeting one portion of the inflammatory cascade may differentially affect 
      dysglycemia and atherothrombosis. Understanding the underlying biological
      processes may contribute to the development of safe and effective therapies,
      although a single approach may not be sufficient for optimal management of both
      metabolic and athrothrombotic disease states.

AB  - There are three dominant contributors to the pathogenesis of dysfunctional
      adipose tissue (AT) in obesity: unresolved inflammation, inappropriate
      extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and insufficient angiogenic potential. The 
      interactions of these processes during AT expansion reflect both a linear
      progression as well as feed-forward mechanisms. For example, both inflammation
      and inadequate angiogenic remodeling can drive fibrosis, which can in turn
      promote migration of immune cells into adipose depots and impede further
      angiogenesis. Therefore, the relationship between the members of this triad is
      complex but important for our understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity. Here 
      we untangle some of these intricacies to highlight the contributions of
      inflammation, angiogenesis, and the ECM to both "healthy" and "unhealthy" AT
      expansion.

AB  - The finding of islet inflammation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its involvement in
      beta cell dysfunction has further highlighted the significance of inflammation in
      metabolic diseases. The number of intra-islet macrophages is increased in T2D,
      and these cells are the main source of proinflammatory cytokines within islets.
      Multiple human studies of T2D have shown that targeting islet inflammation has
      the potential to be an effective therapeutic strategy. In this Review we provide 
      an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which islet inflammation 
      develops and causes beta cell dysfunction. We also emphasize the regulation and
      roles of macrophage polarity shift within islets in the context of T2D pathology 
      and beta cell health, which may have broad translational implications for
      therapeutics aimed at improving islet function.

PG  - 43-54

LID - 10.1172/JCI88880 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation, which contributes to insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Under normal conditions, skeletal muscle
      is responsible for the majority of insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose
      disposal; thus, dysregulation of skeletal muscle metabolism can strongly
      influence whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Increasing
      evidence suggests that inflammation occurs in skeletal muscle in obesity and is
      mainly manifested by increased immune cell infiltration and proinflammatory
      activation in intermyocellular and perimuscular adipose tissue. By secreting
      proinflammatory molecules, immune cells may induce myocyte inflammation,
      adversely regulate myocyte metabolism, and contribute to insulin resistance via
      paracrine effects. Increased influx of fatty acids and inflammatory molecules
      from other tissues, particularly visceral adipose tissue, can also induce muscle 
      inflammation and negatively regulate myocyte metabolism, leading to insulin
      resistance.

AB  - Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, possibly related to adipose cell
      hypertrophy, hypoxia, and/or intestinal leakage of bacteria and their metabolic
      products, likely plays a critical role in the development of obesity-associated
      insulin resistance (IR). Cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system
      residing in adipose tissues, as well as in the intestine, participate in this
      process. Thus, M1 macrophages, IFN-gamma-secreting Th1 cells, CD8+ T cells, and B
      cells promote IR, in part through secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.
      Conversely, eosinophils, Th2 T cells, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and possibly 
      Foxp3+ Tregs protect against IR through local control of inflammation.

LID - 10.1172/JCI88878 [doi]
AB  - Over the last years, hypothalamic inflammation has been linked to the development
      and progression of obesity and its sequelae. There is accumulating evidence that 
      this inflammation not only impairs energy balance but also contributes to
      obesity-associated insulin resistance. Elevated activation of key inflammatory
      mediators such as JNK and IkappaB kinase (IKK) occurs rapidly upon consumption of
      a high-fat diet, even prior to significant weight gain. This activation of
      hypothalamic inflammatory pathways results in the uncoupling of caloric intake
      and energy expenditure, fostering overeating and further weight gain. In
      addition, these inflammatory processes contribute to obesity-associated insulin
      resistance and deterioration of glucose metabolism via altered neurocircuit
      functions. An understanding of the contributions of different neuronal and
      non-neuronal cell types to hypothalamic inflammatory processes, and delineation
      of the differences and similarities between acute and chronic activation of these
      inflammatory pathways, will be critical for the development of novel therapeutic 
      strategies for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Transfusion of rbc is a routine, often lifesaving procedure that depends on a
      stored supply of blood. In the US, 42 days is the maximum duration allowed for
      rbc storage; however, several lines of evidence indicate that patients that
      receive blood at the upper end of this storage limit are at a higher risk of
      morbidity and mortality. In this issue of the JCI, Rapido and colleagues
      evaluated the effects of transfusing one unit of blood close to the storage limit
      into healthy adults. Compared to those that received rbc stored for five weeks or
      less, those that received blood stored for six weeks showed several effects
      associated with increased harm, including disruption in iron handling, increased 
      extravascular hemolysis, and the formation of circulating non-transferrin-bound
      iron. Together, the results of this study suggest that current maximum storage
      durations should be carefully reevaluated.

TI  - Impaired prohormone processing: a grand unified theory for features of
      Prader-Willi syndrome?
PG  - 98-99
LID - 91307 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI91307 [doi]
AB  - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex disorder that manifests with an array of
      phenotypes, such as hypotonia and difficulties in feeding during infancy and
      reduced energy expenditure, hyperphagia, and developmental delays later in life. 
      While the genetic cause has long been known, it is still not clear how mutations 
      at this locus produce this array of phenotypes. In this issue of the JCI, Burnett
      and colleagues used a comprehensive approach to gain insight into how
      PWS-associated mutations drive disease. Using neurons derived from PWS patient
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mouse models, the authors provide
      evidence that neuroendocrine PWS-associated phenotypes may be linked to reduced
      expression of prohormone convertase 1 (PC1). While these compelling results
      support a critical role for PC1 deficiency in PWS, more work needs to be done to 
      fully understand how and to what extent loss of this prohormone processing enzyme
      underlies disease manifestations in PWS patients.

      Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG  - 293-305
LID - 88648 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88648 [doi]
AB  - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by a loss of paternally expressed genes in 
      an imprinted region of chromosome 15q. Among the canonical PWS phenotypes are
      hyperphagic obesity, central hypogonadism, and low growth hormone (GH). Rare
      microdeletions in PWS patients define a 91-kb minimum critical deletion region
      encompassing 3 genes, including the noncoding RNA gene SNORD116. Here, we found
      that protein and transcript levels of nescient helix loop helix 2 (NHLH2) and the
      prohormone convertase PC1 (encoded by PCSK1) were reduced in PWS patient induced 
      pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) neurons. Moreover, Nhlh2 and Pcsk1
      expression were reduced in hypothalami of fasted Snord116 paternal knockout
      (Snord116p-/m+) mice. Hypothalamic Agrp and Npy remained elevated following
      refeeding in association with relative hyperphagia in Snord116p-/m+ mice.
      Nhlh2-deficient mice display growth deficiencies as adolescents and hypogonadism,
      hyperphagia, and obesity as adults. Nhlh2 has also been shown to promote Pcsk1
      expression. Humans and mice deficient in PC1 display hyperphagic obesity,
      hypogonadism, decreased GH, and hypoinsulinemic diabetes due to impaired
      prohormone processing. Here, we found that Snord116p-/m+ mice displayed in vivo
      functional defects in prohormone processing of proinsulin, pro-GH-releasing
      hormone, and proghrelin in association with reductions in islet, hypothalamic,
      and stomach PC1 content. Our findings suggest that the major neuroendocrine
      features of PWS are due to PC1 deficiency.

AB  - Loss of beta cell identity, the presence of polyhormonal cells, and reprogramming
      are emerging as important features of beta cell dysfunction in patients with type
      1 and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we have demonstrated that the transcription
      factor NKX2.2 is essential for the active maintenance of adult beta cell identity
      as well as function. Deletion of Nkx2.2 in beta cells caused rapid onset of a
      diabetic phenotype in mice that was attributed to loss of insulin and
      downregulation of many beta cell functional genes. Concomitantly,
      NKX2.2-deficient murine beta cells acquired non-beta cell endocrine features,
      resulting in populations of completely reprogrammed cells and bihormonal cells
      that displayed hybrid endocrine cell morphological characteristics. Molecular
      analysis in mouse and human islets revealed that NKX2.2 is a conserved master
      regulatory protein that controls the acquisition and maintenance of a functional,
      monohormonal beta cell identity by directly activating critical beta cell genes
      and actively repressing genes that specify the alternative islet endocrine cell
      lineages. This study demonstrates the highly volatile nature of the beta cell,
      indicating that acquiring and sustaining beta cell identity and function requires
      not only active maintaining of the expression of genes involved in beta cell
      function, but also continual repression of closely related endocrine gene
      programs.

AB  - Despite the efficient suppression of HIV-1 replication that can be achieved with 
      combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), low levels of type I interferon (IFN-I)
      signaling persist in some individuals. This sustained signaling may impede immune
      recovery and foster viral persistence. Here we report studies using a monoclonal 
      antibody to block IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) signaling in humanized mice
      (hu-mice) that were persistently infected with HIV-1. We discovered that
      effective cART restored the number of human immune cells in HIV-1-infected
      hu-mice but did not rescue their immune hyperactivation and dysfunction. IFNAR
      blockade fully reversed HIV-1-induced immune hyperactivation and rescued
      anti-HIV-1 immune responses in T cells from HIV-1-infected hu-mice. Finally, we
      found that IFNAR blockade in the presence of cART reduced the size of HIV-1
      reservoirs in lymphoid tissues and delayed HIV-1 rebound after cART cessation in 
      the HIV-1-infected hu-mice. We conclude that low levels of IFN-I signaling
      contribute to HIV-1-associated immune dysfunction and foster HIV-1 persistence in
      cART-treated hosts. Our results suggest that blocking IFNAR may provide a
      potential strategy to enhance immune recovery and reduce HIV-1 reservoirs in
      individuals with sustained elevations in IFN-I signaling during suppressive cART.

AB  - The recognition of beta cell dedifferentiation in type 2 diabetes raises the
      translational relevance of mechanisms that direct and maintain beta cell
      identity. LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) nucleates multimeric
      transcriptional complexes and establishes promoter-enhancer looping, thereby
      directing fate assignment and maturation of progenitor populations. Many
      terminally differentiated endocrine cell types, however, remain enriched for
      LDB1, but its role is unknown. Here, we have demonstrated a requirement for LDB1 
      in maintaining the terminally differentiated status of pancreatic beta cells.
      Inducible ablation of LDB1 in mature beta cells impaired insulin secretion and
      glucose homeostasis. Transcriptomic analysis of LDB1-depleted beta cells revealed
      the collapse of the terminally differentiated gene program, indicated by a loss
      of beta cell identity genes and induction of the endocrine progenitor factor
      neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3). Lineage tracing confirmed that LDB1-depleted,
      insulin-negative beta cells express NEUROG3 but do not adopt alternate endocrine 
      cell fates. In primary mouse islets, LDB1 and its LIM homeodomain-binding partner
      islet 1 (ISL1) were coenriched at chromatin sites occupied by pancreatic and
      duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1), forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), and
      NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2) - factors that co-occupy active enhancers in 3D chromatin
      domains in human islets. Indeed, LDB1 was enriched at active enhancers in human
      islets. Thus, LDB1 maintains the terminally differentiated state of beta cells
      and is a component of active enhancers in both murine and human islets.

PG  - 375-382

LID - 10.1172/JCI90837 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some countries have limited the maximum allowable storage duration
      for red cells to 5 weeks before transfusion. In the US, red blood cells can be
      stored for up to 6 weeks, but randomized trials have not assessed the effects of 
      this final week of storage on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Sixty healthy adult
      volunteers were randomized to a single standard, autologous, leukoreduced, packed
      red cell transfusion after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks of storage (n = 10 per
      group). 51-Chromium posttransfusion red cell recovery studies were performed and 
      laboratory parameters measured before and at defined times after transfusion.
      RESULTS: Extravascular hemolysis after transfusion progressively increased with
      increasing storage time (P < 0.001 for linear trend in the AUC of serum indirect 
      bilirubin and iron levels). Longer storage duration was associated with
      decreasing posttransfusion red cell recovery (P = 0.002), decreasing elevations
      in hematocrit (P = 0.02), and increasing serum ferritin (P < 0.0001). After 6
      weeks of refrigerated storage, transfusion was followed by increases in AUC for
      serum iron (P < 0.01), transferrin saturation (P < 0.001), and
      nontransferrin-bound iron (P < 0.001) as compared with transfusion after 1 to 5
      weeks of storage. CONCLUSIONS: After 6 weeks of refrigerated storage, transfusion
      of autologous red cells to healthy human volunteers increased extravascular
      hemolysis, saturated serum transferrin, and produced circulating
      nontransferrin-bound iron. These outcomes, associated with increased risks of
      harm, provide evidence that the maximal allowable red cell storage duration
      should be reduced to the minimum sustainable by the blood supply, with 35 days as
      an attainable goal.REGISTRATION. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02087514. FUNDING: NIH

LID - 10.1172/JCI91304 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic beta cells have one of the highest protein secretion burdens in the
      body, as these cells must synthesize and secrete insulin in proportion to
      postprandial rises in blood glucose. Remarkably, it is now becoming clear that
      adult beta cells retain plasticity and can dedifferentiate into embryonic fates
      or adopt alternate islet endocrine cell identities. This property is especially
      important, because changes in cell fate alter beta cell function and could form
      the basis for defects in insulin secretion that occur early in the pathogenesis
      of the most prevalent form of beta cell dysfunction, type 2 diabetes. In this
      issue, three different studies provide complementary perspectives on how the
      transcription factors NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2), paired box 6 (PAX6), and LIM
      domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) serve to maintain mature adult beta cell
      identity, revealing clues as to how adult beta cells can partially
      dedifferentiate or become reprogrammed into other islet endocrine cells.

TI  - Targeting type I interferon-mediated activation restores immune function in
      chronic HIV infection.
PG  - 260-268
LID - 89488 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89488 [doi]
AB  - Chronic immune activation, immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion are hallmarks
      of HIV infection, yet the mechanisms driving these processes are unclear. Chronic
      activation can be a driving force in immune exhaustion, and type I interferons
      (IFN-I) are emerging as critical components underlying ongoing activation in HIV 
      infection. Here, we have tested the effect of blocking IFN-I signaling on T cell 
      responses and virus replication in a murine model of chronic HIV infection. Using
      HIV-infected humanized mice, we demonstrated that in vivo blockade of IFN-I
      signaling during chronic HIV infection diminished HIV-driven immune activation,
      decreased T cell exhaustion marker expression, restored HIV-specific CD8 T cell
      function, and led to decreased viral replication. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
      combination with IFN-I blockade accelerated viral suppression, further decreased 
      viral loads, and reduced the persistently infected HIV reservoir compared with
      ART treatment alone. Our data suggest that blocking IFN-I signaling in
      conjunction with ART treatment can restore immune function and may reduce viral
      reservoirs during chronic HIV infection, providing validation for IFN-I blockade 
      as a potential therapy for HIV infection.

AB  - While antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the quality of life and increased
      the life span of many HIV-infected individuals, this therapeutic strategy has
      several limitations, including a lack of efficacy in fully restoring immune
      function and a requirement for life-long treatment. Two studies in this issue of 
      the JCI use a humanized mouse model and demonstrate that type I interferon (IFN) 
      is induced early during HIV infection and that type I IFN-associated gene
      signatures persist, even during ART. Importantly, blockade of type I IFN improved
      immune function, reduced the HIV reservoir, and caused a delay in viral rebound
      after ART interruption. Together, these two studies support further evaluation of
      IFN blockade as a supplement to ART.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is thought to involve a compromised beta cell differentiation
      state, but the mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain unclear. Here, we
      report a key role for the TF PAX6 in the maintenance of adult beta cell identity 
      and function. PAX6 was downregulated in beta cells of diabetic db/db mice and in 
      WT mice treated with an insulin receptor antagonist, revealing metabolic control 
      of expression. Deletion of Pax6 in beta cells of adult mice led to lethal
      hyperglycemia and ketosis that were attributed to loss of beta cell function and 
      expansion of alpha cells. Lineage-tracing, transcriptome, and chromatin analyses 
      showed that PAX6 is a direct activator of beta cell genes, thus maintaining
      mature beta cell function and identity. In parallel, we found that PAX6 binds
      promoters and enhancers to repress alternative islet cell genes including
      ghrelin, glucagon, and somatostatin. Chromatin analysis and shRNA-mediated gene
      suppression experiments indicated a similar function of PAX6 in human beta cells.
      We conclude that reduced expression of PAX6 in metabolically stressed beta cells 
      may contribute to beta cell failure and alpha cell dysfunction in diabetes.

TI  - Cardiac myofibroblast engulfment of dead cells facilitates recovery after
      myocardial infarction.
PG  - 383-401
LID - 83822 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI83822 [doi]
AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) results in the generation of dead cells in the
      infarcted area. These cells are swiftly removed by phagocytes to minimize
      inflammation and limit expansion of the damaged area. However, the types of cells
      and molecules responsible for the engulfment of dead cells in the infarcted area 
      remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that cardiac
      myofibroblasts, which execute tissue fibrosis by producing extracellular matrix
      proteins, efficiently engulf dead cells. Furthermore, we identified a population 
      of cardiac myofibroblasts that appears in the heart after MI in humans and mice. 
      We found that these cardiac myofibroblasts secrete milk fat globule-epidermal
      growth factor 8 (MFG-E8), which promotes apoptotic engulfment, and determined
      that serum response factor is important for MFG-E8 production in myofibroblasts. 
      Following MFG-E8-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells, myofibroblasts acquired 
      antiinflammatory properties. MFG-E8 deficiency in mice led to the accumulation of
      unengulfed dead cells after MI, resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses
      and a substantial decrease in survival. Moreover, MFG-E8 administration into
      infarcted hearts restored cardiac function and morphology. MFG-E8-producing
      myofibroblasts mainly originated from resident cardiac fibroblasts and cells that
      underwent endothelial-mesenchymal transition in the heart. Together, our results 
      reveal previously unrecognized roles of myofibroblasts in regulating apoptotic
      engulfment and a fundamental importance of these cells in recovery from MI.

PG  - 199-214
LID - 86418 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI86418 [doi]
AB  - Outer retinal and renal glomerular functions rely on specialized vasculature
      maintained by VEGF that is produced by neighboring epithelial cells, the retinal 
      pigment epithelium (RPE) and podocytes, respectively. Dysregulation of RPE- and
      podocyte-derived VEGF is associated with neovascularization in wet age-related
      macular degeneration (ARMD), choriocapillaris degeneration, and glomerular
      thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Since complement activation and genetic
      variants in inhibitory complement factor H (CFH) are also features of both ARMD
      and TMA, we hypothesized that VEGF and CFH interact. Here, we demonstrated that
      VEGF inhibition decreases local CFH and other complement regulators in the eye
      and kidney through reduced VEGFR2/PKC-alpha/CREB signaling. Patient podocytes and
      RPE cells carrying disease-associated CFH genetic variants had more alternative
      complement pathway deposits than controls. These deposits were increased by VEGF 
      antagonism, a common wet ARMD treatment, suggesting that VEGF inhibition could
      reduce cellular complement regulatory capacity. VEGF antagonism also increased
      markers of endothelial cell activation, which was partially reduced by genetic
      complement inhibition. Together, these results suggest that VEGF protects the
      retinal and glomerular microvasculature, not only through VEGFR2-mediated
      vasculotrophism, but also through modulation of local complement proteins that
      could protect against complement-mediated damage. Though further study is
      warranted, these findings could be relevant for patients receiving VEGF
      antagonists.

LID - 10.1172/JCI88555 [doi]
AB  - Treatment options are limited for severe asthma, and the need for additional
      therapies remains great. Previously, we demonstrated that integrin
      alphavbeta6-deficient mice are protected from airway hyperresponsiveness, due in 
      part to increased expression of the murine ortholog of human chymase. Here, we
      determined that chymase protects against cytokine-enhanced bronchoconstriction by
      cleaving fibronectin to impair tension transmission in airway smooth muscle
      (ASM). Additionally, we identified a pathway that can be therapeutically targeted
      to mitigate the effects of airway hyperresponsiveness. Administration of chymase 
      to human bronchial rings abrogated IL-13-enhanced contraction, and this effect
      was not due to alterations in calcium homeostasis or myosin light chain
      phosphorylation. Rather, chymase cleaved fibronectin, inhibited ASM adhesion, and
      attenuated focal adhesion phosphorylation. Disruption of integrin ligation with
      an RGD-containing peptide abrogated IL-13-enhanced contraction, with no further
      effect from chymase. We identified alpha5beta1 as the primary fibronectin-binding
      integrin in ASM, and alpha5beta1-specific blockade inhibited focal adhesion
      phosphorylation and IL-13-enhanced contraction, with no additional effect from
      chymase. Delivery of an alpha5beta1 inhibitor into murine airways abrogated the
      exaggerated bronchoconstriction induced by allergen sensitization and challenge. 
      Finally, alpha5beta1 blockade enhanced the effect of the bronchodilator
      isoproterenol on airway relaxation. Our data identify the alpha5beta1 integrin as
      a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the severity of airway contraction in 
      asthma.

      syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, and the TSC
      protein complex is an essential regulator of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Patients
      with TSC develop hypomelanotic macules (white spots), but the molecular
      mechanisms underlying their formation are not fully characterized. Using human
      primary melanocytes and a highly pigmented melanoma cell line, we demonstrate
      that reduced expression of either TSC1 or TSC2 causes reduced pigmentation
      through mTORC1 activation, which results in hyperactivation of glycogen synthase 
      kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), followed by phosphorylation of and loss of beta-catenin 
      from the nucleus, thereby reducing expression of microphthalmia-associated
      transcription factor (MITF), and subsequent reductions in tyrosinase and other
      genes required for melanogenesis. Genetic suppression or pharmacological
      inhibition of this signaling cascade at multiple levels restored pigmentation.
      Importantly, primary melanocytes isolated from hypomelanotic macules from 6
      patients with TSC all exhibited reduced TSC2 protein expression, and 1 culture
      showed biallelic mutation in TSC2, one of which was germline and the second
      acquired in the melanocytes of the hypomelanotic macule. These findings indicate 
      that the TSC/mTORC1/AKT/GSK3beta/beta-catenin/MITF axis plays a central role in
      regulating melanogenesis. Interventions that enhance or diminish mTORC1 activity 
      or other nodes in this pathway in melanocytes could potentially modulate pigment 
      production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease occurs at lower incidence in premenopausal
      females compared with age-matched males. This variation may be linked to sex
      differences in inflammation. We prospectively investigated whether inflammation
      and components of the inflammatory response are altered in females compared with 
      males. METHODS: We performed 2 clinical studies in healthy volunteers. In 12 men 
      and 12 women, we assessed systemic inflammatory markers and vascular function
      using brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). In a further 8 volunteers of 
      each sex, we assessed FMD response to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) at baseline and
      at 8 hours and 32 hours after typhoid vaccine. In a separate study in 16 men and 
      16 women, we measured inflammatory exudate mediators and cellular recruitment in 
      cantharidin-induced skin blisters at 24 and 72 hours. RESULTS: Typhoid vaccine
      induced mild systemic inflammation at 8 hours, reflected by increased white cell 
      count in both sexes. Although neutrophil numbers at baseline and 8 hours were
      greater in females, the neutrophils were less activated. Systemic inflammation
      caused a decrease in FMD in males, but an increase in females, at 8 hours. In
      contrast, GTN response was not altered in either sex after vaccine. At 24 hours, 
      cantharidin formed blisters of similar volume in both sexes; however, at 72
      hours, blisters had only resolved in females. Monocyte and leukocyte counts were 
      reduced, and the activation state of all major leukocytes was lower, in blisters 
      of females. This was associated with enhanced levels of the resolving lipids,
      particularly D-resolvin. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that female sex
      protects against systemic inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction. This
      effect is likely due to accelerated resolution of inflammation compared with
      males, specifically via neutrophils, mediated by an elevation of the D-resolvin
      pathway. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01582321 and NRES: City Road

TI  - The H3K9 dimethyltransferases EHMT1/2 protect against pathological cardiac
      hypertrophy.
PG  - 335-348
LID - 88353 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88353 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac hypertrophic growth in response to pathological cues is associated with
      reexpression of fetal genes and decreased cardiac function and is often a
      precursor to heart failure. In contrast, physiologically induced hypertrophy is
      adaptive, resulting in improved cardiac function. The processes that selectively 
      induce these hypertrophic states are poorly understood. Here, we have profiled 2 
      repressive epigenetic marks, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, which are involved in stable
      cellular differentiation, specifically in cardiomyocytes from physiologically and
      pathologically hypertrophied rat hearts, and correlated these marks with their
      associated transcriptomes. This analysis revealed the pervasive loss of
      euchromatic H3K9me2 as a conserved feature of pathological hypertrophy that was
      associated with reexpression of fetal genes. In hypertrophy, H3K9me2 was reduced 
      following a miR-217-mediated decrease in expression of the H3K9
      dimethyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2 (EHMT1/2). miR-217-mediated, genetic, or
      pharmacological inactivation of EHMT1/2 was sufficient to promote pathological
      hypertrophy and fetal gene reexpression, while suppression of this pathway
      protected against pathological hypertrophy both in vitro and in mice. Thus, we
      have established a conserved mechanism involving a departure of the cardiomyocyte
      epigenome from its adult cellular identity to a reprogrammed state that is
      accompanied by reexpression of fetal genes and pathological hypertrophy. These
      results suggest that targeting miR-217 and EHMT1/2 to prevent H3K9 methylation
      loss is a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart disease.

AB  - The AXL receptor and its activating ligand, growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), are 
      important drivers of metastasis and therapeutic resistance in human cancers.
      Given the critical roles that GAS6 and AXL play in refractory disease, this
      signaling axis represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
      However, the strong picomolar binding affinity between GAS6 and AXL and the
      promiscuity of small molecule inhibitors represent important challenges faced by 
      current anti-AXL therapeutics. Here, we have addressed these obstacles by
      engineering a second-generation, high-affinity AXL decoy receptor with an
      apparent affinity of 93 femtomolar to GAS6. Our decoy receptor, MYD1-72,
      profoundly inhibited disease progression in aggressive preclinical models of
      human cancers and induced cell killing in leukemia cells. When directly compared 
      with the most advanced anti-AXL small molecules in the clinic, MYD1-72 achieved
      superior antitumor efficacy while displaying no toxicity. Moreover, we uncovered 
      a relationship between AXL and the cellular response to DNA damage whereby
      abrogation of AXL signaling leads to accumulation of the DNA-damage markers
      gammaH2AX, 53BP1, and RAD51. MYD1-72 exploited this relationship, leading to
      improvements upon the therapeutic index of current standard-of-care
      chemotherapies in preclinical models of advanced pancreatic and ovarian cancer.

PG  - 306-320

LID - 10.1172/JCI86276 [doi]
AB  - Human NK cell deficiencies are rare yet result in severe and often fatal disease,
      particularly as a result of viral susceptibility. NK cells develop from
      hematopoietic stem cells, and few monogenic errors that specifically interrupt NK
      cell development have been reported. Here we have described biallelic mutations
      in IRF8, which encodes an interferon regulatory factor, as a cause of familial NK
      cell deficiency that results in fatal and severe viral disease. Compound
      heterozygous or homozygous mutations in IRF8 in 3 unrelated families resulted in 
      a paucity of mature CD56dim NK cells and an increase in the frequency of the
      immature CD56bright NK cells, and this impairment in terminal maturation was also
      observed in Irf8-/-, but not Irf8+/-, mice. We then determined that impaired
      maturation was NK cell intrinsic, and gene expression analysis of human NK cell
      developmental subsets showed that multiple genes were dysregulated by IRF8
      mutation. The phenotype was accompanied by deficient NK cell function and was
      stable over time. Together, these data indicate that human NK cells require IRF8 
      for development and functional maturation and that dysregulation of this function
      results in severe human disease, thereby emphasizing a critical role for NK cells
      in human antiviral defense.

AB  - Most patients who initially respond to treatment with the multi-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor sunitinib eventually relapse. Therefore, developing a deeper
      understanding of the contribution of sunitinib's numerous targets to the clinical
      response or to resistance is crucial. Here, we have shown that cancer cells
      respond to clinically relevant doses of sunitinib by enhancing the stability of
      the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 and inducing mTORC1 signaling, thus evoking
      little cytotoxicity. Inhibition of MCL-1 or mTORC1 signaling sensitized cells to 
      clinically relevant doses of sunitinib in vitro and was synergistic with
      sunitinib in impairing tumor growth in vivo, indicating that these responses are 
      triggered as prosurvival mechanisms that enable cells to tolerate the cytotoxic
      effects of sunitinib. Furthermore, higher doses of sunitinib were cytotoxic,
      triggered a decline in MCL-1 levels, and inhibited mTORC1 signaling.
      Mechanistically, we determined that sunitinib modulates MCL-1 stability by
      affecting its proteasomal degradation. Dual modulation of MCL-1 stability at
      different dose ranges of sunitinib was due to differential effects on ERK and
      GSK3beta activity, and the latter also accounted for dual modulation of mTORC1
      activity. Finally, comparison of patient samples prior to and following sunitinib
      treatment suggested that increases in MCL-1 levels and mTORC1 activity correlate 
      with resistance to sunitinib in patients.

TI  - TGF-beta1 modulates microglial phenotype and promotes recovery after
      intracerebral hemorrhage.
PG  - 280-292
LID - 88647 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88647 [doi]
AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke that results from 
      the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, leading to a mass of blood within the
      brain parenchyma. The injury causes a rapid inflammatory reaction that includes
      activation of the tissue-resident microglia and recruitment of blood-derived
      macrophages and other leukocytes. In this work, we investigated the specific
      responses of microglia following ICH with the aim of identifying pathways that
      may aid in recovery after brain injury. We used longitudinal transcriptional
      profiling of microglia in a murine model to determine the phenotype of microglia 
      during the acute and resolution phases of ICH in vivo and found increases in
      TGF-beta1 pathway activation during the resolution phase. We then confirmed that 
      TGF-beta1 treatment modulated inflammatory profiles of microglia in vitro.
      Moreover, TGF-beta1 treatment following ICH decreased microglial Il6 gene
      expression in vivo and improved functional outcomes in the murine model. Finally,
      we observed that patients with early increases in plasma TGF-beta1 concentrations
      had better outcomes 90 days after ICH, confirming the role of TGF-beta1 in
      functional recovery from ICH. Taken together, our data show that TGF-beta1
      modulates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation after ICH and promotes functional 
      recovery, suggesting that TGF-beta1 may be a therapeutic target for acute brain
      injury.

AB  - Tumor cells gain metastatic capacity through a Golgi phosphoprotein 3-dependent
      (GOLPH3-dependent) Golgi membrane dispersal process that drives the budding and
      transport of secretory vesicles. Whether Golgi dispersal underlies the
      pro-metastatic vesicular trafficking that is associated with
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear. Here, we have shown
      that, rather than causing Golgi dispersal, EMT led to the formation of compact
      Golgi organelles with improved ribbon linking and cisternal stacking. Ectopic
      expression of the EMT-activating transcription factor ZEB1 stimulated Golgi
      compaction and relieved microRNA-mediated repression of the Golgi scaffolding
      protein PAQR11. Depletion of PAQR11 dispersed Golgi organelles and impaired
      anterograde vesicle transport to the plasma membrane as well as retrograde
      vesicle tethering to the Golgi. The N-terminal scaffolding domain of PAQR11 was
      associated with key regulators of Golgi compaction and vesicle transport in
      pull-down assays and was required to reconstitute Golgi compaction in
      PAQR11-deficient tumor cells. Finally, high PAQR11 levels were correlated with
      EMT and shorter survival in human cancers, and PAQR11 was found to be essential
      for tumor cell migration and metastasis in EMT-driven lung adenocarcinoma models.
      We conclude that EMT initiates a PAQR11-mediated Golgi compaction process that
      drives metastasis.

      injury.
PG  - 321-334
LID - 87532 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87532 [doi]
AB  - Fibrotic disease is associated with matrix deposition that results in the loss of
      organ function. Pericytes, the precursors of myofibroblasts, are a source of
      pathological matrix collagens and may be promising targets for treating
      fibrogenesis. Here, we have shown that pericytes activate a TLR2/4- and
      MyD88-dependent proinflammatory program in response to tissue injury. Similarly
      to classic immune cells, pericytes activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to
      IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion. Released IL-1beta signals through pericyte MyD88 to
      amplify this response. Unexpectedly, we found that MyD88 and its downstream
      effector kinase IRAK4 intrinsically control pericyte migration and conversion to 
      myofibroblasts. Specific ablation of MyD88 in pericytes or pharmacological
      inhibition of MyD88 signaling by an IRAK4 inhibitor in vivo protected against
      kidney injury by profoundly attenuating tissue injury, activation, and
      differentiation of myofibroblasts. Our data show that in pericytes, MyD88 and
      IRAK4 are key regulators of 2 major injury responses: inflammatory and
      fibrogenic. Moreover, these findings suggest that disruption of this
      MyD88-dependent pathway in pericytes might be a potential therapeutic approach to
      inhibit fibrogenesis and promote regeneration.

AB  - Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition disorder caused by germline
      mutations in TP53 that can lead to increased mitochondrial metabolism in
      patients. However, the implications of altered mitochondrial function for
      tumorigenesis in LFS are unclear. Here, we have reported that genetic or
      pharmacologic disruption of mitochondrial respiration improves cancer-free
      survival in a mouse model of LFS that expresses mutant p53. Mechanistically,
      inhibition of mitochondrial function increased autophagy and decreased the
      aberrant proliferation signaling caused by mutant p53. In a pilot study, LFS
      patients treated with metformin exhibited decreases in mitochondrial activity
      concomitant with activation of antiproliferation signaling, thus reproducing the 
      effects of disrupting mitochondrial function observed in LFS mice. These
      observations indicate that a commonly prescribed diabetic medicine can restrain
      mitochondrial metabolism and tumorigenesis in an LFS model, supporting its
      further consideration for cancer prevention in LFS patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell
      carcinoma. Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the
      efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin
      (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity
      in barrier-defective skin. Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a 
      topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an
      immunotherapy for actinic keratosis. METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol
      action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse
      models. The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 
      5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of
      actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131
      participants. The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the
      qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4
      consecutive days. The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses 
      (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were
      assessed. RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a
      TSLP-dependent manner. Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus
      Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of
      actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001). Importantly, calcipotriol plus
      5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D
      (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked 
      CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without
      pain, crusting, or ulceration. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the
      synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a 
      CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers
      of the skin and other organs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.

AB  - Malignant tumors develop through multiple steps of initiation and progression,
      and tumor initiation is of singular importance in tumor prevention, diagnosis,
      and treatment. However, the molecular mechanism whereby a signaling network of
      interacting pathways restrains proliferation in normal cells and prevents tumor
      initiation is still poorly understood. Here, we have reported that the Hippo,
      Wnt/beta-catenin, and Notch pathways form an interacting network to maintain
      liver size and suppress hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ablation of the mammalian
      Hippo kinases Mst1 and Mst2 in liver led to rapid HCC formation and activated
      Yes-associated protein/WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 (YAP/TAZ), 
      STAT3, Wnt/beta-catenin, and Notch signaling. Previous work has shown that
      abnormal activation of these downstream pathways can lead to HCC. Rigorous
      genetic experiments revealed that Notch signaling forms a positive feedback loop 
      with the Hippo signaling effector YAP/TAZ to promote severe hepatomegaly and
      rapid HCC initiation and progression. Surprisingly, we found that
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation suppressed HCC formation by inhibiting the 
      positive feedback loop between YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling. Furthermore, we found
      that STAT3 in hepatocytes is dispensable for HCC formation when mammalian sterile
      20-like kinase 1 and 2 (Mst1 and Mst2) were removed. The molecular network we
      have identified provides insights into HCC molecular classifications and
      therapeutic developments for the treatment of liver tumors caused by distinct
      genetic mutations.

PG  - 4727-4734
LID - 91578 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI91578 [doi]
AB  - Leptin is an adipose tissue hormone that functions as an afferent signal in a
      negative feedback loop that maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass.
      This endocrine system thus serves a critical evolutionary function by protecting 
      individuals from the risks associated with being too thin (starvation) or too
      obese (predation and temperature dysregulation). Mutations in leptin or its
      receptor cause massive obesity in mice and humans, and leptin can effectively
      treat obesity in leptin-deficient patients. Leptin acts on neurons in the
      hypothalamus and elsewhere to elicit its effects, and mutations that affect the
      function of this neural circuit cause Mendelian forms of obesity. Leptin levels
      fall during starvation and elicit adaptive responses in many other physiologic
      systems, the net effect of which is to reduce energy expenditure. These effects
      include cessation of menstruation, insulin resistance, alterations of immune
      function, and neuroendocrine dysfunction, among others. Some or all of these
      effects are also seen in patients with constitutively low leptin levels, such as 
      occur in lipodystrophy. Leptin is an approved treatment for generalized
      lipodystrophy, a condition associated with severe metabolic disease, and has also
      shown potential for the treatment of other types of diabetes. In addition, leptin
      restores reproductive capacity and increases bone mineral density in patients
      with hypothalamic amenorrhea, an infertility syndrome in females. Most obese
      patients have high endogenous levels of leptin, in some instances as a result of 
      mutations in the neural circuit on which leptin acts, though in most cases, the
      pathogenesis of leptin resistance is not known. Obese patients with leptin
      resistance show a variable response to exogenous leptin but may respond to a
      combination of leptin plus amylin. Overall, the identification of leptin has
      provided a framework for studying the pathogenesis of obesity in the general
      population, clarified the nature of the biologic response to starvation, and
      helped to advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms that control
      feeding.

AB  - Cognitive impairment, an underappreciated consequence of hypertension, is linked 
      to cerebral arteriolar disease through poorly defined mechanisms. A study by
      Faraco et al. in this issue of the JCI points to perturbations of neurovascular
      unit coupling caused by perivascular macrophages (PVMs) as a cause of
      hypertension-related cognitive impairment. Angiotensin II (Ang II) was shown to
      activate PVMs, causing them to produce superoxide and thereby alter the proper
      functioning of the adjacent arterioles. Faraco and colleagues also show that
      disruption of the blood-brain barrier occurs in hypertension, allowing
      circulating Ang II to access PVMs. This study provides important new insight into
      the role of inflammatory cells in the genesis of vascular dementia.

PG  - 4640-4653

LID - 10.1172/JCI85856 [doi]
AB  - Multiple myeloma is incurable by standard approaches because of inevitable
      relapse and development of treatment resistance in all patients. In our prior
      work, we identified a panel of macropinocytosing human monoclonal antibodies
      against CD46, a negative regulator of the innate immune system, and constructed
      antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In this report, we show that an anti-CD46 ADC
      (CD46-ADC) potently inhibited proliferation in myeloma cell lines with little
      effect on normal cells. CD46-ADC also potently eliminated myeloma growth in
      orthometastatic xenograft models. In primary myeloma cells derived from bone
      marrow aspirates, CD46-ADC induced apoptosis and cell death, but did not affect
      the viability of nontumor mononuclear cells. It is of clinical interest that the 
      CD46 gene resides on chromosome 1q, which undergoes genomic amplification in the 
      majority of relapsed myeloma patients. We found that the cell surface expression 
      level of CD46 was markedly higher in patient myeloma cells with 1q gain than in
      those with normal 1q copy number. Thus, genomic amplification of CD46 may serve
      as a surrogate for target amplification that could allow patient stratification
      for tailored CD46-targeted therapy. Overall, these findings indicate that CD46 is
      a promising target for antibody-based treatment of multiple myeloma, especially
      in patients with gain of chromosome 1q.

      associated with hypertension.
PG  - 4674-4689
LID - 86950 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI86950 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is a leading risk factor for dementia, but the mechanisms underlying
      its damaging effects on the brain are poorly understood. Due to a lack of energy 
      reserves, the brain relies on continuous delivery of blood flow to its active
      regions in accordance with their dynamic metabolic needs. Hypertension disrupts
      these vital regulatory mechanisms, leading to the neuronal dysfunction and damage
      underlying cognitive impairment. Elucidating the cellular bases of these
      impairments is essential for developing new therapies. Perivascular macrophages
      (PVMs) represent a distinct population of resident brain macrophages that serves 
      key homeostatic roles but also has the potential to generate large amounts of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we report that PVMs are critical in driving 
      the alterations in neurovascular regulation and attendant cognitive impairment in
      mouse models of hypertension. This effect was mediated by an increase in
      blood-brain barrier permeability that allowed angiotensin II to enter the
      perivascular space and activate angiotensin type 1 receptors in PVMs, leading to 
      production of ROS through the superoxide-producing enzyme NOX2. These findings
      unveil a pathogenic role of PVMs in the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction
      associated with hypertension and identify these cells as a putative therapeutic
      target for diseases associated with cerebrovascular oxidative stress.

AB  - CD8+ T cells play a central role in eradicating intracellular pathogens, but also
      are important for noninfectious diseases, including cancer and autoimmunity. The 
      ability to clinically manipulate CD8+ T cells to target cancer and autoimmune
      disease is limited by our ignorance of relevant self-peptide target antigens. In 
      this issue of the JCI, Pearson et al. describe 25,270 MHC class I-associated
      peptides presented by a wide range of HLA A and B allomorphs expressed by 18
      different B cell lines. Via extensive bioinformatic analysis, the authors make
      surprising conclusions regarding the selective nature of peptide generation at
      the level of individual gene products and create a predictive algorithm for
      disease-relevant self-peptides that will be of immediate use for clinical and
      basic immunological research.

PG  - 4402-4403

LID - 10.1172/JCI91303 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent mediator of blood vessel dilation and is released
      by several cell sources. Red blood cells (rbc) release NO when hemoglobin that
      has been S-nitrosylated at Cys93 of the beta-chain (betaCys93) transitions from
      the oxygenated form to the deoxygenated form. This transition occurs in response 
      to reduced tissue oxygenation and is an important physiologic regulator of
      hypoxic vasodilation. In this issue of the JCI, Zhang and colleagues demonstrate 
      that S-nitrosylation of hemoglobin at betaCys93 is important for tissue
      oxygenation after cardiac injury. Mice harboring mutations that prevent
      S-nitrosylation of betaCys93 had higher rates of morbidity and mortality
      following cardiac injury compared with WT; however, adaptive cardiac
      vascularization was increased in some mutant mice and reduced cardiac injury in
      these animals. The results of this study reveal a previously unexplored role of
      S-nitrosylated hemoglobin in cardioprotection.

AB  - Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy that is associated with an
      increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Currently,
      delivery is the only cure for preeclampsia; therefore, effective prevention and
      treatment options for this condition are sorely needed. In the current issue of
      the JCI, Mirzakhani et al. report the findings of the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma 
      Reduction Trial (VDAART), a well-conducted large, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of
      preeclampsia. Though vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the risk of
      preeclampsia, reduced maternal serum vitamin D levels did correlate with
      preeclampsia risk. Mirzakhani and colleagues identified a number of gene pathways
      that are differentially regulated among women with low serum vitamin D levels who
      develop preeclampsia. These results indicate that further research on the role of
      vitamin D in preeclampsia is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low vitamin D status in pregnancy was proposed as a risk factor of
      preeclampsia. METHODS: We assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation (4,400
      vs. 400 IU/day), initiated early in pregnancy (10-18 weeks), on the development
      of preeclampsia. The effects of serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD])
      levels on preeclampsia incidence at trial entry and in the third trimester (32-38
      weeks) were studied. We also conducted a nested case-control study of 157 women
      to investigate peripheral blood vitamin D-associated gene expression profiles at 
      10 to 18 weeks in 47 participants who developed preeclampsia. RESULTS: Of 881
      women randomized, outcome data were available for 816, with 67 (8.2%) developing 
      preeclampsia. There was no significant difference between treatment (N = 408) or 
      control (N = 408) groups in the incidence of preeclampsia (8.08% vs. 8.33%,
      respectively; relative risk: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.61-1.53). However, in a cohort
      analysis and after adjustment for confounders, a significant effect of sufficient
      vitamin D status (25OHD >/=30 ng/ml) was observed in both early and late
      pregnancy compared with insufficient levels (25OHD <30 ng/ml) (adjusted odds
      ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.96). Differential expression of 348 vitamin
      D-associated genes (158 upregulated) was found in peripheral blood of women who
      developed preeclampsia (FDR <0.05 in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction
      Trial [VDAART]; P < 0.05 in a replication cohort). Functional enrichment and
      network analyses of this vitamin D-associated gene set suggests several highly
      functional modules related to systematic inflammatory and immune responses,
      including some nodes with a high degree of connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D
      supplementation initiated in weeks 10-18 of pregnancy did not reduce preeclampsia
      incidence in the intention-to-treat paradigm. However, vitamin D levels of 30
      ng/ml or higher at trial entry and in late pregnancy were associated with a lower
      risk of preeclampsia. Differentially expressed vitamin D-associated
      transcriptomes implicated the emergence of an early pregnancy, distinctive immune
      response in women who went on to develop preeclampsia. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) encompasses a diverse group of Mendelian disorders
      leading to progressive degeneration of rods and then cones. For reasons that
      remain unclear, diseased RP photoreceptors begin to deteriorate, eventually
      leading to cell death and, consequently, loss of vision. Here, we have
      hypothesized that RP associated with mutations in phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6)
      provokes a metabolic aberration in rod cells that promotes the pathological
      consequences of elevated cGMP and Ca2+, which are induced by the Pde6 mutation.
      Inhibition of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a histone deacetylase repressor of glycolytic
      flux, reprogrammed rods into perpetual glycolysis, thereby driving the
      accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates, improving outer segment (OS) length, 
      enhancing photoreceptor survival, and preserving vision. In mouse retinae lacking
      Sirt6, effectors of glycolytic flux were dramatically increased, leading to
      upregulation of key intermediates in glycolysis, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis.
      Both transgenic and AAV2/8 gene therapy-mediated ablation of Sirt6 in rods
      provided electrophysiological and anatomic rescue of both rod and cone
      photoreceptors in a preclinical model of RP. Due to the extensive network of
      downstream effectors of Sirt6, this study motivates further research into the
      role that these pathways play in retinal degeneration. Because reprogramming
      metabolism by enhancing glycolysis is not gene specific, this strategy may be
      applicable to a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - MHC class I-associated peptides (MAPs) define the immune self for CD8+ T
      lymphocytes and are key targets of cancer immunosurveillance. Here, the goals of 
      our work were to determine whether the entire set of protein-coding genes could
      generate MAPs and whether specific features influence the ability of discrete
      genes to generate MAPs. Using proteogenomics, we have identified 25,270 MAPs
      isolated from the B lymphocytes of 18 individuals who collectively expressed 27
      high-frequency HLA-A,B allotypes. The entire MAP repertoire presented by these 27
      allotypes covered only 10% of the exomic sequences expressed in B lymphocytes.
      Indeed, 41% of expressed protein-coding genes generated no MAPs, while 59% of
      genes generated up to 64 MAPs, often derived from adjacent regions and presented 
      by different allotypes. We next identified several features of transcripts and
      proteins associated with efficient MAP production. From these data, we built a
      logistic regression model that predicts with good accuracy whether a gene
      generates MAPs. Our results show preferential selection of MAPs from a limited
      repertoire of proteins with distinctive features. The notion that the MHC class I
      immunopeptidome presents only a small fraction of the protein-coding genome for
      monitoring by the immune system has profound implications in autoimmunity and
      cancer immunology.

TI  - Hemoglobin S-nitrosylation plays an essential role in cardioprotection.
PG  - 4654-4658
LID - 90425 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI90425 [doi]
AB  - Homeostatic control of tissue oxygenation is achieved largely through changes in 
      blood flow that are regulated by the classic physiological response of hypoxic
      vasodilation. The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the control of blood flow is a
      central tenet of cardiovascular biology. However, extensive evidence now
      indicates that hypoxic vasodilation entails S-nitrosothiol-based (SNO-based)
      vasoactivity (rather than NO per se) and that this activity is conveyed
      substantially by the betaCys93 residue in hemoglobin. Thus, tissue oxygenation in
      the respiratory cycle is dependent on S-nitrosohemoglobin. This perspective
      predicts that red blood cells (RBCs) may play an important but previously
      undescribed role in cardioprotection. Here, we have found that cardiac injury and
      mortality in models of myocardial infarction and heart failure were greatly
      enhanced in mice lacking betaCys93 S-nitrosylation. In addition, betaCys93 mutant
      mice exhibited adaptive collateralization of cardiac vasculature that mitigated
      ischemic injury and predicted outcomes after myocardial infarction. Enhanced
      myopathic injury and mortality across different etiologies in the absence of
      betaCys93 confirm the central cardiovascular role of RBC-derived SNO-based
      vasoactivity and point to a potential locus of therapeutic intervention. Our
      findings also suggest the possibility that RBCs may play a previously
      unappreciated role in heart disease.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) reside in the bone marrow. Stress
      signals from cancer and other conditions promote HSPC mobilization into
      circulation and subsequent homing to tissue microenvironments. HSPC infiltration 
      into tissue microenvironments can influence disease progression; notably, in
      cancer, HSPCs encourage tumor growth. Here we have uncovered a mutually exclusive
      distribution of EPHB4 receptors in bone marrow sinusoids and ephrin B2 ligands in
      hematopoietic cells. We determined that signaling interactions between EPHB4 and 
      ephrin B2 control HSPC mobilization from the bone marrow. In mice, blockade of
      the EPHB4/ephrin B2 signaling pathway reduced mobilization of HSPCs and other
      myeloid cells to the circulation. EPHB4/ephrin B2 blockade also reduced HSPC
      infiltration into tumors as well as tumor progression in murine models of
      melanoma and mammary cancer. These results identify EPHB4/ephrin B2 signaling as 
      critical to HSPC mobilization from bone marrow and provide a potential strategy
      for reducing cancer progression by targeting the bone marrow.

      for skin homeostasis. However, the mechanisms that regulate epidermal barrier
      function are incompletely understood. Here we have found that
      keratinocyte-specific deletion of the gene encoding RAB guanine nucleotide
      exchange factor 1 (RABGEF1, also known as RABEX-5) severely impairs epidermal
      barrier function in mice and induces an allergic cutaneous and systemic
      phenotype. RABGEF1-deficient keratinocytes exhibited aberrant activation of the
      intrinsic IL-1R/MYD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and MYD88-dependent
      abnormalities in expression of structural proteins that contribute to skin
      barrier function. Moreover, ablation of MYD88 signaling in RABGEF1-deficient
      keratinocytes or deletion of Il1r1 restored skin homeostasis and prevented
      development of skin inflammation. We further demonstrated that epidermal RABGEF1 
      expression is reduced in skin lesions of humans diagnosed with either atopic
      dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis as well as in an inducible mouse model 
      of allergic dermatitis. Our findings reveal a key role for RABGEF1 in dampening
      keratinocyte-intrinsic MYD88 signaling and sustaining epidermal barrier function 
      in mice, and suggest that dysregulation of RABGEF1 expression may contribute to
      epidermal barrier dysfunction in allergic skin disorders in mice and humans.
      Thus, RABGEF1-mediated regulation of IL-1R/MYD88 signaling might represent a
      potential therapeutic target.

AB  - Mutations and deletions in components of ubiquitin ligase complexes that lead to 
      alterations in protein turnover are important mechanisms in driving
      tumorigenesis. Here we describe an alternative mechanism involving upregulation
      of the microRNA miR-424 that leads to impaired ubiquitination and degradation of 
      oncogenic transcription factors in prostate cancers. We found that miR-424
      targets the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 and identified STAT3 as a key substrate of
      COP1 in promoting tumorigenic and cancer stem-like properties in prostate
      epithelial cells. Altered protein turnover due to impaired COP1 function led to
      accumulation and enhanced basal and cytokine-induced activity of STAT3. We
      further determined that loss of the ETS factor ESE3/EHF is the initial event that
      triggers the deregulation of the miR-424/COP1/STAT3 axis. COP1 silencing and
      STAT3 activation were effectively reverted by blocking of miR-424, suggesting a
      possible strategy to attack this key node of tumorigenesis in ESE3/EHF-deficient 
      tumors. These results establish miR-424 as an oncogenic effector linked to
      noncanonical activation of STAT3 and as a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - The transcription factor NR4A3 (also known as NOR-1) is a member of the Nr4a
      family of nuclear receptors and is expressed in myeloid and lymphoid cells. Here,
      we have shown that Nr4a3 is essential for the migration of CD103+ dendritic cells
      (DCs) to lymph nodes (LNs). Nr4a3-deficient mice had very few CD103+ migratory
      DCs (mDCs) present in LNs, and mixed-chimera studies revealed that this migratory
      defect was cell intrinsic. We further found that CD103+ DCs from Nr4a3-deficient 
      mice displayed a marked loss of surface expression of the chemokine CCR7. This
      defect in CCR7 expression was confined to CD103+ DCs, as CCR7 expression on T
      lymphocytes was unaffected. Moreover, CCR7 was not induced on CD103+ DCs from
      Nr4a3-deficient mice in response to either administration of the TLR7 agonist
      R848 or infection with Citrobacter rodentium in vivo. The transcription factor
      FOXO1 has been shown to regulate CCR7 expression. We found that FOXO1 protein was
      reduced in Nr4a3-deficient DCs through an AKT-dependent mechanism. Further, we
      found a requirement for NR4A3 in the maintenance of homeostatic mitochondrial
      function in CD103+ DCs, although this is likely independent of the
      NR4A3/FOXO1/CCR7 axis in the regulation of DC migration. Thus, NR4A3 plays an
      important role in the regulation of CD103+ mDCs by regulating CCR7-dependent cell
      migration.

AB  - Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that form ribonucleoproteins
      to guide covalent modifications of ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs in the
      nucleus. Recent studies have also uncovered additional non-canonical roles for
      snoRNAs. However, the physiological contributions of these small RNAs are largely
      unknown. Here, we selectively deleted four snoRNAs encoded within the introns of 
      the ribosomal protein L13a (Rpl13a) locus in a mouse model. Loss of Rpl13a
      snoRNAs altered mitochondrial metabolism and lowered reactive oxygen species
      tone, leading to increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic
      islets and enhanced systemic glucose tolerance. Islets from mice lacking Rpl13a
      snoRNAs demonstrated blunted oxidative stress responses. Furthermore, these mice 
      were protected against diabetogenic stimuli that cause oxidative stress damage to
      islets. Our study illuminates a previously unrecognized role for snoRNAs in
      metabolic regulation.

TI  - Obesity accelerates T cell senescence in murine visceral adipose tissue.
PG  - 4626-4639
LID - 88606 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88606 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) precipitates the
      development of cardiometabolic disorders. Although changes in T cell function
      associated with visceral obesity are thought to affect chronic VAT inflammation, 
      the specific features of these changes remain elusive. Here, we have determined
      that a high-fat diet (HFD) caused a preferential increase and accumulation of
      CD44hiCD62LloCD4+ T cells that constitutively express PD-1 and CD153 in a B
      cell-dependent manner in VAT. These cells possessed characteristics of cellular
      senescence and showed a strong activation of Spp1 (encoding osteopontin [OPN]) in
      VAT. Upon T cell receptor stimulation, these T cells also produced large amounts 
      of OPN in a PD-1-resistant manner in vitro. The features of CD153+PD-1+CD44hiCD4+
      T cells were highly reminiscent of senescence-associated CD4+ T cells that
      normally increase with age. Adoptive transfer of CD153+PD-1+CD44hiCD4+ T cells
      from HFD-fed WT, but not Spp1-deficient, mice into the VAT of lean mice fed a
      normal diet recapitulated the essential features of VAT inflammation and insulin 
      resistance. Our results demonstrate that a distinct CD153+PD-1+CD44hiCD4+ T cell 
      population that accumulates in the VAT of HFD-fed obese mice causes VAT
      inflammation by producing large amounts of OPN. This finding suggests a link
      between visceral adiposity and immune aging.

AB  - Cellular identity in metazoan organisms is frequently established through
      lineage-specifying transcription factors, which control their own expression
      through transcriptional positive feedback, while antagonizing the developmental
      networks of competing lineages. Here, we have uncovered a distinct positive
      feedback loop that arises from the reciprocal stabilization of the tyrosine
      kinase ABL and the transcriptional coactivator TAZ. Moreover, we determined that 
      this loop is required for osteoblast differentiation and embryonic skeletal
      formation. ABL potentiated the assembly and activation of the RUNX2-TAZ master
      transcription factor complex that is required for osteoblastogenesis, while
      antagonizing PPARgamma-mediated adipogenesis. ABL also enhanced TAZ nuclear
      localization and the formation of the TAZ-TEAD complex that is required for
      osteoblast expansion. Last, we have provided genetic data showing that regulation
      of the ABL-TAZ amplification loop lies downstream of the adaptor protein 3BP2,
      which is mutated in the craniofacial dysmorphia syndrome cherubism. Our study
      demonstrates an interplay between ABL and TAZ that controls the mesenchymal
      maturation program toward the osteoblast lineage and is mechanistically distinct 
      from the established model of lineage-specific maturation.

AB  - Current chemotherapies for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
      efficiently reduce tumor mass. Nonetheless, disease relapse attributed to
      survival of preleukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) is associated with poor prognosis. 
      Herein, we provide direct evidence that pre-LSCs are much less chemosensitive to 
      existing chemotherapy drugs than leukemic blasts because of a distinctive lower
      proliferative state. Improving therapies for T-ALL requires the development of
      strategies to target pre-LSCs that are absolutely dependent on their
      microenvironment. Therefore, we designed a robust protocol for high-throughput
      screening of compounds that target primary pre-LSCs maintained in a niche-like
      environment, on stromal cells that were engineered for optimal NOTCH1 activation.
      The multiparametric readout takes into account the intrinsic complexity of
      primary cells in order to specifically monitor pre-LSCs, which were induced here 
      by the SCL/TAL1 and LMO1 oncogenes. We screened a targeted library of compounds
      and determined that the estrogen derivative 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME2) disrupted 
      both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous pathways. Specifically, 2-ME2
      abrogated pre-LSC viability and self-renewal activity in vivo by inhibiting
      translation of MYC, a downstream effector of NOTCH1, and preventing SCL/TAL1
      activity. In contrast, normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells remained
      functional. These results illustrate how recapitulating tissue-like properties of
      primary cells in high-throughput screening is a promising avenue for innovation
      in cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - Neuronal oscillations at beta frequencies (20-50 Hz) in the cortico-basal ganglia
      circuits have long been the leading theory for bradykinesia, the slow movements
      that are cardinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The beta oscillation
      theory helped to drive a frequency-based design in the development of deep brain 
      stimulation therapy for PD. However, in contrast to this theory, here we have
      found that bradykinesia can be completely dissociated from beta oscillations in
      rodent models. Instead, we observed that bradykinesia is causatively regulated by
      the burst-firing pattern of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in a feed-forward, or
      efferent-only, mechanism. Furthermore, STN burst-firing and beta oscillations are
      two independent mechanisms that are regulated by different NMDA receptors in STN.
      Our results shift the understanding of bradykinesia pathophysiology from an
      interactive oscillatory theory toward a feed-forward mechanism that is coded by
      firing patterns. This distinct mechanism may improve understanding of the
      fundamental concepts of motor control and enable more selective targeting of
      bradykinesia-specific mechanisms to improve PD therapy.

PG  - 4537-4553

LID - 10.1172/JCI87105 [doi]
AB  - Certain secretory proteins are known to be critical for maintaining the stemness 
      of stem cells through autocrine signaling. However, the processes underlying the 
      biogenesis, maturation, and secretion of these proteins remain largely unknown.
      Here we demonstrate that many secretory proteins produced by hematopoietic stem
      cells (HSCs) undergo exosomal maturation and release that is controlled by
      vacuolar protein sorting protein 33b (VPS33B). Deletion of VPS33B in either mouse
      or human HSCs resulted in impaired exosome maturation and secretion as well as
      loss of stemness. Additionally, VPS33B deficiency led to a dramatic delay in
      leukemogenesis. Exosomes purified from either conditioned medium or human plasma 
      could partially rescue the defects of HSCs and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). 
      VPS33B co-existed in exosomes with GDI2, VPS16B, FLOT1, and other known exosome
      markers. Mechanistically, VPS33B interacted with the GDI2/RAB11A/RAB27A pathway
      to regulate the trafficking of secretory proteins as exosomes. These findings
      reveal an essential role for VPS33B in exosome pathways in HSCs and LICs.
      Moreover, they shed light on the understanding of vesicle trafficking in other
      stem cells and on the development of improved strategies for cancer treatment.

AB  - Arterial blood pressure is controlled by vasodilatory factors such as nitric
      oxide (NO) that are released from the endothelium under the influence of fluid
      shear stress exerted by flowing blood. Flow-induced endothelial release of ATP
      and subsequent activation of Gq/G11-coupled purinergic P2Y2 receptors have been
      shown to mediate fluid shear stress-induced stimulation of NO formation. However,
      the mechanism by which fluid shear stress initiates these processes is unclear.
      Here, we have shown that the endothelial mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1
      is required for flow-induced ATP release and subsequent P2Y2/Gq/G11-mediated
      activation of downstream signaling that results in phosphorylation and activation
      of AKT and endothelial NOS. We also demonstrated that PIEZO1-dependent ATP
      release is mediated in part by pannexin channels. The PIEZO1 activator Yoda1
      mimicked the effect of fluid shear stress on endothelial cells and induced
      vasorelaxation in a PIEZO1-dependent manner. Furthermore, mice with induced
      endothelium-specific PIEZO1 deficiency lost the ability to induce NO formation
      and vasodilation in response to flow and consequently developed hypertension.
      Together, our data demonstrate that PIEZO1 is required for the regulation of NO
      formation, vascular tone, and blood pressure.

AB  - Rapid impulse propagation in the heart is a defining property of pectinated
      atrial myocardium (PAM) and the ventricular conduction system (VCS) and is
      essential for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and optimal cardiac output.
      Conduction defects in these tissues produce a disproportionate burden of
      arrhythmic disease and are major predictors of mortality in heart failure
      patients. Despite the clinical importance, little is known about the gene
      regulatory network that dictates the fast conduction phenotype. Here, we have
      used signal transduction and transcriptional profiling screens to identify a
      genetic pathway that converges on the NRG1-responsive transcription factor ETV1
      as a critical regulator of fast conduction physiology for PAM and VCS
      cardiomyocytes. Etv1 was highly expressed in murine PAM and VCS cardiomyocytes,
      where it regulates expression of Nkx2-5, Gja5, and Scn5a, key cardiac genes
      required for rapid conduction. Mice deficient in Etv1 exhibited marked cardiac
      conduction defects coupled with developmental abnormalities of the VCS. Loss of
      Etv1 resulted in a complete disruption of the normal sodium current heterogeneity
      that exists between atrial, VCS, and ventricular myocytes. Lastly, a phenome-wide
      association study identified a link between ETV1 and bundle branch block and
      heart block in humans. Together, these results identify ETV1 as a critical factor
      in determining fast conduction physiology in the heart.

TI  - Antibiotic effects on gut microbiota and metabolism are host dependent.
PG  - 4430-4443

LID - 10.1172/JCI86674 [doi]
AB  - Interactions of diet, gut microbiota, and host genetics play important roles in
      the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we have investigated the
      molecular links between gut microbiota, insulin resistance, and glucose
      metabolism in 3 inbred mouse strains with differing susceptibilities to metabolic
      syndrome using diet and antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment altered
      intestinal microbiota, decreased tissue inflammation, improved insulin signaling 
      in basal and stimulated states, and improved glucose metabolism in obesity- and
      diabetes-prone C57BL/6J mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). Many of these changes were
      reproduced by the transfer of gut microbiota from antibiotic-treated donors to
      germ-free or germ-depleted mice. These physiological changes closely correlated
      with changes in serum bile acids and levels of the antiinflammatory bile acid
      receptor Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and were partially
      recapitulated by treatment with a TGR5 agonist. In contrast, antibiotic treatment
      of HFD-fed, obesity-resistant 129S1 and obesity-prone 129S6 mice did not improve 
      metabolism, despite changes in microbiota and bile acids. These mice also failed 
      to show a reduction in inflammatory gene expression in response to the TGR5
      agonist. Thus, changes in bile acid and inflammatory signaling, insulin
      resistance, and glucose metabolism driven by an HFD can be modified by
      antibiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota; however, these effects depend on
      important interactions with the host's genetic background and inflammatory
      potential.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells can have potent antileukemic activity following
      haplo-mismatched, T cell-depleted stem cell transplantations for the treatment of
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but they are not successful in eradicating de novo 
      AML. Here, we have used a mouse model of de novo AML to elucidate the mechanisms 
      by which AML evades NK cell surveillance. NK cells in leukemic mice displayed a
      marked reduction in the cytolytic granules perforin and granzyme B. Further, as
      AML progressed, we noted the selective loss of an immature subset of NK cells in 
      leukemic mice and in AML patients. This absence was not due to elimination by
      cell death or selective reduction in proliferation, but rather to the result of a
      block in NK cell differentiation. Indeed, NK cells from leukemic mice and humans 
      with AML showed lower levels of TBET and EOMES, transcription factors that are
      critical for terminal NK cell differentiation. Further, the microRNA miR-29b, a
      regulator of T-bet and EOMES, was elevated in leukemic NK cells. Finally,
      deletion of miR-29b in NK cells reversed the depletion of this NK cell subset in 
      leukemic mice. These results indicate that leukemic evasion of NK cell
      surveillance occurs through miR-mediated dysregulation of lymphocyte development,
      representing an additional mechanism of immune escape in cancer.

AB  - Interactions between multiple myeloma (MM) cells and the BM microenvironment play
      a critical role in bortezomib (BTZ) resistance. However, the mechanisms involved 
      in these interactions are not completely understood. We previously showed that
      expression of CYP26 in BM stromal cells maintains a retinoic acid-low (RA-low)
      microenvironment that prevents the differentiation of normal and malignant
      hematopoietic cells. Since a low secretory B cell phenotype is associated with
      BTZ resistance in MM and retinoid signaling promotes plasma cell differentiation 
      and Ig production, we investigated whether stromal expression of the cytochrome
      P450 monooxygenase CYP26 modulates BTZ sensitivity in the BM niche.
      CYP26-mediated inactivation of RA within the BM microenvironment prevented plasma
      cell differentiation and promoted a B cell-like, BTZ-resistant phenotype in human
      MM cells that were cocultured on BM stroma. Moreover, paracrine Hedgehog
      secretion by MM cells upregulated stromal CYP26 and further reinforced a
      protective microenvironment. These results suggest that crosstalk between
      Hedgehog and retinoid signaling modulates BTZ sensitivity in the BM niche.
      Targeting these pathological interactions holds promise for eliminating minimal
      residual disease in MM.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect over 5 million individuals in the
      industrialized world, with an increasing incidence rate worldwide. IBD also
      predisposes affected individuals to development of colorectal cancer, which is a 
      leading cause of cancer-related deaths in adults. Mutations in genes encoding
      molecules in the IL-33 signaling pathway are associated with colitis and
      colitis-associated cancer (CAC), but how IL-33 modulates gut homeostasis is
      unclear. Here, we have shown that Il33-deficient mice are highly susceptible to
      colitis and CAC. Mechanistically, we observed that IL-33 promoted IgA production 
      from B cells, which is important for maintaining microbial homeostasis in the
      intestine. Il33-deficient mice developed a dysbiotic microbiota that was
      characterized by increased levels of mucolytic and colitogenic bacteria. In
      response to chemically induced colitis, this microbial landscape promoted the
      release of IL-1alpha, which acted as a critical driver of colitis and CAC.
      Consequently, reconstitution of symbiotic microbiota or IL-1alpha ablation
      markedly ameliorated colitis susceptibility in Il33-deficient animals. Our
      results demonstrate that IL-33 promotes IgA production to maintain gut microbial 
      homoeostasis and restrain IL-1alpha-dependent colitis and CAC. This study
      therefore highlights modulation of IL-33, IgA, IL-1alpha, and the microbiota as a
      potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD and CAC.

AB  - The rising success of cancer immunotherapy has produced immense interest in
      defining the clinical contexts that may benefit from this therapeutic approach.
      To this end, there is a need to ascertain how the therapeutic modulation of
      intrinsic cancer cell programs influences the anticancer immune response. For
      example, the role of autophagy as a tumor cell survival and metabolic fitness
      pathway is being therapeutically targeted in ongoing clinical trials that combine
      cancer therapies with antimalarial drugs for the treatment of a broad spectrum of
      cancers, many of which will likely benefit from immunotherapy. However, our
      current understanding of the interplay between autophagy and the immune response 
      remains incomplete. Here, we have evaluated how autophagy inhibition impacts the 
      antitumor immune response in immune-competent mouse models of melanoma and
      mammary cancer. We observed equivalent levels of T cell infiltration and function
      within autophagy-competent and -deficient tumors, even upon treatment with the
      anthracycline chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Similarly, we found equivalent T cell
      responses upon systemic treatment of tumor-bearing mice with antimalarial drugs. 
      Our findings demonstrate that antitumor adaptive immunity is not adversely
      impaired by autophagy inhibition in these models, allowing for the future
      possibility of combining autophagy inhibitors with immunotherapy in certain
      clinical contexts.

PG  - 4068-4071

AB  - Hepatocyte death, which can be apoptosis or necrosis depending on the context, is
      a prominent feature of liver disease. The lectin concanavalin A (ConA) activates 
      immune cells, resulting in inflammatory liver injury and hepatocyte necrosis. In 
      this issue of the JCI, Gunther et al. demonstrate that the pseudokinase mixed
      lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) participates in hepatocyte death in
      ConA injury and that MLKL-mediated death is independent of the
      receptor-interacting protein kinase RIPK3. RIPK3 was absent in hepatocytes, and
      MLKL-deficient mice, but not RIPK3-deficient mice, were protected from
      ConA-induced liver injury. The authors also present evidence that an unidentified
      kinase activates MLKL, as RIPK1 bound MLKL but did not phosphorylate it.
      Moreover, ConA rapidly induced MLKL, mediated by the IFN-gamma/STAT1 pathway,
      while activation and translocation to the plasma membrane required TNF. Increased
      phospho-MLKL staining in liver biopsies from patients with autoimmune hepatitis
      suggests a role for MLKL in this disease. This study describes a previously
      unrecognized form of cell death in the liver that should be further explored as a
      potential therapeutic target in immune-mediated liver injury.

AB  - Some autoimmune disorders are monogenetic diseases; however, clinical
      manifestations among individuals vary, despite the presence of identical
      mutations in the disease-causing gene. In this issue of the JCI, Massaad and
      colleagues characterized a seemingly monogenic autoimmune disorder in a family
      that was linked to homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the
      endonuclease Nei endonuclease VIII-like 3 (NEIL3), which has not been previously 
      associated with autoimmunity. The identification of an unrelated healthy
      individual with the same homozygous mutation spurred more in-depth analysis of
      the data and revealed the presence of a second mutation in a known
      autoimmune-associated gene. Animals lacking Neil3 had no overt phenotype, but
      were predisposed to autoantibody production and nephritis following exposure to
      the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). Together, these results support further evaluation of 
      the drivers of autoimmunity in supposedly monogenic disorders.

AB  - The regulatory roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in transcriptional
      coactivators are still largely unknown. Here, we have shown that the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator alpha (PGC-1alpha, 
      encoded by Ppargc1a) is functionally regulated by the lncRNA taurine-upregulated 
      gene 1 (Tug1). Further, we have described a role for Tug1 in the regulation of
      mitochondrial function in podocytes. Using a murine model of diabetic nephropathy
      (DN), we performed an unbiased RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of kidney
      glomeruli and identified Tug1 as a differentially expressed lncRNA in the
      diabetic milieu. Podocyte-specific overexpression (OE) of Tug1 in diabetic mice
      improved the biochemical and histological features associated with DN.
      Unexpectedly, we found that Tug1 OE rescued the expression of PGC-1alpha and its 
      transcriptional targets. Tug1 OE was also associated with improvements in
      mitochondrial bioenergetics in the podocytes of diabetic mice. Mechanistically,
      we found that the interaction between Tug1 and PGC-1alpha promotes the binding of
      PGC-1alpha to its own promoter. We identified a Tug1-binding element (TBE)
      upstream of the Ppargc1a gene and showed that Tug1 binds with the TBE to enhance 
      Ppargc1a promoter activity. These findings indicate that a direct interaction
      between PGC-1alpha and Tug1 modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in podocytes in
      the diabetic milieu.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes
      (T2D), but whether NAFLD plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of T2D is
      uncertain. One proposed mechanism linking NAFLD to hepatic insulin resistance
      involves diacylglycerol-mediated (DAG-mediated) activation of protein kinase
      C-epsilon (PKCepsilon) and the consequent inhibition of insulin receptor (INSR)
      kinase activity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying PKCepsilon
      inhibition of INSR kinase activity is unknown. Here, we used mass spectrometry to
      identify the phosphorylation site Thr1160 as a PKCepsilon substrate in the
      functionally critical INSR kinase activation loop. We hypothesized that Thr1160
      phosphorylation impairs INSR kinase activity by destabilizing the active
      configuration of the INSR kinase, and our results confirmed this prediction by
      demonstrating severely impaired INSR kinase activity in phosphomimetic T1160E
      mutants. Conversely, the INSR T1160A mutant was not inhibited by PKCepsilon in
      vitro. Furthermore, mice with a threonine-to-alanine mutation at the homologous
      residue Thr1150 (InsrT1150A mice) were protected from high fat diet-induced
      hepatic insulin resistance. InsrT1150A mice also displayed increased insulin
      signaling, suppression of hepatic glucose production, and increased hepatic
      glycogen synthesis compared with WT controls during hyperinsulinemic clamp
      studies. These data reveal a critical pathophysiological role for INSR Thr1160
      phosphorylation and provide further mechanistic links between PKCepsilon and INSR
      in mediating NAFLD-induced hepatic insulin resistance.

AB  - A vast number of cancer genes are transcription factors that drive tumorigenesis 
      as oncogenic fusion proteins. Although the direct targeting of transcription
      factors remains challenging, therapies aimed at oncogenic fusion proteins are
      attractive as potential treatments for cancer. There is particular interest in
      targeting the oncogenic PAX3-FOXO1 fusion transcription factor, which induces
      alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), an aggressive cancer of skeletal muscle cells
      for which patient outcomes remain dismal. In this work, we have defined the
      interactome of PAX3-FOXO1 and screened 60 candidate interactors using
      siRNA-mediated depletion to identify candidates that affect fusion protein
      activity in aRMS cells. We report that chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 
      4 (CHD4), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, acts as crucial coregulator of
      PAX3-FOXO1 activity. CHD4 interacts with PAX3-FOXO1 via short DNA fragments.
      Together, they bind to regulatory regions of PAX3-FOXO1 target genes. Gene
      expression analysis suggested that CHD4 coregulatory activity is essential for a 
      subset of PAX3-FOXO1 target genes. Depletion of CHD4 reduced cell viability of
      fusion-positive but not of fusion-negative RMS in vitro, which resembled loss of 
      PAX3-FOXO1. It also caused specific regression of fusion-positive xenograft
      tumors in vivo. Therefore, this work identifies CHD4 as an epigenetic coregulator
      of PAX3-FOXO1 activity, providing rational evidence for CHD4 as a potential
      therapeutic target in aRMS.

AB  - Little is known about the role of mTOR signaling in plasma cell differentiation
      and function. Furthermore, for reasons not understood, mTOR inhibition reverses
      antibody-associated disease in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus.
      Here, we have demonstrated that induced B lineage-specific deletion of the gene
      encoding RAPTOR, an essential signaling adaptor for rapamycin-sensitive mTOR
      complex 1 (mTORC1), abrogated the generation of antibody-secreting plasma cells
      in mice. Acute treatment with rapamycin recapitulated the effects of RAPTOR
      deficiency, and both strategies led to the ablation of newly formed plasma cells 
      in the spleen and bone marrow while also obliterating preexisting germinal
      centers. Surprisingly, although perturbing mTOR activity caused a profound
      decline in serum antibodies that were specific for exogenous antigen or DNA,
      frequencies of long-lived bone marrow plasma cells were unaffected. Instead,
      mTORC1 inhibition led to decreased expression of immunoglobulin-binding protein
      (BiP) and other factors needed for robust protein synthesis. Consequently,
      blockade of antibody synthesis was rapidly reversed after termination of
      rapamycin treatment. We conclude that mTOR signaling plays critical but diverse
      roles in early and late phases of antibody responses and plasma cell
      differentiation.

AB  - The adoptive transfer of T cells that have been genetically modified to express a
      CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is effective for treating human B
      cell malignancies. However, the persistence of functional CD19 CAR T cells causes
      sustained depletion of endogenous CD19+ B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia. Thus, 
      there is a need for a mechanism to ablate transferred T cells after tumor
      eradication is complete to allow recovery of normal B cells. Previously, we
      developed a truncated version of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt)
      that is coexpressed with the CAR on the T cell surface. Here, we show that
      targeting EGFRt with the IgG1 monoclonal antibody cetuximab eliminates CD19 CAR T
      cells both early and late after adoptive transfer in mice, resulting in complete 
      and permanent recovery of normal functional B cells, without tumor relapse. EGFRt
      can be incorporated into many clinical applications to regulate the survival of
      gene-engineered cells. These results support the concept that EGFRt represents a 
      promising approach to improve safety of cell-based therapies.

AB  - An increasing amount of evidence suggests that metabolic alterations play a key
      role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathogenesis. In this issue of the JCI, Long
      et al. report that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) taurine-upregulated 1 (Tug1)
      contributes to CKD development. The authors show that Tug1 regulates
      mitochondrial function in podocytes by epigenetic targeting of expression of the 
      transcription factor PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha, encoded by
      Ppargc1a). Transgenic overexpression of Tug1 specifically in podocytes
      ameliorated diabetes-induced CKD in mice. Together, these results highlight an
      important connection between lncRNA-mediated metabolic alterations in podocytes
      and kidney disease development.

TI  - Deficiency of base excision repair enzyme NEIL3 drives increased predisposition
      to autoimmunity.
PG  - 4219-4236
LID - 85647 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI85647 [doi]
AB  - Alterations in the apoptosis of immune cells have been associated with
      autoimmunity. Here, we have identified a homozygous missense mutation in the gene
      encoding the base excision repair enzyme Nei endonuclease VIII-like 3 (NEIL3)
      that abolished enzymatic activity in 3 siblings from a consanguineous family. The
      NEIL3 mutation was associated with fatal recurrent infections, severe
      autoimmunity, hypogammaglobulinemia, and impaired B cell function in these
      individuals. The same homozygous NEIL3 mutation was also identified in an
      asymptomatic individual who exhibited elevated levels of serum autoantibodies and
      defective peripheral B cell tolerance, but normal B cell function. Further
      analysis of the patients revealed an absence of LPS-responsive beige-like anchor 
      (LRBA) protein expression, a known cause of immunodeficiency. We next examined
      the contribution of NEIL3 to the maintenance of self-tolerance in Neil3-/- mice. 
      Although Neil3-/- mice displayed normal B cell function, they exhibited elevated 
      serum levels of autoantibodies and developed nephritis following treatment with
      poly(I:C) to mimic microbial stimulation. In Neil3-/- mice, splenic T and B cells
      as well as germinal center B cells from Peyer's patches showed marked increases
      in apoptosis and cell death, indicating the potential release of self-antigens
      that favor autoimmunity. These findings demonstrate that deficiency in NEIL3 is
      associated with increased lymphocyte apoptosis, autoantibodies, and
      predisposition to autoimmunity.

TI  - The pseudokinase MLKL mediates programmed hepatocellular necrosis independently
      of RIPK3 during hepatitis.
PG  - 4346-4360
LID - 87545 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87545 [doi]
AB  - Although necrosis and necroinflammation are central features of many liver
      diseases, the role of programmed necrosis in the context of
      inflammation-dependent hepatocellular death remains to be fully determined. Here,
      we have demonstrated that the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like
      protein (MLKL), which plays a key role in the execution of receptor-interacting
      protein (RIP) kinase-dependent necroptosis, is upregulated and activated in human
      autoimmune hepatitis and in a murine model of inflammation-dependent hepatitis.
      Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we determined that hepatocellular
      necrosis in experimental hepatitis is driven by an MLKL-dependent pathway that
      occurs independently of RIPK3. Moreover, we have provided evidence that the
      cytotoxic activity of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma in hepatic
      inflammation is strongly connected to induction of MLKL expression via activation
      of the transcription factor STAT1. In summary, our results reveal a pathway for
      MLKL-dependent programmed necrosis that is executed in the absence of RIPK3 and
      potentially drives the pathogenesis of severe liver diseases.

TI  - Targeting CAG repeat RNAs reduces Huntington's disease phenotype independently of
      huntingtin levels.
PG  - 4319-4330
LID - 83185 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI83185 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a polyglutamine disorder caused by a CAG expansion
      in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene exon 1. This expansion encodes a mutant protein
      whose abnormal function is traditionally associated with HD pathogenesis;
      however, recent evidence has also linked HD pathogenesis to RNA stable hairpins
      formed by the mutant HTT expansion. Here, we have shown that a locked nucleic
      acid-modified antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the CAG repeat (LNA-CTG)
      preferentially binds to mutant HTT without affecting HTT mRNA or protein levels. 
      LNA-CTGs produced rapid and sustained improvement of motor deficits in an R6/2
      mouse HD model that was paralleled by persistent binding of LNA-CTG to the
      expanded HTT exon 1 transgene. Motor improvement was accompanied by a pronounced 
      recovery in the levels of several striatal neuronal markers severely impaired in 
      R6/2 mice. Furthermore, in R6/2 mice, LNA-CTG blocked several pathogenic
      mechanisms caused by expanded CAG RNA, including small RNA toxicity and decreased
      Rn45s expression levels. These results suggest that LNA-CTGs promote
      neuroprotection by blocking the detrimental activity of CAG repeats within HTT
      mRNA. The present data emphasize the relevance of expanded CAG RNA to HD
      pathogenesis, indicate that inhibition of HTT expression is not required to
      reverse motor deficits, and further suggest a therapeutic potential for LNA-CTG
      in polyglutamine disorders.

PG  - 4174-4186
LID - 86623 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI86623 [doi]
AB  - Carcinoma cells can acquire increased motility and invasiveness through
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the significance of EMT in
      cancer metastasis has been controversial, and the exact fates and functions of
      EMT cancer cells in vivo remain inadequately understood. Here, we tracked
      epithelial cancer cells that underwent inducible or spontaneous EMT in various
      tumor transplantation models. Unlike epithelial cells, the majority of EMT cancer
      cells were specifically located in the perivascular space and closely associated 
      with blood vessels. EMT markedly activated multiple pericyte markers in carcinoma
      cells, in particular PDGFR-beta and N-cadherin, which enabled EMT cells to be
      chemoattracted towards and physically interact with endothelium. In tumor
      xenografts generated from carcinoma cells that were prone to spontaneous EMT, a
      substantial fraction of the pericytes associated with tumor vasculature were
      derived from EMT cancer cells. Depletion of such EMT cells in transplanted tumors
      diminished pericyte coverage, impaired vascular integrity, and attenuated tumor
      growth. These findings suggest that EMT confers key pericyte attributes on cancer
      cells. The resulting EMT cells phenotypically and functionally resemble pericytes
      and are indispensable for vascular stabilization and sustained tumor growth. This
      study thus proposes a previously unrecognized role for EMT in cancer.

AB  - Scleroderma is a group of skin-fibrosing diseases for which there are no
      effective treatments. A feature of the skin fibrosis typical of scleroderma is
      atrophy of the dermal white adipose tissue (DWAT). Adipose tissue contains
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSCs) that have regenerative and
      reparative functions; however, whether DWAT atrophy in fibrosis is accompanied by
      ADSC loss is poorly understood, as are the mechanisms that might maintain ADSC
      survival in fibrotic skin. Here, we have shown that DWAT ADSC numbers were
      reduced, likely because of cell death, in 2 murine models of scleroderma skin
      fibrosis. The remaining ADSCs showed a partial dependence on dendritic cells
      (DCs) for survival. Lymphotoxin beta (LTbeta) expression in DCs maintained ADSC
      survival in fibrotic skin by activating an LTbeta receptor/beta1 integrin
      (LTbetaR/beta1 integrin) pathway on ADSCs. Stimulation of LTbetaR augmented the
      engraftment of therapeutically injected ADSCs, which was associated with
      reductions in skin fibrosis and improved skin function. These findings provide
      insight into the effects of skin fibrosis on DWAT ADSCs, identify a DC-ADSC
      survival axis in fibrotic skin, and suggest an approach for improving mesenchymal
      stromal cell therapy in scleroderma and other diseases.

AB  - Eccrine sweat glands are essential for sweating and thermoregulation in humans.
      Loss-of-function mutations in the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel
      genes ORAI1 and STIM1 abolish store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), and patients with
      these CRAC channel mutations suffer from anhidrosis and hyperthermia at high
      ambient temperatures. Here we have shown that CRAC channel-deficient patients and
      mice with ectodermal tissue-specific deletion of Orai1 (Orai1K14Cre) or Stim1 and
      Stim2 (Stim1/2K14Cre) failed to sweat despite normal sweat gland development.
      SOCE was absent in agonist-stimulated sweat glands from Orai1K14Cre and
      Stim1/2K14Cre mice and human sweat gland cells lacking ORAI1 or STIM1 expression.
      In Orai1K14Cre mice, abolishment of SOCE was associated with impaired chloride
      secretion by primary murine sweat glands. In human sweat gland cells, SOCE
      mediated by ORAI1 was necessary for agonist-induced chloride secretion and
      activation of the Ca2+-activated chloride channel (CaCC) anoctamin 1 (ANO1, also 
      known as TMEM16A). By contrast, expression of TMEM16A, the water channel
      aquaporin 5 (AQP5), and other regulators of sweat gland function was normal in
      the absence of SOCE. Our findings demonstrate that Ca2+ influx via store-operated
      CRAC channels is essential for CaCC activation, chloride secretion, and sweat
      production in humans and mice.

TI  - Matricellular protein SPARCL1 regulates tumor microenvironment-dependent
      endothelial cell heterogeneity in colorectal carcinoma.
PG  - 4187-4204
LID - 78260 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI78260 [doi]
AB  - Different tumor microenvironments (TMEs) induce stromal cell plasticity that
      affects tumorigenesis. The impact of TME-dependent heterogeneity of tumor
      endothelial cells (TECs) on tumorigenesis is unclear. Here, we isolated pure TECs
      from human colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) that exhibited TMEs with either improved 
      (Th1-TME CRCs) or worse clinical prognosis (control-TME CRCs). Transcriptome
      analyses identified markedly different gene clusters that reflected the
      tumorigenic and angiogenic activities of the respective TMEs. The gene encoding
      the matricellular protein SPARCL1 was most strongly upregulated in Th1-TME TECs. 
      It was also highly expressed in ECs in healthy colon tissues and Th1-TME CRCs but
      low in control-TME CRCs. In vitro, SPARCL1 expression was induced in confluent,
      quiescent ECs and functionally contributed to EC quiescence by inhibiting
      proliferation, migration, and sprouting, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown
      increased sprouting. In human CRC tissues and mouse models, vessels with SPARCL1 
      expression were larger and more densely covered by mural cells. SPARCL1 secretion
      from quiescent ECs inhibited mural cell migration, which likely led to stabilized
      mural cell coverage of mature vessels. Together, these findings demonstrate
      TME-dependent intertumoral TEC heterogeneity in CRC. They further indicate that
      TEC heterogeneity is regulated by SPARCL1, which promotes the cell quiescence and
      vessel homeostasis contributing to the favorable prognoses associated with
      Th1-TME CRCs.

AB  - Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can influence ovarian cancer growth,
      migration, and metastasis, but the detailed mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer 
      metastasis remain unclear. Here, we have shown a strong correlation between
      TAM-associated spheroids and the clinical pathology of ovarian cancer. Further,
      we have determined that TAMs promote spheroid formation and tumor growth at early
      stages of transcoelomic metastasis in an established mouse model for epithelial
      ovarian cancer. M2 macrophage-like TAMs were localized in the center of spheroids
      and secreted EGF, which upregulated alphaMbeta2 integrin on TAMs and ICAM-1 on
      tumor cells to promote association between tumor cells and TAM. Moreover, EGF
      secreted by TAMs activated EGFR on tumor cells, which in turn upregulated
      VEGF/VEGFR signaling in surrounding tumor cells to support tumor cell
      proliferation and migration. Pharmacological blockade of EGFR or antibody
      neutralization of ICAM-1 in TAMs blunted spheroid formation and ovarian cancer
      progression in mouse models. These findings suggest that EGF secreted from TAMs
      plays a critical role in promoting early transcoelomic metastasis of ovarian
      cancer. As transcoelomic metastasis is also associated with many other cancers,
      such as pancreatic and colon cancers, our findings uncover a mechanism for
      TAM-mediated spheroid formation and provide a potential target for the treatment 
      of ovarian cancer and other transcoelomic metastatic cancers.

AB  - Neutrophils need to penetrate the perivascular basement membrane for successful
      extravasation into inflamed tissue, but this process is incompletely understood. 
      Recent findings have associated mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) loss of
      function with a human primary immunodeficiency disorder, suggesting that MST1 may
      be involved in immune cell migration. Here, we have shown that MST1 is a critical
      regulator of neutrophil extravasation during inflammation. Mst1-deficient
      (Mst1-/-) neutrophils were unable to migrate into inflamed murine cremaster
      muscle venules, instead persisting between the endothelium and the basement
      membrane. Mst1-/- neutrophils also failed to extravasate from gastric submucosal 
      vessels in a murine model of Helicobacter pylori infection. Mechanistically, we
      observed defective translocation of VLA-3, VLA-6, and neutrophil elastase from
      intracellular vesicles to the surface of Mst1-/- neutrophils, indicating that
      MST1 is required for this crucial step in neutrophil transmigration. Furthermore,
      we found that MST1 associates with the Rab27 effector protein synaptotagmin-like 
      protein 1 (JFC1, encoded by Sytl1 in mice), but not Munc13-4, thereby regulating 
      the trafficking of Rab27-positive vesicles to the cellular membrane. Together,
      these findings highlight a role for MST1 in vesicle trafficking and extravasation
      in neutrophils, providing an additional mechanistic explanation for the severe
      immune defect observed in patients with MST1 deficiency.

AB  - Radiotherapy causes dose-limiting toxicity and long-term complications in rapidly
      renewing tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, there is no
      FDA-approved agent for the prevention or treatment of radiation-induced
      intestinal injury. In this study, we have shown that PD 0332991 (PD), an
      FDA-approved selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6),
      prevents radiation-induced lethal intestinal injury in mice. Treating mice with
      PD or a structurally distinct CDK4/6 inhibitor prior to radiation blocked
      proliferation and crypt apoptosis and improved crypt regeneration. PD treatment
      also enhanced LGR5+ stem cell survival and regeneration after radiation. PD was
      an on-target inhibitor of RB phosphorylation and blocked G1/S transition in the
      intestinal crypts. PD treatment strongly but reversibly inhibited
      radiation-induced p53 activation, which blocked p53-upregulated modulator of
      apoptosis-dependent (PUMA-dependent) apoptosis without affecting p21-dependent
      suppression of DNA damage accumulation, with a repair bias toward nonhomologous
      end joining. Further, deletion of PUMA synergized with PD treatment for even
      greater intestinal radioprotection. Our results demonstrate that the cell cycle
      critically regulates the DNA damage response and survival of intestinal stem
      cells and support the concept that pharmacological quiescence is a potentially
      highly effective and selective strategy for intestinal radioprotection.

TI  - Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived annexin A6+ extracellular vesicles support
      pancreatic cancer aggressiveness.
PG  - 4140-4156
LID - 87734 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87734 [doi]
AB  - The intratumoral microenvironment, or stroma, is of major importance in the
      pathobiology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), and specific conditions
      in the stroma may promote increased cancer aggressiveness. We hypothesized that
      this heterogeneous and evolving compartment drastically influences tumor cell
      abilities, which in turn influences PDA aggressiveness through crosstalk that is 
      mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here, we have analyzed the PDA
      proteomic stromal signature and identified a contribution of the annexin A6/LDL
      receptor-related protein 1/thrombospondin 1 (ANXA6/LRP1/TSP1) complex in tumor
      cell crosstalk. Formation of the ANXA6/LRP1/TSP1 complex was restricted to
      cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and required physiopathologic culture
      conditions that improved tumor cell survival and migration. Increased PDA
      aggressiveness was dependent on tumor cell-mediated uptake of CAF-derived ANXA6+ 
      EVs carrying the ANXA6/LRP1/TSP1 complex. Depletion of ANXA6 in CAFs impaired
      complex formation and subsequently impaired PDA and metastasis occurrence, while 
      injection of CAF-derived ANXA6+ EVs enhanced tumorigenesis. We found that the
      presence of ANXA6+ EVs in serum was restricted to PDA patients and represents a
      potential biomarker for PDA grade. These findings suggest that CAF-tumor cell
      crosstalk supported by ANXA6+ EVs is predictive of PDA aggressiveness,
      highlighting a therapeutic target and potential biomarker for PDA.

TI  - Adipocyte-specific deletion of Ip6k1 reduces diet-induced obesity by enhancing
      AMPK-mediated thermogenesis.
PG  - 4273-4288
LID - 85510 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI85510 [doi]
AB  - Enhancing energy expenditure (EE) is an attractive strategy to combat obesity and
      diabetes. Global deletion of Ip6k1 protects mice from diet-induced obesity (DIO) 
      and insulin resistance, but the tissue-specific mechanism by which IP6K1
      regulates body weight is unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that IP6K1 regulates
      fat accumulation by modulating AMPK-mediated adipocyte energy metabolism. Cold
      exposure led to downregulation of Ip6k1 in murine inguinal and retroperitoneal
      white adipose tissue (IWAT and RWAT) depots. Adipocyte-specific deletion of Ip6k1
      (AdKO) enhanced thermogenic EE, which protected mice from high-fat diet-induced
      weight gain at ambient temperature (23 degrees C), but not at thermoneutral
      temperature (30 degrees C). AdKO-induced increases in thermogenesis also
      protected mice from cold-induced decreases in body temperature. UCP1, PGC1alpha, 
      and other markers of browning and thermogenesis were elevated in IWAT and RWAT of
      AdKO mice. Cold-induced activation of sympathetic signaling was unaltered,
      whereas AMPK was enhanced, in AdKO IWAT. Moreover, beige adipocytes from AdKO
      IWAT displayed enhanced browning, which was diminished by AMPK depletion.
      Furthermore, we determined that IP6 and IP6K1 differentially regulate upstream
      kinase-mediated AMPK stimulatory phosphorylation in vitro. Finally, treating
      mildly obese mice with the IP6K inhibitor TNP enhanced thermogenesis and
      inhibited progression of DIO. Thus, IP6K1 regulates energy metabolism via a
      mechanism that could potentially be targeted in obesity.

TI  - Decreased somatic hypermutation induces an impaired peripheral B cell tolerance
      checkpoint.
PG  - 4289-4302
LID - 84645 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI84645 [doi]
AB  - Patients with mutations in AICDA, which encodes activation-induced cytidine
      deaminase (AID), display an impaired peripheral B cell tolerance. AID mediates
      class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in B cells, but 
      the mechanism by which AID prevents the accumulation of autoreactive B cells in
      blood is unclear. Here, we analyzed B cell tolerance in AID-deficient patients,
      patients with autosomal dominant AID mutations (AD-AID), asymptomatic AICDA
      heterozygotes (AID+/-), and patients with uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) deficiency, 
      which impairs CSR but not SHM. The low frequency of autoreactive mature naive B
      cells in UNG-deficient patients resembled that of healthy subjects, revealing
      that impaired CSR does not interfere with the peripheral B cell tolerance
      checkpoint. In contrast, we observed decreased frequencies of SHM in memory B
      cells from AD-AID patients and AID+/- subjects, who were unable to prevent the
      accumulation of autoreactive mature naive B cells. In addition, the individuals
      with AICDA mutations, but not UNG-deficient patients, displayed Tregs with
      defective suppressive capacity that correlated with increases in circulating T
      follicular helper cells and enhanced cytokine production. We conclude that SHM,
      but not CSR, regulates peripheral B cell tolerance through the production of
      mutated antibodies that clear antigens and prevent sustained interleukin
      secretions that interfere with Treg function.

AB  - Rush desensitization (DS) is a widely used and effective clinical strategy for
      the rapid inhibition of IgE-mediated anaphylactic responses. However, the
      cellular targets and underlying mechanisms behind this process remain unclear.
      Recent studies have implicated mast cells (MCs) as the primary target cells for
      DS. Here, we developed a murine model of passive anaphylaxis with demonstrated MC
      involvement and an in vitro assay to evaluate the effect of DS on MCs. In
      contrast with previous reports, we determined that functional IgE remains on the 
      cell surface of desensitized MCs following DS. Despite notable reductions in MC
      degranulation following DS, the high-affinity IgE receptor FcepsilonRI was still 
      capable of transducing signals in desensitized MCs. Additionally, we found that
      displacement of the actin cytoskeleton and its continued association with
      FcepsilonRI impede the capacity of desensitized MCs to evoke the calcium response
      that is essential for MC degranulation. Together, these findings suggest that
      reduced degranulation responses in desensitized MCs arise from aberrant actin
      remodeling, providing insights that may lead to improvement of DS treatments for 
      anaphylactic responses.

      pathways.

AB  - Oncogenic mutations drive anabolic metabolism, creating a dependency on nutrient 
      influx through transporters, receptors, and macropinocytosis. While sphingolipids
      suppress tumor growth by downregulating nutrient transporters, macropinocytosis
      and autophagy still provide cancer cells with fuel. Therapeutics that
      simultaneously disrupt these parallel nutrient access pathways have potential as 
      powerful starvation agents. Here, we describe a water-soluble, orally
      bioavailable synthetic sphingolipid, SH-BC-893, that triggers nutrient
      transporter internalization and also blocks lysosome-dependent nutrient
      generation pathways. SH-BC-893 activated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading
      to mislocalization of the lipid kinase PIKfyve. The concomitant mislocalization
      of the PIKfyve product PI(3,5)P2 triggered cytosolic vacuolation and blocked
      lysosomal fusion reactions essential for LDL, autophagosome, and macropinosome
      degradation. By simultaneously limiting access to both extracellular and
      intracellular nutrients, SH-BC-893 selectively killed cells expressing an
      activated form of the anabolic oncogene Ras in vitro and in vivo. However,
      slower-growing, autochthonous PTEN-deficient prostate tumors that did not exhibit
      a classic Warburg phenotype were equally sensitive. Remarkably, normal
      proliferative tissues were unaffected by doses of SH-BC-893 that profoundly
      inhibited tumor growth. These studies demonstrate that simultaneously blocking
      parallel nutrient access pathways with sphingolipid-based drugs is broadly
      effective and cancer selective, suggesting a potential strategy for overcoming
      the resistance conferred by tumor heterogeneity.

TI  - ChREBP regulates fructose-induced glucose production independently of insulin
      signaling.
PG  - 4372-4386
LID - 81993 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI81993 [doi]
AB  - Obese, insulin-resistant states are characterized by a paradoxical pathogenic
      condition in which the liver appears to be selectively insulin resistant.
      Specifically, insulin fails to suppress glucose production, yet successfully
      stimulates de novo lipogenesis. The mechanisms underlying this dysregulation
      remain controversial. Here, we hypothesized that carbohydrate-responsive
      element-binding protein (ChREBP), a transcriptional activator of glycolytic and
      lipogenic genes, plays a central role in this paradox. Administration of fructose
      increased hepatic hexose-phosphate levels, activated ChREBP, and caused glucose
      intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis in
      mice. Activation of ChREBP was required for the increased expression of
      glycolytic and lipogenic genes as well as glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) that was
      associated with the effects of fructose administration. We found that
      fructose-induced G6PC activity is a major determinant of hepatic glucose
      production and reduces hepatic glucose-6-phosphate levels to complete a
      homeostatic loop. Moreover, fructose activated ChREBP and induced G6pc in the
      absence of Foxo1a, indicating that carbohydrate-induced activation of ChREBP and 
      G6PC dominates over the suppressive effects of insulin to enhance glucose
      production. This ChREBP/G6PC signaling axis is conserved in humans. Together,
      these findings support a carbohydrate-mediated, ChREBP-driven mechanism that
      contributes to hepatic insulin resistance.

LID - 89067 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI89067 [doi]
AB  - Radioiodide (RAI) therapy of thyroid cancer exploits the relatively selective
      ability of thyroid cells to transport and accumulate iodide. Iodide uptake
      requires expression of critical genes that are involved in various steps of
      thyroid hormone biosynthesis. ERK signaling, which is markedly increased in
      thyroid cancer cells driven by oncogenic BRAF, represses the genetic program that
      enables iodide transport. Here, we determined that a critical threshold for
      inhibition of MAPK signaling is required to optimally restore expression of
      thyroid differentiation genes in thyroid cells and in mice with BrafV600E-induced
      thyroid cancer. Although the MEK inhibitor selumetinib transiently inhibited ERK 
      signaling, which subsequently rebounded, the MEK inhibitor CKI suppressed ERK
      signaling in a sustained manner by preventing RAF reactivation. A small increase 
      in ERK inhibition markedly increased the expression of thyroid differentiation
      genes, increased iodide accumulation in cancer cells, and thereby improved
      responses to RAI therapy. Only a short exposure to the drug was necessary to
      obtain a maximal response to RAI. These data suggest that potent inhibition of
      ERK signaling is required to adequately induce iodide uptake and indicate that
      this is a promising strategy for the treatment of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer.

LID - 10.1172/JCI87439 [doi]
AB  - In the past decade, new approaches have been explored that are aimed at restoring
      functional beta cell mass as a treatment strategy for diabetes. The two most
      intensely pursued strategies are beta cell replacement through conversion of
      other cell types and beta cell regeneration by enhancement of beta cell
      replication. The approach closest to clinical implementation is the replacement
      of beta cells with human pluripotent stem cell-derived (hPSC-derived) cells,
      which are currently under investigation in a clinical trial to assess their
      safety in humans. In addition, there has been success in reprogramming
      developmentally related cell types into beta cells. Reprogramming approaches
      could find therapeutic applications by inducing beta cell conversion in vivo or
      by reprogramming cells ex vivo followed by implantation. Finally, recent studies 
      have revealed novel pharmacologic targets for stimulating beta cell replication. 
      Manipulating these targets or the pathways they regulate could be a strategy for 
      promoting the expansion of residual beta cells in diabetic patients. Here, we
      provide an overview of progress made toward beta cell replacement and
      regeneration and discuss promises and challenges for clinical implementation of
      these strategies.

AB  - Mast cells (MCs) influence intercellular communication during inflammation by
      secreting cytoplasmic granules that contain diverse mediators. Here, we have
      demonstrated that MCs decode different activation stimuli into spatially and
      temporally distinct patterns of granule secretion. Certain signals, including
      substance P, the complement anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and endothelin 1, induced
      human MCs rapidly to secrete small and relatively spherical granule structures, a
      pattern consistent with the secretion of individual granules. Conversely,
      activating MCs with anti-IgE increased the time partition between signaling and
      secretion, which was associated with a period of sustained elevation of
      intracellular calcium and formation of larger and more heterogeneously shaped
      granule structures that underwent prolonged exteriorization. Pharmacological
      inhibition of IKK-beta during IgE-dependent stimulation strongly reduced the time
      partition between signaling and secretion, inhibited SNAP23/STX4 complex
      formation, and switched the degranulation pattern into one that resembled
      degranulation induced by substance P. IgE-dependent and substance P-dependent
      activation in vivo also induced different patterns of mouse MC degranulation that
      were associated with distinct local and systemic pathophysiological responses.
      These findings show that cytoplasmic granule secretion from MCs that occurs in
      response to different activating stimuli can exhibit distinct dynamics and
      features that are associated with distinct patterns of MC-dependent inflammation.

AB  - Mast cells (MCs) are present in various tissues and are responsible for
      initiating many of the early inflammatory responses to extrinsic challenges.
      Recent studies have demonstrated that MCs can tailor their responses, depending
      on the stimulus encountered and the tissue in which they are stimulated. In this 
      issue of the JCI, Gaudenzio and colleagues examine the mechanistic differences
      between MC responses observed after engagement of Fcepsilon receptor I and those 
      seen after MC stimulation via the recently identified G protein-coupled receptor 
      MRGPRX2. By showing that discrete cellular activation patterns affect the
      phenotype of the MC response in vivo and in vitro, the authors provide important 
      information about how MCs differentially process various stimuli into distinct
      degranulation programs.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrhythmia that arises from electrical and 
      contractile dysfunction in the atria. Atrial function is regulated by a variety
      of intracellular signaling networks that facilitate rapid communication and
      coordinate responses of atrial myocytes. In this issue of the JCI, Brandenburg
      and colleagues describe the identification and characterization of "super-hub"
      signaling nodes located on atrial axial tubules that regulate atrial contraction.
      Together, the results of this study provide important insight into the regulation
      of atrial contraction and describe potential therapeutic targets to be explored
      in future studies.

      malaria.
PG  - 4016-4029
LID - 87306 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87306 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral malaria is characterized by cytoadhesion of Plasmodium
      falciparum-infected red blood cells (Pf-iRBCs) to endothelial cells in the brain,
      disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and cerebral microhemorrhages. No
      available antimalarial drugs specifically target the endothelial disruptions
      underlying this complication, which is responsible for the majority of
      malaria-associated deaths. Here, we have demonstrated that ruptured Pf-iRBCs
      induce activation of beta-catenin, leading to disruption of inter-endothelial
      cell junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs).
      Inhibition of beta-catenin-induced TCF/LEF transcription in the nucleus of HBMECs
      prevented the disruption of endothelial junctions, confirming that beta-catenin
      is a key mediator of P. falciparum adverse effects on endothelial integrity.
      Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) or stimulation of the type 2
      receptor (AT2) abrogated Pf-iRBC-induced activation of beta-catenin and prevented
      the disruption of HBMEC monolayers. In a mouse model of cerebral malaria,
      modulation of angiotensin II receptors produced similar effects, leading to
      protection against cerebral malaria, reduced cerebral hemorrhages, and increased 
      survival. In contrast, AT2-deficient mice were more susceptible to cerebral
      malaria. The interrelation of the beta-catenin and the angiotensin II signaling
      pathways opens immediate host-targeted therapeutic possibilities for cerebral
      malaria and other diseases in which brain endothelial integrity is compromised.

AB  - In addition to the infectious consequences of immunodeficiency, patients with
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) often suffer from poorly understood exaggerated
      immune responses that result in autoimmunity and elevated levels of serum IgE.
      Here, we have shown that WAS patients and mice deficient in WAS protein (WASP)
      frequently develop IgE-mediated reactions to common food allergens.
      WASP-deficient animals displayed an adjuvant-free IgE-sensitization to chow
      antigens that was most pronounced for wheat and soy and occurred under specific
      pathogen-free as well as germ-free housing conditions. Conditional deletion of
      Was in FOXP3+ Tregs resulted in more severe Th2-type intestinal inflammation than
      that observed in mice with global WASP deficiency, indicating that allergic
      responses to food allergens are dependent upon loss of WASP expression in this
      immune compartment. While WASP-deficient Tregs efficiently contained Th1- and
      Th17-type effector differentiation in vivo, they failed to restrain Th2 effector 
      responses that drive allergic intestinal inflammation. Loss of WASP was
      phenotypically associated with increased GATA3 expression in effector memory
      FOXP3+ Tregs, but not in naive-like FOXP3+ Tregs, an effect that occurred
      independently of increased IL-4 signaling. Our results reveal a Treg-specific
      role for WASP that is required for prevention of Th2 effector cell
      differentiation and allergic sensitization to dietary antigens.

AB  - Imatinib-insensitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are believed to be responsible
      for resistance to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors and relapse of chronic
      myelogenous leukemia (CML). Identifying therapeutic targets to eradicate CML LSCs
      may be a strategy to cure CML. In the present study, we discovered a positive
      feedback loop between BCR-ABL and protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in
      CML cells. Overexpression of PRMT5 was observed in human CML LSCs. Silencing
      PRMT5 with shRNA or blocking PRMT5 methyltransferase activity with the
      small-molecule inhibitor PJ-68 reduced survival, serial replating capacity, and
      long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) in LSCs from CML patients. Further, 
      PRMT5 knockdown or PJ-68 treatment dramatically prolonged survival in a murine
      model of retroviral BCR-ABL-driven CML and impaired the in vivo self-renewal
      capacity of transplanted CML LSCs. PJ-68 also inhibited long-term engraftment of 
      human CML CD34+ cells in immunodeficient mice. Moreover, inhibition of PRMT5
      abrogated the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in CML CD34+ cells by depleting
      dishevelled homolog 3 (DVL3). This study suggests that epigenetic methylation
      modification on histone protein arginine residues is a regulatory mechanism to
      control self-renewal of LSCs and indicates that PRMT5 may represent a potential
      therapeutic target against LSCs.

AB  - Dysregulation of the type 2 immune system presents with various manifestations,
      including allergic inflammation, and has emerged as an alarming public health
      issue. The pathological mechanisms that underlie T helper type 2 cell-driven
      (Th2-driven) allergic diseases remain unclear. In particular, it is not
      completely understood how type 2 immunity is restricted in inflammatory
      responses. In this issue of the JCI, Lexmond et al. use Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 
      as a model disease and establish that the Wiskott-Aldrich gene product (WASP)
      serves an essential role in T regulatory cells to contain Th2 effector cell
      differentiation and prevent allergic sensitization to dietary antigens.

AB  - Recent findings have linked brain swelling to death in cerebral malaria (CM).
      These observations have prompted a number of investigations into the mechanisms
      of this pathology with the goal of identifying potential therapeutic targets. In 
      this issue of the JCI, Gallego-Delgado and colleagues present evidence that
      implicates angiotensin receptors and the relocation of beta-catenin to the
      endothelial cell nucleus in CM. This study provides a renewed focus on infected
      erythrocyte debris as the cause of endothelial damage and challenges previous
      work implicating direct effects of infected erythrocyte sequestration in the
      brain as the major driver of disease. While this work provides potential
      therapeutic avenues for CM, it leaves a number of questions unanswered.

TI  - Axial tubule junctions control rapid calcium signaling in atria.
PG  - 3999-4015
LID - 88241 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI88241 [doi]
AB  - The canonical atrial myocyte (AM) is characterized by sparse transverse tubule
      (TT) invaginations and slow intracellular Ca2+ propagation but exhibits rapid
      contractile activation that is susceptible to loss of function during
      hypertrophic remodeling. Here, we have identified a membrane structure and
      Ca2+-signaling complex that may enhance the speed of atrial contraction
      independently of phospholamban regulation. This axial couplon was observed in
      human and mouse atria and is composed of voluminous axial tubules (ATs) with
      extensive junctions to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that include ryanodine
      receptor 2 (RyR2) clusters. In mouse AM, AT structures triggered Ca2+ release
      from the SR approximately 2 times faster at the AM center than at the surface.
      Rapid Ca2+ release correlated with colocalization of highly phosphorylated RyR2
      clusters at AT-SR junctions and earlier, more rapid shortening of central
      sarcomeres. In contrast, mice expressing phosphorylation-incompetent RyR2
      displayed depressed AM sarcomere shortening and reduced in vivo atrial
      contractile function. Moreover, left atrial hypertrophy led to AT proliferation, 
      with a marked increase in the highly phosphorylated RyR2-pS2808 cluster fraction,
      thereby maintaining cytosolic Ca2+ signaling despite decreases in RyR2 cluster
      density and RyR2 protein expression. AT couplon "super-hubs" thus underlie faster
      excitation-contraction coupling in health as well as hypertrophic compensatory
      adaptation and represent a structural and metabolic mechanism that may contribute
      to contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias.

AB  - Transcriptional reactivation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
      reconstitutes telomerase activity in the majority of human cancers. Here, we
      found that ectopic TERT expression increases cell proliferation, while acute
      reductions in TERT levels lead to a dramatic loss of proliferation without any
      change in telomere length, suggesting that the effects of TERT could be telomere 
      independent. We observed that TERT determines the growth rate of cancer cells by 
      directly regulating global protein synthesis independently of its catalytic
      activity. Genome-wide TERT binding across 5 cancer cell lines and 2 embryonic
      stem cell lines revealed that endogenous TERT, driven by mutant promoters or
      oncogenes, directly associates with the RNA polymerase III (pol III) subunit
      RPC32 and enhances its recruitment to chromatin, resulting in increased RNA pol
      III occupancy and tRNA expression in cancers. TERT-deficient mice displayed
      marked delays in polyomavirus middle T oncogene-induced (PyMT-induced) mammary
      tumorigenesis, increased survival, and reductions in tRNA levels. Ectopic
      expression of either RPC32 or TERT restored tRNA levels and proliferation defects
      in TERT-depleted cells. Finally, we determined that levels of TERT and tRNA
      correlated in breast and liver cancer samples. Together, these data suggest the
      existence of a unifying mechanism by which TERT enhances translation in cells to 
      regulate cancer cell proliferation.

AB  - Immune surveillance in tissues is mediated by a long-lived subset of
      tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm cells). A putative subset of tissue-resident 
      long-lived stem cells is characterized by the ability to efflux Hoechst dyes and 
      is referred to as side population (SP) cells. Here, we have characterized a
      subset of SP T cells (Tsp cells) that exhibit a quiescent (G0) phenotype in
      humans and mice. Human Trm cells in the gut and BM were enriched in Tsp cells
      that were predominantly in the G0 stage of the cell cycle. Moreover, in histone
      2B-GFP mice, the 2B-GFP label was retained in Tsp cells, indicative of a
      slow-cycling phenotype. Human Tsp cells displayed a distinct gene-expression
      profile that was enriched for genes overexpressed in Trm cells. In mice, proteins
      encoded by Tsp signature genes, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A
      member 1 (NR4A1) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, influenced the
      function and differentiation of Trm cells. Responses to adoptive transfer of
      human Tsp cells into immune-deficient mice and plerixafor therapy suggested that 
      human Tsp cell mobilization could be manipulated as a potential cellular therapy.
      These data identify a distinct subset of human T cells with a
      quiescent/slow-cycling phenotype, propensity for tissue enrichment, and potential
      to mobilize into circulation, which may be harnessed for adoptive cellular
      therapy.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe and progressive muscle-wasting
      disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Although dystrophin
      deficiency in myofiber triggers the disease's pathological changes, the degree of
      satellite cell (SC) dysfunction defines disease progression. Here, we have
      identified chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II
      (COUP-TFII) hyperactivity as a contributing factor underlying muscular dystrophy 
      in a dystrophin-deficient murine model of DMD. Ectopic expression of COUP-TFII in
      murine SCs led to Duchenne-like dystrophy in the muscles of control animals and
      exacerbated degenerative myopathies in dystrophin-deficient mice.
      COUP-TFII-overexpressing mice exhibited regenerative failure that was attributed 
      to deficient SC proliferation and myoblast fusion. Mechanistically, we determined
      that COUP-TFII coordinated a regenerative program through combined regulation of 
      multiple promyogenic factors. Furthermore, inhibition of COUP-TFII preserved SC
      function and counteracted the muscle weakness associated with Duchenne-like
      dystrophy in the murine model, suggesting that targeting COUP-TFII is a potential
      treatment for DMD. Together, our findings reveal a regulatory role of COUP-TFII
      in the development of muscular dystrophy and open up a potential therapeutic
      opportunity for managing disease progression in patients with DMD.

      activation.
PG  - 3917-3928
LID - 86953 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI86953 [doi]
AB  - Members of the NLR family can assemble inflammasome complexes with the adaptor
      protein ASC and caspase-1 that result in the activation of caspase-1 and the
      release of IL-1beta and IL-18. Although the NLRC4 inflammasome is known to have a
      protective role in tumorigenesis, there is an increased appreciation for the
      inflammasome-independent actions of NLRC4. Here, we utilized a syngeneic
      subcutaneous murine model of B16F10 melanoma to explore the role of NLRC4 in
      tumor suppression. We found that NLRC4-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor
      growth that was independent of the inflammasome components ASC and caspase-1.
      Nlrc4 expression was critical for cytokine and chemokine production in
      tumor-associated macrophages and was necessary for the generation of protective
      IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Tumor progression was diminished when 
      WT or caspase-1-deficient, but not NLRC4-deficient, macrophages were coinjected
      with B16F10 tumor cells in NLRC4-deficient mice. Finally, examination of human
      primary melanomas revealed the extensive presence of NLRC4+ tumor-associated
      macrophages. In contrast, there was a paucity of NLRC4+ tumor-associated
      macrophages observed in human metastatic melanoma, supporting the concept that
      NLRC4 expression controls tumor growth. These results reveal a critical role for 
      NLRC4 in suppressing tumor growth in an inflammasome-independent manner.

      progeria syndrome phenotype.
PG  - 3879-3893
LID - 84164 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI84164 [doi]
AB  - Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic 
      disease that is caused by a silent mutation of the LMNA gene encoding lamins A
      and C (lamin A/C). The G608G mutation generates a more accessible splicing donor 
      site than does WT and produces an alternatively spliced product of LMNA called
      progerin, which is also expressed in normal aged cells. In this study, we
      determined that progerin binds directly to lamin A/C and induces profound nuclear
      aberrations. Given this observation, we performed a random screening of a
      chemical library and identified 3 compounds (JH1, JH4, and JH13) that efficiently
      block progerin-lamin A/C binding. These 3 chemicals, particularly JH4, alleviated
      nuclear deformation and reversed senescence markers characteristic of HGPS cells,
      including growth arrest and senescence-associated beta-gal (SA-beta-gal)
      activity. We then used microarray-based analysis to demonstrate that JH4 is able 
      to rescue defects of cell-cycle progression in both HGPS and aged cells.
      Furthermore, administration of JH4 to LmnaG609G/G609G-mutant mice, which
      phenocopy human HGPS, resulted in a marked improvement of several progeria
      phenotypes and an extended lifespan. Together, these findings indicate that
      specific inhibitors with the ability to block pathological progerin-lamin A/C
      binding may represent a promising strategy for improving lifespan and health in
      both HGPS and normal aging.

AB  - Ventricular arrhythmias are among the most severe complications of heart disease 
      and can result in sudden cardiac death. Patients at risk currently receive
      implantable defibrillators that deliver electrical shocks to terminate
      arrhythmias on demand. However, strong electrical shocks can damage the heart and
      cause severe pain. Therefore, we have tested optogenetic defibrillation using
      expression of the light-sensitive channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in cardiac
      tissue. Epicardial illumination effectively terminated ventricular arrhythmias in
      hearts from transgenic mice and from WT mice after adeno-associated virus-based
      gene transfer of ChR2. We also explored optogenetic defibrillation for human
      hearts, taking advantage of a recently developed, clinically validated in silico 
      approach for simulating infarct-related ventricular tachycardia (VT). Our
      analysis revealed that illumination with red light effectively terminates VT in
      diseased, ChR2-expressing human hearts. Mechanistically, we determined that the
      observed VT termination is due to ChR2-mediated transmural depolarization of the 
      myocardium, which causes a block of voltage-dependent Na+ channels throughout the
      myocardial wall and interrupts wavefront propagation into illuminated tissue.
      Thus, our results demonstrate that optogenetic defibrillation is highly effective
      in the mouse heart and could potentially be translated into humans to achieve
      nondamaging and pain-free termination of ventricular arrhythmia.

AB  - Protective T cell memory is an acquired trait that is contingent upon the
      preservation of its constituents and therefore vulnerable to the potentially
      deleterious effects of organismal aging. Here, however, we have found that
      long-term T cell memory in a natural murine host-pathogen system can
      substantially improve over time. Comprehensive molecular, phenotypic, and
      functional profiling of aging antiviral CD8+ memory T cells (CD8+ TM) revealed a 
      pervasive remodeling process that promotes the gradual acquisition of distinct
      molecular signatures, of increasingly homogeneous phenotypes, and of diversified 
      functionalities that combine to confer a CD8+ TM-autonomous capacity for enhanced
      recall responses and immune protection. Notably, the process of CD8+ TM aging is 
      characterized by a progressive harmonization of memory and naive T cell traits,
      is broadly amenable to experimental acceleration or retardation, and serves as a 
      constitutional component for the "rebound model" of memory T cell maturation. By 
      casting CD8+ TM populations within the temporal framework of their slowly
      evolving properties, this model establishes a simple ontogenetic perspective on
      the principal organization of CD8+ T cell memory that may directly inform the
      development of improved diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Much has been written already about whether the scientific machine is churning
      out too many PhDs and postdocs when there are a limited number of academic jobs
      and the competition for funding and space in competitive journals is intense. But
      gratifyingly, there exists a vast array of other scientific careers. We need to
      mentor and advise trainees about the diverse and rewarding professional
      opportunities that are available beyond the postdoctoral apprenticeship period.

AB  - Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is associated with mutations in the WAS protein
      (WASp), which plays a critical role in the initiation of T cell receptor-driven
      (TCR-driven) actin polymerization. The clinical phenotype of WAS includes
      susceptibility to infection, allergy, autoimmunity, and malignancy and overlaps
      with the symptoms of dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, suggesting
      that the 2 syndromes share common pathogenic mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated
      that the WASp-interacting protein (WIP) bridges DOCK8 to WASp and actin in T
      cells. We determined that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of
      DOCK8 is essential for the integrity of the subcortical actin cytoskeleton as
      well as for TCR-driven WASp activation, F-actin assembly, immune synapse
      formation, actin foci formation, mechanotransduction, T cell transendothelial
      migration, and homing to lymph nodes, all of which also depend on WASp. These
      results indicate that DOCK8 and WASp are in the same signaling pathway that links
      TCRs to the actin cytoskeleton in TCR-driven actin assembly. Further, they
      provide an explanation for similarities in the clinical phenotypes of WAS and
      DOCK8 deficiency.

TI  - TGF-beta receptor maintains CD4 T helper cell identity during chronic viral
      infections.
PG  - 3799-3813

AB  - Suppression of CD8 and CD4 T cells is a hallmark in chronic viral infections,
      including hepatitis C and HIV. While multiple pathways are known to inhibit CD8 T
      cells, the host molecules that restrict CD4 T cell responses are less understood.
      Here, we used inducible and CD4 T cell-specific deletion of the gene encoding the
      TGF-beta receptor during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in 
      mice, and determined that TGF-beta signaling restricted proliferation and
      terminal differentiation of antiviral CD4 T cells. TGF-beta signaling also
      inhibited a cytotoxic program that includes granzymes and perforin expression at 
      both early and late stages of infection in vivo and repressed the transcription
      factor eomesodermin. Overexpression of eomesodermin was sufficient to
      recapitulate in great part the phenotype of TGF-beta receptor-deficient CD4 T
      cells, while SMAD4 was necessary for CD4 T cell accumulation and differentiation.
      TGF-beta signaling also restricted accumulation and differentiation of CD4 T
      cells and reduced the expression of cytotoxic molecules in mice and humans
      infected with other persistent viruses. These data uncovered an
      eomesodermin-driven CD4 T cell program that is continuously suppressed by
      TGF-beta signaling. During chronic viral infection, this program limits CD4 T
      cell responses while maintaining CD4 T helper cell identity.

PG  - 3783-3798
LID - 83873 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI83873 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophil granulocytes, also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), extrude
      molecular lattices of decondensed chromatin studded with histones, granule
      enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides that are referred to as neutrophil
      extracellular traps (NETs). NETs capture and contain bacteria, viruses, and other
      pathogens. Nevertheless, experimental evidence indicates that NETs also cause
      inflammatory vascular and tissue damage, suggesting that identifying pathways
      that inhibit NET formation may have therapeutic implications. Here, we determined
      that neonatal NET-inhibitory factor (nNIF) is an inhibitor of NET formation in
      umbilical cord blood. In human neonatal and adult neutrophils, nNIF inhibits key 
      terminal events in NET formation, including peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) 
      activity, neutrophil nuclear histone citrullination, and nuclear decondensation. 
      We also identified additional nNIF-related peptides (NRPs) that inhibit NET
      formation. nNIFs and NRPs blocked NET formation induced by pathogens, microbial
      toxins, and pharmacologic agonists in vitro and in mouse models of infection and 
      systemic inflammation, and they improved mortality in murine models of systemic
      inflammation, which are associated with NET-induced collateral tissue injury. The
      identification of NRPs as neutrophil modulators that selectively interrupt NET
      generation at critical steps suggests their potential as therapeutic agents.
      Furthermore, our results indicate that nNIF may be an important regulator of NET 
      formation in fetal and neonatal inflammation.

      phenotype.
PG  - 3868-3878
LID - 87885 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87885 [doi]
AB  - Reducing expression of the fetal hemoglobin (HbF) repressor BCL11A leads to a
      simultaneous increase in gamma-globin expression and reduction in beta-globin
      expression. Thus, there is interest in targeting BCL11A as a treatment for
      beta-hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and
      beta-thalassemia. Here, we found that using optimized shRNAs embedded within an
      miRNA (shRNAmiR) architecture to achieve ubiquitous knockdown of BCL11A
      profoundly impaired long-term engraftment of both human and mouse hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSCs) despite a reduction in nonspecific cellular toxicities. BCL11A 
      knockdown was associated with a substantial increase in S/G2-phase human HSCs
      after engraftment into immunodeficient (NSG) mice, a phenotype that is associated
      with HSC exhaustion. Lineage-specific, shRNAmiR-mediated suppression of BCL11A in
      erythroid cells led to stable long-term engraftment of gene-modified cells.
      Transduced primary normal or SCD human HSCs expressing the lineage-specific
      BCL11A shRNAmiR gave rise to erythroid cells with up to 90% reduction of BCL11A
      protein. These erythrocytes demonstrated 60%-70% gamma-chain expression (vs. <
      10% for negative control) and a corresponding increase in HbF. Transplantation of
      gene-modified murine HSCs from Berkeley sickle cell mice led to a substantial
      improvement of sickle-associated hemolytic anemia and reticulocytosis, key
      pathophysiological biomarkers of SCD. These data form the basis for a clinical
      trial application for treating sickle cell disease.

AB  - Upfront resistance to chemotherapy and relapse following remission are critical
      problems in leukemia that are generally attributed to subpopulations of
      chemoresistant tumor cells. There are, however, limited means for prospectively
      identifying these subpopulations, which hinders an understanding of therapeutic
      resistance. BH3 profiling is a functional single-cell analysis using synthetic
      BCL-2 BH3 domain-like peptides that measures mitochondrial apoptotic sensitivity 
      or "priming." Here, we observed that the extent of apoptotic priming is
      heterogeneous within multiple cancer cell lines and is not the result of
      experimental noise. Apoptotic priming was also heterogeneous in treatment-naive
      primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) myeloblasts, and this heterogeneity
      decreased in chemotherapy-treated AML patients. The priming of the most
      apoptosis-resistant tumor cells, rather than the median priming of the
      population, best predicted patient response to induction chemotherapy. For
      several patients, these poorly primed subpopulations of AML tumor cells were
      enriched for antiapoptotic proteins. Developing techniques to identify and
      understand these apoptosis-insensitive subpopulations of tumor cells may yield
      insights into clinical chemoresistance and potentially improve therapeutic
      outcomes in AML.

LID - 10.1172/JCI86028 [doi]
AB  - Inhibition of VLDL secretion reduces plasma levels of atherogenic apolipoprotein 
      B (apoB) lipoproteins but can also cause hepatic steatosis. Approaches targeting 
      apoB synthesis, which lies upstream of VLDL secretion, have potential to
      effectively reduce dyslipidemia but can also lead to hepatic accumulation of
      unsecreted triglycerides (TG). Here, we found that treating mice with apoB
      antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for 6 weeks decreased VLDL secretion and plasma
      cholesterol without causing steatosis. The absence of steatosis was linked to an 
      increase in ER stress in the first 3 weeks of ASO treatment, followed by
      development of ER autophagy at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. The latter
      resulted in increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation that was inhibited by both
      chloroquine and 3-methyl adenine, consistent with trafficking of ER TG through
      the autophagic pathway before oxidation. These findings support the concept that 
      inhibition of apoB synthesis traps lipids that have been transferred to the ER by
      microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP), inducing ER stress. ER stress then triggers
      ER autophagy and subsequent lysosomal lipolysis of TG, followed by mitochondrial 
      oxidation of released FA, leading to prevention of steatosis. The identification 
      of this pathway indicates that inhibition of VLDL secretion remains a viable
      target for therapies aiming to reduce circulating levels of atherogenic apoB
      lipoproteins.

AB  - Hypoxia is a prominent characteristic of many acute or chronic inflammatory
      diseases, and exerts significant influence on their progression. Macrophages and 
      neutrophils are major cellular components of innate immunity and contribute not
      only to O2 deprivation at the site of inflammation, but also alter many of their 
      functions in response to hypoxia to either facilitate or suppress inflammation.
      Hypoxia stabilizes HIF-alphas in macrophages and neutrophils, and these
      O2-sensitive transcription factors are key regulators of inflammatory responses
      in myeloid cells. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding of 
      the role of HIF-alphas in shaping macrophage and neutrophil functions in the
      pathogenesis and progression of multiple inflammatory diseases.

      translation.
PG  - 3739-3757

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) includes basal-like and claudin-low subtypes
      for which no specific treatment is currently available. Although the
      retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene (RB1) is frequently lost together with TP53 
      in TNBC, it is not directly targetable. There is thus great interest in
      identifying vulnerabilities downstream of RB1 that can be therapeutically
      exploited. Here, we determined that combined inactivation of murine Rb and p53 in
      diverse mammary epithelial cells induced claudin-low-like TNBC with Met,
      Birc2/3-Mmp13-Yap1, and Pvt1-Myc amplifications. Gene set enrichment analysis
      revealed that Rb/p53-deficient tumors showed elevated expression of the
      mitochondrial protein translation (MPT) gene pathway relative to tumors harboring
      p53 deletion alone. Accordingly, bioinformatic, functional, and biochemical
      analyses showed that RB1-E2F complexes bind to MPT gene promoters to regulate
      transcription and control MPT. Additionally, a screen of US Food and Drug
      Administration-approved (FDA-approved) drugs identified the MPT antagonist
      tigecycline (TIG) as a potent inhibitor of Rb/p53-deficient tumor cell
      proliferation. TIG preferentially suppressed RB1-deficient TNBC cell
      proliferation, targeted both the bulk and cancer stem cell fraction, and strongly
      attenuated xenograft growth. It also cooperated with sulfasalazine, an
      FDA-approved inhibitor of cystine xCT antiporter, in culture and xenograft
      assays. Our results suggest that RB1 deficiency promotes cancer cell
      proliferation in part by enhancing mitochondrial function and identify TIG as a
      clinically approved drug for RB1-deficient TNBC.

LID - 10.1172/JCI86923 [doi]
AB  - NK cells are innate lymphocytes with protective functions against viral
      infections and tumor formation. Human NK cells carry inhibitory killer cell
      Ig-like receptors (KIRs), which recognize distinct HLAs. NK cells with KIRs for
      self-HLA molecules acquire superior cytotoxicity against HLA- tumor cells during 
      education for improved missing-self recognition. Here, we reconstituted mice with
      human hematopoietic cells from donors with homozygous KIR ligands or with a mix
      of hematopoietic cells from these homozygous donors, allowing assessment of the
      resulting KIR repertoire and NK cell education. We found that co-reconstitution
      with 2 KIR ligand-mismatched compartments did not alter the frequency of
      KIR-expressing NK cells. However, NK cell education was diminished in mice
      reconstituted with parallel HLA compartments due to a lack of cognate HLA
      molecules on leukocytes for the corresponding KIRs. This change in NK cell
      education in mixed human donor-reconstituted mice improved NK cell-mediated
      immune control of EBV infection, indicating that mixed hematopoietic cell
      populations could be exploited to improve NK cell reactivity against leukotropic 
      pathogens. Taken together, these findings indicate that leukocytes lacking
      cognate HLA ligands can disarm KIR+ NK cells in a manner that may decrease HLA-
      tumor cell recognition but allows for improved NK cell-mediated immune control of
      a human gamma-herpesvirus.

PG  - 3699-3707

LID - 10.1172/JCI84431 [doi]
AB  - HIF1alpha is a common component of pathways involved in the control of cellular
      metabolism and has a role in regulating immune cell effector functions.
      Additionally, HIF1alpha is critical for the maturation of dendritic cells and for
      the activation of T cells. HIF1alpha is induced in LPS-activated macrophages,
      where it is critically involved in glycolysis and the induction of
      proinflammatory genes, notably Il1b. The mechanism of LPS-stimulated HIF1alpha
      induction involves succinate, which inhibits prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Pyruvate
      kinase M2 (PKM2) is also induced and interacts with and promotes the function of 
      HIF1alpha. In another critical inflammatory cell type, Th17 cells, HIF1alpha acts
      via the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gammat (RORgammat) to drive Th17
      differentiation. HIF1alpha is therefore a key reprogrammer of metabolism in
      inflammatory cells that promotes inflammatory gene expression.

AB  - Potent CD19-directed immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells
      (CART) and blinatumomab, have drastically changed the outcome of patients with
      relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However,
      CD19-negative relapses have emerged as a major problem that is observed in
      approximately 30% of treated patients. Developing approaches to preventing and
      treating antigen-loss escapes would therefore represent a vertical advance in the
      field. Here, we found that in primary patient samples, the IL-3 receptor alpha
      chain CD123 was highly expressed on leukemia-initiating cells and CD19-negative
      blasts in bulk B-ALL at baseline and at relapse after CART19 administration.
      Using intravital imaging in an antigen-loss CD19-negative relapse xenograft
      model, we determined that CART123, but not CART19, recognized leukemic blasts,
      established protracted synapses, and eradicated CD19-negative leukemia, leading
      to prolonged survival. Furthermore, combining CART19 and CART123 prevented
      antigen-loss relapses in xenograft models. Finally, we devised a dual
      CAR-expressing construct that combined CD19- and CD123-mediated T cell activation
      and demonstrated that it provides superior in vivo activity against B-ALL
      compared with single-expressing CART or pooled combination CART. In conclusion,
      these findings indicate that targeting CD19 and CD123 on leukemic blasts
      represents an effective strategy for treating and preventing antigen-loss
      relapses occurring after CD19-directed therapies.

AB  - Studies of the genetic factors associated with human autoimmune disease suggest a
      multigenic origin of susceptibility; however, how these factors interact and
      through which tolerance pathways they operate generally remain to be defined. One
      key checkpoint occurs through the activity of the autoimmune regulator AIRE,
      which promotes central T cell tolerance. Recent reports have described a variety 
      of dominant-negative AIRE mutations that likely contribute to human autoimmunity 
      to a greater extent than previously thought. In families with these mutations,
      the penetrance of autoimmunity is incomplete, suggesting that other checkpoints
      play a role in preventing autoimmunity. Here, we tested whether a defect in LYN, 
      an inhibitory protein tyrosine kinase that is implicated in systemic
      autoimmunity, could combine with an Aire mutation to provoke organ-specific
      autoimmunity. Indeed, mice with a dominant-negative allele of Aire and deficiency
      in LYN spontaneously developed organ-specific autoimmunity in the eye. We further
      determined that a small pool of retinal protein-specific T cells escaped thymic
      deletion as a result of the hypomorphic Aire function and that these cells also
      escaped peripheral tolerance in the presence of LYN-deficient dendritic cells,
      leading to highly destructive autoimmune attack. These findings demonstrate how 2
      distinct tolerance pathways can synergize to unleash autoimmunity and have
      implications for the genetic susceptibility of autoimmune disease.

AB  - Radiotherapy is an effective treatment strategy for cancer, but a significant
      proportion of patients experience radiation-induced toxicity due to damage to
      normal tissue in the irradiation field. The use of chemical or biological
      approaches aimed at reducing or preventing normal tissue toxicity induced by
      radiotherapy is a long-held goal. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) regulate the
      production of factors that may protect several cellular compartments affected by 
      radiation-induced toxicity. Pharmacological inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylase
      domain-containing enzymes (PHDs), which result in stabilization of HIFs, have
      recently been proposed as a new class of radioprotectors. In this review,
      radiation-induced toxicity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the main
      cellular compartments studied in this context will be discussed. The effects of
      PHD inhibition on GI radioprotection will be described in detail.

AB  - The tumor immune response is in a dynamic balance between antitumor mechanisms,
      which serve to decrease cancer growth, and the protumor inflammatory response,
      which increases immune tolerance, cell survival, and proliferation. Hypoxia and
      expression of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are characteristic features of all solid 
      tumors. HIF signaling serves as a major adaptive mechanism in tumor growth in a
      hypoxic microenvironment. HIFs represent a critical signaling node in the switch 
      to protumorigenic inflammatory responses through recruitment of protumor immune
      cells and altered immune cell effector functions to suppress antitumor immune
      responses and promote tumor growth through direct growth-promoting cytokine
      production, angiogenesis, and ROS production. Modulating HIF function will be an 
      important mechanism to dampen the tumor-promoting inflammatory response and
      inhibit cancer growth.

LID - 10.1172/JCI84429 [doi]
AB  - Mucosal surfaces are lined by epithelial cells and provide an important barrier
      to the flux of antigens from the outside. This barrier is provided at a number of
      levels, including epithelial junctional complexes, mucus production, and
      mucosa-derived antimicrobials. Tissue metabolism is central to the maintenance of
      homeostasis in the mucosa. In the intestine, for example, baseline pO2 levels are
      uniquely low due to counter-current blood flow and the presence of large numbers 
      of bacteria. As such, hypoxia and HIF signaling predominates normal intestinal
      metabolism and barrier regulation during both homeostasis and active
      inflammation. Contributing factors that elicit important adaptive responses
      within the mucosa include the transcriptional regulation of tight junction
      proteins, metabolic regulation of barrier components, and changes in autophagic
      flux. Here, we review recent literature around the topic of hypoxia and barrier
      function in health and during disease.

AB  - The role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in cancer is often correlated
      with poor prognosis, even though this statement should be interpreted with care, 
      as the effects of macrophages primarily depend on their localization within the
      tumor. This versatile cell type orchestrates a broad spectrum of biological
      functions and exerts very complex and even opposing functions on cell death,
      immune stimulation or suppression, and angiogenesis, resulting in an overall pro-
      or antitumoral effect. We are only beginning to understand the environmental cues
      that contribute to transient retention of macrophages in a specific phenotype. It
      has become clear that hypoxia shapes and induces specific macrophage phenotypes
      that serve tumor malignancy, as hypoxia promotes immune evasion, angiogenesis,
      tumor cell survival, and metastatic dissemination. Additionally, TAMs in the
      hypoxic niches within the tumor are known to mediate resistance to several
      anticancer treatments and to promote cancer relapse. Thus, a careful
      characterization and understanding of this macrophage differentiation state is
      needed in order to efficiently tailor cancer therapy.

AB  - Uncontrolled inflammation underpins a diverse range of diseases where effective
      therapy remains an unmet clinical need. Hypoxia is a prominent feature of the
      inflammatory microenvironment that regulates key transcription factors including 
      HIF and NF-kappaB in both innate and adaptive immune cells. In turn, altered
      activity of the pathways controlled by these factors can affect the course of
      inflammation through the regulation of immune cell development and function. In
      this review, we will discuss these pathways and the oxygen sensors that confer
      hypoxic sensitivity in immune cells. Furthermore, we will describe how
      hypoxia-dependent pathways contribute to immunity and discuss their potential as 
      therapeutic targets in inflammatory and infectious disease.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the noncellular component critical in the
      maintenance of organ structure and the regulation of tissue development, organ
      structure, and cellular signaling. The ECM is a dynamic entity that undergoes
      continuous degradation and resynthesis. In addition to compromising structure,
      degradation of the ECM can liberate bioactive fragments that cause cellular
      activation and chemotaxis of a variety of cells. These fragments are termed
      matrikines, and their cellular activities are sentinel in the development and
      progression of tissue injury seen in chronic lung disease. Here, we discuss the
      matrikines that are known to be active in lung biology and their roles in lung
      disease. We also consider the use of matrikines as disease markers and potential 
      therapeutic targets in lung disease.

AB  - Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8, 
      is the etiologic agent underlying Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and 
      multicentric Castleman's disease. This human gammaherpesvirus was discovered in
      1994 by Drs. Yuan Chang and Patrick Moore. Today, there are over five thousand
      publications on KSHV and its associated malignancies. In this article, we review 
      recent and ongoing developments in the KSHV field, including molecular mechanisms
      of KSHV pathogenesis, clinical aspects of KSHV-associated diseases, and current
      treatments for cancers associated with this virus.

TI  - Tie1 controls angiopoietin function in vascular remodeling and inflammation.
PG  - 3495-510

LID - 84923 [pii]
AB  - The angiopoietin/Tie (ANG/Tie) receptor system controls developmental and tumor
      angiogenesis, inflammatory vascular remodeling, and vessel leakage. ANG1 is a
      Tie2 agonist that promotes vascular stabilization in inflammation and sepsis,
      whereas ANG2 is a context-dependent Tie2 agonist or antagonist. A limited
      understanding of ANG signaling mechanisms and the orphan receptor Tie1 has
      hindered development of ANG/Tie-targeted therapeutics. Here, we determined that
      both ANG1 and ANG2 binding to Tie2 increases Tie1-Tie2 interactions in a beta1
      integrin-dependent manner and that Tie1 regulates ANG-induced Tie2 trafficking in
      endothelial cells. Endothelial Tie1 was essential for the agonist activity of
      ANG1 and autocrine ANG2. Deletion of endothelial Tie1 in mice reduced Tie2
      phosphorylation and downstream Akt activation, increased FOXO1 nuclear
      localization and transcriptional activation, and prevented ANG1- and ANG2-induced
      capillary-to-venous remodeling. However, in acute endotoxemia, the Tie1
      ectodomain that is responsible for interaction with Tie2 was rapidly cleaved,
      ANG1 agonist activity was decreased, and autocrine ANG2 agonist activity was
      lost, which led to suppression of Tie2 signaling. Tie1 cleavage also occurred in 
      patients with hantavirus infection. These results support a model in which Tie1
      directly interacts with Tie2 to promote ANG-induced vascular responses under
      noninflammatory conditions, whereas in inflammation, Tie1 cleavage contributes to
      loss of ANG2 agonist activity and vascular stability.

PG  - 3511-25

LID - 84871 [pii]
AB  - Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) regulates blood vessel remodeling in many pathological
      conditions through differential effects on Tie2 signaling. While ANG2 competes
      with ANG1 to inhibit Tie2, it can paradoxically also promote Tie2 phosphorylation
      (p-Tie2). A related paradox is that both inactivation and overactivation of Tie2 
      can result in vascular remodeling. Here, we reconciled these opposing actions of 
      ANG2 by manipulating conditions that govern its actions in the vasculature. ANG2 
      drove vascular remodeling during Mycoplasma pulmonis infection by acting as a
      Tie2 antagonist, which led to p-Tie2 suppression, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)
      activation, increased ANG2 expression, and vessel leakiness. These changes were
      exaggerated by anti-Tie2 antibody, inhibition of PI3K signaling, or ANG2
      overexpression and were reduced by anti-ANG2 antibody or exogenous ANG1. In
      contrast, under pathogen-free conditions, ANG2 drove vascular remodeling by
      acting as an agonist, promoting high p-Tie2, low FOXO1 activation, and no
      leakage. Tie1 activation was strong under pathogen-free conditions, but infection
      or TNF-alpha led to Tie1 inactivation by ectodomain cleavage and promoted the
      Tie2 antagonist action of ANG2. Together, these data indicate that ANG2
      activation of Tie2 supports stable enlargement of normal nonleaky vessels, but
      reduction of Tie1 in inflammation leads to ANG2 antagonism of Tie2 and initiates 
      a positive feedback loop wherein FOXO1-driven ANG2 expression promotes vascular
      remodeling and leakage.

LID - 86841 [pii]
AB  - Myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a devastating pediatric neuromuscular disorder of
      phosphoinositide (PIP) metabolism resulting from mutations of the PIP phosphatase
      MTM1 for which there are no treatments. We have previously shown
      phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) accumulation in animal models of MTM.
      Here, we tested the hypothesis that lowering PI3P levels may prevent or reverse
      the MTM disease process. To test this, we targeted class II and III PI3 kinases
      (PI3Ks) in an MTM1-deficient mouse model. Muscle-specific ablation of Pik3c2b,
      but not Pik3c3, resulted in complete prevention of the MTM phenotype, and
      postsymptomatic targeting promoted a striking rescue of disease. We confirmed
      this genetic interaction in zebrafish, and additionally showed that certain PI3K 
      inhibitors prevented development of the zebrafish mtm phenotype. Finally, the
      PI3K inhibitor wortmannin improved motor function and prolonged lifespan of the
      Mtm1-deficient mice. In all, we have identified Pik3c2b as a genetic modifier of 
      Mtm1 mutation and demonstrated that PIK3C2B inhibition is a potential treatment
      strategy for MTM. In addition, we set the groundwork for similar reciprocal
      inhibition approaches for treating other PIP metabolic disorders and highlight
      the importance of modifier gene pathways as therapeutic targets.

TI  - BET bromodomain inhibition enhances T cell persistence and function in adoptive
      immunotherapy models.
PG  - 3479-94
LID - 10.1172/JCI86437 [doi]
LID - 86437 [pii]
AB  - Adoptive immunotherapy is a potentially curative therapeutic approach for
      patients with advanced cancer. However, the in vitro expansion of antitumor T
      cells prior to infusion inevitably incurs differentiation towards effector T
      cells and impairs persistence following adoptive transfer. Epigenetic profiles
      regulate gene expression of key transcription factors over the course of immune
      cell differentiation, proliferation, and function. Using comprehensive screening 
      of chemical probes with defined epigenetic targets, we found that JQ1, an
      inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) proteins, maintained CD8+
      T cells with functional properties of stem cell-like and central memory T cells. 
      Mechanistically, the BET protein BRD4 directly regulated expression of the
      transcription factor BATF in CD8+ T cells, which was associated with
      differentiation of T cells into an effector memory phenotype. JQ1-treated T cells
      showed enhanced persistence and antitumor effects in murine T cell receptor and
      chimeric antigen receptor gene therapy models. Furthermore, we found that histone
      acetyltransferase p300 supported the recruitment of BRD4 to the BATF promoter
      region, and p300 inhibition similarly augmented antitumor effects of the
      adoptively transferred T cells. These results demonstrate that targeting the
      BRD4-p300 signaling cascade supports the generation of superior antitumor T cell 
      grafts for adoptive immunotherapy.

TI  - Tie1: an orphan receptor provides context for angiopoietin-2/Tie2 signaling.
PG  - 3188-91
LID - 10.1172/JCI89963 [doi]
LID - 89963 [pii]
AB  - Angiopoietin-1/Tie2 (ANG1/Tie2) signaling is well documented as regulating
      angiogenesis and vessel maturation. This pathway is complicated by involvement of
      the orphan receptor Tie1, which has been implicated as both a positive and
      negative regulator of ANG1/Tie2 signaling, and ANG2, which can serve as both a
      Tie2 agonist and antagonist, depending on the context. Two papers in this issue
      of the JCI provide new insight into this complicated pathway. Korhonen et al.
      reveal that Tie1 acts to modulate the effects of ANG1 and ANG2 on Tie2 in vitro
      and in vivo. Kim et al. demonstrate that ANG2 acts as a Tie2 agonist in
      non-pathological conditions, whereas in the setting of inflammation, ANG2
      functions as a Tie2 antagonist and promotes vascular dysfunction. Both studies
      indicate that inflammation promotes cleavage of the ectodomain of Tie1 and that
      this cleavage event corresponds with the switch of ANG2 from a Tie2 agonist to an
      antagonist. The results of these studies lay the groundwork for future strategies
      to therapeutically exploit this pathway in diseases characterized by adverse
      vascular remodeling and increased permeability.

LID - 89768 [pii]
AB  - Eosinophils are classically known as proinflammatory cells, as they are equipped 
      with a variety of preformed cytotoxic mediators and have been shown to
      definitively contribute to asthma. The connection between eosinophils and asthma 
      development has led to a new class of asthma therapeutics based on blocking
      eosinophils with humanized antibodies that neutralize IL-5, a potent eosinophil
      growth, activation, and survival factor. Yet, recent studies have led to an
      increasing appreciation that eosinophils have a variety of homeostatic functions,
      including immunomodulation. In this issue of the JCI, Mesnil et al. identify a
      notable population of lung-resident eosinophils and demonstrate that, compared
      with traditional eosinophils, these cells have distinct characteristics,
      including nuclear structure, surface markers, IL-5 independence, and
      immunoregulatory function that is capable of polarizing adaptive immune
      responses, at least in vitro. Thus, these results reinforce a key homeostatic
      role for this enigmatic cell population, particularly in residing and regulating 
      immunity in the lung.

TI  - beta1-Adrenergic receptor deficiency in ghrelin-expressing cells causes
      hypoglycemia in susceptible individuals.
PG  - 3467-78
LID - 10.1172/JCI86270 [doi]
LID - 86270 [pii]
AB  - Ghrelin is an orexigenic gastric peptide hormone secreted when caloric intake is 
      limited. Ghrelin also regulates blood glucose, as emphasized by the hypoglycemia 
      that is induced by caloric restriction in mouse models of deficient ghrelin
      signaling. Here, we hypothesized that activation of beta1-adrenergic receptors
      (beta1ARs) localized to ghrelin cells is required for caloric
      restriction-associated ghrelin release and the ensuing protective glucoregulatory
      response. In mice lacking the beta1AR specifically in ghrelin-expressing cells,
      ghrelin secretion was markedly blunted, resulting in profound hypoglycemia and
      prevalent mortality upon severe caloric restriction. Replacement of ghrelin
      blocked the effects of caloric restriction in beta1AR-deficient mice. We also
      determined that treating calorically restricted juvenile WT mice with beta
      blockers led to reduced plasma ghrelin and hypoglycemia, the latter of which is
      similar to the life-threatening, fasting-induced hypoglycemia observed in infants
      treated with beta blockers. These findings highlight the critical functions of
      ghrelin in preventing hypoglycemia and promoting survival during severe caloric
      restriction and the requirement for ghrelin cell-expressed beta1ARs in these
      processes. Moreover, these results indicate a potential role for ghrelin in
      mediating beta blocker-associated hypoglycemia in susceptible individuals, such
      as young children.

TI  - A liver stress-endocrine nexus promotes metabolic integrity during dietary
      protein dilution.
PG  - 3263-78
LID - 10.1172/JCI85946 [doi]
LID - 85946 [pii]
AB  - Dietary protein intake is linked to an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes
      (T2D). Although dietary protein dilution (DPD) can slow the progression of some
      aging-related disorders, whether this strategy affects the development and risk
      for obesity-associated metabolic disease such as T2D is unclear. Here, we
      determined that DPD in mice and humans increases serum markers of metabolic
      health. In lean mice, DPD promoted metabolic inefficiency by increasing
      carbohydrate and fat oxidation. In nutritional and polygenic murine models of
      obesity, DPD prevented and curtailed the development of impaired glucose
      homeostasis independently of obesity and food intake. DPD-mediated metabolic
      inefficiency and improvement of glucose homeostasis were independent of
      uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), but required expression of liver-derived fibroblast 
      growth factor 21 (FGF21) in both lean and obese mice. FGF21 expression and
      secretion as well as the associated metabolic remodeling induced by DPD also
      required induction of liver-integrated stress response-driven nuclear protein 1
      (NUPR1). Insufficiency of select nonessential amino acids (NEAAs) was necessary
      and adequate for NUPR1 and subsequent FGF21 induction and secretion in
      hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that DPD
      promotes improved glucose homeostasis through an NEAA insufficiency-induced liver
      NUPR1/FGF21 axis.

AB  - Dysregulation of vascular stiffness and cellular metabolism occurs early in
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, the mechanisms by which biophysical
      properties of the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) relate to metabolic
      processes important in PH remain undefined. In this work, we examined cultured
      pulmonary vascular cells and various types of PH-diseased lung tissue and
      determined that ECM stiffening resulted in mechanoactivation of the
      transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (WWTR1). YAP/TAZ activation modulated
      metabolic enzymes, including glutaminase (GLS1), to coordinate glutaminolysis and
      glycolysis. Glutaminolysis, an anaplerotic pathway, replenished aspartate for
      anabolic biosynthesis, which was critical for sustaining proliferation and
      migration within stiff ECM. In vitro, GLS1 inhibition blocked aspartate
      production and reprogrammed cellular proliferation pathways, while application of
      aspartate restored proliferation. In the monocrotaline rat model of PH,
      pharmacologic modulation of pulmonary vascular stiffness and YAP-dependent
      mechanotransduction altered glutaminolysis, pulmonary vascular proliferation, and
      manifestations of PH. Additionally, pharmacologic targeting of GLS1 in this model
      ameliorated disease progression. Notably, evaluation of simian immunodeficiency
      virus-infected nonhuman primates and HIV-infected subjects revealed a correlation
      between YAP/TAZ-GLS activation and PH. These results indicate that ECM stiffening
      sustains vascular cell growth and migration through YAP/TAZ-dependent
      glutaminolysis and anaplerosis, and thereby link mechanical stimuli to
      dysregulated vascular metabolism. Furthermore, this study identifies potential
      metabolic drug targets for therapeutic development in PH.

TI  - Lung-resident eosinophils represent a distinct regulatory eosinophil subset.
PG  - 3279-95
LID - 10.1172/JCI85664 [doi]
LID - 85664 [pii]
AB  - Increases in eosinophil numbers are associated with infection and allergic
      diseases, including asthma, but there is also evidence that eosinophils
      contribute to homeostatic immune processes. In mice, the normal lung contains
      resident eosinophils (rEos), but their function has not been characterized. Here,
      we have reported that steady-state pulmonary rEos are IL-5-independent
      parenchymal Siglec-FintCD62L+CD101lo cells with a ring-shaped nucleus. During
      house dust mite-induced airway allergy, rEos features remained unchanged, and
      rEos were accompanied by recruited inflammatory eosinophils (iEos), which were
      defined as IL-5-dependent peribronchial Siglec-FhiCD62L-CD101hi cells with a
      segmented nucleus. Gene expression analyses revealed a more regulatory profile
      for rEos than for iEos, and correspondingly, mice lacking lung rEos showed an
      increase in Th2 cell responses to inhaled allergens. Such elevation of Th2
      responses was linked to the ability of rEos, but not iEos, to inhibit the
      maturation, and therefore the pro-Th2 function, of allergen-loaded DCs. Finally, 
      we determined that the parenchymal rEos found in nonasthmatic human lungs
      (Siglec-8+CD62L+IL-3Rlo cells) were phenotypically distinct from the iEos
      isolated from the sputa of eosinophilic asthmatic patients
      (Siglec-8+CD62LloIL-3Rhi cells), suggesting that our findings in mice are
      relevant to humans. In conclusion, our data define lung rEos as a distinct
      eosinophil subset with key homeostatic functions.

TI  - Calpain-6 confers atherogenicity to macrophages by dysregulating pre-mRNA
      splicing.
PG  - 3417-32
LID - 10.1172/JCI85880 [doi]
LID - 85880 [pii]
AB  - Macrophages contribute to the development of atherosclerosis through pinocytotic 
      deposition of native LDL-derived cholesterol in macrophages in the vascular wall.
      Inhibiting macrophage-mediated lipid deposition may have protective effects in
      atheroprone vasculature, and identifying mechanisms that potentiate this process 
      may inform potential therapeutic interventions for atherosclerosis. Here, we
      report that dysregulation of exon junction complex-driven (EJC-driven) mRNA
      splicing confers hyperpinocytosis to macrophages during atherogenesis.
      Mechanistically, we determined that inflammatory cytokines induce an
      unconventional nonproteolytic calpain, calpain-6 (CAPN6), which associates with
      the essential EJC-loading factor CWC22 in the cytoplasm. This association
      disturbs the nuclear localization of CWC22, thereby suppressing the splicing of
      target genes, including those related to Rac1 signaling. CAPN6 deficiency in LDL 
      receptor-deficient mice restored CWC22/EJC/Rac1 signaling, reduced pinocytotic
      deposition of native LDL in macrophages, and attenuated macrophage recruitment
      into the lesions, generating an atheroprotective phenotype in the aorta. In
      macrophages, the induction of CAPN6 in the atheroma interior limited macrophage
      movements, resulting in a decline in cell clearance from the lesions. Consistent 
      with this finding, we observed that myeloid CAPN6 contributed to atherogenesis in
      a murine model of bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, macrophages from
      advanced human atheromas exhibited increased CAPN6 induction and impaired CWC22
      nuclear localization. Together, these results indicate that CAPN6 promotes
      atherogenicity in inflamed macrophages by disturbing CWC22/EJC systems.

TI  - Insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulate FoxO-mediated signaling in muscle
      proteostasis.
PG  - 3433-46
LID - 10.1172/JCI86522 [doi]
LID - 86522 [pii]
AB  - Diabetes strongly impacts protein metabolism, particularly in skeletal muscle.
      Insulin and IGF-1 enhance muscle protein synthesis through their receptors, but
      the relative roles of each in muscle proteostasis have not been fully elucidated.
      Using mice with muscle-specific deletion of the insulin receptor (M-IR-/- mice), 
      the IGF-1 receptor (M-IGF1R-/- mice), or both (MIGIRKO mice), we assessed the
      relative contributions of IR and IGF1R signaling to muscle proteostasis. In
      differentiated muscle, IR expression predominated over IGF1R expression, and
      correspondingly, M-IR-/- mice displayed a moderate reduction in muscle mass
      whereas M-IGF1R-/- mice did not. However, these receptors serve complementary
      roles, such that double-knockout MIGIRKO mice displayed a marked reduction in
      muscle mass that was linked to increases in proteasomal and autophagy-lysosomal
      degradation, accompanied by a high-protein-turnover state. Combined
      muscle-specific deletion of FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 in MIGIRKO mice reversed
      increased autophagy and completely rescued muscle mass without changing
      proteasomal activity. These data indicate that signaling via IR is more important
      than IGF1R in controlling proteostasis in differentiated muscle. Nonetheless, the
      overlap of IR and IGF1R signaling is critical to the regulation of muscle protein
      turnover, and this regulation depends on suppression of FoxO-regulated,
      autophagy-mediated protein degradation.

TI  - Serine 421 regulates mutant huntingtin toxicity and clearance in mice.
PG  - 3585-97
LID - 10.1172/JCI80339 [doi]
LID - 80339 [pii]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease
      caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the N-terminal region of the
      protein huntingtin (HTT). There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies for
      HD. HTT has a highly conserved Akt phosphorylation site at serine 421, and prior 
      work in HD models found that phosphorylation at S421 (S421-P) diminishes the
      toxicity of mutant HTT (mHTT) fragments in neuronal cultures. However, whether
      S421-P affects the toxicity of mHTT in vivo remains unknown. In this work, we
      used murine models to investigate the role of S421-P in HTT-induced
      neurodegeneration. Specifically, we mutated the human mHTT gene within a BAC to
      express either an aspartic acid or an alanine at position 421, mimicking tonic
      phosphorylation (mHTT-S421D mice) or preventing phosphorylation (mHTT-S421A
      mice), respectively. Mimicking HTT phosphorylation strongly ameliorated
      mHTT-induced behavioral dysfunction and striatal neurodegeneration, whereas
      neuronal dysfunction persisted when S421 phosphorylation was blocked. We found
      that S421 phosphorylation mitigates neurodegeneration by increasing
      proteasome-dependent turnover of mHTT and reducing the presence of a toxic mHTT
      conformer. These data indicate that S421 is a potent modifier of mHTT toxicity
      and offer in vivo validation for S421 as a therapeutic target in HD.

TI  - Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor induces CCL17 production via
      IRF4 to mediate inflammation.
PG  - 3453-66
LID - 10.1172/JCI87828 [doi]
LID - 87828 [pii]
AB  - Data from preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that granulocyte
      macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can function as a key
      proinflammatory cytokine. However, therapies that directly target GM-CSF function
      could lead to undesirable side effects, creating a need to delineate downstream
      pathways and mediators. In this work, we provide evidence that GM-CSF drives
      CCL17 production by acting through an IFN regulatory factor 4-dependent
      (IRF4-dependent) pathway in human monocytes, murine macrophages, and mice in
      vivo. In murine models of arthritis and pain, IRF4 regulated the formation of
      CCL17, which mediated the proinflammatory and algesic actions of GM-CSF.
      Mechanistically, GM-CSF upregulated IRF4 expression by enhancing JMJD3
      demethylase activity. We also determined that CCL17 has chemokine-independent
      functions in inflammatory arthritis and pain. These findings indicate that GM-CSF
      can mediate inflammation and pain by regulating IRF4-induced CCL17 production,
      providing insights into a pathway with potential therapeutic avenues for the
      treatment of inflammatory diseases and their associated pain.

TI  - Lymphatic vessels regulate immune microenvironments in human and murine melanoma.
PG  - 3389-402
LID - 10.1172/JCI79434 [doi]
LID - 79434 [pii]
AB  - Lymphatic remodeling in tumor microenvironments correlates with progression and
      metastasis, and local lymphatic vessels play complex and poorly understood roles 
      in tumor immunity. Tumor lymphangiogenesis is associated with increased immune
      suppression, yet lymphatic vessels are required for fluid drainage and immune
      cell trafficking to lymph nodes, where adaptive immune responses are mounted.
      Here, we examined the contribution of lymphatic drainage to tumor inflammation
      and immunity using a mouse model that lacks dermal lymphatic vessels
      (K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice). Melanomas implanted in these mice grew robustly, but
      exhibited drastically reduced cytokine expression and leukocyte infiltration
      compared with those implanted in control animals. In the absence of local immune 
      suppression, transferred cytotoxic T cells more effectively controlled tumors in 
      K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice than in control mice. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of
      human melanoma samples revealed that patient immune parameters are markedly
      stratified by levels of lymphatic markers. This work suggests that the
      establishment of tumor-associated inflammation and immunity critically depends on
      lymphatic vessel remodeling and drainage. Moreover, these results have
      implications for immunotherapies, the efficacies of which are regulated by the
      tumor immune microenvironment.

TI  - Tyrosine kinase FYN negatively regulates NOX4 in cardiac remodeling.
PG  - 3403-16
LID - 10.1172/JCI85624 [doi]
LID - 85624 [pii]
AB  - NADPH oxidases (Noxes) produce ROS that regulate cell growth and death. NOX4
      expression in cardiomyocytes (CMs) plays an important role in cardiac remodeling 
      and injury, but the posttranslational mechanisms that modulate this enzyme are
      poorly understood. Here, we determined that FYN, a Src family tyrosine kinase,
      interacts with the C-terminal domain of NOX4. FYN and NOX4 colocalized in
      perinuclear mitochondria, ER, and nuclear fractions in CMs, and FYN expression
      negatively regulated NOX4-induced O2- production and apoptosis in CMs.
      Mechanistically, we found that direct phosphorylation of tyrosine 566 on NOX4 was
      critical for this FYN-mediated negative regulation. Transverse aortic
      constriction activated FYN in the left ventricle (LV), and FYN-deficient mice
      displayed exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction and increased ROS
      production and apoptosis. Deletion of Nox4 rescued the exaggerated LV remodeling 
      in FYN-deficient mice. Furthermore, FYN expression was markedly decreased in
      failing human hearts, corroborating its role as a regulator of cardiac cell death
      and ROS production. In conclusion, FYN is activated by oxidative stress and
      serves as a negative feedback regulator of NOX4 in CMs during cardiac remodeling.

TI  - Urea impairs beta cell glycolysis and insulin secretion in chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - 3598-612
LID - 10.1172/JCI86181 [doi]
LID - 86181 [pii]
AB  - Disorders of glucose homeostasis are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
      are associated with increased mortality, but the mechanisms of impaired insulin
      secretion in this disease remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
      defective insulin secretion in CKD is caused by a direct effect of urea on
      pancreatic beta cells. In a murine model in which CKD is induced by 5/6
      nephrectomy (CKD mice), we observed defects in glucose-stimulated insulin
      secretion in vivo and in isolated islets. Similarly, insulin secretion was
      impaired in normal mouse and human islets that were cultured with
      disease-relevant concentrations of urea and in islets from normal mice treated
      orally with urea for 3 weeks. In CKD mouse islets as well as urea-exposed normal 
      islets, we observed an increase in oxidative stress and protein O-GlcNAcylation. 
      Protein O-GlcNAcylation was also observed in pancreatic sections from CKD
      patients. Impairment of insulin secretion in both CKD mouse and urea-exposed
      islets was associated with reduced glucose utilization and activity of
      phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1), which could be reversed by inhibiting
      O-GlcNAcylation. Inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation also restored insulin secretion in
      both mouse models. These results suggest that insulin secretory defects
      associated with CKD arise from elevated circulating levels of urea that increase 
      islet protein O-GlcNAcylation and impair glycolysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade is revolutionizing therapy for advanced
      cancer, but many patients do not respond to treatment. The identification of
      robust biomarkers that predict clinical response to specific checkpoint
      inhibitors is critical in order to stratify patients and to rationally select
      combinations in the context of an expanding array of therapeutic options.
      METHODS: We performed multiparameter flow cytometry on freshly isolated
      metastatic melanoma samples from 2 cohorts of 20 patients each prior to treatment
      and correlated the subsequent clinical response with the tumor immune phenotype. 
      RESULTS: Increasing fractions of programmed cell death 1 high/cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte-associated protein 4 high (PD-1hiCTLA-4hi) cells within the
      tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cell subset strongly correlated with response to
      therapy (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Functional analysis of these
      cells revealed a partially exhausted T cell phenotype. Assessment of metastatic
      lesions during anti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated a release of T cell exhaustion, as 
      measured by an accumulation of highly activated CD8+ T cells within tumors, with 
      no effect on Tregs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the relative abundance of 
      partially exhausted tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells predicts response to
      anti-PD-1 therapy. This information can be used to appropriately select patients 
      with a high likelihood of achieving a clinical response to PD-1 pathway
      inhibition. FUNDING: This work was funded by a generous gift provided by
      Inga-Lill and David Amoroso as well as a generous gift provided by Stephen

TI  - A colitogenic memory CD4+ T cell population mediates gastrointestinal
      graft-versus-host disease.
PG  - 3541-55
LID - 10.1172/JCI80874 [doi]
LID - 80874 [pii]
AB  - Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is a major cause of morbidity and mortality 
      in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is attributable to T cell-mediated
      inflammation. In this work, we identified a unique CD4+ T cell population that
      constitutively expresses the beta2 integrin CD11c and displays a biased central
      memory phenotype and memory T cell transcriptional profile, innate-like
      properties, and increased expression of the gut-homing molecules alpha4beta7 and 
      CCR9. Using several complementary murine GVHD models, we determined that adoptive
      transfer and early accumulation of beta2 integrin-expressing CD4+ T cells in the 
      gastrointestinal tract initiated Th1-mediated proinflammatory cytokine
      production, augmented pathological damage in the colon, and increased mortality. 
      The pathogenic effect of this CD4+ T cell population critically depended on
      coexpression of the IL-23 receptor, which was required for maximal inflammatory
      effects. Non-Foxp3-expressing CD4+ T cells produced IL-10, which regulated
      colonic inflammation and attenuated lethality in the absence of functional
      CD4+Foxp3+ T cells. Thus, the coordinate expression of CD11c and the IL-23
      receptor defines an IL-10-regulated, colitogenic memory CD4+ T cell subset that
      is poised to initiate inflammation when there is loss of tolerance and breakdown 
      of mucosal barriers.

TI  - BRPF1 is essential for development of fetal hematopoietic stem cells.
PG  - 3247-62
LID - 10.1172/JCI80711 [doi]
LID - 80711 [pii]
AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) serve as a life-long reservoir for all blood cell
      types and are clinically useful for a variety of HSC transplantation-based
      therapies. Understanding the role of chromatin organization and regulation in HSC
      homeostasis may provide important insights into HSC development. Bromodomain- and
      PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multivalent chromatin regulator that
      possesses 4 nucleosome-binding domains and activates 3 lysine acetyltransferases 
      (KAT6A, KAT6B, and KAT7), suggesting that this protein has the potential to
      stimulate crosstalk between different chromatin modifications. Here, we
      investigated the function of BRPF1 in hematopoiesis by selectively deleting its
      gene in murine blood cells. Brpf1-deficient pups experienced early lethality due 
      to acute bone marrow failure and aplastic anemia. The mutant bone marrow and
      fetal liver exhibited severe deficiency in HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors,
      along with elevated reactive oxygen species, senescence, and apoptosis. BRPF1
      deficiency also reduced the expression of multipotency genes, including Slamf1,
      Mecom, Hoxa9, Hlf, Gfi1, Egr, and Gata3. Furthermore, BRPF1 was required for
      acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 23, a highly abundant but not
      well-characterized epigenetic mark. These results identify an essential role of
      the multivalent chromatin regulator BRPF1 in definitive hematopoiesis and
      illuminate a potentially new avenue for studying epigenetic networks that govern 
      HSC ontogeny.

PG  - 3556-66
LID - 10.1172/JCI84939 [doi]
LID - 84939 [pii]
AB  - Exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics can lead to the generation of toxic levels
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within mechanosensory hair cells of the inner
      ear that have been implicated in hearing and balance disorders. Better
      understanding of the origin of aminoglycoside-induced ROS could focus the
      development of therapies aimed at preventing this event. In this work, we used
      the zebrafish lateral line system to monitor the dynamic behavior of
      mitochondrial and cytoplasmic oxidation occurring within the same dying hair cell
      following exposure to aminoglycosides. The increased oxidation observed in both
      mitochondria and cytoplasm of dying hair cells was highly correlated with
      mitochondrial calcium uptake. Application of the mitochondrial uniporter
      inhibitor Ru360 reduced mitochondrial and cytoplasmic oxidation, suggesting that 
      mitochondrial calcium drives ROS generation during aminoglycoside-induced hair
      cell death. Furthermore, targeting mitochondria with free radical scavengers
      conferred superior protection against aminoglycoside exposure compared with
      identical, untargeted scavengers. Our findings suggest that targeted therapies
      aimed at preventing mitochondrial oxidation have therapeutic potential to
      ameliorate the toxic effects of aminoglycoside exposure.

TI  - Biallelic inactivation of REV7 is associated with Fanconi anemia.
PG  - 3580-4

LID - 88010 [pii]
AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive genetic disease characterized by congenital
      abnormalities, chromosome instability, progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), and
      a strong predisposition to cancer. Twenty FA genes have been identified, and the 
      FANC proteins they encode cooperate in a common pathway that regulates DNA
      crosslink repair and replication fork stability. We identified a child with
      severe BMF who harbored biallelic inactivating mutations of the translesion DNA
      synthesis (TLS) gene REV7 (also known as MAD2L2), which encodes the mutant REV7
      protein REV7-V85E. Patient-derived cells demonstrated an extended FA phenotype,
      which included increased chromosome breaks and G2/M accumulation upon exposure to
      DNA crosslinking agents, gammaH2AX and 53BP1 foci accumulation, and enhanced
      p53/p21 activation relative to cells derived from healthy patients. Expression of
      WT REV7 restored normal cellular and functional phenotypes in the patient's
      cells, and CRISPR/Cas9 inactivation of REV7 in a non-FA human cell line produced 
      an FA phenotype. Finally, silencing Rev7 in primary hematopoietic cells impaired 
      progenitor function, suggesting that the DNA repair defect underlies the
      development of BMF in FA. Taken together, our genetic and functional analyses
      identified REV7 as a previously undescribed FA gene, which we term FANCV.

AB  - Intramuscular lipid accumulation is a common manifestation of chronic caloric
      excess and obesity that is strongly associated with insulin resistance. The
      mechanistic links between lipid accumulation in myocytes and insulin resistance
      are not completely understood. In this work, we used a high-throughput chemical
      biology screen to identify a small-molecule probe, SBI-477, that coordinately
      inhibited triacylglyceride (TAG) synthesis and enhanced basal glucose uptake in
      human skeletal myocytes. We then determined that SBI-477 stimulated insulin
      signaling by deactivating the transcription factor MondoA, leading to reduced
      expression of the insulin pathway suppressors thioredoxin-interacting protein
      (TXNIP) and arrestin domain-containing 4 (ARRDC4). Depleting MondoA in myocytes
      reproduced the effects of SBI-477 on glucose uptake and myocyte lipid
      accumulation. Furthermore, an analog of SBI-477 suppressed TXNIP expression,
      reduced muscle and liver TAG levels, enhanced insulin signaling, and improved
      glucose tolerance in mice fed a high-fat diet. These results identify a key role 
      for MondoA-directed programs in the coordinated control of myocyte lipid balance 
      and insulin signaling and suggest that this pathway may have potential as a
      therapeutic target for insulin resistance and lipotoxicity.

TI  - ZEB1 drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer.
PG  - 3219-35
LID - 10.1172/JCI76725 [doi]
LID - 76725 [pii]
AB  - Increased expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) is associated
      with tumor grade and metastasis in lung cancer, likely due to its role as a
      transcription factor in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we
      modeled malignant transformation in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and 
      determined that EMT and ZEB1 expression are early, critical events in lung cancer
      pathogenesis. Specific oncogenic mutations in TP53 and KRAS were required for
      HBECs to engage EMT machinery in response to microenvironmental (serum/TGF-beta) 
      or oncogenetic (MYC) factors. Both TGF-beta- and MYC-induced EMT required ZEB1,
      but engaged distinct TGF-beta-dependent and vitamin D receptor-dependent
      (VDR-dependent) pathways, respectively. Functionally, we found that ZEB1 causally
      promotes malignant progression of HBECs and tumorigenicity, invasion, and
      metastases in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines. Mechanistically, ZEB1
      expression in HBECs directly repressed epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1
      (ESRP1), leading to increased expression of a mesenchymal splice variant of CD44 
      and a more invasive phenotype. In addition, ZEB1 expression in early stage IB
      primary NSCLC correlated with tumor-node-metastasis stage. These findings
      indicate that ZEB1-induced EMT and associated molecular changes in ESRP1 and CD44
      contribute to early pathogenesis and metastatic potential in established lung
      cancer. Moreover, TGF-beta and VDR signaling and CD44 splicing pathways
      associated with ZEB1 are potential EMT chemoprevention and therapeutic targets in
      NSCLC.

TI  - Disruption of Gpr45 causes reduced hypothalamic POMC expression and obesity.
PG  - 3192-206
LID - 10.1172/JCI85676 [doi]
LID - 85676 [pii]
AB  - A rise in the occurrence of obesity has driven exploration of its underlying
      genetic basis and potential targets for intervention. GWAS studies have
      identified obesity susceptibility pathways involving several neuropeptides that
      control energy homeostasis, suggesting that variations in the genes that regulate
      food intake and energy expenditure may contribute to obesity. In this study, we
      identified 5 additional obesity loci, including a neuronal orphan GPCR called
      Gpr45, in a forward genetic screen of mutant mice generated by piggyBac
      insertional mutagenesis. Disruption of Gpr45 led to increased adiposity at the
      time of weaning and increases in body mass, fat content, glucose intolerance, and
      hepatic steatosis with advancing age. Mice with disruptions in Gpr45 also
      displayed a reduction in expression of the metabolic regulator POMC and less
      energy expenditure prior to the onset of obesity. Mechanistically, we determined 
      that GPR45 regulates POMC expression via the JAK/STAT pathway in a
      cell-autonomous manner. Consistent with this finding, intraventricular
      administration of melanotan-2, an analog of the POMC derivative alpha-MSH,
      suppressed adult obesity in Gpr45 mutants. These results reveal that GPR45 is a
      regulator of POMC signaling and energy expenditure, which suggests that it may be
      a potential intervention target to combat obesity.

TI  - Recurrent EZH1 mutations are a second hit in autonomous thyroid adenomas.
PG  - 3383-8
LID - 10.1172/JCI84894 [doi]
LID - 84894 [pii]
AB  - Autonomous thyroid adenomas (ATAs) are a frequent cause of hyperthyroidism.
      Mutations in the genes encoding the TSH receptor (TSHR) or the Gs protein alpha
      subunit (GNAS) are found in approximately 70% of ATAs. The involvement of other
      genes and the pathogenesis of the remaining cases are presently unknown. Here, we
      performed whole-exome sequencing in 19 ATAs that were paired with normal DNA
      samples and identified a recurrent hot-spot mutation (c.1712A>G; p.Gln571Arg) in 
      the enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) gene, which codes for a catalytic subunit 
      of the polycomb complex. Targeted screening in an independent cohort confirmed
      that this mutation occurs with high frequency (27%) in ATAs. EZH1 mutations were 
      strongly associated with known (TSHR, GNAS) or presumed (adenylate cyclase 9
      [ADCY9]) alterations in cAMP pathway genes. Furthermore, functional studies
      revealed that the p.Gln571Arg EZH1 mutation caused increased histone H3
      trimethylation and increased proliferation of thyroid cells. In summary, this
      study revealed that a hot-spot mutation in EZH1 is the second most frequent
      genetic alteration in ATAs. The association between EZH1 and TSHR mutations
      suggests a 2-hit model for the pathogenesis of these tumors, whereby constitutive
      activation of the cAMP pathway and EZH1 mutations cooperate to induce the
      hyperproliferation of thyroid cells.

TI  - Posttranscriptional manipulation of TERC reverses molecular hallmarks of telomere
      disease.
PG  - 3377-82
LID - 10.1172/JCI87547 [doi]
LID - 87547 [pii]
AB  - The telomerase RNA component (TERC) is a critical determinant of cellular
      self-renewal. Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is required for
      posttranscriptional maturation of TERC. PARN mutations lead to incomplete 3' end 
      processing and increased destruction of nascent TERC RNA transcripts, resulting
      in telomerase deficiency and telomere diseases. Here, we determined that
      overexpression of TERC increased telomere length in PARN-deficient cells and
      hypothesized that decreasing posttranscriptional 3' oligo-adenylation of TERC
      would counteract the deleterious effects of PARN mutations. Inhibition of the
      noncanonical poly(A) polymerase PAP-associated domain-containing 5 (PAPD5)
      increased TERC levels in PARN-mutant patient cells. PAPD5 inhibition was also
      associated with increases in TERC stability, telomerase activity, and telomere
      elongation. Our results demonstrate that manipulating posttranscriptional
      regulatory pathways may be a potential strategy to reverse the molecular
      hallmarks of telomere disease.

AB  - High levels of circulating TNF and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, predict the
      progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), but their contribution to organ
      damage in DKD remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the function of
      local and systemic TNF in podocyte injury. We cultured human podocytes with sera 
      collected from DKD patients, who displayed elevated TNF levels, and focal
      segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) patients, whose TNF levels resembled those of
      healthy patients. Exogenous TNF administration or local TNF expression was
      equally sufficient to cause free cholesterol-dependent apoptosis in podocytes by 
      acting through a dual mechanism that required a reduction in ATP-binding cassette
      transporter A1-mediated (ABCA1-mediated) cholesterol efflux and reduced
      cholesterol esterification by sterol-O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1). TNF-induced
      albuminuria was aggravated in mice with podocyte-specific ABCA1 deficiency and
      was partially prevented by cholesterol depletion with cyclodextrin.
      TNF-stimulated free cholesterol-dependent apoptosis in podocytes was mediated by 
      nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1). ABCA1 overexpression or
      cholesterol depletion was sufficient to reduce albuminuria in mice with
      podocyte-specific NFATc1 activation. Our data implicate an NFATc1/ABCA1-dependent
      mechanism in which local TNF is sufficient to cause free cholesterol-dependent
      podocyte injury irrespective of TNF, TNFR1, or TNFR2 serum levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: T cells expressing antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
      improve outcomes for CD19-expressing B cell malignancies. We evaluated a human
      application of T cells that were genetically modified using the Sleeping Beauty
      (SB) transposon/transposase system to express a CD19-specific CAR. METHODS: T
      cells were genetically modified using DNA plasmids from the SB platform to stably
      express a second-generation CD19-specific CAR and selectively propagated ex vivo 
      with activating and propagating cells (AaPCs) and cytokines. Twenty-six patients 
      with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia safely
      underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and infusion of CAR T
      cells as adjuvant therapy in the autologous (n = 7) or allogeneic settings (n =
      19). RESULTS: SB-mediated genetic transposition and stimulation resulted in
      2,200- to 2,500-fold ex vivo expansion of genetically modified T cells, with 84% 
      CAR expression, and without integration hotspots. Following autologous HSCT, the 
      30-month progression-free and overall survivals were 83% and 100%, respectively. 
      After allogeneic HSCT, the respective 12-month rates were 53% and 63%. No acute
      or late toxicities and no exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease were
      observed. Despite a low antigen burden and unsupportive recipient cytokine
      environment, CAR T cells persisted for an average of 201 days for autologous
      recipients and 51 days for allogeneic recipients. CONCLUSIONS: CD19-specific CAR 
      T cells generated with SB and AaPC platforms were safe, and may provide
      additional cancer control as planned infusions after HSCT. These results support 
      further clinical development of this nonviral gene therapy approach. TRIAL

TI  - Rationally designed BCL6 inhibitors target activated B cell diffuse large B cell 
      lymphoma.
PG  - 3351-62
LID - 10.1172/JCI85795 [doi]
LID - 85795 [pii]
AB  - Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) arise from proliferating B cells
      transiting different stages of the germinal center reaction. In activated B cell 
      DLBCLs (ABC-DLBCLs), a class of DLBCLs that respond poorly to current therapies, 
      chromosomal translocations and amplification lead to constitutive expression of
      the B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) oncogene. The role of BCL6 in maintaining these
      lymphomas has not been investigated. Here, we designed small-molecule inhibitors 
      that display higher affinity for BCL6 than its endogenous corepressor ligands to 
      evaluate their therapeutic efficacy for targeting ABC-DLBCL. We used an in silico
      drug design functional-group mapping approach called SILCS to create a specific
      BCL6 inhibitor called FX1 that has 10-fold greater potency than endogenous
      corepressors and binds an essential region of the BCL6 lateral groove. FX1
      disrupted formation of the BCL6 repression complex, reactivated BCL6 target
      genes, and mimicked the phenotype of mice engineered to express BCL6 with
      corepressor binding site mutations. Low doses of FX1 induced regression of
      established tumors in mice bearing DLBCL xenografts. Furthermore, FX1 suppressed 
      ABC-DLBCL cells in vitro and in vivo, as well as primary human ABC-DLBCL
      specimens ex vivo. These findings indicate that ABC-DLBCL is a BCL6-dependent
      disease that can be targeted by rationally designed inhibitors that exceed the
      binding affinity of natural BCL6 ligands.

TI  - EGFR regulates macrophage activation and function in bacterial infection.
PG  - 3296-312
LID - 10.1172/JCI83585 [doi]
LID - 83585 [pii]
AB  - EGFR signaling regulates macrophage function, but its role in bacterial infection
      has not been investigated. Here, we assessed the role of macrophage EGFR
      signaling during infection with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterial pathogen that
      causes persistent inflammation and gastric cancer. EGFR was phosphorylated in
      murine and human macrophages during H. pylori infection. In human gastric
      tissues, elevated levels of phosphorylated EGFR were observed throughout the
      histologic cascade from gastritis to carcinoma. Deleting Egfr in myeloid cells
      attenuated gastritis and increased H. pylori burden in infected mice. EGFR
      deficiency also led to a global defect in macrophage activation that was
      associated with decreased cytokine, chemokine, and NO production. We observed
      similar alterations in macrophage activation and disease phenotype in the
      Citrobacter rodentium model of murine infectious colitis. Mechanistically, EGFR
      signaling activated NF-kappaB and MAPK1/3 pathways to induce cytokine production 
      and macrophage activation. Although deletion of Egfr had no effect on DC
      function, EGFR-deficient macrophages displayed impaired Th1 and Th17 adaptive
      immune responses to H. pylori, which contributed to decreased chronic
      inflammation in infected mice. Together, these results indicate that EGFR
      signaling is central to macrophage function in response to enteric bacterial
      pathogens and is a potential therapeutic target for infection-induced
      inflammation and associated carcinogenesis.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease that can be
      induced by dasatinib, a dual Src and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is
      used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Today, key questions remain
      regarding the mechanisms involved in the long-term development of
      dasatinib-induced PAH. Here, we demonstrated that chronic dasatinib therapy
      causes pulmonary endothelial damage in humans and rodents. We found that
      dasatinib treatment attenuated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction responses and
      increased susceptibility to experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH) in rats, but
      these effects were absent in rats treated with imatinib, another BCR-ABL tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, dasatinib treatment induced pulmonary endothelial 
      cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, while imatinib did not. Dasatinib
      treatment mediated endothelial cell dysfunction via increased production of ROS
      that was independent of Src family kinases. Consistent with these findings, we
      observed elevations in markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage in 
      the serum of CML patients who were treated with dasatinib, compared with CML
      patients treated with imatinib. Taken together, our findings indicate that
      dasatinib causes pulmonary vascular damage, induction of ER stress, and
      mitochondrial ROS production, which leads to increased susceptibility to PH
      development.

PG  - 3526-40

LID - 86120 [pii]
AB  - Genomic studies have linked mTORC1 pathway-activating mutations with exceptional 
      response to treatment with allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 called rapalogs.
      Rapalogs are approved for selected cancer types, including kidney and breast
      cancers. Here, we used sequencing data from 22 human kidney cancer cases to
      identify the activating mechanisms conferred by mTOR mutations observed in human 
      cancers and advance precision therapeutics. mTOR mutations that clustered in
      focal adhesion kinase targeting domain (FAT) and kinase domains enhanced mTORC1
      kinase activity, decreased nutrient reliance, and increased cell size. We
      identified 3 distinct mechanisms of hyperactivation, including reduced binding to
      DEP domain-containing MTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), resistance to regulatory
      associated protein of mTOR-mediated (RAPTOR-mediated) suppression, and altered
      kinase kinetics. Of the 28 mTOR double mutants, activating mutations could be
      divided into 6 complementation groups, resulting in synergistic Rag- and Ras
      homolog enriched in brain-independent (RHEB-independent) mTORC1 activation. mTOR 
      mutants were resistant to DNA damage-inducible transcript 1-mediated
      (REDD1-mediated) inhibition, confirming that activating mutations can bypass the 
      negative feedback pathway formed between HIF1 and mTORC1 in the absence of von
      Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor expression. Moreover, VHL-deficient cells
      that expressed activating mTOR mutants grew tumors that were sensitive to
      rapamycin treatment. These data may explain the high incidence of mTOR mutations 
      observed in clear cell kidney cancer, where VHL loss and HIF activation is
      pathognomonic. Our study provides mechanistic and therapeutic insights concerning
      mTOR mutations in human diseases.

PG  - 3236-46

LID - 83136 [pii]
AB  - ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) promotes cholesterol accumulation and
      alters T cell homeostasis, which may contribute to progression of
      atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated how the selective loss of ABCG1 in T cells
      impacts atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR-deficient) mice, a model 
      of the disease. In LDLR-deficient mice fed a high-cholesterol diet, T
      cell-specific ABCG1 deficiency protected against atherosclerotic lesions.
      Furthermore, T cell-specific ABCG1 deficiency led to a 30% increase in Treg
      percentages in aorta and aorta-draining lymph nodes (LNs) of these mice compared 
      with animals with only LDLR deficiency. When Abcg1 was selectively deleted in
      Tregs of LDLR-deficient mice, we observed a 30% increase in Treg percentages in
      aorta and aorta-draining LNs and reduced atherosclerosis. In the absence of
      ABCG1, intracellular cholesterol accumulation led to downregulation of the mTOR
      pathway, which increased the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Tregs. The
      increase in Tregs resulted in reduced T cell activation and increased IL-10
      production by T cells. Last, we found that higher ABCG1 expression in Tregs was
      associated with a higher frequency of these cells in human blood samples. Our
      study indicates that ABCG1 regulates T cell differentiation into Tregs,
      highlighting a pathway by which cholesterol accumulation can influence T cell
      homeostasis in atherosclerosis.

AB  - The number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has grown rapidly; however, our
      understanding of their function remains limited. Although cultured cells have
      facilitated investigations of lncRNA function at the molecular level, the use of 
      animal models provides a rich context in which to investigate the phenotypic
      impact of these molecules. Promising initial studies using animal models
      demonstrated that lncRNAs influence a diverse number of phenotypes, ranging from 
      subtle dysmorphia to viability. Here, we highlight the diversity of animal models
      and their unique advantages, discuss the use of animal models to profile lncRNA
      expression, evaluate experimental strategies to manipulate lncRNA function in
      vivo, and review the phenotypes attributable to lncRNAs. Despite a limited number
      of studies leveraging animal models, lncRNAs are already recognized as a notable 
      class of molecules with important implications for health and disease.

PG  - 2775-82

LID - 84421 [pii]
AB  - The traditional view of genome organization has been upended in the last decade
      with the discovery of vast amounts of non-protein-coding transcription. After
      initial concerns that this "dark matter" of the genome was transcriptional noise,
      it is apparent that a subset of these noncoding RNAs are functional. Long
      noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes resemble protein-coding genes in several key
      aspects, and they have myriad molecular functions across many cellular pathways
      and processes, including oncogenic signaling. The number of lncRNA genes has
      recently been greatly expanded by our group to triple the number of
      protein-coding genes; therefore, lncRNAs are likely to play a role in many
      biological processes. Based on their large number and expression specificity in a
      variety of cancers, lncRNAs are likely to serve as the basis for many clinical
      applications in oncology.

AB  - Tumor suppression that is mediated by oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is
      considered to function as a safeguard during development of pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the mechanisms that regulate OIS in PDAC are
      poorly understood. Here, we have determined that nuclear RelA reinforces OIS to
      inhibit carcinogenesis in the Kras mouse model of PDAC. Inactivation of RelA
      accelerated pancreatic lesion formation in Kras mice by abrogating the
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) gene transcription signature.
      Using genetic and pharmacological tools, we determined that RelA activation
      promotes OIS via elevation of the SASP factor CXCL1 (also known as KC), which
      activates CXCR2, during pancreatic carcinogenesis. In Kras mice,
      pancreas-specific inactivation of CXCR2 prevented OIS and was correlated with
      increased tumor proliferation and decreased survival. Moreover, reductions in
      CXCR2 levels were associated with advanced neoplastic lesions in tissue from
      human pancreatic specimens. Genetically disabling OIS in Kras mice caused RelA to
      promote tumor proliferation, suggesting a dual role for RelA signaling in
      pancreatic carcinogenesis. Taken together, our data suggest a pivotal role for
      RelA in regulating OIS in preneoplastic lesions and implicate the
      RelA/CXCL1/CXCR2 axis as an essential mechanism of tumor surveillance in PDAC.

AB  - Following immune attack, solid tumors upregulate coinhibitory ligands that bind
      to inhibitory receptors on T cells. This adaptive resistance compromises the
      efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, which redirect T
      cells to solid tumors. Here, we investigated whether programmed death-1-mediated 
      (PD-1-mediated) T cell exhaustion affects mesothelin-targeted CAR T cells and
      explored cell-intrinsic strategies to overcome inhibition of CAR T cells. Using
      an orthotopic mouse model of pleural mesothelioma, we determined that relatively 
      high doses of both CD28- and 4-1BB-based second-generation CAR T cells achieved
      tumor eradication. CAR-mediated CD28 and 4-1BB costimulation resulted in similar 
      levels of T cell persistence in animals treated with low T cell doses; however,
      PD-1 upregulation within the tumor microenvironment inhibited T cell function. At
      lower doses, 4-1BB CAR T cells retained their cytotoxic and cytokine secretion
      functions longer than CD28 CAR T cells. The prolonged function of 4-1BB CAR T
      cells correlated with improved survival. PD-1/PD-1 ligand [PD-L1] pathway
      interference, through PD-1 antibody checkpoint blockade, cell-intrinsic PD-1
      shRNA blockade, or a PD-1 dominant negative receptor, restored the effector
      function of CD28 CAR T cells. These findings provide mechanistic insights into
      human CAR T cell exhaustion in solid tumors and suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade 
      may be an effective strategy for improving the potency of CAR T cell therapies.

AB  - The recent clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for
      B cell malignancies represents a paradigm shift in cancer immunotherapy.
      Unfortunately, application of CAR T cell-mediated therapy for solid tumors has so
      far been disappointing, and the reasons for this poor response in solid tumors
      remain unknown. In this issue of the JCI, Cherkassky and colleagues report on
      their use of a murine model of human pleural mesothelioma to explore potential
      factors that limit CAR T cell efficacy. Their studies have uncovered the
      importance of the tumor microenvironment in the inhibition of CAR T cell
      functions, revealed a critical role for the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway in 
      CAR T cell exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment, and demonstrated
      improved antitumor effects with a CAR T cell-intrinsic PD-1 blockade strategy
      using a dominant negative form of PD-1. Together, the results of this study lay
      the groundwork for further evaluation of mechanisms underlying CAR T cell immune 
      evasion within the tumor microenvironment for the improvement of CAR T
      cell-mediated therapy for solid tumors.

TI  - Pravastatin improves pregnancy outcomes in obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome
      refractory to antithrombotic therapy.
PG  - 2933-40
LID - 10.1172/JCI86957 [doi]
LID - 86957 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Administration of conventional antithrombotic treatment (low-dose
      aspirin plus low-molecular weight heparin [LDA+LMWH]) for obstetric
      antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) does not prevent life-threatening placenta
      insufficiency-associated complications such as preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine
      growth restriction (IUGR) in 20% of patients. Statins have been linked to
      improved pregnancy outcomes in mouse models of PE and APS, possibly due to their 
      protective effects on endothelium. Here, we investigated the use of pravastatin
      in LDA+LMWH-refractory APS in patients at an increased risk of adverse pregnancy 
      outcomes. METHODS: We studied 21 pregnant women with APS who developed PE and/or 
      IUGR during treatment with LDA+LMWH. A control group of 10 patients received only
      LDA+LMWH. Eleven patients received pravastatin (20 mg/d) in addition to LDA+LMWH 
      at the onset of PE and/or IUGR. Uteroplacental blood hemodynamics, progression of
      PE features (hypertension and proteinuria), and fetal/neonatal outcomes were
      evaluated. RESULTS: In the control group, all deliveries occurred preterm and
      only 6 of 11 neonates survived. Of the 6 surviving neonates, 3 showed abnormal
      development. Patients who received both pravastatin and LDA+LMWH exhibited
      increased placental blood flow and improvements in PE features. These beneficial 
      effects were observed as early as 10 days after pravastatin treatment onset.
      Pravastatin treatment combined with LDA+LMWH was also associated with live births
      that occurred close to full term in all patients. CONCLUSION: The present study
      suggests that pravastatin may improve pregnancy outcomes in women with refractory
      obstetric APS when taken at the onset of PE or IUGR until the end of pregnancy.

AB  - Pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are at a high risk of
      obstetrical complications. The current standard of care, including the use of
      low-dose aspirin and heparin, has not been shown to prevent preeclampsia or
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Due to the similarities in
      pathophysiology among preeclampsia, IUGR, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease, statins have been proposed for treating and/or preventing these
      obstetrical complications. In this issue of the JCI, Lefkou et al. report on a
      small, observational trial that showed a dramatic improvement in both maternal
      and fetal/neonatal outcomes in women with APS given pravastatin after the onset
      of preeclampsia and/or IUGR compared with women in the control group. These
      results, along with other recent clinical studies, support further evaluation of 
      statins for prevention of preeclampsia in a large-scale randomized clinical
      trial.

PG  - 2799-801

LID - 89156 [pii]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly cancer in which NF-kappaB
      pathways promote biological aggressiveness. In this issue of the JCI, Lesina et
      al. investigated the role of RelA, the p65 partner of p50 that together form the 
      most common NF-kappaB complex, in the early stages of pancreatic malignant
      transformation and in established PDAC. By deleting Rela in the context of an
      oncogenic Kras-driven autochthonous model of PDAC, the authors demonstrated that 
      RelA is a mediator of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and the
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that attenuates acinar-to-ductal
      metaplasia, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) formation, and PanIN
      progression to PDAC. Loss of the tumor-suppressor function of RelA in the early
      stages of Kras-driven pancreatic neoplastic transformation was associated with
      decreased OIS and SASP and a protumorigenic tumor microenvironment that harbored 
      more M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The beneficial effects 
      of RelA were mediated by increased expression of CXCL1 and its activation of
      CXCR2. By contrast, in advanced stages of Kras-driven murine PDAC, loss of p53 or
      p16 was associated with senescence bypass, and RelA deficiency in this context
      attenuated cancer cell proliferation and prolonged mouse survival, indicating
      that RelA enhances tumor progression in established PDAC.

AB  - A rare subset of HIV-1-infected individuals is able to maintain plasma viral load
      (VL) at low levels without antiretroviral treatment. Identifying the mechanisms
      underlying this atypical response to infection may lead to therapeutic advances
      for treating HIV-1. Here, we developed a proteomic analysis to compare peripheral
      blood cell proteomes in 20 HIV-1-infected individuals who maintained either high 
      or low VL with the aim of identifying host factors that impact HIV-1 replication.
      We determined that the levels of multiple histone proteins were markedly
      decreased in cohorts of individuals with high VL. This reduction was correlated
      with lower levels of stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), which is known to control 
      histone metabolism. Depletion of cellular SLBP increased promoter engagement with
      the chromatin structures of the host gene high mobility group protein A1 (HMGA1) 
      and viral long terminal repeat (LTR), which led to higher levels of HIV-1 genomic
      integration and proviral transcription. Further, we determined that TNF-alpha
      regulates expression of SLBP and observed that plasma TNF-alpha levels in
      HIV-1-infected individuals correlated directly with VL levels and inversely with 
      cellular SLBP levels. Our findings identify SLBP as a potentially important
      cellular regulator of HIV-1, thereby establishing a link between histone
      metabolism, inflammation, and HIV-1 infection.

TI  - E2f8 mediates tumor suppression in postnatal liver development.
PG  - 2955-69
LID - 10.1172/JCI85506 [doi]
LID - 85506 [pii]
AB  - E2F-mediated transcriptional repression of cell cycle-dependent gene expression
      is critical for the control of cellular proliferation, survival, and development.
      E2F signaling also interacts with transcriptional programs that are downstream of
      genetic predictors for cancer development, including hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). Here, we evaluated the function of the atypical repressor genes E2f7 and
      E2f8 in adult liver physiology. Using several loss-of-function alleles in mice,
      we determined that combined deletion of E2f7 and E2f8 in hepatocytes leads to
      HCC. Temporal-specific ablation strategies revealed that E2f8's tumor suppressor 
      role is critical during the first 2 weeks of life, which correspond to a highly
      proliferative stage of postnatal liver development. Disruption of E2F8's DNA
      binding activity phenocopied the effects of an E2f8 null allele and led to HCC.
      Finally, a profile of chromatin occupancy and gene expression in young and
      tumor-bearing mice identified a set of shared targets for E2F7 and E2F8 whose
      increased expression during early postnatal liver development is associated with 
      HCC progression in mice. Increased expression of E2F8-specific target genes was
      also observed in human liver biopsies from HCC patients compared to healthy
      patients. In summary, these studies suggest that E2F8-mediated transcriptional
      repression is a critical tumor suppressor mechanism during postnatal liver
      development.

TI  - p53 coordinates decidual sestrin 2/AMPK/mTORC1 signaling to govern parturition
      timing.
PG  - 2941-54

LID - 87715 [pii]
AB  - Inflammation and oxidative stress are known risk factors for preterm birth (PTB);
      however, the mechanisms and pathways that influence this condition are not fully 
      described. Previously, we showed that mTORC1 signaling is increased in mice
      harboring a uterine-specific deletion of transformation-related protein 53
      (p53d/d mice), which exhibit premature decidual senescence that triggers
      spontaneous and inflammation-induced PTB. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor
      rapamycin reduced the incidence of PTB in the p53d/d mice. Decidual senescence
      with heightened mTORC1 signaling is also a signature of human PTB. Here, we have 
      identified an underlying mechanism for PTB and a potential therapeutic strategy
      for treating the condition. Treatment of pregnant p53d/d mice with either the
      antidiabetic drug metformin or the antioxidant resveratrol activated AMPK
      signaling and inhibited mTORC1 signaling in decidual cells. Both metformin and
      resveratrol protected against spontaneous and inflammation-induced PTB in p53d/d 
      females. Using multiple approaches, we determined that p53 interacts with
      sestrins to coordinate an inverse relationship between AMPK and mTORC1 signaling 
      that determines parturition timing. This signature was also observed in human
      decidual cells. Together, these results reveal that p53-dependent coordination of
      AMPK and mTORC1 signaling controls parturition timing and suggest that metformin 
      and resveratrol have therapeutic potential to prevent PTB.

PG  - 3145-57

LID - 87033 [pii]
AB  - Patients with cancers that harbor breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) mutations initially
      respond well to platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)
      therapy; however, resistance invariably arises in these patients and is a major
      clinical problem. The BRCA1185delAG allele is a common inherited mutation located
      close to the protein translation start site that is thought to produce a
      shortened, nonfunctional peptide. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms
      that lead to PARPi and platinum resistance in the SUM1315MO2 breast cancer cell
      line, which harbors a hemizygous BRCA1185delAG mutation. SUM1315MO2 cells were
      initially sensitive to PARPi and cisplatin but readily acquired resistance.
      PARPi- and cisplatin-resistant clones did not harbor secondary reversion
      mutations; rather, PARPi and platinum resistance required increased expression of
      a really interesting gene (RING) domain-deficient BRCA1 protein (Rdd-BRCA1).
      Initiation of translation occurred downstream of the frameshift mutation,
      probably at the BRCA1-Met-297 codon. In contrast to full-length BRCA1, Rdd-BRCA1 
      did not require BRCA1-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1) interaction for stability.
      Functionally, Rdd-BRCA1 formed irradiation-induced foci and supported RAD51 foci 
      formation. Ectopic overexpression of Rdd-BRCA1 promoted partial PARPi and
      cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, Rdd-BRCA1 protein expression was detected in
      recurrent carcinomas from patients who carried germline BRCA1185delAG mutations. 
      Taken together, these results indicate that RING-deficient BRCA1 proteins are
      hypomorphic and capable of contributing to PARPi and platinum resistance when
      expressed at high levels.

LID - 89209 [pii]
AB  - Germline breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) variants are associated with a high risk of
      breast and ovarian cancers. Many BRCA1-mediated cancers are initially responsive 
      to platinum-based therapy; however, resistance commonly develops. The
      BRCA1185delAG mutation is common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and has been 
      thought to result in loss of function due to the introduction of a stop codon in 
      the 5' region of the BRCA1 transcript. Two studies in this issue of the JCI
      reveal that the BRCA1185delAG mutation results in the production of BRCA1 that
      lacks the N-terminal really interesting new gene (RING) domain. RING-less BRCA1
      was shown to directly mediate chemoresistance, while maintaining some homologous 
      recombination function. These results provide important insight into BRCA1
      function and indicate that other truncated proteins could arise through similar
      alterations in codon usage.

AB  - Heterozygous germline mutations in breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) strongly predispose
      women to breast cancer. BRCA1 plays an important role in DNA double-strand break 
      (DSB) repair via homologous recombination (HR), which is important for tumor
      suppression. Although BRCA1-deficient cells are highly sensitive to treatment
      with DSB-inducing agents through their HR deficiency (HRD), BRCA1-associated
      tumors display heterogeneous responses to platinum drugs and poly(ADP-ribose)
      polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in clinical trials. It is unclear whether all
      pathogenic BRCA1 mutations have similar effects on the response to therapy. Here,
      we have investigated mammary tumorigenesis and therapy sensitivity in mice
      carrying the Brca1185stop and Brca15382stop alleles, which respectively mimic the
      2 most common BRCA1 founder mutations, BRCA1185delAG and BRCA15382insC. Both the 
      Brca1185stop and Brca15382stop mutations predisposed animals to mammary tumors,
      but Brca1185stop tumors responded markedly worse to HRD-targeted therapy than did
      Brca15382stop tumors. Mice expressing Brca1185stop mutations also developed
      therapy resistance more rapidly than did mice expressing Brca15382stop. We
      determined that both murine Brca1185stop tumors and human BRCA1185delAG breast
      cancer cells expressed a really interesting new gene domain-less (RING-less)
      BRCA1 protein that mediated resistance to HRD-targeted therapies. Together, these
      results suggest that expression of RING-less BRCA1 may serve as a marker to
      predict poor response to DSB-inducing therapy in human cancer patients.

AB  - Vision impairments and blindness caused by retinitis pigmentosa result from
      severe neurodegeneration that leads to a loss of photoreceptors, the specialized 
      light-sensitive neurons that enable vision. Although the mammalian nervous system
      is unable to replace neurons lost due to degeneration, therapeutic approaches to 
      reprogram resident glial cells to replace retinal neurons have been proposed.
      Here, we demonstrate that retinal Muller glia can be reprogrammed in vivo into
      retinal precursors that then differentiate into photoreceptors. We transplanted
      hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into retinas affected by
      photoreceptor degeneration and observed spontaneous cell fusion events between
      Muller glia and the transplanted cells. Activation of Wnt signaling in the
      transplanted HSPCs enhanced survival and proliferation of Muller-HSPC hybrids as 
      well as their reprogramming into intermediate photoreceptor precursors. This
      suggests that Wnt signaling drives the reprogrammed cells toward a photoreceptor 
      progenitor fate. Finally, Muller-HSPC hybrids differentiated into photoreceptors.
      Transplantation of HSPCs with activated Wnt functionally rescued the retinal
      degeneration phenotype in rd10 mice, a model for inherited retinitis pigmentosa. 
      Together, these results suggest that photoreceptors can be generated by
      reprogramming Muller glia and that this approach may have potential as a strategy
      for reversing retinal degeneration.

AB  - Joints that have degenerated as a result of aging or injury contain dead
      chondrocytes and damaged cartilage. Some studies have suggested that chondrocyte 
      death precedes cartilage damage, but how the loss of chondrocytes affects
      cartilage integrity is not clear. In this study, we examined whether chondrocyte 
      death undermines cartilage integrity in aging and injury using a rapid 3D
      confocal cartilage imaging technique coupled with standard histology. We induced 
      autonomous expression of diphtheria toxin to kill articular surface chondrocytes 
      in mice and determined that chondrocyte death did not lead to cartilage damage.
      Moreover, cartilage damage after surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus 
      of the knee was increased in mice with intact chondrocytes compared with animals 
      whose chondrocytes had been killed, suggesting that chondrocyte death does not
      drive cartilage damage in response to injury. These data imply that chondrocyte
      catabolism, not death, contributes to articular cartilage damage following
      injury. Therefore, therapies targeted at reducing the catabolic phenotype may
      protect against degenerative joint disease.

AB  - Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection triggers neoplastic transformation of the
      gastric mucosa in a small subset of patients, but the risk factors that induce
      progression to gastric metaplasia have not been identified. Prior to cancer
      development, the oxyntic gastric glands atrophy and are replaced by metaplastic
      cells in response to chronic gastritis. Previously, we identified schlafen 4
      (Slfn4) as a GLI1 target gene and myeloid differentiation factor that correlates 
      with spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) in mice. Here, we
      tested the hypothesis that migration of SLFN4-expressing cells from the bone
      marrow to peripheral organs predicts preneoplastic changes in the gastric
      microenvironment. Lineage tracing in Helicobacter-infected Slfn4 reporter mice
      revealed that SLFN4+ cells migrated to the stomach, where they exhibited
      myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) markers and acquired the ability to
      inhibit T cell proliferation. SLFN4+ MDSCs were not observed in infected
      GLI1-deficient mice. Overexpression of sonic hedgehog ligand (SHH) in infected WT
      mice accelerated the appearance of SLFN4+ MDSCs in the gastric corpus. Similarly,
      in the stomachs of H. pylori-infected patients, the human SLFN4 ortholog SLFN12L 
      colocalized to cells that expressed MDSC surface markers CD15+CD33+HLA-DRlo.
      Together, these results indicate that SLFN4 marks a GLI1-dependent population of 
      MDSCs that predict a shift in the gastric mucosa to a metaplastic phenotype.

AB  - The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins supports
      mitotic proliferation, meiosis, and DNA repair to control genomic stability.
      Impairments in chromosome maintenance are linked to rare chromosome breakage
      disorders. Here, we have identified a chromosome breakage syndrome associated
      with severe lung disease in early childhood. Four children from two unrelated
      kindreds died of severe pulmonary disease during infancy following viral
      pneumonia with evidence of combined T and B cell immunodeficiency. Whole exome
      sequencing revealed biallelic missense mutations in the NSMCE3 (also known as
      NDNL2) gene, which encodes a subunit of the SMC5/6 complex that is essential for 
      DNA damage response and chromosome segregation. The NSMCE3 mutations disrupted
      interactions within the SMC5/6 complex, leading to destabilization of the
      complex. Patient cells showed chromosome rearrangements, micronuclei, sensitivity
      to replication stress and DNA damage, and defective homologous recombination.
      This work associates missense mutations in NSMCE3 with an autosomal recessive
      chromosome breakage syndrome that leads to defective T and B cell function and
      acute respiratory distress syndrome in early childhood.

AB  - In preclinical models of glioblastoma, antigen escape variants can lead to tumor 
      recurrence after treatment with CAR T cells that are redirected to single tumor
      antigens. Given the heterogeneous expression of antigens on glioblastomas, we
      hypothesized that a bispecific CAR molecule would mitigate antigen escape and
      improve the antitumor activity of T cells. Here, we created a CAR that joins a
      HER2-binding scFv and an IL13Ralpha2-binding IL-13 mutein to make a tandem CAR
      exodomain (TanCAR) and a CD28.zeta endodomain. We determined that patient TanCAR 
      T cells showed distinct binding to HER2 or IL13Ralpha2 and had the capability to 
      lyse autologous glioblastoma. TanCAR T cells exhibited activation dynamics that
      were comparable to those of single CAR T cells upon encounter of HER2 or
      IL13Ralpha2. We observed that TanCARs engaged HER2 and IL13Ralpha2 simultaneously
      by inducing HER2-IL13Ralpha2 heterodimers, which promoted superadditive T cell
      activation when both antigens were encountered concurrently. TanCAR T cell
      activity was more sustained but not more exhaustible than that of T cells that
      coexpressed a HER2 CAR and an IL13Ralpha2 CAR, T cells with a unispecific CAR, or
      a pooled product. In a murine glioblastoma model, TanCAR T cells mitigated
      antigen escape, displayed enhanced antitumor efficacy, and improved animal
      survival. Thus, TanCAR T cells show therapeutic potential to improve glioblastoma
      control by coengaging HER2 and IL13Ralpha2 in an augmented, bivalent immune
      synapse that enhances T cell functionality and reduces antigen escape.

TI  - p21 mediates macrophage reprogramming through regulation of p50-p50 NF-kappaB and
      IFN-beta.

AB  - M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes, which mediate proinflammatory and
      antiinflammatory functions, respectively, represent the extremes of
      immunoregulatory plasticity in the macrophage population. This plasticity can
      also result in intermediate macrophage states that support a balance between
      these opposing functions. In sepsis, M1 macrophages can compensate for
      hyperinflammation by acquiring an M2-like immunosuppressed status that increases 
      the risk of secondary infection and death. The M1 to M2 macrophage reprogramming 
      that develops during LPS tolerance resembles the pathological antiinflammatory
      response to sepsis. Here, we determined that p21 regulates macrophage
      reprogramming by shifting the balance between active p65-p50 and inhibitory
      p50-p50 NF-kappaB pathways. p21 deficiency reduced the DNA-binding affinity of
      the p50-p50 homodimer in LPS-primed and -rechallenged macrophages, impairing
      their ability to attenuate IFN-beta production and acquire an M2-like
      hyporesponsive status. High p21 levels in sepsis patients correlated with low
      IFN-beta expression, and p21 knockdown in human monocytes corroborated its role
      in IFN-beta regulation. The data demonstrate that p21 adjusts the equilibrium
      between p65-p50 and p50-p50 NF-kappaB pathways to mediate macrophage plasticity
      in LPS tolerance. Identifying p21-related pathways involved in monocyte
      reprogramming may lead to potential targets for sepsis treatment.

TI  - IRF3 promotes adipose inflammation and insulin resistance and represses browning.
PG  - 2839-54
LID - 10.1172/JCI86080 [doi]
LID - 86080 [pii]
AB  - The chronic inflammatory state that accompanies obesity is a major contributor to
      insulin resistance and other dysfunctional adaptations in adipose tissue.
      Cellular and secreted factors promote the inflammatory milieu of obesity, but the
      transcriptional pathways that drive these processes are not well described.
      Although the canonical inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB is considered 
      to be the major driver of adipocyte inflammation, members of the interferon
      regulatory factor (IRF) family may also play a role in this process. Here, we
      determined that IRF3 expression is upregulated in the adipocytes of obese mice
      and humans. Signaling through TLR3 and TLR4, which lie upstream of IRF3, induced 
      insulin resistance in murine adipocytes, while IRF3 knockdown prevented insulin
      resistance. Furthermore, improved insulin sensitivity in IRF3-deficient mice was 
      associated with reductions in intra-adipose and systemic inflammation in the high
      fat-fed state, enhanced browning of subcutaneous fat, and increased adipose
      expression of GLUT4. Taken together, the data indicate that IRF3 is a major
      transcriptional regulator of adipose inflammation and is involved in maintaining 
      systemic glucose and energy homeostasis.

LID - 10.1172/JCI86610 [doi]
LID - 86610 [pii]
AB  - Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
      and plasma triglycerides (TGs) correlate strongly with plasma apolipoprotein
      C-III (ApoC-III) levels. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for ApoC-III reduce
      plasma TGs in primates and mice, but the underlying mechanism of action remains
      controversial. We determined that a murine-specific ApoC-III-targeting ASO
      reduces fasting TG levels through a mechanism that is dependent on low-density
      lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1). ApoC-III ASO
      treatment lowered plasma TGs in mice lacking lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepatic
      heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors, LDLR, or LRP1 and in animals with 
      combined deletion of the genes encoding HSPG receptors and LDLRs or LRP1.
      However, the ApoC-III ASO did not lower TG levels in mice lacking both LDLR and
      LRP1. LDLR and LRP1 were also required for ApoC-III ASO-induced reduction of
      plasma TGs in mice fed a high-fat diet, in postprandial clearance studies, and
      when ApoC-III-rich or ApoC-III-depleted lipoproteins were injected into mice. ASO
      reduction of ApoC-III had no effect on VLDL secretion, heparin-induced TG
      reduction, or uptake of lipids into heart and skeletal muscle. Our data indicate 
      that ApoC-III inhibits turnover of TG-rich lipoproteins primarily through a
      hepatic clearance mechanism mediated by the LDLR/LRP1 axis.

TI  - Truncated netrin-1 contributes to pathological vascular permeability in diabetic 
      retinopathy.
PG  - 3006-22
LID - 10.1172/JCI84767 [doi]
LID - 84767 [pii]
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of diabetes and a leading cause
      of blindness in the working-age population. Impaired blood-retinal barrier
      function leads to macular edema that is closely associated with the deterioration
      of central vision. We previously demonstrated that the neuronal guidance cue
      netrin-1 activates a program of reparative angiogenesis in microglia within the
      ischemic retina. Here, we provide evidence in both vitreous humor of diabetic
      patients and in retina of a murine model of diabetes that netrin-1 is metabolized
      into a bioactive fragment corresponding to domains VI and V of the full-length
      molecule. In contrast to the protective effects of full-length netrin-1 on
      retinal microvasculature, the VI-V fragment promoted vascular permeability
      through the uncoordinated 5B (UNC5B) receptor. The collagenase matrix
      metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9), which is increased in patients with diabetic macular
      edema, was capable of cleaving netrin-1 into the VI-V fragment. Thus, MMP-9 may
      release netrin-1 fragments from the extracellular matrix and facilitate
      diffusion. Nonspecific inhibition of collagenases or selective inhibition of
      MMP-9 decreased pathological vascular permeability in a murine model of diabetic 
      retinal edema. This study reveals that netrin-1 degradation products are capable 
      of modulating vascular permeability, suggesting that these fragments are of
      potential therapeutic interest for the treatment of DR.

AB  - Risk for ischemic stroke has a strong genetic basis, but heritable factors also
      contribute to the extent of damage after a stroke has occurred. We previously
      identified a locus on distal mouse chromosome 7 that contributes over 50% of the 
      variation in postischemic cerebral infarct volume observed between inbred
      strains. Here, we used ancestral haplotype analysis to fine-map this locus to 12 
      candidate genes. The gene encoding the IL-21 receptor (Il21r) showed a marked
      difference in strain-specific transcription levels and coding variants in
      neonatal and adult cortical tissue. Collateral vessel connections were moderately
      reduced in Il21r-deficient mice, and cerebral infarct volume increased 2.3-fold, 
      suggesting that Il21r modulates both collateral vessel anatomy and innate
      neuroprotection. In brain slice explants, oxygen deprivation (OD) activated
      apoptotic pathways and increased neuronal cell death in IL-21 receptor-deficient 
      (IL-21R-deficient) mice compared with control animals. We determined that the
      neuroprotective effects of IL-21R arose from signaling through JAK/STAT pathways 
      and upregulation of caspase 3. Thus, natural genetic variation in murine Il21r
      influences neuronal cell viability after ischemia by modulating receptor function
      and downstream signal transduction. The identification of neuroprotective genes
      based on naturally occurring allelic variations has the potential to inform the
      development of drug targets for ischemic stroke treatment.

LID - 85794 [pii]
AB  - Hydrops fetalis describes fluid accumulation in at least 2 fetal compartments,
      including abdominal cavities, pleura, and pericardium, or in body tissue. The
      majority of hydrops fetalis cases are nonimmune conditions that present with
      generalized edema of the fetus, and approximately 15% of these nonimmune cases
      result from a lymphatic abnormality. Here, we have identified an autosomal
      dominant, inherited form of lymphatic-related (nonimmune) hydrops fetalis (LRHF).
      Independent exome sequencing projects on 2 families with a history of in utero
      and neonatal deaths associated with nonimmune hydrops fetalis uncovered 2
      heterozygous missense variants in the gene encoding Eph receptor B4 (EPHB4).
      Biochemical analysis determined that the mutant EPHB4 proteins are devoid of
      tyrosine kinase activity, indicating that loss of EPHB4 signaling contributes to 
      LRHF pathogenesis. Further, inactivation of Ephb4 in lymphatic endothelial cells 
      of developing mouse embryos led to defective lymphovenous valve formation and
      consequent subcutaneous edema. Together, these findings identify EPHB4 as a
      critical regulator of early lymphatic vascular development and demonstrate that
      mutations in the gene can cause an autosomal dominant form of LRHF that is
      associated with a high mortality rate.

TI  - Transcription factor TBX4 regulates myofibroblast accumulation and lung fibrosis.
PG  - 3063-79

LID - 85328 [pii]
AB  - Progressive tissue fibrosis is a major cause of the morbidity and mortality
      associated with repeated epithelial injuries and accumulation of myofibroblasts. 
      Successful treatment options are limited by an incomplete understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms that regulate myofibroblast accumulation. Here, we employed 
      in vivo lineage tracing and real-time gene expression transgenic reporting
      methods to analyze the early embryonic transcription factor T-box gene 4 (TBX4), 
      and determined that TBX4-lineage mesenchymal progenitors are the predominant
      source of myofibroblasts in injured adult lung. In a murine model, ablation of
      TBX4-expressing cells or disruption of TBX4 signaling attenuated lung fibrosis
      after bleomycin-induced injury. Furthermore, TBX4 regulated hyaluronan synthase 2
      production to enable fibroblast invasion of matrix both in murine models and in
      fibroblasts from patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis. These data identify
      TBX4 as a mesenchymal transcription factor that drives accumulation of
      myofibroblasts and the development of lung fibrosis. Targeting TBX4 and
      downstream factors that regulate fibroblast invasiveness could lead to
      therapeutic approaches in lung fibrosis.

PG  - 3023-35
LID - 10.1172/JCI85350 [doi]
LID - 85350 [pii]
AB  - Mutations in the T-box transcription factor TBX20 are associated with multiple
      forms of congenital heart defects, including cardiac septal abnormalities, but
      our understanding of the contributions of endocardial TBX20 to heart development 
      remains incomplete. Here, we investigated how TBX20 interacts with endocardial
      gene networks to drive the mesenchymal and myocardial movements that are
      essential for outflow tract and atrioventricular septation. Selective ablation of
      Tbx20 in murine endocardial lineages reduced the expression of extracellular
      matrix and cell migration genes that are critical for septation. Using the assay 
      for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), 
      we identified accessible chromatin within endocardial lineages and intersected
      these data with TBX20 ChIP-seq and chromatin loop maps to determine that TBX20
      binds a conserved long-range enhancer to regulate versican (Vcan) expression. We 
      also observed reduced Vcan expression in Tbx20-deficient mice, supporting a
      direct role for TBX20 in Vcan regulation. Further, we show that the Vcan enhancer
      drove reporter gene expression in endocardial lineages in a TBX20-binding
      site-dependent manner. This work illuminates gene networks that interact with
      TBX20 to orchestrate cardiac septation and provides insight into the chromatin
      landscape of endocardial lineages during septation.

LID - 10.1172/JCI86165 [doi]
LID - 86165 [pii]
AB  - Pain is a life-long symptom in sickle cell disease (SCD) and a predictor of
      disease progression and mortality, but little is known about its molecular
      mechanisms. Here, we characterized pain in a targeted knockin mouse model of SCD 
      (TOW mouse) that exclusively expresses human alleles encoding normal alpha- and
      sickle beta-globin. TOW mice exhibited ongoing spontaneous pain behavior and
      increased sensitivity to evoked pain compared with littermate control mice
      expressing normal human hemoglobins. PKCdelta activation was elevated in the
      superficial laminae of the spinal cord dorsal horn in TOW mice, specifically in
      GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Functional inhibition and neuron-specific silencing
      of PKCdelta attenuated spontaneous pain, mechanical allodynia, and heat
      hyperalgesia in TOW mice. Furthermore, we took a hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation approach to generating a SCD model in PKCdelta-deficient mice.
      Neither spontaneous pain nor evoked pain was detected in the mice lacking
      PKCdelta despite full establishment of SCD phenotypes. These findings support a
      critical role of spinal PKCdelta in the development of chronic pain in SCD, which
      may become a potential target for pharmacological interventions.

AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the primary cause of bacterial
      meningitis. Pneumococcal bacteria penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but
      the bacterial factors that enable this process are not known. Here, we determined
      that expression of pneumococcal pilus-1, which includes the pilus adhesin RrgA,
      promotes bacterial penetration through the BBB in a mouse model. S. pneumoniae
      that colonized the respiratory epithelium and grew in the bloodstream were chains
      of variable lengths; however, the pneumococci that entered the brain were
      division-competent, spherical, single cocci that expressed adhesive
      RrgA-containing pili. The cell division protein DivIVA, which is required for an 
      ovoid shape, was localized at the poles and septum of pneumococcal chains of
      ovoid, nonseparated bacteria, but was absent in spherical, single cocci. In the
      bloodstream, a small percentage of pneumococci appeared as piliated,
      RrgA-expressing, DivIVA-negative single cocci, suggesting that only a minority of
      S. pneumoniae are poised to cross the BBB. Together, our data indicate that small
      bacterial cell size, which is signified by the absence of DivIVA, and the
      presence of an adhesive RrgA-containing pilus-1 mediate pneumococcal passage from
      the bloodstream through the BBB into the brain to cause lethal meningitis.

TI  - Developmental SHP2 dysfunction underlies cardiac hypertrophy in Noonan syndrome
      with multiple lentigines.
PG  - 2989-3005
LID - 10.1172/JCI80396 [doi]
LID - 80396 [pii]
AB  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of mortality in congenital heart
      disease (CHD). Many gene abnormalities are associated with cardiac hypertrophy,
      but their function in cardiac development is not well understood.
      Loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine
      phosphatase (PTP) SHP2, are implicated in CHD and cause Noonan syndrome with
      multiple lentigines (NSML), a condition that often presents with cardiac
      hypertrophic defects. Here, we found that NSML-associated hypertrophy stems from 
      aberrant signaling mechanisms originating in developing endocardium.
      Trabeculation and valvular hyperplasia were diminished in hearts of embryonic
      mice expressing a human NSML-associated variant of SHP2, and these defects were
      recapitulated in mice expressing NSML-associated SHP2 specifically in
      endothelial, but not myocardial or neural crest, cells. In contrast, mice with
      myocardial- but not endothelial-specific NSML SHP2 expression developed
      ventricular septal defects, suggesting that NSML-associated mutations have both
      cell-autonomous and nonautonomous functions in cardiac development. However, only
      endothelial-specific expression of NSML-associated SHP2 induced adult-onset
      cardiac hypertrophy. Further, embryos expressing the NSML-associated SHP2
      mutation exhibited aberrant AKT activity and decreased downstream forkhead box P1
      (FOXP1)/FGF and NOTCH1/EPHB2 signaling, indicating that SHP2 is required for
      regulating reciprocal crosstalk between developing endocardium and myocardium.
      Together, our data provide functional and disease-based evidence that aberrant
      SHP2 signaling during cardiac development leads to CHD and adult-onset heart
      hypertrophy.

AB  - Aggregation of alpha-synuclein contributes to the formation of Lewy bodies and
      neurites, the pathologic hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD) and
      alpha-synucleinopathies. Although a number of human mutations have been
      identified in familial PD, the mechanisms that promote alpha-synuclein
      accumulation and toxicity are poorly understood. Here, we report that
      hyperactivity of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl critically regulates
      alpha-synuclein-induced neuropathology. In mice expressing a human
      alpha-synucleinopathy-associated mutation (hA53Talpha-syn mice), deletion of the 
      gene encoding c-Abl reduced alpha-synuclein aggregation, neuropathology, and
      neurobehavioral deficits. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively active
      c-Abl in hA53Talpha-syn mice accelerated alpha-synuclein aggregation,
      neuropathology, and neurobehavioral deficits. Moreover, c-Abl activation led to
      an age-dependent increase in phosphotyrosine 39 alpha-synuclein. In human
      postmortem samples, there was an accumulation of phosphotyrosine 39
      alpha-synuclein in brain tissues and Lewy bodies of PD patients compared with
      age-matched controls. Furthermore, in vitro studies show that c-Abl
      phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at tyrosine 39 enhances alpha-synuclein
      aggregation. Taken together, this work establishes a critical role for c-Abl in
      alpha-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration and demonstrates that selective
      inhibition of c-Abl may be neuroprotective. This study further indicates that
      phosphotyrosine 39 alpha-synuclein is a potential disease indicator for PD and
      related alpha-synucleinopathies.

TI  - Donor dendritic cell-derived exosomes promote allograft-targeting immune
      response.
PG  - 2805-20
LID - 10.1172/JCI84577 [doi]
LID - 84577 [pii]
AB  - The immune response against transplanted allografts is one of the most potent
      reactions mounted by the immune system. The acute rejection response has been
      attributed to donor dendritic cells (DCs), which migrate to recipient lymphoid
      tissues and directly activate alloreactive T cells against donor MHC molecules.
      Here, using a murine heart transplant model, we determined that only a small
      number of donor DCs reach lymphoid tissues and investigated how this limited
      population of donor DCs efficiently initiates the alloreactive T cell response
      that causes acute rejection. In our mouse model, efficient passage of donor MHC
      molecules to recipient conventional DCs (cDCs) was dependent on the transfer of
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) from donor DCs that migrated from the graft to
      lymphoid tissues. These EVs shared characteristics with exosomes and were
      internalized or remained attached to the recipient cDCs. Recipient cDCs that
      acquired exosomes became activated and triggered full activation of alloreactive 
      T cells. Depletion of recipient cDCs after cardiac transplantation drastically
      decreased presentation of donor MHC molecules to directly alloreactive T cells
      and delayed graft rejection in mice. These findings support a key role for
      transfer of donor EVs in the generation of allograft-targeting immune responses
      and suggest that interrupting this process has potential to dampen the immune
      response to allografts.

PG  - 3058-62
LID - 10.1172/JCI86508 [doi]
LID - 86508 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are characterized by myofibroblast
      proliferation and an inflammatory cell infiltrate. Little is known about the
      molecular pathways that precipitate IMT formation. Here, we report the
      identification of somatic mutations in UPF1, a gene that encodes an essential
      component of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, in 13 of 15 pulmonary
      IMT samples. The majority of mutations occurred in a specific region of UPF1 and 
      triggered UPF1 alternative splicing. Several mRNA targets of the NMD pathway were
      upregulated in IMT samples, indicating that the UPF1 mutations led to reduced NMD
      magnitude. These upregulated NMD targets included NIK mRNA, which encodes a
      potent activator of NF-kappaB. In human lung cells, UPF1 depletion increased
      expression of chemokine-encoding genes in a NIK-dependent manner. Elevated
      chemokines and IgE class switching events were observed in IMT samples,
      consistent with NIK upregulation in these tumors. Together, these results support
      a model in which UPF1 mutations downregulate NMD, leading to NIK-dependent
      NF-kappaB induction, which contributes to the immune infiltration that is
      characteristic of IMTs. The molecular link between the NMD pathway and IMTs has
      implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors.

PG  - 2404-11

LID - 86892 [pii]
AB  - A major subset of human cancers shows evidence for spontaneous adaptive immunity,
      which is reflected by the presence of infiltrating CD8+ T cells specific for
      tumor antigens within the tumor microenvironment. This observation has raised the
      question of which innate immune sensing pathway might detect the presence of
      cancer and lead to a natural adaptive antitumor immune response in the absence of
      exogenous infectious pathogens. Evidence for a critical functional role for type 
      I IFNs led to interrogation of candidate innate immune sensing pathways that
      might be triggered by tumor presence and induce type I IFN production. Such
      analyses have revealed a major role for the stimulator of IFN genes pathway
      (STING pathway), which senses cytosolic tumor-derived DNA within the cytosol of
      tumor-infiltrating DCs. Activation of this pathway is correlated with IFN-beta
      production and induction of antitumor T cells. Based on the biology of this
      natural immune response, pharmacologic agonists of the STING pathway are being
      developed to augment and optimize STING activation as a cancer therapy.
      Intratumoral administration of STING agonists results in remarkable therapeutic
      activity in mouse models, and STING agonists are being carried forward into phase
      I clinical testing.

TI  - Current concepts of severe asthma.
PG  - 2394-403
LID - 10.1172/JCI84144 [doi]
LID - 84144 [pii]
AB  - The term asthma encompasses a disease spectrum with mild to very severe disease
      phenotypes whose traditional common characteristic is reversible airflow
      limitation. Unlike milder disease, severe asthma is poorly controlled by the
      current standard of care. Ongoing studies using advanced molecular and
      immunological tools along with improved clinical classification show that severe 
      asthma does not identify a specific patient phenotype, but rather includes
      patients with constant medical needs, whose pathobiologic and clinical
      characteristics vary widely. Accordingly, in recent clinical trials, therapies
      guided by specific patient characteristics have had better outcomes than previous
      therapies directed to any subject with a diagnosis of severe asthma. However,
      there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the full scope of this
      disease that hinder the development of effective treatments for all severe
      asthmatics. In this Review, we discuss our current state of knowledge regarding
      severe asthma, highlighting different molecular and immunological pathways that
      can be targeted for future therapeutic development.

LID - 88617 [pii]
AB  - The severe liver pathology of untreated Wilson disease (WD) is associated with
      massive copper overload caused by mutations in a liver-specific
      copper-transporting ATPase, ATP7B. While early, presymptomatic detection and
      chelation with conventional copper-binding molecules enables effective and
      life-saving treatment, liver transplantation is the sole option currently
      available for those with advanced disease. In this issue of the JCI,
      Lichtmannegger, Leitzinger, and colleagues delineate the therapeutic effect of
      methanobactin (MB), a potent bacterial copper-binding protein, at three late
      stages of disease in a WD rat model. Their results suggest that a formal clinical
      trial of MB in human subjects with severe hepatic pathology caused by WD would be
      rational.

PG  - 2745-56
LID - 10.1172/JCI85996 [doi]
LID - 85996 [pii]
AB  - In HIV-1-infected patients, increased numbers of circulating CD8+ T cells are
      linked to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Here, we identified a
      bystander mechanism that promotes CD8 T cell activation and expansion in
      untreated HIV-1-infected patients. Compared with healthy controls, untreated
      HIV-1-infected patients have an increased population of proliferating, granzyme
      B+, CD8+ T cells in circulation. Vbeta expression and deep sequencing of CDR3
      revealed that in untreated HIV-1 infection, cycling memory CD8 T cells possess a 
      broad T cell repertoire that reflects the repertoire of the resting population.
      This suggests that cycling is driven by bystander activation, rather than
      specific antigen exposure. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with
      IL-15 induced a cycling, granzyme B+ phenotype in CD8+ T cells. Moreover,
      elevated IL-15 expression in the lymph nodes of untreated HIV-1-infected patients
      correlated with circulating CD8+ T cell counts and was normalized in these
      patients following antiretroviral therapy. Together, these results suggest that
      IL-15 drives bystander activation of CD8+ T cells, which predicts disease
      progression in untreated HIV-1-infected patients and suggests that elevated IL-15
      may also drive CD8+ T cell expansion that is linked to increased morbidity and
      mortality in treated patients.

TI  - SORLA facilitates insulin receptor signaling in adipocytes and exacerbates
      obesity.
PG  - 2706-20
LID - 10.1172/JCI84708 [doi]
LID - 84708 [pii]
AB  - In humans, genetic variation of sortilin-related receptor, L(DLR class) A repeats
      containing (SORL1), which encodes the intracellular sorting receptor SORLA, is a 
      major genetic risk factor for familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease.
      Recent GWAS analysis has also associated SORL1 with obesity in humans and in
      mouse models, suggesting that this receptor may play a role in regulating
      metabolism. Here, using mouse models with genetic loss or tissue-specific
      overexpression of SORLA as well as data from obese human subjects, we observed a 
      gene-dosage effect that links SORLA expression to obesity and glucose tolerance. 
      Overexpression of human SORLA in murine adipose tissue blocked hydrolysis of
      triacylglycerides and caused excessive adiposity. In contrast, Sorl1 gene
      inactivation in mice accelerated breakdown of triacylglycerides in adipocytes and
      protected animals from diet-induced obesity. We then identified the underlying
      molecular mechanism whereby SORLA promotes insulin-induced suppression of
      lipolysis in adipocytes. Specifically, we determined that SORLA acts as a sorting
      factor for the insulin receptor (IR) that redirects internalized receptor
      molecules from endosomes to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing IR surface
      expression and strengthening insulin signal reception in target cells. Our
      findings provide a molecular mechanism for the association of SORL1 with human
      obesity and confirm a genetic link between neurodegeneration and metabolism that 
      converges on the receptor SORLA.

AB  - In Wilson disease (WD), functional loss of ATPase copper-transporting beta
      (ATP7B) impairs biliary copper excretion, leading to excessive copper
      accumulation in the liver and fulminant hepatitis. Current US Food and Drug
      Administration- and European Medicines Agency-approved pharmacological treatments
      usually fail to restore copper homeostasis in patients with WD who have
      progressed to acute liver failure, leaving liver transplantation as the only
      viable treatment option. Here, we investigated the therapeutic utility of
      methanobactin (MB), a peptide produced by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, which 
      has an exceptionally high affinity for copper. We demonstrated that
      ATP7B-deficient rats recapitulate WD-associated phenotypes, including hepatic
      copper accumulation, liver damage, and mitochondrial impairment. Short-term
      treatment of these rats with MB efficiently reversed mitochondrial impairment and
      liver damage in the acute stages of liver copper accumulation compared with that 
      seen in untreated ATP7B-deficient rats. This beneficial effect was associated
      with depletion of copper from hepatocyte mitochondria. Moreover, MB treatment
      prevented hepatocyte death, subsequent liver failure, and death in the rodent
      model. These results suggest that MB has potential as a therapeutic agent for the
      treatment of acute WD.

TI  - CKAP4 is a Dickkopf1 receptor and is involved in tumor progression.
PG  - 2689-705
LID - 10.1172/JCI84658 [doi]
LID - 84658 [pii]
AB  - Dickkopf1 (DKK1) is a secretory protein that antagonizes oncogenic Wnt signaling 
      by binding to the Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
      6 (LRP6). DKK1 may also regulate its own signaling to promote cancer cell
      proliferation, but the mechanism is not understood. Here, we identified
      cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) as a DKK1 receptor and evaluated
      CKAP4-mediated DKK1 signaling in cancer cell proliferation. We determined that
      DKK1 binds CKAP4 and LRP6 with similar affinity but interacts with these 2
      receptors with different cysteine-rich domains. DKK1 induced internalization of
      CKAP4 in a clathrin-dependent manner, further supporting CKAP4 as a receptor for 
      DKK1. DKK1/CKAP4 signaling activated AKT by forming a complex between the
      proline-rich domain of CKAP4 and the Src homology 3 domain of PI3K, resulting in 
      proliferation of normal cells and cancer cells. Expression of DKK1 and CKAP4 was 
      frequent in tumor lesions of human pancreatic and lung cancers, and simultaneous 
      expression of both proteins in patient tumors was negatively correlated with
      prognosis and relapse-free survival. An anti-CKAP4 antibody blocked the binding
      of DKK1 to CKAP4, suppressed AKT activity in a human cancer cell line, and
      attenuated xenograft tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. Together, our
      results suggest that CKAP4 is a potential therapeutic target for cancers that
      express both DKK1 and CKAP4.

TI  - gamma-Secretase inhibitor-resistant glioblastoma stem cells require RBPJ to
      propagate.
PG  - 2415-8
LID - 10.1172/JCI88619 [doi]
LID - 88619 [pii]
AB  - Targeting glioblastoma stem cells with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) disrupts
      the Notch pathway and has shown some benefit in both pre-clinical models and in
      patients during phase I/II clinical trials. However, it is largely unknown why
      some glioblastoma (GBM) does not respond to GSI treatment. In this issue of the
      JCI, Xie et al. determined that GSI-resistant brain tumor-initiating cells
      (BTICs) from GBM express a higher level of the gene RBPJ, which encodes a
      mediator of canonical Notch signaling, compared to non-BTICs. Knockdown of RBPJ
      in BTICs decreased propagation in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis.
      Interestingly, RBPJ was shown to regulate a different transcription program than 
      Notch in BTICs by binding CDK9, thereby affecting Pol II-regulated transcript
      elongation. Targeting CDK9 or c-MYC, an upstream regulator of RBPJ, with small
      molecules also decreased BTIC propagation, and prolonged survival in mice bearing
      orthotopic GBM xenografts. This study not only provides a mechanism for GSI
      treatment resistance, but also identifies two potential therapeutic strategies to
      target GSI-resistant BTICs.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that microbes have a large influence on immune
      function. Previous studies have linked pathogenic microorganisms with decreased
      allograft tolerance and subsequent rejection. In this issue of the JCI, Lei and
      colleagues demonstrate that commensal organisms also influence the host response 
      to allograft transplantation. Using murine skin and cardiac transplant models,
      the authors demonstrate that allograft rejection is accelerated in mice with a
      normal microbiome compared with germ-free animals and antibiotic-treated mice.
      The increased graft rejection observed in conventional animals was due to
      enhanced T cell priming and was mediated through type I IFN. Together, these
      results suggest that altering a patient's microbial community prior to transplant
      could improve allograft acceptance.

PG  - 2419-21
LID - 10.1172/JCI88620 [doi]
LID - 88620 [pii]
AB  - The secretory protein Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) is a known Wnt antagonist and has been
      shown to suppress tumorigenesis in some cancer cells; however, it is also
      upregulated in many types of cancer and associated with poor prognosis.
      Wnt-independent mechanisms by which DKK-1 promotes cancer cell proliferation are 
      not well understood. In this issue of the JCI, Kimura and colleagues demonstrate 
      that DKK-1 interacts with cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) to promote
      activation of AKT. They show that both DKK-1 and CKAP4 are frequently upregulated
      in pancreatic and lung cancers. Importantly, targeting this interaction with an
      anti-CKAP4 antibody prevented tumor formation in murine xenograft models. These
      results identify a previously unrecognized DKK-1-mediated pathway and suggest
      CKAP4 as a potential therapeutic target for certain cancers.

AB  - Glioblastomas co-opt stem cell regulatory pathways to maintain brain
      tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), also known as cancer stem cells. NOTCH signaling 
      has been a molecular target in BTICs, but NOTCH antagonists have demonstrated
      limited efficacy in clinical trials. Recombining binding protein suppressor of
      hairless (RBPJ) is considered a central transcriptional mediator of NOTCH
      activity. Here, we report that pharmacologic NOTCH inhibitors were less effective
      than targeting RBPJ in suppressing tumor growth. While NOTCH inhibitors decreased
      canonical NOTCH gene expression, RBPJ regulated a distinct profile of genes
      critical to BTIC stemness and cell cycle progression. RBPJ was preferentially
      expressed by BTICs and required for BTIC self-renewal and tumor growth. MYC, a
      key BTIC regulator, bound the RBPJ promoter and treatment with a bromodomain and 
      extraterminal domain (BET) family bromodomain inhibitor decreased MYC and RBPJ
      expression. Proteomic studies demonstrated that RBPJ binds CDK9, a component of
      positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), to target gene promoters,
      enhancing transcriptional elongation. Collectively, RBPJ links MYC and
      transcriptional control through CDK9, providing potential nodes of fragility for 
      therapeutic intervention, potentially distinct from NOTCH.

AB  - Transplantation is the only cure for end-stage organ failure, but without
      immunosuppression, T cells rapidly reject allografts. While genetic disparities
      between donor and recipient are major determinants of the kinetics of transplant 
      rejection, little is known about the contribution of environmental factors.
      Because colonized organs have worse transplant outcome than sterile organs, we
      tested the influence of host and donor microbiota on skin transplant rejection.
      Compared with untreated conventional mice, pretreatment of donors and recipients 
      with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) or use of germ-free (GF) donors and
      recipients resulted in prolonged survival of minor antigen-mismatched skin
      grafts. Increased graft survival correlated with reduced type I IFN signaling in 
      antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and decreased priming of alloreactive T cells.
      Colonization of GF mice with fecal material from untreated conventional mice, but
      not from Abx-pretreated mice, enhanced the ability of APCs to prime alloreactive 
      T cells and accelerated graft rejection, suggesting that alloimmunity is
      modulated by the composition of microbiota rather than the quantity of bacteria. 
      Abx pretreatment of conventional mice also delayed rejection of major
      antigen-mismatched skin and MHC class II-mismatched cardiac allografts. This
      study demonstrates that Abx pretreatment prolongs graft survival, suggesting that
      targeting microbial constituents is a potential therapeutic strategy for
      enhancing graft acceptance.

      cells.

LID - 10.1172/JCI85738 [doi]
LID - 85738 [pii]
AB  - Interactions between the epidermis and the immune system govern epidermal tissue 
      homeostasis. These epidermis-immune interactions are altered in the inflammatory 
      disease psoriasis; however, the pathways that underlie this aberrant immune
      response are not well understood. Here, we determined that Ras-related C3
      botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) is a key mediator of epidermal dysfunction.
      RAC1 activation was consistently elevated in psoriatic epidermis and primary
      psoriatic human keratinocytes (PHKCs) exposed to psoriasis-related stimuli, but
      not in skin from patients with basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Expression of a 
      constitutively active form of RAC1 (RACV12) in mice resulted in the development
      of lesions similar to those of human psoriasis that required the presence of an
      intact immune system. RAC1V12-expressing mice and human psoriatic skin showed
      similar RAC1-dependent signaling as well as transcriptional overlap of
      differentially expressed epidermal and immune pathways. Coculture of PHKCs with
      immunocytes resulted in the upregulation of RAC1-dependent proinflammatory
      cytokines, an effect that was reproduced by overexpressing RAC1 in normal human
      keratinocytes. In keratinocytes, modulating RAC1 activity altered
      differentiation, proliferation, and inflammatory pathways, including STAT3,
      NFkappaB, and zinc finger protein 750 (ZNF750). Finally, RAC1 inhibition in
      xenografts composed of human PHKCs and immunocytes abolished psoriasiform
      hyperplasia and inflammation in vivo. These studies implicate RAC1 as a potential
      therapeutic target for psoriasis and as a key orchestrator of pathologic
      epidermis-immune interactions.

LID - 10.1172/JCI85796 [doi]
LID - 85796 [pii]
AB  - Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) interaction with PD-1 induces T cell exhaustion
      and is a therapeutic target to enhance immune responses against cancer and
      chronic infections. In murine bone marrow transplant models, PD-L1 expression on 
      host target tissues reduces the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
      PD-L1 is also expressed on T cells; however, it is unclear whether PD-L1 on this 
      population influences immune function. Here, we examined the effects of PD-L1
      modulation of T cell function in GVHD. In patients with severe GVHD, PD-L1
      expression was increased on donor T cells. Compared with mice that received WT T 
      cells, GVHD was reduced in animals that received T cells from Pdl1-/- donors.
      PD-L1-deficient T cells had reduced expression of gut homing receptors,
      diminished production of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced rates of apoptosis.
      Moreover, multiple bioenergetic pathways, including aerobic glycolysis, oxidative
      phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism, were also reduced in T cells lacking 
      PD-L1. Finally, the reduction of acute GVHD lethality in mice that received
      Pdl1-/- donor cells did not affect graft-versus-leukemia responses. These data
      demonstrate that PD-L1 selectively enhances T cell-mediated immune responses,
      suggesting a context-dependent function of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, and suggest
      selective inhibition of PD-L1 on donor T cells as a potential strategy to prevent
      or ameliorate GVHD.

TI  - Glycolysis determines dichotomous regulation of T cell subsets in hypoxia.
PG  - 2678-88
LID - 10.1172/JCI85834 [doi]
LID - 85834 [pii]
AB  - Hypoxia occurs in many pathological conditions, including chronic inflammation
      and tumors, and is considered to be an inhibitor of T cell function. However,
      robust T cell responses occur at many hypoxic inflammatory sites, suggesting that
      functions of some subsets are stimulated under low oxygen conditions. Here, we
      investigated how hypoxic conditions influence human T cell functions and found
      that, in contrast to naive and central memory T cells (TN and TCM), hypoxia
      enhances the proliferation, viability, and cytotoxic action of effector memory T 
      cells (TEM). Enhanced TEM expansion in hypoxia corresponded to high
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) expression and glycolytic activity
      compared with that observed in TN and TCM. We determined that the glycolytic
      enzyme GAPDH negatively regulates HIF1A expression by binding to
      adenylate-uridylate-rich elements in the 3'-UTR region of HIF1A mRNA in
      glycolytically inactive TN and TCM. Conversely, active glycolysis with decreased 
      GAPDH availability in TEM resulted in elevated HIF1alpha expression. Furthermore,
      GAPDH overexpression reduced HIF1alpha expression and impaired proliferation and 
      survival of T cells in hypoxia, indicating that high glycolytic metabolism drives
      increases in HIF1alpha to enhance TEM function during hypoxia. This work
      demonstrates that glycolytic metabolism regulates the translation of HIF1A to
      determine T cell responses to hypoxia and implicates GAPDH as a potential
      mechanism for controlling T cell function in peripheral tissue.

TI  - CD47-blocking immunotherapies stimulate macrophage-mediated destruction of
      small-cell lung cancer.
PG  - 2610-20
LID - 10.1172/JCI81603 [doi]
LID - 81603 [pii]
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive subtype of lung cancer with 
      limited treatment options. CD47 is a cell-surface molecule that promotes immune
      evasion by engaging signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), which serves as 
      an inhibitory receptor on macrophages. Here, we found that CD47 is highly
      expressed on the surface of human SCLC cells; therefore, we investigated
      CD47-blocking immunotherapies as a potential approach for SCLC treatment.
      Disruption of the interaction of CD47 with SIRPalpha using anti-CD47 antibodies
      induced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of human SCLC patient cells in culture. 
      In a murine model, administration of CD47-blocking antibodies or targeted
      inactivation of the Cd47 gene markedly inhibited SCLC tumor growth. Furthermore, 
      using comprehensive antibody arrays, we identified several possible therapeutic
      targets on the surface of SCLC cells. Antibodies to these targets, including
      CD56/neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), promoted phagocytosis in human SCLC
      cell lines that was enhanced when combined with CD47-blocking therapies. In light
      of recent clinical trials for CD47-blocking therapies in cancer treatment, these 
      findings identify disruption of the CD47/SIRPalpha axis as a potential
      immunotherapeutic strategy for SCLC. This approach could enable personalized
      immunotherapeutic regimens in patients with SCLC and other cancers.

AB  - Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway impairs hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      functions and promotes leukemogenesis. mTORC1 and mTORC2 differentially control
      normal and leukemic stem cell functions. mTORC1 regulates p70 ribosomal protein
      S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding (eIF4E-binding)
      protein 1 (4E-BP1), and mTORC2 modulates AKT activation. Given the extensive
      crosstalk that occurs between mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways, we assessed
      the role of the mTORC1 substrate S6K1 in the regulation of both normal HSC
      functions and in leukemogenesis driven by the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion
      oncogene MLL-AF9. We demonstrated that S6K1 deficiency impairs self-renewal of
      murine HSCs by reducing p21 expression. Loss of S6K1 also improved survival in
      mice transplanted with MLL-AF9-positive leukemic stem cells by modulating AKT and
      4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that S6K1 acts
      through multiple targets of the mTOR pathway to promote self-renewal and leukemia
      progression. Given the recent interest in S6K1 as a potential therapeutic target 
      in cancer, our results further support targeting this molecule as a potential
      strategy for treatment of myeloid malignancies.

PG  - 2626-41
LID - 10.1172/JCI84637 [doi]
LID - 84637 [pii]
AB  - Although Notch signaling is deregulated in prostate cancer, the role of this
      pathway in disease development and progression is not fully understood. Here, we 
      analyzed 2 human prostate cancer data sets and found that higher Notch signaling 
      correlates with increased metastatic potential and worse disease survival rates. 
      We used the Pten-null mouse prostate cancer model to investigate the function of 
      Notch signaling in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Disruption 
      of the transcription factor RBPJ in Pten-null mice revealed that endogenous
      canonical Notch signaling is not required for disease initiation and progression.
      However, augmentation of Notch activity in this model promoted both proliferation
      and apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells, which collectively reduced the
      primary tumor burden. The increase in cellular apoptosis was linked to DNA
      damage-induced p53 activation. Despite a reduced primary tumor burden, Notch
      activation in Pten-null mice promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
      FOXC2-dependent tumor metastases but did not confer resistance to androgen
      deprivation. Notch activation also resulted in transformation of seminal vesicle 
      epithelial cells in Pten-null mice. Our study highlights a multifaceted role for 
      Notch signaling in distinct aspects of prostate cancer biology and supports Notch
      as a potential therapeutic target for metastatic prostate cancer.

TI  - Clinical responses with T lymphocytes targeting malignancy-associated kappa light
      chains.
PG  - 2588-96
LID - 10.1172/JCI86000 [doi]
LID - 86000 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of B cell malignancies with adoptive transfer of T cells
      with a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) shows remarkable clinical
      efficacy. However, long-term persistence of T cells targeting CD19, a pan-B cell 
      marker, also depletes normal B cells and causes severe hypogammaglobulinemia.
      Here, we developed a strategy to target B cell malignancies more selectively by
      taking advantage of B cell light Ig chain restriction. We generated a CAR that is
      specific for the kappa light chain (kappa.CAR) and therefore recognizes
      kappa-restricted cells and spares the normal B cells expressing the nontargeted
      lambda light chain, thus potentially minimizing humoral immunity impairment.
      METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial and treated 16 patients with
      relapsed or refractory kappa+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (NHL/CLL) or multiple myeloma (MM) with autologous T cells genetically modified
      to express kappa.CAR (kappa.CARTs). Other treatments were discontinued in 11 of
      the 16 patients at least 4 weeks prior to T cell infusion. Six patients without
      lymphopenia received 12.5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide 4 days before kappa.CART
      infusion (0.2 x 108 to 2 x 108 kappa.CARTs/m2). No other lymphodepletion was
      used. RESULTS: kappa.CART expansion peaked 1-2 weeks after infusion, and cells
      remained detectable for more than 6 weeks. Of 9 patients with relapsed NHL or
      CLL, 2 entered complete remission after 2 and 3 infusions of kappa.CARTs, and 1
      had a partial response. Of 7 patients with MM, 4 had stable disease lasting 2-17 
      months. No toxicities attributable to kappa.CARTs were observed. CONCLUSION:
      kappa.CART infusion is feasible and safe and can lead to complete clinical
      responses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00881920. FUNDING: National

TI  - p66Shc regulates renal vascular tone in hypertension-induced nephropathy.
PG  - 2533-46
LID - 10.1172/JCI75079 [doi]
LID - 75079 [pii]
AB  - Renal preglomerular arterioles regulate vascular tone to ensure a large pressure 
      gradient over short distances, a function that is extremely important for
      maintaining renal microcirculation. Regulation of renal microvascular tone is
      impaired in salt-sensitive (SS) hypertension-induced nephropathy, but the
      molecular mechanisms contributing to this impairment remain elusive. Here, we
      assessed the contribution of the SH2 adaptor protein p66Shc (encoded by Shc1) in 
      regulating renal vascular tone and the development of renal vascular dysfunction 
      associated with hypertension-induced nephropathy. We generated a panel of mutant 
      rat strains in which specific modifications of Shc1 were introduced into the Dahl
      SS rats. In SS rats, overexpression of p66Shc was linked to increased renal
      damage. Conversely, deletion of p66Shc from these rats restored the myogenic
      responsiveness of renal preglomerular arterioles ex vivo and promoted cellular
      contraction in primary vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that were isolated
      from renal vessels. In primary SMCs, p66Shc restricted the activation of
      transient receptor potential cation channels to attenuate cytosolic Ca2+ influx, 
      implicating a mechanism by which overexpression of p66Shc impairs renal vascular 
      reactivity. These results establish the adaptor protein p66Shc as a regulator of 
      renal vascular tone and a driver of impaired renal vascular function in
      hypertension-induced nephropathy.

AB  - Diminished inhibitory neurotransmission in the superficial dorsal horn of the
      spinal cord is thought to contribute to chronic pain. In inflammatory pain,
      reductions in synaptic inhibition occur partially through prostaglandin E2-
      (PGE2-) and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of a specific subtype of glycine
      receptors (GlyRs) that contain alpha3 subunits. Here, we demonstrated that
      2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (2,6-DTBP), a nonanesthetic propofol derivative, reverses
      inflammation-mediated disinhibition through a specific interaction with
      heteromeric alphabetaGlyRs containing phosphorylated alpha3 subunits. We
      expressed mutant GlyRs in HEK293T cells, and electrophysiological analyses of
      these receptors showed that 2,6-DTBP interacted with a conserved phenylalanine
      residue in the membrane-associated stretch between transmembrane regions 3 and 4 
      of the GlyR alpha3 subunit. In native murine spinal cord tissue, 2,6-DTBP
      modulated synaptic, presumably alphabeta heteromeric, GlyRs only after priming
      with PGE2. This observation is consistent with results obtained from molecular
      modeling of the alpha-beta subunit interface and suggests that in
      alpha3betaGlyRs, the binding site is accessible to 2,6-DTBP only after
      PKA-dependent phosphorylation. In murine models of inflammatory pain, 2,6-DTBP
      reduced inflammatory hyperalgesia in an alpha3GlyR-dependent manner. Together,
      our data thus establish that selective potentiation of GlyR function is a
      promising strategy against chronic inflammatory pain and that, to our knowledge, 
      2,6-DTBP has a unique pharmacological profile that favors an interaction with
      GlyRs that have been primed by peripheral inflammation.

      variable expressivity.

LID - 85830 [pii]
AB  - Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a devastating eye disease and an important
      cause of childhood blindness worldwide. In PCG, defects in the anterior chamber
      aqueous humor outflow structures of the eye result in elevated intraocular
      pressure (IOP); however, the genes and molecular mechanisms involved in the
      etiology of these defects have not been fully characterized. Previously, we
      observed PCG-like phenotypes in transgenic mice that lack functional
      angiopoietin-TEK signaling. Herein, we identified rare TEK variants in 10 of 189 
      unrelated PCG families and demonstrated that each mutation results in
      haploinsufficiency due to protein loss of function. Multiple cellular mechanisms 
      were responsible for the loss of protein function resulting from individual TEK
      variants, including an absence of normal protein production, protein aggregate
      formation, enhanced proteasomal degradation, altered subcellular localization,
      and reduced responsiveness to ligand stimulation. Further, in mice, hemizygosity 
      for Tek led to the formation of severely hypomorphic Schlemm's canal and
      trabecular meshwork, as well as elevated IOP, demonstrating that anterior chamber
      vascular development is sensitive to Tek gene dosage and the resulting decrease
      in angiopoietin-TEK signaling. Collectively, these results identify TEK mutations
      in patients with PCG that likely underlie disease and are transmitted in an
      autosomal dominant pattern with variable expressivity.

AB  - The extramural General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) program has been funded
      for more than 50 years, first by the National Center for Research Resources, NIH,
      and more recently as part of the Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA)
      program through the newly formed National Center for Advancing Translation
      Sciences (NCATS). The GCRCs represent the federally funded laboratories that
      employ a highly trained cadre of research nurses, dietitians, and other support
      staff and in which generations of clinical investigators trained and performed
      groundbreaking human studies that advanced medical science and improved clinical 
      care. Without the opportunity for adequate discussion, NCATS has now stopped
      funding these Research Centers. In this "eulogy," we review the origins and
      history of the GCRCs, their contributions to the advancement of medicine, and the
      recent events that have essentially defunded them. We mourn their loss.

TI  - GABA interneurons mediate the rapid antidepressant-like effects of scopolamine.
PG  - 2482-94

LID - 85033 [pii]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a recurring psychiatric illness that causes
      substantial health and socioeconomic burdens. Clinical reports have revealed that
      scopolamine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist,
      produces rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with MDD. Preclinical models
      suggest that these rapid antidepressant effects can be recapitulated with
      blockade of M1-type muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1-AChR); however, the
      cellular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent synaptic and behavioral
      responses to scopolamine have not been determined. Here, we demonstrate that the 
      antidepressant-like effects of scopolamine are mediated by GABA interneurons in
      the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Both GABAergic (GAD67+) interneurons and
      glutamatergic (CaMKII+) interneurons in the mPFC expressed M1-AChR. In mice,
      viral-mediated knockdown of M1-AChR specifically in GABAergic neurons, but not
      glutamatergic neurons, in the mPFC attenuated the antidepressant-like effects of 
      scopolamine. Immunohistology and electrophysiology showed that somatostatin (SST)
      interneurons in the mPFC express M1-AChR at higher levels than parvalbumin
      interneurons. Moreover, knockdown of M1-AChR in SST interneurons in the mPFC
      demonstrated that M1-AChR expression in these neurons is required for the rapid
      antidepressant-like effects of scopolamine. These data indicate that SST
      interneurons in the mPFC are a promising pharmacological target for developing
      rapid-acting antidepressant therapies.

TI  - Persistent 7-tesla phase rim predicts poor outcome in new multiple sclerosis
      patient lesions.
PG  - 2597-609
LID - 10.1172/JCI86198 [doi]
LID - 86198 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In some active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, a strong immune
      reaction at the lesion edge may contain growth and thereby isolate the lesion
      from the surrounding parenchyma. Our previous studies suggest that this process
      involves opening of the blood-brain barrier in capillaries at the lesion edge,
      seen on MRI as centripetal contrast enhancement and a colocalized phase rim. We
      hypothesized that using these features to characterize early lesion evolution
      will allow in vivo tracking of tissue degeneration and/or repair, thus improving 
      the evaluation of potential therapies for chronic active lesions. METHODS:
      Centripetally and centrifugally enhancing lesions were studied in 17 patients
      with MS using 7-tesla MRI. High-resolution, susceptibility-weighted, T1-weighted 
      (before/after gadolinium), and dynamic contrast-enhanced scans were acquired at
      baseline and months 1, 3, 6, and 12. For each lesion, time evolution of the phase
      rim, lesion volume, and T1 hypointensity were assessed. In autopsies of 3
      progressive MS cases, the histopathology of the phase rim was determined.
      RESULTS: In centripetal lesions, a phase rim colocalized with initial contrast
      enhancement. In 12 of 22, this phase rim persisted after enhancement resolved.
      Compared with centripetal lesions with transient rim, those with persistent rim
      had less volume shrinkage and became more T1 hypointense between months 3 and 12.
      No centrifugal lesions developed phase rims at any time point. Pathologically,
      persistent rims corresponded to an iron-laden inflammatory myeloid cell
      population at the edge of chronic demyelinated lesions. CONCLUSION: In early
      lesion evolution, a persistent phase rim in lesions that shrink least and become 
      more T1 hypointense over time suggests that the rim might mark failure of early
      lesion repair and/or irreversible tissue damage. In later stages of MS, phase rim
      lesions continue to smolder, exerting detrimental effects on affected brain
      tissue. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00001248. FUNDING: The Intramural Research Program
      of NINDS supported this study.

TI  - Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 promotes angiotensin II sensitivity in
      preeclampsia.
PG  - 2561-74

LID - 83918 [pii]
AB  - Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in which patients develop
      profound sensitivity to vasopressors, such as angiotensin II, and is associated
      with substantial morbidity for the mother and fetus. Enhanced vasoconstrictor
      sensitivity and elevations in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1), a
      circulating antiangiogenic protein, precede clinical signs and symptoms of
      preeclampsia. Here, we report that overexpression of sFlt1 in pregnant mice
      induced angiotensin II sensitivity and hypertension by impairing endothelial
      nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and promoting oxidative stress in
      the vasculature. Administration of the NOS inhibitor l-NAME to pregnant mice
      recapitulated the angiotensin sensitivity and oxidative stress observed with
      sFlt1 overexpression. Sildenafil, an FDA-approved phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor
      that enhances NO signaling, reversed sFlt1-induced hypertension and angiotensin
      II sensitivity in the preeclampsia mouse model. Sildenafil treatment also
      improved uterine blood flow, decreased uterine vascular resistance, and improved 
      fetal weights in comparison with untreated sFlt1-expressing mice. Finally, sFLT1 
      protein expression inversely correlated with reductions in eNOS phosphorylation
      in placental tissue of human preeclampsia patients. These data support the
      concept that endothelial dysfunction due to high circulating sFLT1 may be the
      primary event leading to enhanced vasoconstrictor sensitivity that is
      characteristic of preeclampsia and suggest that targeting sFLT1-induced pathways 
      may be an avenue for treating preeclampsia and improving fetal outcomes.

TI  - Transcription factor TLX1 controls retinoic acid signaling to ensure spleen
      development.
PG  - 2452-64
LID - 10.1172/JCI82956 [doi]
LID - 82956 [pii]
AB  - The molecular mechanisms that underlie spleen development and congenital
      asplenia, a condition linked to increased risk of overwhelming infections, remain
      largely unknown. The transcription factor TLX1 controls cell fate specification
      and organ expansion during spleen development, and Tlx1 deletion causes asplenia 
      in mice. Deregulation of TLX1 expression has recently been proposed in the
      pathogenesis of congenital asplenia in patients carrying mutations of the
      gene-encoding transcription factor SF-1. Herein, we have shown that
      TLX1-dependent regulation of retinoic acid (RA) metabolism is critical for spleen
      organogenesis. In a murine model, loss of Tlx1 during formation of the splenic
      anlage increased RA signaling by regulating several genes involved in RA
      metabolism. Uncontrolled RA activity resulted in premature differentiation of
      mesenchymal cells and reduced vasculogenesis of the splenic primordium.
      Pharmacological inhibition of RA signaling in Tlx1-deficient animals partially
      rescued the spleen defect. Finally, spleen growth was impaired in mice lacking
      either cytochrome P450 26B1 (Cyp26b1), which results in excess RA, or retinol
      dehydrogenase 10 (Rdh10), which results in RA deficiency. Together, these
      findings establish TLX1 as a critical regulator of RA metabolism and provide
      mechanistic insights into the molecular determinants of human congenital
      asplenia.

TI  - Paracellular epithelial sodium transport maximizes energy efficiency in the
      kidney.
PG  - 2509-18
LID - 10.1172/JCI83942 [doi]
LID - 83942 [pii]
AB  - Efficient oxygen utilization in the kidney may be supported by paracellular
      epithelial transport, a form of passive diffusion that is driven by preexisting
      transepithelial electrochemical gradients. Claudins are tight-junction
      transmembrane proteins that act as paracellular ion channels in epithelial cells.
      In the proximal tubule (PT) of the kidney, claudin-2 mediates paracellular sodium
      reabsorption. Here, we used murine models to investigate the role of claudin-2 in
      maintaining energy efficiency in the kidney. We found that claudin-2-null mice
      conserve sodium to the same extent as WT mice, even during profound dietary
      sodium depletion, as a result of the upregulation of transcellular Na-K-2Cl
      transport activity in the thick ascending limb of Henle. We hypothesized that
      shifting sodium transport to transcellular pathways would lead to increased
      whole-kidney oxygen consumption. Indeed, compared with control animals, oxygen
      consumption in the kidneys of claudin-2-null mice was markedly increased,
      resulting in medullary hypoxia. Furthermore, tubular injury in kidneys subjected 
      to bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury was more severe in the absence of 
      claudin-2. Our results indicate that paracellular transport in the PT is required
      for efficient utilization of oxygen in the service of sodium transport. We
      speculate that paracellular permeability may have evolved as a general strategy
      in epithelial tissues to maximize energy efficiency.

PG  - 2495-508
LID - 10.1172/JCI83361 [doi]
LID - 83361 [pii]
AB  - Loss of the growth-suppressive effects of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
      signaling has been demonstrated to promote pulmonary arterial endothelial cell
      dysfunction and induce pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC)
      proliferation, leading to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (PAH). MicroRNAs (miRs) mediate higher order regulation of cellular function
      through coordinated modulation of mRNA targets; however, miR expression is
      altered by disease development and drug therapy. Here, we examined
      treatment-naive patients and experimental models of PAH and identified a
      reduction in the levels of miR-140-5p. Inhibition of miR-140-5p promoted PASMC
      proliferation and migration in vitro. In rat models of PAH, nebulized delivery of
      miR-140-5p mimic prevented the development of PAH and attenuated the progression 
      of established PAH. Network and pathway analysis identified SMAD-specific E3
      ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SMURF1) as a key miR-140-5p target and regulator of
      BMP signaling. Evaluation of human tissue revealed that SMURF1 is increased in
      patients with PAH. miR-140-5p mimic or SMURF1 knockdown in PASMCs altered BMP
      signaling, further supporting these factors as regulators of BMP signaling.
      Finally, Smurf1 deletion protected mice from PAH, demonstrating a critical role
      in disease development. Together, these studies identify both miR-140-5p and
      SMURF1 as key regulators of disease pathology and as potential therapeutic
      targets for the treatment of PAH.

TI  - Uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain CFT073 disrupts NLRP3 inflammasome
      activation.
PG  - 2425-36

LID - 81916 [pii]
AB  - Successful bacterial pathogens produce an array of virulence factors that allow
      subversion of the immune system and persistence within the host. For example,
      uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, such as CFT073, express Toll/IL-1
      receptor-containing (TIR-containing) protein C (TcpC), which impairs TLR
      signaling, thereby suppressing innate immunity in the urinary tract and enhancing
      persistence in the kidneys. Here, we have reported that TcpC also reduces
      secretion of IL-1beta by directly interacting with the NACHT leucin-rich repeat
      PYD protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is crucial for recognition of pathogens
      within the cytosol. At a low MOI, IL-1beta secretion was minimal in
      CFT073-infected macrophages; however, IL-1beta release was markedly increased in 
      macrophages infected with CFT073 lacking tcpC. Induction of IL-1beta secretion by
      CFT073 and tcpC-deficient CFT073 required the NLRP3 inflammasome. TcpC attenuated
      activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding both NLRP3 and caspase-1 and
      thereby preventing processing and activation of caspase-1. Moreover, in a murine 
      urinary tract infection model, CFT073 infection rapidly induced expression of the
      NLRP3 inflammasome in the bladder mucosa; however, the presence of TcpC in WT
      CFT073 reduced IL-1beta levels in the urine of infected mice. Together, these
      findings illustrate how uropathogenic E. coli use the multifunctional virulence
      factor TcpC to attenuate innate immune responses in the urinary tract.

AB  - The 5th anniversary of the Fukushima disaster and the 30th anniversary of the
      Chernobyl disaster, the two most catastrophic nuclear accidents in history, both 
      occurred recently. Images of Chernobyl are replete with the international sign of
      radioactive contamination (a circle with three broad spokes radiating outward in 
      a yellow sign). In contrast, ongoing decontamination efforts at Fukushima lack
      international warnings about radioactivity. Decontamination workers at Fukushima 
      appear to be poorly protected against radiation. It is almost as if the effort is
      to make the Fukushima problem disappear. A more useful response would be to
      openly acknowledge the monumental problems inherent in managing a nuclear plant
      disaster. Lessons from Chernobyl are the best predictors of what the Fukushima
      region of Japan is coping with in terms of health and environmental problems
      following a nuclear catastrophe.

      ERK hyperactivation.

AB  - The lymphatic vasculature is essential for maintaining interstitial fluid
      homeostasis, and dysfunctional lymphangiogenesis contributes to various
      pathological processes, including inflammatory disease and tumor metastasis.
      Mutations in FOXC2 are dominantly associated with late-onset lymphedema; however,
      the precise role of FOXC2 and a closely related factor, FOXC1, in the lymphatic
      system remains largely unknown. Here we identified a molecular cascade by which
      FOXC1 and FOXC2 regulate ERK signaling in lymphatic vessel growth. In mice,
      lymphatic endothelial cell-specific (LEC-specific) deletion of Foxc1, Foxc2, or
      both resulted in increased LEC proliferation, enlarged lymphatic vessels, and
      abnormal lymphatic vessel morphogenesis. Compared with LECs from control animals,
      LECs from mice lacking both Foxc1 and Foxc2 exhibited aberrant expression of Ras 
      regulators, and embryos with LEC-specific deletion of Foxc1 and Foxc2, alone or
      in combination, exhibited ERK hyperactivation. Pharmacological ERK inhibition in 
      utero abolished the abnormally enlarged lymphatic vessels in FOXC-deficient
      embryos. Together, these results identify FOXC1 and FOXC2 as essential regulators
      of lymphangiogenesis and indicate a new potential mechanistic basis for
      lymphatic-associated diseases.

LID - 85265 [pii]
AB  - Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in
      adults, and one-third of patients develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
      Circulating autoantibodies against the podocyte surface antigens phospholipase A2
      receptor 1 (PLA2R1) and the recently identified thrombospondin type 1
      domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) are assumed to cause the disease in the majority of
      patients. The pathogenicity of these antibodies, however, has not been directly
      proven. Here, we have reported the analysis and characterization of a male
      patient with THSD7A-associated MN who progressed to ESRD and subsequently
      underwent renal transplantation. MN rapidly recurred after transplantation.
      Enhanced staining for THSD7A was observed in the kidney allograft, and detectable
      anti-THSD7A antibodies were present in the serum before and after
      transplantation, suggesting that these antibodies induced a recurrence of MN in
      the renal transplant. In contrast to PLA2R1, THSD7A was expressed on both human
      and murine podocytes, enabling the evaluation of whether anti-THSD7A antibodies
      cause MN in mice. We demonstrated that human anti-THSD7A antibodies specifically 
      bind to murine THSD7A on podocyte foot processes, induce proteinuria, and
      initiate a histopathological pattern that is typical of MN. Furthermore,
      anti-THSD7A antibodies induced marked cytoskeletal rearrangement in primary
      murine glomerular epithelial cells as well as in human embryonic kidney 293
      cells. Our findings support a causative role of anti-THSD7A antibodies in the
      development of MN.

PG  - 2465-81
LID - 10.1172/JCI82925 [doi]
LID - 82925 [pii]
AB  - High levels of arginine metabolizing enzymes, including inducible nitric oxide
      synthase (iNOS) and arginase (ARG), are typical in asthmatic airway epithelium;
      however, little is known about the metabolic effects of enhanced arginine flux in
      asthma. Here, we demonstrated that increased metabolism sustains arginine
      availability in asthmatic airway epithelium with consequences for bioenergetics
      and inflammation. Expression of iNOS, ARG2, arginine synthetic enzymes, and
      mitochondrial respiratory complexes III and IV was elevated in asthmatic lung
      samples compared with healthy controls. ARG2 overexpression in a human bronchial 
      epithelial cell line accelerated oxidative bioenergetic pathways and suppressed
      hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and phosphorylation of the signal transducer for
      atopic Th2 inflammation STAT6 (pSTAT6), both of which are implicated in asthma
      etiology. Arg2-deficient mice had lower mitochondrial membrane potential and
      greater HIF-2alpha than WT animals. In an allergen-induced asthma model, mice
      lacking Arg2 had greater Th2 inflammation than WT mice, as indicated by higher
      levels of pSTAT6, IL-13, IL-17, eotaxin, and eosinophils and more mucus
      metaplasia. Bone marrow transplants from Arg2-deficient mice did not affect
      airway inflammation in recipient mice, supporting resident lung cells as the
      drivers of elevated Th2 inflammation. These data demonstrate that arginine flux
      preserves cellular respiration and suppresses pathological signaling events that 
      promote inflammation in asthma.

LID - 83005 [pii]
AB  - Immune cell metabolism is dynamically regulated in parallel with the substantial 
      changes in cellular function that accompany immune cell activation. While these
      changes in metabolism are important for facilitating the increased energetic and 
      biosynthetic demands of activated cells, immune cell metabolism also has direct
      roles in controlling the functions of immune cells and shaping the immune
      response. A theme is emerging wherein nutrients, metabolic enzymes, and
      metabolites can act as an extension of the established immune signal transduction
      pathways, thereby adding an extra layer of complexity to the regulation of
      immunity. This Review will outline the metabolic configurations adopted by
      different immune cell subsets, describe the emerging roles for metabolic enzymes 
      and metabolites in the control of immune cell function, and discuss the
      therapeutic implications of this emerging immune regulatory axis.

AB  - RNA is likely to be the most rediscovered macromolecule in biology. Periodically,
      new non-canonical functions have been ascribed to RNA, such as the ability to act
      as a catalytic molecule or to work independently from its coding capacity. Recent
      annotations show that more than half of the transcriptome encodes for RNA
      molecules lacking coding activity. Here we illustrate how these transcripts
      affect skeletal muscle differentiation and related disorders. We discuss the most
      recent scientific discoveries that have led to the identification of the
      molecular circuitries that are controlled by RNA during the differentiation
      process and that, when deregulated, lead to pathogenic events. These findings
      will provide insights that can aid in the development of new therapeutic
      interventions for muscle diseases.

AB  - Malaria remains a global public health threat, with half of the world's
      population at risk. Despite numerous efforts in the past decade to develop new
      antimalarial drugs to surmount increasing resistance to common therapies,
      challenges remain in the expansion of the current antimalarial arsenal for the
      elimination of this disease. The requirement of prophylactic and radical cure
      activities for the next generation of antimalarial drugs demands that new
      research models be developed to support the investigation of the elusive liver
      stage of the malaria parasite. In this Review, we revisit current antimalarial
      therapies and discuss recent advances for in vitro and in vivo malaria research
      models of the liver stage and their importance in probing parasite biology and
      the discovery of novel drug candidates.

LID - 84870 [pii]
AB  - Palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) are debilitating lesions that arise in individuals
      with pachyonychia congenita (PC) and feature upregulation of danger-associated
      molecular patterns and skin barrier regulators. The defining features of
      PC-associated PPK are reproduced in mice null for keratin 16 (Krt16), which is
      commonly mutated in PC patients. Here, we have shown that PPK onset is preceded
      by oxidative stress in footpad skin of Krt16-/- mice and correlates with an
      inability of keratinocytes to sustain nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 related 
      factor 2-dependent (NRF2-dependent) synthesis of the cellular antioxidant
      glutathione (GSH). Additionally, examination of plantar skin biopsies from
      individuals with PC confirmed the presence of high levels of hypophosphorylated
      NRF2 in lesional tissue. In Krt16-/- mice, genetic ablation of Nrf2 worsened
      spontaneous skin lesions and accelerated PPK development in footpad skin.
      Hypoactivity of NRF2 in Krt16-/- footpad skin correlated with decreased levels or
      activity of upstream NRF2 activators, including PKCdelta, receptor for activated 
      C kinase 1 (RACK1), and p21. Topical application of the NRF2 activator
      sulforaphane to the footpad of Krt16-/- mice prevented the development of PPK and
      normalized redox balance via regeneration of GSH from existing cellular pools.
      Together, these findings point to oxidative stress and dysfunctional NRF2 as
      contributors to PPK pathogenesis, identify K16 as a regulator of NRF2 activation,
      and suggest that pharmacological activation of NRF2 should be further explored
      for PC treatment.

LID - 10.1172/JCI84910 [doi]
LID - 84910 [pii]
AB  - The development of pathologic mucus, which is not readily cleared from the
      airways, is an important contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated
      with asthma. It is not clear how the major airway mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B are
      organized within the mucus gel or how this gel contributes to airway obstruction 
      in asthma. Here, we demonstrated that mucus plugs from individuals with fatal
      asthma are heterogeneous gels with distinct MUC5AC- and MUC5B-containing domains.
      Stimulation of cultured human bronchial epithelial cells with IL-13, a key
      mediator in asthma, induced the formation of heterogeneous mucus gels and
      dramatically impaired mucociliary transport. Impaired transport was not
      associated with defects in ciliary function but instead was related to tethering 
      of MUC5AC-containing mucus gel domains to mucus-producing cells in the
      epithelium. Replacement of tethered mucus with untethered mucus restored
      mucociliary transport. Together, our results indicate that tethering of
      MUC5AC-containing domains to the epithelium causes mucostasis and likely
      represents a major cause of mucus plugging in asthma.

TI  - Hotspot autoimmune T cell receptor binding underlies pathogen and insulin peptide
      cross-reactivity.
PG  - 2191-204
LID - 10.1172/JCI85679 [doi]
LID - 85679 [pii]
AB  - The cross-reactivity of T cells with pathogen- and self-derived peptides has been
      implicated as a pathway involved in the development of autoimmunity. However, the
      mechanisms that allow the clonal T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to functionally
      engage multiple peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) are unclear.
      Here, we studied multiligand discrimination by a human, preproinsulin reactive,
      MHC class-I-restricted CD8+ T cell clone (1E6) that can recognize over 1 million 
      different peptides. We generated high-resolution structures of the 1E6 TCR bound 
      to 7 altered peptide ligands, including a pathogen-derived peptide that was an
      order of magnitude more potent than the natural self-peptide. Evaluation of these
      structures demonstrated that binding was stabilized through a conserved
      lock-and-key-like minimal binding footprint that enables 1E6 TCR to tolerate vast
      numbers of substitutions outside of this so-called hotspot. Highly potent
      antigens of the 1E6 TCR engaged with a strong antipathogen-like binding affinity;
      this engagement was governed though an energetic switch from an enthalpically to 
      entropically driven interaction compared with the natural autoimmune ligand.
      Together, these data highlight how T cell cross-reactivity with pathogen-derived 
      antigens might break self-tolerance to induce autoimmune disease.

LID - 83476 [pii]
AB  - Valpha24-invariant natural killer T cells (NKTs) localize to tumors and have
      inherent antitumor properties, making them attractive chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR) carriers for redirected cancer immunotherapy. However, clinical application
      of CAR-NKTs has been impeded, as mechanisms responsible for NKT expansion and the
      in vivo persistence of these cells are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that
      antigen-induced expansion of primary NKTs in vitro associates with the
      accumulation of a CD62L+ subset and exhaustion of CD62L- cells. Only CD62L+ NKTs 
      survived and proliferated in response to secondary stimulation. When transferred 
      to immune-deficient NSG mice, CD62L+ NKTs persisted 5 times longer than CD62L-
      NKTs. Moreover, CD62L+ cells transduced with a CD19-specific CAR achieved
      sustained tumor regression in a B cell lymphoma model. Proliferating CD62L+ cells
      downregulated or maintained CD62L expression when activated via T cell receptor
      alone or in combination with costimulatory receptors. We generated HLAnull K562
      cell clones that were engineered to express CD1d and costimulatory ligands. Clone
      B-8-2 (HLAnullCD1dmedCD86high4-1BBLmedOX40Lhigh) induced the highest rates of NKT
      expansion and CD62L expression. B-8-2-expanded CAR-NKTs exhibited prolonged in
      vivo persistence and superior therapeutic activities in models of lymphoma and
      neuroblastoma. Therefore, we have identified CD62L as a marker of a distinct NKT 
      subset endowed with high proliferative potential and have developed artificial
      antigen-presenting cells that generate CD62L-enriched NKTs for effective cancer
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating multisystemic autoimmune
      disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain
      elusive. Some patients with Noonan syndrome, a congenital disorder predominantly 
      caused by gain-of-function mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase SH2
      domain-containing PTP (SHP2), have been shown to develop SLE, suggesting a
      functional correlation between phosphatase activity and systemic autoimmunity. To
      test this directly, we measured SHP2 activity in spleen lysates isolated from
      lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice and found it was markedly increased compared with that
      in control mice. Similar increases in SHP2 activity were seen in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells isolated from lupus patients relative to healthy patients. To
      determine whether SHP2 alters autoimmunity and related immunopathology, we
      treated MRL/lpr mice with an SHP2 inhibitor and found increased life span,
      suppressed crescentic glomerulonephritis, reduced spleen size, and diminished
      skin lesions. SHP2 inhibition also reduced numbers of double-negative T cells,
      normalized ERK/MAPK signaling, and decreased production of IFN-gamma and
      IL-17A/F, 2 cytokines involved in SLE-associated organ damage. Moreover, in
      cultured human lupus T cells, SHP2 inhibition reduced proliferation and decreased
      production of IFN-gamma and IL-17A/F, further implicating SHP2 in
      lupus-associated immunopathology. Taken together, these data identify SHP2 as a
      critical regulator of SLE pathogenesis and suggest targeting of its activity as a
      potent treatment for lupus patients.

AB  - The ability of a single T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to cross-react with
      multiple antigens allows the finite number of T cells within an organism to
      respond to the compendium of pathogen challenges faced during a lifetime.
      Effective immune surveillance, however, comes at a price. TCR cross-reactivity
      can allow molecular mimics to spuriously activate autoimmune T cells; it also
      underlies T cell rejection of organ transplants and drives graft-versus-host
      disease. In this issue of the JCI, Cole and colleagues provide insight into how
      an insulin-reactive T cell cross-reacts with pathogen-derived antigens by
      focusing on a limited portion of the peptides to provide a hotspot for binding.
      These findings dovetail with recent studies of alloreactive and autoimmune TCRs
      and suggest that the biochemical principles that govern conventional
      protein-protein interactions may allow the specificity and cross-reactivity
      profiles of T cells to be predicted.

      homocystinuria in murine model.
PG  - 2372-84

LID - 85396 [pii]
AB  - Homocystinuria, which typically results from cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)
      deficiency, is the most common defect of sulfur amino acid metabolism. CBS
      condenses homocysteine and serine to cystathionine that is then converted to
      cysteine. Individuals with homocystinuria have markedly elevated plasma levels of
      homocysteine and methionine and reduced concentrations of cystathionine and
      cysteine. Clinical disease manifestations include thromboembolism and
      neuropsychiatric, ocular, and skeletal complications. Here, we have shown that
      administration of PEGylated CBS into the circulation of homocystinuria model mice
      alters the extra- and intracellular equilibrium of sulfur amino acids, resulting 
      in a decrease of approximately 75% in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and
      normalization of cysteine concentrations. Moreover, the decrease in homocysteine 
      and the normalization of cysteine in PEGylated CBS-treated model mice were
      accompanied by improvement of histopathological liver symptoms and increased
      survival. Together, these data suggest that CBS enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
      is a promising approach for the treatment of homocystinuria and that ERT for
      metabolic diseases may not necessitate introduction of the deficient enzyme into 
      its natural intracellular compartment.

AB  - Inherited metabolic disorders are often characterized by the lack of an essential
      enzyme and are currently treated by dietary restriction and other strategies to
      replace the substrates or products of the missing enzyme. Patients with
      homocystinuria lack the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), and many of
      these individuals do not respond to current treatment protocols. In this issue of
      the JCI, Bublil and colleagues demonstrate that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
      provides long-term amelioration of homocystinuria-associated phenotypes in
      CBS-deficient murine models. A PEGylated form of CBS provided long-term stability
      and, when used in conjunction with the methylation agent betaine, dramatically
      increased survival in mice fed a normal diet. The results of this study provide
      one of the first examples of ERT for a metabolic disorder and suggest that
      PEGylated CBS should be further explored for use in patients.

TI  - Stabilization of histone demethylase PHF8 by USP7 promotes breast carcinogenesis.
PG  - 2205-20
LID - 10.1172/JCI85747 [doi]
LID - 85747 [pii]
AB  - The histone demethylase PHF8 has been implicated in multiple pathological
      disorders, including X-linked mental retardation and tumorigenesis. However, it
      is not clear how the abundance and function of PHF8 are regulated. Here, we
      report that PHF8 physically associates with the deubiquitinase USP7.
      Specifically, we demonstrated that USP7 promotes deubiquitination and
      stabilization of PHF8, leading to the upregulation of a group of genes, including
      cyclin A2, that are critical for cell growth and proliferation. The USP7-encoding
      gene was also transcriptionally regulated by PHF8, via positive feedback. USP7
      was overexpressed in breast carcinomas, and the level of expression positively
      correlated with expression of PHF8 and cyclin A2 and with the histological grade 
      of breast cancer. We showed that USP7 promotes breast carcinogenesis by
      stabilizing PHF8 and upregulating cyclin A2 and that the interaction between USP7
      and PHF8 is augmented during DNA damage. Moreover, USP7-promoted PHF8
      stabilization conferred cellular resistance to genotoxic insults and was required
      for the recruitment of BLM and KU70, which are both essential for DNA
      double-strand break repair. Our study mechanistically links USP7 to epigenetic
      regulation and DNA repair. Moreover, these data support the pursuit of USP7 and
      PHF8 as potential targets for breast cancer intervention, especially in
      combination with chemo- or radiotherapies.

TI  - Cotargeting MNK and MEK kinases induces the regression of NF1-mutant cancers.
PG  - 2181-90

LID - 85183 [pii]
AB  - Neurofibromin 1-mutant (NF1-mutant) cancers are driven by excessive Ras
      signaling; however, there are currently no effective therapies for these or other
      Ras-dependent tumors. While combined MEK and mTORC1 suppression causes regression
      of NF1-deficient malignancies in animal models, the potential toxicity of
      cotargeting these 2 major signaling pathways in humans may necessitate the
      identification of more refined, cancer-specific signaling nodes. Here, we have
      provided evidence that MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs), which converge on the
      mTORC1 effector eIF4E, are therapeutic targets in NF1-deficient malignancies.
      Specifically, we evaluated primary human NF1-deficient peripheral nervous system 
      tumors and found that MNKs are activated in the majority of tumors tested.
      Genetic and chemical suppression of MNKs in NF1-deficient murine tumor models and
      human cell lines potently cooperated with MEK inhibitors to kill these cancers
      through effects on eIF4E. We also demonstrated that MNK kinases are important and
      direct targets of cabozantinib. Accordingly, coadministration of cabozantinib and
      MEK inhibitors triggered dramatic regression in an aggressive genetically
      engineered tumor model. The cytotoxicity of this combination required the
      suppression of MNK-induced eIF4E phosphorylation and was not recapitulated by
      suppressing other cabozantinib targets. Collectively, these studies demonstrate
      that combined MNK and MEK suppression represents a promising therapeutic strategy
      for these incurable Ras-driven tumors and highlight the utility of developing
      selective MNK inhibitors for these and possibly other malignancies.

AB  - Antibodies that target the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death
      protein 1 (PD-1) have resulted in prolonged and beneficial responses toward a
      variety of human cancers. However, anti-PD-1 therapy in some patients provides no
      benefit and/or results in adverse side effects. The factors that determine
      whether patients will be drug sensitive or resistant are not fully understood;
      therefore, genomic assessment of exceptional responders can provide important
      insight into patient response. Here, we identified a patient with endometrial
      cancer who had an exceptional response to the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab.
      Clinical grade targeted genomic profiling of a pretreatment tumor sample from
      this individual identified a mutation in DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) that
      associated with an ultramutator phenotype. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas
      (TCGA) revealed that the presence of POLE mutation associates with high
      mutational burden and elevated expression of several immune checkpoint genes.
      Together, these data suggest that cancers harboring POLE mutations are good
      candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

TI  - Cre-inducible human CD59 mediates rapid cell ablation after intermedilysin
      administration.

LID - 84921 [pii]
AB  - Cell ablation is a powerful tool for studying cell lineage and/or function;
      however, current cell-ablation models have limitations. Intermedilysin (ILY), a
      cytolytic pore-forming toxin that is secreted by Streptococcus intermedius, lyses
      human cells exclusively by binding to the human complement regulator CD59
      (hCD59), but does not react with CD59 from nonprimates. Here, we took advantage
      of this feature of ILY and developed a model of conditional and targeted cell
      ablation by generating floxed STOP-CD59 knockin mice (ihCD59), in which
      expression of human CD59 only occurs after Cre-mediated recombination. The
      administration of ILY to ihCD59+ mice crossed with various Cre-driver lines
      resulted in the rapid and specific ablation of immune, epithelial, or neural
      cells without off-target effects. ILY had a large pharmacological window, which
      allowed us to perform dose-dependent studies. Finally, the ILY/ihCD59-mediated
      cell-ablation method was tested in several disease models to study immune cell
      functionalities, hepatocyte and/or biliary epithelial damage and regeneration,
      and neural cell damage. Together, the results of this study demonstrate the
      utility of the ihCD59 mouse model for studying the effects of cell ablation in
      specific organ systems in a variety of developmental and disease states.

TI  - Proteolytic activation defines distinct lymphangiogenic mechanisms for VEGFC and 
      VEGFD.
PG  - 2167-80
LID - 10.1172/JCI83967 [doi]
LID - 83967 [pii]
AB  - Lymphangiogenesis is supported by 2 homologous VEGFR3 ligands, VEGFC and VEGFD.
      VEGFC is required for lymphatic development, while VEGFD is not. VEGFC and VEGFD 
      are proteolytically cleaved after cell secretion in vitro, and recent studies
      have implicated the protease a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with
      thrombospondin motifs 3 (ADAMTS3) and the secreted factor collagen and calcium
      binding EGF domains 1 (CCBE1) in this process. It is not well understood how
      ligand proteolysis is controlled at the molecular level or how this process
      regulates lymphangiogenesis, because these complex molecular interactions have
      been difficult to follow ex vivo and test in vivo. Here, we have developed and
      used biochemical and cellular tools to demonstrate that an ADAMTS3-CCBE1 complex 
      can form independently of VEGFR3 and is required to convert VEGFC, but not VEGFD,
      into an active ligand. Consistent with these ex vivo findings, mouse genetic
      studies revealed that ADAMTS3 is required for lymphatic development in a manner
      that is identical to the requirement of VEGFC and CCBE1 for lymphatic
      development. Moreover, CCBE1 was required for in vivo lymphangiogenesis
      stimulated by VEGFC but not VEGFD. Together, these studies reveal that
      lymphangiogenesis is regulated by two distinct proteolytic mechanisms of ligand
      activation: one in which VEGFC activation by ADAMTS3 and CCBE1 spatially and
      temporally patterns developing lymphatics, and one in which VEGFD activation by a
      distinct proteolytic mechanism may be stimulated during inflammatory lymphatic
      growth.

PG  - 2295-307
LID - 10.1172/JCI83725 [doi]
LID - 83725 [pii]
AB  - Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not sufficient to completely suppress
      disease progression in the CNS, as indicated by the rising incidence of
      HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) among infected individuals on
      ART. It is not clear why some HIV-1-infected patients develop HAND, despite
      effective repression of viral replication in the circulation. SIV-infected
      nonhuman primate models are widely used to dissect the mechanisms of viral
      pathogenesis in the CNS. Here, we identified 4 amino acid substitutions in the
      cytoplasmic tail of viral envelope glycoprotein gp41 of the neurovirulent virus
      SIVsm804E that enhance replication in macrophages and associate with enhanced
      antagonism of the host restriction factor BM stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2).
      Rhesus macaques were inoculated with a variant of the parental virus SIVsmE543-3 
      that had been engineered to contain the 4 amino acid substitutions present in
      gp41 of SIVsm804E. Compared with WT virus-infected controls, animals infected
      with mutant virus exhibited higher viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. Together,
      these results are consistent with a potential role for BST-2 in the CNS
      microenvironment and suggest that BST-2 antagonists may serve as a possible
      target for countermeasures against HAND.

TI  - Reciprocal interplay between thyroid hormone and microRNA-21 regulates hedgehog
      pathway-driven skin tumorigenesis.
PG  - 2308-20
LID - 10.1172/JCI84465 [doi]
LID - 84465 [pii]
AB  - The thyroid hormone-inactivating (TH-inactivating) enzyme type 3 iodothyronine
      deiodinase (D3) is an oncofetal protein that is rarely expressed in adult life
      but has been shown to be reactivated in the context of proliferation and
      neoplasms. D3 terminates TH action within the tumor microenvironment, thereby
      enhancing cancer cell proliferation. However, the pathological role of D3 and the
      contribution of TH metabolism in cancer have yet to be fully explored. Here, we
      describe a reciprocal regulation between TH action and the cancer-associated
      microRNA-21 (miR21) in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) skin tumors. We found that,
      besides being negatively regulated by TH at the transcriptional level, miR21
      attenuates the TH signal by increasing D3 levels. The ability of miR21 to
      positively regulate D3 was mediated by the tumor suppressor gene GRHL3, a
      hitherto unrecognized D3 transcriptional inhibitor. Finally, in a BCC mouse
      model, keratinocyte-specific D3 depletion markedly reduced tumor growth.
      Together, our results establish TH action as a critical hub of multiple oncogenic
      pathways and provide functional and mechanistic evidence of the involvement of TH
      metabolism in BCC tumorigenesis. Moreover, our results identify a miR21/GRHL3/D3 
      axis that reduces TH in the tumor microenvironment and has potential to be
      targeted as a therapeutic approach to BCC.

AB  - Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are uniquely predisposed to
      mucormycosis, an angioinvasive fungal infection with high mortality. Previously, 
      we demonstrated that Rhizopus invades the endothelium via binding of fungal CotH 
      proteins to the host receptor GRP78. Here, we report that surface expression of
      GRP78 is increased in endothelial cells exposed to physiological concentrations
      of beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), glucose, and iron that are similar to those found
      in DKA patients. Additionally, expression of R. oryzae CotH was increased within 
      hours of incubation with DKA-associated concentrations of BHB, glucose, and iron,
      augmenting the ability of R. oryzae to invade and subsequently damage endothelial
      cells in vitro. BHB exposure also increased fungal growth and attenuated R.
      oryzae neutrophil-mediated damage. Further, mice given BHB developed clinical
      acidosis and became extremely susceptible to mucormycosis, but not aspergillosis,
      while sodium bicarbonate reversed this susceptibility. BHB-related acidosis
      exerted a direct effect on both GRP78 and CotH expression, an effect not seen
      with lactic acidosis. However, BHB also indirectly compromised the ability of
      transferrin to chelate iron, as iron chelation combined with sodium bicarbonate
      completely protected endothelial cells from Rhizopus-mediated invasion and
      damage. Our results dissect the pathogenesis of mucormycosis during ketoacidosis 
      and reinforce the importance of careful metabolic control of the acidosis to
      prevent and manage this infection.

TI  - Clinical iron deficiency disturbs normal human responses to hypoxia.
PG  - 2139-50
LID - 10.1172/JCI85715 [doi]
LID - 85715 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron bioavailability has been identified as a factor that influences 
      cellular hypoxia sensing, putatively via an action on the hypoxia-inducible
      factor (HIF) pathway. We therefore hypothesized that clinical iron deficiency
      would disturb integrated human responses to hypoxia. METHODS: We performed a
      prospective, controlled, observational study of the effects of iron status on
      hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Individuals with absolute iron deficiency (ID)
      and an iron-replete (IR) control group were exposed to two 6-hour periods of
      isocapnic hypoxia. The second hypoxic exposure was preceded by i.v. infusion of
      iron. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was serially assessed with
      Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: Thirteen ID individuals completed the study
      and were age- and sex-matched with controls. PASP did not differ by group or
      study day before each hypoxic exposure. During the first 6-hour hypoxic exposure,
      the rise in PASP was 6.2 mmHg greater in the ID group (absolute rises 16.1 and
      10.7 mmHg, respectively; 95% CI for difference, 2.7-9.7 mmHg, P = 0.001).
      Intravenous iron attenuated the PASP rise in both groups; however, the effect was
      greater in ID participants than in controls (absolute reductions 11.1 and 6.8
      mmHg, respectively; 95% CI for difference in change, -8.3 to -0.3 mmHg, P =
      0.035). Serum erythropoietin responses to hypoxia also differed between groups.
      CONCLUSION: Clinical iron deficiency disturbs normal responses to hypoxia, as
      evidenced by exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary hypertension that is reversed by
      subsequent iron administration. Disturbed hypoxia sensing and signaling provides 
      a mechanism through which iron deficiency may be detrimental to human health.

TI  - CHD4-regulated plasmin activation impacts lymphovenous hemostasis and hepatic
      vascular integrity.
PG  - 2254-66
LID - 10.1172/JCI84652 [doi]

AB  - The chromatin-remodeling enzyme CHD4 maintains vascular integrity at
      mid-gestation; however, it is unknown whether this enzyme contributes to later
      blood vessel or lymphatic vessel development. Here, we addressed this issue in
      mice harboring a deletion of Chd4 specifically in cells that express lymphatic
      vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), which include lymphatic
      endothelial cells (LECs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Chd4 mutant
      embryos died before birth and exhibited severe edema, blood-filled lymphatics,
      and liver hemorrhage. CHD4-deficient embryos developed normal lymphovenous (LV)
      valves, which regulate the return of lymph to the blood circulation; however,
      these valves lacked the fibrin-rich thrombi that prevent blood from entering the 
      lymphatic system. Transcripts of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
      (uPAR), which facilitates activation of the fibrin-degrading protease plasmin,
      were upregulated in Chd4 mutant LYVE1+ cells, and plasmin activity was elevated
      near the LV valves. Genetic reduction of the uPAR ligand urokinase prevented
      degradation of fibrin-rich thrombi at the LV valves and largely resolved the
      blood-filled lymphatics in Chd4 mutants. Urokinase reduction also ameliorated
      liver hemorrhage and prolonged embryonic survival by reducing plasmin-mediated
      extracellular matrix degradation around sinusoidal blood vessels. These results
      highlight the susceptibility of LV thrombi and liver sinusoidal vessels to
      plasmin-mediated damage and demonstrate the importance of CHD4 in regulating
      embryonic plasmin activation after mid-gestation.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset degeneration of motor
      neurons that is commonly caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide
      dismutase 1 (SOD1). Both patients and Tg mice expressing mutant human SOD1
      (hSOD1) develop aggregates of unknown importance. In Tg mice, 2 different strains
      of hSOD1 aggregates (denoted A and B) can arise; however, the role of these
      aggregates in disease pathogenesis has not been fully characterized. Here, minute
      amounts of strain A and B hSOD1 aggregate seeds that were prepared by
      centrifugation through a density cushion were inoculated into lumbar spinal cords
      of 100-day-old mice carrying a human SOD1 Tg. Mice seeded with A or B aggregates 
      developed premature signs of ALS and became terminally ill after approximately
      100 days, which is 200 days earlier than for mice that had not been inoculated or
      were given a control preparation. Concomitantly, exponentially growing strain A
      and B hSOD1 aggregations propagated rostrally throughout the spinal cord and
      brainstem. The phenotypes provoked by the A and B strains differed regarding
      progression rates, distribution, end-stage aggregate levels, and histopathology. 
      Together, our data indicate that the aggregate strains are prions that transmit a
      templated, spreading aggregation of hSOD1, resulting in a fatal ALS-like disease.

LID - 79895 [pii]
AB  - Liver glycogen is important for the counterregulation of hypoglycemia and is
      reduced in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we examined the effect
      of varying hepatic glycogen content on the counterregulatory response to low
      blood sugar in dogs. During the first 4 hours of each study, hepatic glycogen was
      increased by augmenting hepatic glucose uptake using hyperglycemia and a low-dose
      intraportal fructose infusion. After hepatic glycogen levels were increased,
      animals underwent a 2-hour control period with no fructose infusion followed by a
      2-hour hyperinsulinemic/hypoglycemic clamp. Compared with control treatment,
      fructose infusion caused a large increase in liver glycogen that markedly
      elevated the response of epinephrine and glucagon to a given hypoglycemia and
      increased net hepatic glucose output (NHGO). Moreover, prior denervation of the
      liver abolished the improved counterregulatory responses that resulted from
      increased liver glycogen content. When hepatic glycogen content was lowered,
      glucagon and NHGO responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were reduced. We
      conclude that there is a liver-brain counterregulatory axis that is responsive to
      liver glycogen content. It remains to be determined whether the risk of
      iatrogenic hypoglycemia in T1D humans could be lessened by targeting metabolic
      pathway(s) associated with hepatic glycogen repletion.

TI  - cAMP/CREB-regulated LINC00473 marks LKB1-inactivated lung cancer and mediates
      tumor growth.

AB  - The LKB1 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated and inactivated in non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences
      therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted
      therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here,
      we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated
      with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the 
      most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and
      derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis,
      and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of
      LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1
      inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein
      (CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined 
      that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the
      cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription.
      Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves
      as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated
      into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and
      implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.

AB  - Alternatively activated (also known as M2) macrophages are involved in the repair
      of various types of organs. However, the contribution of M2 macrophages to
      cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI) remains to be fully
      characterized. Here, we identified CD206+F4/80+CD11b+ M2-like macrophages in the 
      murine heart and demonstrated that this cell population predominantly increases
      in the infarct area and exhibits strengthened reparative abilities after MI. We
      evaluated mice lacking the kinase TRIB1 (Trib1-/-), which exhibit a selective
      depletion of M2 macrophages after MI. Compared with control animals, Trib1-/-
      mice had a catastrophic prognosis, with frequent cardiac rupture, as the result
      of markedly reduced collagen fibril formation in the infarct area due to impaired
      fibroblast activation. The decreased tissue repair observed in Trib1-/- mice was 
      entirely rescued by an external supply of M2-like macrophages. Furthermore,
      IL-1alpha and osteopontin were suggested to be mediators of M2-like
      macrophage-induced fibroblast activation. In addition, IL-4 administration
      achieved a targeted increase in the number of M2-like macrophages and enhanced
      the post-MI prognosis of WT mice, corresponding with amplified fibroblast
      activation and formation of more supportive fibrous tissues in the infarcts.
      Together, these data demonstrate that M2-like macrophages critically determine
      the repair of infarcted adult murine heart by regulating fibroblast activation
      and suggest that IL-4 is a potential biological drug for treating MI.

TI  - CD19 CAR-T cells of defined CD4+:CD8+ composition in adult B cell ALL patients.
PG  - 2123-38
LID - 10.1172/JCI85309 [doi]
LID - 85309 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: T cells that have been modified to express a CD19-specific chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) have antitumor activity in B cell malignancies; however,
      identification of the factors that determine toxicity and efficacy of these T
      cells has been challenging in prior studies in which phenotypically heterogeneous
      CAR-T cell products were prepared from unselected T cells. METHODS: We conducted 
      a clinical trial to evaluate CD19 CAR-T cells that were manufactured from defined
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets and administered in a defined CD4+:CD8+ composition 
      to adults with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after lymphodepletion
      chemotherapy. RESULTS: The defined composition product was remarkably potent, as 
      27 of 29 patients (93%) achieved BM remission, as determined by flow cytometry.
      We established that high CAR-T cell doses and tumor burden increase the risks of 
      severe cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Moreover, we identified serum
      biomarkers that allow testing of early intervention strategies in patients at the
      highest risk of toxicity. Risk-stratified CAR-T cell dosing based on BM disease
      burden decreased toxicity. CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-CAR transgene product immune
      responses developed after CAR-T cell infusion in some patients, limited CAR-T
      cell persistence, and increased relapse risk. Addition of fludarabine to the
      lymphodepletion regimen improved CAR-T cell persistence and disease-free
      survival. CONCLUSION: Immunotherapy with a CAR-T cell product of defined
      composition enabled identification of factors that correlated with CAR-T cell
      expansion, persistence, and toxicity and facilitated design of lymphodepletion
      and CAR-T cell dosing strategies that mitigated toxicity and improved
      disease-free survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01865617.

AB  - IFN-gamma is a critical mediator of host defense against Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Antigen-specific CD4+ T cells have long been
      regarded as the main producer of IFN-gamma in tuberculosis (TB), and CD4+ T cell 
      immunity is the main target of current TB vaccine candidates. However, given the 
      recent failures of such a TB vaccine candidate in clinical trials, strategies to 
      harness CD4-independent mechanisms of protection should be included in future
      vaccine design. Here, we have reported that noncognate IFN-gamma production by
      Mtb antigen-independent memory CD8+ T cells and NK cells is protective during Mtb
      infection and evaluated the mechanistic regulation of IFN-gamma production by
      these cells in vivo. Transfer of arenavirus- or protein-specific CD8+ T cells or 
      NK cells reduced the mortality and morbidity rates of mice highly susceptible to 
      TB in an IFN-gamma-dependent manner. Secretion of IFN-gamma by these cell
      populations required IL-18, sensing of mycobacterial viability, Mtb protein 6-kDa
      early secretory antigenic target-mediated (ESAT-6-mediated) cytosolic contact,
      and activation of NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)
      inflammasomes in CD11c+ cell subsets. Neutralization of IL-18 abrogated
      protection in susceptible recipient mice that had received noncognate cells.
      Moreover, improved Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
      vaccine-induced protection was lost in the absence of ESAT-6-dependent cytosolic 
      contact. Our findings provide a comprehensive mechanistic framework for
      antigen-independent IFN-gamma secretion in response to Mtb with critical
      implications for future intervention strategies against TB.

AB  - In this issue of the JCI, Li et al. show that germ-free mice, when chemically
      castrated, do not lose bone - a finding that unequivocally establishes a role of 
      gut microbiota in mediating hypogonadal bone loss. Additionally and not
      unexpectedly, probiotics reversed hypogonadal osteopenia in sex steroid-deficient
      mice by preventing the disruption of gut barrier function and dampening
      cytokine-induced inflammation. The authors propose that TNFalpha is a key
      mediator; however, it is very likely that other molecules - including IL-1, IL-6,
      IL-17, RANKL, OPG, and CCL2 - modulate probiotic action. The results of this
      study highlight the potential for repurposing probiotics for the therapy of
      osteoporosis. Future placebo-controlled clinical trials will be required to
      establish safety and efficacy of probiotics in reducing fracture risk in people.

AB  - A eubiotic microbiota influences many physiological processes in the metazoan
      host, including development and intestinal homeostasis. Here, we have shown that 
      the intestinal microbiota modulates inflammatory responses caused by sex steroid 
      deficiency, leading to trabecular bone loss. In murine models, sex steroid
      deficiency increased gut permeability, expanded Th17 cells, and upregulated the
      osteoclastogenic cytokines TNFalpha (TNF), RANKL, and IL-17 in the small
      intestine and the BM. In germ-free (GF) mice, sex steroid deficiency failed to
      increase osteoclastogenic cytokine production, stimulate bone resorption, and
      cause trabecular bone loss, demonstrating that the gut microbiota is central in
      sex steroid deficiency-induced trabecular bone loss. Furthermore, we demonstrated
      that twice-weekly treatment of sex steroid-deficient mice with the probiotics
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) or the commercially available probiotic
      supplement VSL#3 reduces gut permeability, dampens intestinal and BM
      inflammation, and completely protects against bone loss. In contrast,
      supplementation with a nonprobiotic strain of E. coli or a mutant LGG was not
      protective. Together, these data highlight the role that the gut luminal
      microbiota and increased gut permeability play in triggering inflammatory
      pathways that are critical for inducing bone loss in sex steroid-deficient mice. 
      Our data further suggest that probiotics that decrease gut permeability have
      potential as a therapeutic strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB  - Skin homeostasis is maintained by the continuous proliferation and
      differentiation of epidermal cells. The skin forms a strong but flexible barrier 
      against microorganisms as well as physical and chemical insults; however, the
      physiological mechanisms that maintain this barrier are not fully understood.
      Here, we have described a mutant mouse that spontaneously develops pruritic
      dermatitis as the result of an initial defect in skin homeostasis that is
      followed by induction of a Th2-biased immune response. These mice harbor a
      mutation that results in a single aa substitution in the JAK1 tyrosine kinase
      that results in hyperactivation, thereby leading to skin serine protease
      overexpression and disruption of skin barrier function. Accordingly, treatment
      with an ointment to maintain normal skin barrier function protected mutant mice
      from dermatitis onset. Pharmacological inhibition of JAK1 also delayed disease
      onset. Together, these findings indicate that JAK1-mediated signaling cascades in
      skin regulate the expression of proteases associated with the maintenance of skin
      barrier function and demonstrate that perturbation of these pathways can lead to 
      the development of spontaneous pruritic dermatitis.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly common behavioral condition
      that frequently presents with gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. It is not
      clear, however, how gut dysfunction relates to core ASD features. Multiple, rare 
      hyperfunctional coding variants of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT,
      encoded by SLC6A4) have been identified in ASD. Expression of the most common
      SERT variant (Ala56) in mice increases 5-HT clearance and causes ASD-like
      behaviors. Here, we demonstrated that Ala56-expressing mice display GI defects
      that resemble those seen in mice lacking neuronal 5-HT. These defects included
      enteric nervous system hypoplasia, slow GI transit, diminished peristaltic reflex
      activity, and proliferation of crypt epithelial cells. An opposite phenotype was 
      seen in SERT-deficient mice and in progeny of WT dams given the SERT antagonist
      fluoxetine. The reciprocal phenotypes that resulted from increased or decreased
      SERT activity support the idea that 5-HT signaling regulates enteric neuronal
      development and can, when disturbed, cause long-lasting abnormalities of GI
      function. Administration of a 5-HT4 agonist to Ala56 mice during development
      prevented Ala56-associated GI perturbations, suggesting that excessive SERT
      activity leads to inadequate 5-HT4-mediated neurogenesis. We propose that
      deficient 5-HT signaling during development may contribute to GI and behavioral
      features of ASD. The consequences of therapies targeting SERT during pregnancy
      warrant further evaluation.

LID - 83792 [pii]
AB  - The rare patients who are able to spontaneously control HIV replication in the
      absence of therapy show signs of a particularly efficient cellular immune
      response. To identify the molecular determinants that underlie this response, we 
      characterized the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire directed at Gag293, the most
      immunoprevalent CD4 epitope in the HIV-1 capsid. HIV controllers from the ANRS
      CODEX cohort showed a highly skewed TCR repertoire that was characterized by a
      predominance of TRAV24 and TRBV2 variable genes, shared CDR3 motifs, and a high
      frequency of public clonotypes. The most prevalent public clonotypes generated
      TCRs with affinities at the higher end of values reported for naturally occurring
      TCRs. The high-affinity Gag293-specific TCRs were cross-restricted by up to 5
      distinct HLA-DR alleles, accounting for the expression of these TCRs in HIV
      controllers of diverse genetic backgrounds. Transfer of these TCRs to healthy
      donor CD4+ T cells conferred high antigen sensitivity and polyfunctionality, thus
      recapitulating key features of the controller CD4 response. Transfer of a
      high-affinity Gag293-specific TCR also redirected CD8+ T cells to target HIV-1
      capsid via nonconventional MHC II restriction. Together, these findings indicate 
      that TCR clonotypes with superior functions are associated with HIV control.
      Amplification or transfer of such clonotypes may contribute to immunotherapeutic 
      approaches aiming at a functional HIV cure.

PG  - 1630-9

LID - 85339 [pii]
AB  - Although the use of antioxidants for the treatment of cancer and HIV/AIDS has
      been proposed for decades, new insights gained from redox research have suggested
      a very different scenario. These new data show that the major cellular
      antioxidant systems, the thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH) systems,
      actually promote cancer growth and HIV infection, while suppressing an effective 
      immune response. Mechanistically, these systems control both the redox- and
      NO-based pathways (nitroso-redox homeostasis), which subserve innate and cellular
      immune defenses. Dual inhibition of the Trx and GSH systems synergistically kills
      neoplastic cells in vitro and in mice and decreases resistance to anticancer
      therapy. Similarly, the population of HIV reservoir cells that constitutes the
      major barrier to a cure for AIDS is exquisitely redox sensitive and could be
      selectively targeted by Trx and GSH inhibitors. Trx and GSH inhibition may lead
      to a reprogramming of the immune response, tilting the balance between the immune
      system and cancer or HIV in favor of the former, allowing elimination of diseased
      cells. Thus, therapies based on silencing of the Trx and GSH pathways represent a
      promising approach for the cure of both cancer and AIDS and warrant further
      investigation.

AB  - Mammalian chromosomes terminate in stretches of repetitive telomeric DNA that act
      as buffers to avoid loss of essential genetic information during end-replication.
      A multiprotein complex known as shelterin prevents recognition of telomeric
      sequences as sites of DNA damage. Telomere erosion contributes to human diseases 
      ranging from BM failure to premature aging syndromes and cancer. The role of
      shelterin telomere protection is less understood. Mutations in genes encoding the
      shelterin proteins TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TIN2) and adrenocortical
      dysplasia homolog (ACD) were identified in dyskeratosis congenita, a syndrome
      characterized by somatic stem cell dysfunction in multiple organs leading to BM
      failure and other pleiotropic manifestations. Here, we introduce the biochemical 
      features and in vivo effects of individual shelterin proteins, discuss shelterin 
      functions in hematopoiesis, and review emerging knowledge implicating the
      shelterin complex in hematological disorders.

LID - 84538 [pii]
AB  - Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were discovered as extracellular strands of
      decondensed DNA in complex with histones and granule proteins, which were
      expelled from dying neutrophils to ensnare and kill microbes. NETs are formed
      during infection in vivo by mechanisms different from those originally described 
      in vitro. Citrullination of histones by peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is
      central for NET formation in vivo. NETs may spur formation of autoantibodies and 
      may also serve as scaffolds for thrombosis, thereby providing a link among
      infection, autoimmunity, and thrombosis. In this review, we present the
      mechanisms by which NETs are formed and discuss the physiological and
      pathophysiological consequences of NET formation. We conclude that NETs may be of
      more importance in autoimmunity and thrombosis than in innate immune defense.

      injury through alpha7nAChR+ splenocytes.

AB  - The nervous and immune systems interact in complex ways to maintain homeostasis
      and respond to stress or injury, and rapid nerve conduction can provide
      instantaneous input for modulating inflammation. The inflammatory reflex referred
      to as the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway regulates innate and adaptive
      immunity, and modulation of this reflex by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is
      effective in various inflammatory disease models, such as rheumatoid arthritis
      and inflammatory bowel disease. Effectiveness of VNS in these models necessitates
      the integration of neural signals and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
      (alpha7nAChRs) on splenic macrophages. Here, we sought to determine whether
      electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve attenuates kidney ischemia-reperfusion 
      injury (IRI), which promotes the release of proinflammatory molecules.
      Stimulation of vagal afferents or efferents in mice 24 hours before IRI markedly 
      attenuated acute kidney injury (AKI) and decreased plasma TNF. Furthermore, this 
      protection was abolished in animals in which splenectomy was performed 7 days
      before VNS and IRI. In mice lacking alpha7nAChR, prior VNS did not prevent IRI.
      Conversely, adoptive transfer of VNS-conditioned alpha7nAChR splenocytes
      conferred protection to recipient mice subjected to IRI. Together, these results 
      demonstrate that VNS-mediated attenuation of AKI and systemic inflammation
      depends on alpha7nAChR-positive splenocytes.

AB  - Substantial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) to the transplanted kidney occurs
      in 30% to 50% of transplantation patients who receive the organ from a deceased
      donor. IRI usually manifests as delayed graft function (DGF) and, in severe
      cases, results in primary nonfunction. Previous studies, primarily experimental, 
      have demonstrated sex-specific susceptibility to IRI in kidney and other organs. 
      In this issue of the JCI, Aufhauser Jr., Wang, and colleagues further demonstrate
      the importance of donor and recipient sex in IRI and elucidate the role of
      estrogen receptors in a murine model. Furthermore, analysis of data from 46,691
      renal transplant patients in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database
      revealed that sex affects DGF outcomes in humans. Manipulation of sex-driven
      molecular pathways offers a fertile opportunity to increase the number of organs 
      available for transplantation and to reduce IRI in kidney and, likely, other
      organs.

LID - 87429 [pii]
AB  - Tregs are critical for control of self-reactive T cells that escape thymic
      selection and end up in the periphery. Treg subsets suppress effector T cell
      populations through the secretion of immunosuppressive molecules and inhibitory
      cytokines as well as cell contact-dependent mechanisms. In this issue of the JCI,
      Wen and colleagues describe another mechanism by which Tregs suppress effector T 
      cell populations. Specifically, the authors reveal that CD8+ T cells in close
      contact with target T cells release NADPH oxidase 2-containing microvesicles that
      inhibit TCR activation by elevating ROS and thereby reducing phosphorylation of
      the TCR-associated kinase ZAP70. Together, the results of this study provide
      important insight into CD8+ Treg function and into the development of
      autoimmunity in older individuals.

AB  - Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases globally and can be divided
      into presenting with or without an immune response. Current therapies have little
      effect on nonimmune disease, and the mechanisms that drive this type of asthma
      are poorly understood. Here, we have shown that loss of the transcription factors
      forkhead box P1 (Foxp1) and Foxp4, which are critical for lung epithelial
      development, in the adult airway epithelium evokes a non-Th2 asthma phenotype
      that is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) without eosinophilic
      inflammation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that loss of Foxp1 and Foxp4
      expression induces ectopic expression of neuropeptide Y (Npy), which has been
      reported to be present in the airways of asthma patients, but whose importance in
      disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Treatment of human lung airway explants
      with recombinant NPY increased airway contractility. Conversely, loss of Npy in
      Foxp1- and Foxp4-mutant airway epithelium rescued the AHR phenotype. We
      determined that NPY promotes AHR through the induction of Rho kinase activity and
      phosphorylation of myosin light chain, which induces airway smooth muscle
      contraction. Together, these studies highlight the importance of paracrine
      signals from the airway epithelium to the underlying smooth muscle to induce AHR 
      and suggest that therapies targeting epithelial induction of this phenotype may
      prove useful in treatment of noneosinophilic asthma.

AB  - Renal peritubular interstitial fibroblast-like cells are critical for adult
      erythropoiesis, as they are the main source of erythropoietin (EPO).
      Hypoxia-inducible factor 2 (HIF-2) controls EPO synthesis in the kidney and liver
      and is regulated by prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) dioxygenases PHD1, PHD2,
      and PHD3, which function as cellular oxygen sensors. Renal interstitial cells
      with EPO-producing capacity are poorly characterized, and the role of the
      PHD/HIF-2 axis in renal EPO-producing cell (REPC) plasticity is unclear. Here we 
      targeted the PHD/HIF-2/EPO axis in FOXD1 stroma-derived renal interstitial cells 
      and examined the role of individual PHDs in REPC pool size regulation and renal
      EPO output. Renal interstitial cells with EPO-producing capacity were entirely
      derived from FOXD1-expressing stroma, and Phd2 inactivation alone induced renal
      Epo in a limited number of renal interstitial cells. EPO induction was
      submaximal, as hypoxia or pharmacologic PHD inhibition further increased the REPC
      fraction among Phd2-/- renal interstitial cells. Moreover, Phd1 and Phd3 were
      differentially expressed in renal interstitium, and heterozygous deficiency for
      Phd1 and Phd3 increased REPC numbers in Phd2-/- mice. We propose that FOXD1
      lineage renal interstitial cells consist of distinct subpopulations that differ
      in their responsiveness to Phd2 inactivation and thus regulation of HIF-2
      activity and EPO production under hypoxia or conditions of pharmacologic or
      genetic PHD inactivation.

LID - 84181 [pii]
AB  - Immune aging results in progressive loss of both protective immunity and T
      cell-mediated suppression, thereby conferring susceptibility to a combination of 
      immunodeficiency and chronic inflammatory disease. Here, we determined that older
      individuals fail to generate immunosuppressive CD8+CCR7+ Tregs, a defect that is 
      even more pronounced in the age-related vasculitic syndrome giant cell arteritis.
      In young, healthy individuals, CD8+CCR7+ Tregs are localized in T cell zones of
      secondary lymphoid organs, suppress activation and expansion of CD4 T cells by
      inhibiting the phosphorylation of membrane-proximal signaling molecules, and
      effectively inhibit proliferative expansion of CD4 T cells in vitro and in vivo. 
      We identified deficiency of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) as the molecular underpinning 
      of CD8 Treg failure in the older individuals and in patients with giant cell
      arteritis. CD8 Tregs suppress by releasing exosomes that carry preassembled NOX2 
      membrane clusters and are taken up by CD4 T cells. Overexpression of NOX2 in aged
      CD8 Tregs promptly restored suppressive function. Together, our data support NOX2
      as a critical component of the suppressive machinery of CD8 Tregs and suggest
      that repairing NOX2 deficiency in these cells may protect older individuals from 
      tissue-destructive inflammatory disease, such as large-vessel vasculitis.

LID - 86826 [pii]
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common cause of hospital-related mortality;
      therefore, strategies to either prevent or treat this complication are of great
      interest. In this issue of the JCI, Inoue, Abe, and colleagues have uncovered a
      targetable neuroimmunomodulatory mechanism that protects mice from
      ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and subsequent AKI. Specifically, the authors
      demonstrate that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) activates the cholinergic
      antiinflammatory pathway (CAP), resulting in activation of antiinflammatory
      effects via alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-expressing splenic
      macrophages. Together, the results of this study have potential clinical
      implications in the prevention of AKI in at-risk individuals.

      outcomes.

LID - 84712 [pii]
AB  - Experimentally, females show an improved ability to recover from
      ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) compared with males; however, this
      sex-dependent response is less established in humans. Here, we developed a series
      of murine renal ischemia and transplant models to investigate sex-specific
      effects on recovery after IRI. We found that IRI tolerance is profoundly
      increased in female mice compared with that observed in male mice and discovered 
      an intermediate phenotype after neutering of either sex. Transplantation of adult
      kidneys from either sex into a recipient of the opposite sex followed by ischemia
      at a remote time resulted in ischemia recovery that reflected the sex of the
      recipient, not the donor, revealing that the host sex determines recovery.
      Likewise, renal IRI was exacerbated in female estrogen receptor alpha-KO mice,
      while female mice receiving supplemental estrogen before ischemia were protected.
      We examined data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to determine
      whether there is an association between sex and delayed graft function (DGF) in
      patients who received deceased donor renal transplants. A multivariable logistic 
      regression analysis determined that there was a greater association with DGF in
      male recipients than in female recipients. Together, our results demonstrate that
      sex affects renal IRI tolerance in mice and humans and indicate that estrogen
      administration has potential as a therapeutic intervention to clinically improve 
      ischemia tolerance.

LID - 83000 [pii]
AB  - Physiochemical stress induces tissue injury as a result of the detection of
      abnormal molecular patterns by sensory molecules of the innate immune system.
      Here, we have described how the recently discovered C-type lectin collectin-11
      (CL-11, also known as CL-K1 and encoded by COLEC11) recognizes an abnormal
      pattern of L-fucose on postischemic renal tubule cells and activates a
      destructive inflammatory response. We found that intrarenal expression of CL-11
      rapidly increases in the postischemic period and colocalizes with complement
      deposited along the basolateral surface of the proximal renal tubule in
      association with L-fucose, the potential binding ligand for CL-11. Mice with
      either generalized or kidney-specific deficiency of CL-11 were strongly protected
      against loss of renal function and tubule injury due to reduced complement
      deposition. Ex vivo renal tubule cells showed a marked capacity for CL-11 binding
      that was induced by cell stress under hypoxic or hypothermic conditions and
      prevented by specific removal of L-fucose. Further analysis revealed that
      cell-bound CL-11 required the lectin complement pathway-associated protease
      MASP-2 to trigger complement deposition. Given these results, we conclude that
      lectin complement pathway activation triggered by ligand-CL-11 interaction in
      postischemic tissue is a potent source of acute kidney injury and is amenable to 
      sugar-specific blockade.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and
      progressive beta cell dysfunction. Excess glucose and lipid impair beta cell
      function in islet cell lines, cultured rodent and human islets, and in vivo
      rodent models. Here, we examined the mechanistic consequences of glucotoxic and
      lipotoxic conditions on human islets in vivo and developed and/or used 3
      complementary models that allowed comparison of the effects of hyperglycemic
      and/or insulin-resistant metabolic stress conditions on human and mouse islets,
      which responded quite differently to these challenges. Hyperglycemia and/or
      insulin resistance impaired insulin secretion only from human islets in vivo. In 
      human grafts, chronic insulin resistance decreased antioxidant enzyme expression 
      and increased superoxide and amyloid formation. In human islet grafts, expression
      of transcription factors NKX6.1 and MAFB was decreased by chronic insulin
      resistance, but only MAFB decreased under chronic hyperglycemia. Knockdown of
      NKX6.1 or MAFB expression in a human beta cell line recapitulated the insulin
      secretion defect seen in vivo. Contrary to rodent islet studies, neither insulin 
      resistance nor hyperglycemia led to human beta cell proliferation or apoptosis.
      These results demonstrate profound differences in how excess glucose or lipid
      influence mouse and human insulin secretion and beta cell activity and show that 
      reduced expression of key islet-enriched transcription factors is an important
      mediator of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity.

TI  - Hypomorphism of Fto and Rpgrip1l causes obesity in mice.
PG  - 1897-910
LID - 10.1172/JCI85526 [doi]
LID - 85526 [pii]
AB  - Noncoding polymorphisms in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene
      represent common alleles that are strongly associated with effects on food intake
      and adiposity in humans. Previous studies have suggested that the obesity-risk
      allele rs8050136 in the first intron of FTO alters a regulatory element
      recognized by the transcription factor CUX1, thereby leading to decreased
      expression of FTO and retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein-1
      like (RPGRIP1L). Here, we evaluated the effects of rs8050136 and another
      potential CUX1 element in rs1421085 on expression of nearby genes in human
      induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) neurons. There were
      allele-dosage effects on FTO, RPGRIP1L, and AKT-interacting protein (AKTIP)
      expression, but expression of other vicinal genes, including IRX3, IRX5, and
      RBL2, which have been implicated in mediating functional effects, was not
      altered. In vivo manipulation of CUX1, Fto, and/or Rpgrip1l expression in mice
      affected adiposity in a manner that was consistent with CUX1 influence on
      adiposity via remote effects on Fto and Rpgrip1l expression. In support of a
      mechanism, mice hypomorphic for Rpgrip1l exhibited hyperphagic obesity, as the
      result of diminished leptin sensitivity in Leprb-expressing neurons. Together,
      the results of this study indicate that the effects of FTO-associated SNPs on
      energy homeostasis are due in part to the effects of these genetic variations on 
      hypothalamic FTO, RPGRIP1L, and possibly other genes.

TI  - FAK regulates platelet extravasation and tumor growth after antiangiogenic
      therapy withdrawal.
PG  - 1885-96
LID - 10.1172/JCI85086 [doi]
LID - 85086 [pii]
AB  - Recent studies in patients with ovarian cancer suggest that tumor growth may be
      accelerated following cessation of antiangiogenesis therapy; however, the
      underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to compare
      the effects of therapy withdrawal to those of continuous treatment with various
      antiangiogenic agents. Cessation of therapy with pazopanib, bevacizumab, and the 
      human and murine anti-VEGF antibody B20 was associated with substantial tumor
      growth in mouse models of ovarian cancer. Increased tumor growth was accompanied 
      by tumor hypoxia, increased tumor angiogenesis, and vascular leakage. Moreover,
      we found hypoxia-induced ADP production and platelet infiltration into tumors
      after withdrawal of antiangiogenic therapy, and lowering platelet counts markedly
      inhibited tumor rebound after withdrawal of antiangiogenic therapy. Focal
      adhesion kinase (FAK) in platelets regulated their migration into the tumor
      microenvironment, and FAK-deficient platelets completely prevented the rebound
      tumor growth. Additionally, combined therapy with a FAK inhibitor and the
      antiangiogenic agents pazopanib and bevacizumab reduced tumor growth and
      inhibited negative effects following withdrawal of antiangiogenic therapy. In
      summary, these results suggest that FAK may be a unique target in situations in
      which antiangiogenic agents are withdrawn, and dual targeting of FAK and VEGF
      could have therapeutic implications for ovarian cancer management.

LID - 83926 [pii]
AB  - Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most frequent form of dwarfism and is caused by
      gain-of-function mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3-encoding
      (FGFR3-encoding) gene. Although potential therapeutic strategies for ACH, which
      aim to reduce excessive FGFR3 activation, have emerged over many years, the use
      of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to counteract FGFR3 hyperactivity has yet to
      be evaluated. Here, we have reported that the pan-FGFR TKI, NVP-BGJ398, reduces
      FGFR3 phosphorylation and corrects the abnormal femoral growth plate and calvaria
      in organ cultures from embryos of the Fgfr3Y367C/+ mouse model of ACH. Moreover, 
      we demonstrated that a low dose of NVP-BGJ398, injected subcutaneously, was able 
      to penetrate into the growth plate of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice and modify its
      organization. Improvements to the axial and appendicular skeletons were
      noticeable after 10 days of treatment and were more extensive after 15 days of
      treatment that started from postnatal day 1. Low-dose NVP-BGJ398 treatment
      reduced intervertebral disc defects of lumbar vertebrae, loss of synchondroses,
      and foramen-magnum shape anomalies. NVP-BGJ398 inhibited FGFR3 downstream
      signaling pathways, including MAPK, SOX9, STAT1, and PLCgamma, in the growth
      plates of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice and in cultured chondrocyte models of ACH. Together, 
      our data demonstrate that NVP-BGJ398 corrects pathological hallmarks of ACH and
      support TKIs as a potential therapeutic approach for ACH.

      neuropathic pain.
PG  - 1983-97
LID - 10.1172/JCI82859 [doi]
LID - 82859 [pii]
AB  - Long-term treatments to ameliorate peripheral neuropathic pain that includes
      mechanical allodynia are limited. While glial activation and altered nociceptive 
      transmission within the spinal cord are associated with the pathogenesis of
      mechanical allodynia, changes in cortical circuits also accompany peripheral
      nerve injury and may represent additional therapeutic targets. Dendritic spine
      plasticity in the S1 cortex appears within days following nerve injury; however, 
      the underlying cellular mechanisms of this plasticity and whether it has a causal
      relationship to allodynia remain unsolved. Furthermore, it is not known whether
      glial activation occurs within the S1 cortex following injury or whether it
      contributes to this S1 synaptic plasticity. Using in vivo 2-photon imaging with
      genetic and pharmacological manipulations of murine models, we have shown that
      sciatic nerve ligation induces a re-emergence of immature metabotropic glutamate 
      receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling in S1 astroglia, which elicits spontaneous somatic 
      Ca2+ transients, synaptogenic thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) release, and synapse
      formation. This S1 astrocyte reactivation was evident only during the first week 
      after injury and correlated with the temporal changes in S1 extracellular
      glutamate levels and dendritic spine turnover. Blocking the astrocytic
      mGluR5-signaling pathway suppressed mechanical allodynia, while activating this
      pathway in the absence of any peripheral injury induced long-lasting (>1 month)
      allodynia. We conclude that reawakened astrocytes are a key trigger for S1
      circuit rewiring and that this contributes to neuropathic mechanical allodynia.

AB  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) often leads to neurotrophic ulcerations in
      the cornea and skin; however, the underlying cellular mechanisms of this
      complication are poorly understood. Here, we used post-wound corneal sensory
      degeneration and regeneration as a model and tested the hypothesis that diabetes 
      adversely affects DC populations and infiltration, resulting in disrupted
      DC-nerve communication and DPN. In streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice,
      there was a substantial reduction in sensory nerve density and the number of
      intraepithelial DCs in unwounded (UW) corneas. In wounded corneas, diabetes
      markedly delayed sensory nerve regeneration and reduced the number of
      infiltrating DCs, which were a major source of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)
      in the cornea. While CNTF neutralization retarded reinnervation in normal
      corneas, exogenous CNTF accelerated nerve regeneration in the wounded corneas of 
      diabetic mice and healthy animals, in which DCs had been locally depleted.
      Moreover, blockade of the CNTF-specific receptor CNTFRalpha induced sensory nerve
      degeneration and retarded regeneration in normal corneas. Soluble CNTFRalpha also
      partially restored the branching of diabetes-suppressed sensory nerve endings and
      regeneration in the diabetic corneas. Collectively, our data show that DCs
      mediate sensory nerve innervation and regeneration through CNTF and that diabetes
      reduces DC populations in UW and wounded corneas, resulting in decreased CNTF and
      impaired sensory nerve innervation and regeneration.

AB  - The endosome/lysosome pathway is disrupted early in the course of both
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS); however, it is not clear how
      dysfunction in this pathway influences the development of these diseases. Herein,
      we explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which endosomal dysfunction 
      contributes to the pathogenesis of AD and DS. We determined that full-length
      amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) act
      though increased activation of Rab5 to cause enlargement of early endosomes and
      to disrupt retrograde axonal trafficking of nerve growth factor (NGF) signals.
      The functional impacts of APP and its various products were investigated in PC12 
      cells, cultured rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), and BFCNs from a
      mouse model of DS. We found that the full-length wild-type APP (APPWT) and
      beta-CTF both induced endosomal enlargement and disrupted NGF signaling and
      axonal trafficking. beta-CTF alone induced atrophy of BFCNs that was rescued by
      the dominant-negative Rab5 mutant, Rab5S34N. Moreover, expression of a
      dominant-negative Rab5 construct markedly reduced APP-induced axonal blockage in 
      Drosophila. Therefore, increased APP and/or beta-CTF impact the endocytic pathway
      to disrupt NGF trafficking and signaling, resulting in trophic deficits in BFCNs.
      Our data strongly support the emerging concept that dysregulation of Rab5
      activity contributes importantly to early pathogenesis of AD and DS.

AB  - Inflammasomes form as the result of the intracellular presence of
      danger-associated molecular patterns and mediate the release of active IL-1beta, 
      which influences a variety of inflammatory responses. Excessive inflammasome
      activation results in severe inflammatory conditions, but physiological IL-1beta 
      secretion is necessary for intestinal homeostasis. Here, we have described a
      mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation of NLRP3
      at Tyr861. We demonstrated that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22
      (PTPN22), variants in which are associated with chronic inflammatory disorders,
      dephosphorylates NLRP3 upon inflammasome induction, allowing efficient NLRP3
      activation and subsequent IL-1beta release. In murine models, PTPN22 deficiency
      resulted in pronounced colitis, increased NLRP3 phosphorylation, but reduced
      levels of mature IL-1beta. Conversely, patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) that carried an autoimmunity-associated PTPN22 variant had increased
      IL-1beta levels. Together, our results identify tyrosine phosphorylation as an
      important regulatory mechanism for NLRP3 that prevents aberrant inflammasome
      activation.

AB  - Targeting multiple components of the MAPK pathway can prolong the survival of
      patients with BRAFV600E melanoma. This approach is not curative, as some
      BRAF-mutated melanoma cells are intrinsically resistant to MAPK inhibitors
      (MAPKi). At the systemic level, our knowledge of how signaling pathways underlie 
      drug resistance needs to be further expanded. Here, we have shown that
      intrinsically resistant BRAF-mutated melanoma cells with a low basal level of
      mitochondrial biogenesis depend on this process to survive MAPKi. Intrinsically
      resistant cells exploited an integrated stress response, exhibited an increase in
      mitochondrial DNA content, and required oxidative phosphorylation to meet their
      bioenergetic needs. We determined that intrinsically resistant cells rely on the 
      genes encoding TFAM, which controls mitochondrial genome replication and
      transcription, and TRAP1, which regulates mitochondrial protein folding.
      Therefore, we targeted mitochondrial biogenesis with a mitochondrium-targeted,
      small-molecule HSP90 inhibitor (Gamitrinib), which eradicated intrinsically
      resistant cells and augmented the efficacy of MAPKi by inducing mitochondrial
      dysfunction and inhibiting tumor bioenergetics. A subset of tumor biopsies from
      patients with disease progression despite MAPKi treatment showed increased
      mitochondrial biogenesis and tumor bioenergetics. A subset of acquired
      drug-resistant melanoma cell lines was sensitive to Gamitrinib. Our study
      establishes mitochondrial biogenesis, coupled with aberrant tumor bioenergetics, 
      as a potential therapy escape mechanism and paves the way for a rationale-based
      combinatorial strategy to improve the efficacy of MAPKi.

AB  - The mTOR pathway orchestrates cellular homeostasis. The rapamycin-sensitive mTOR 
      complex (mTORC1) in the kidney has been widely studied; however, mTORC2 function 
      in renal tubules is poorly characterized. Here, we generated mice lacking mTORC2 
      in the distal tubule (Rictorfl/fl Ksp-Cre mice), which were viable and had no
      obvious phenotype, except for a 2.5-fold increase in plasma aldosterone.
      Challenged with a low-Na+ diet, these mice adequately reduced Na+ excretion;
      however, Rictorfl/fl Ksp-Cre mice rapidly developed hyperkalemia on a high-K+
      diet, despite a 10-fold increase in serum aldosterone levels, implying that
      mTORC2 regulates kaliuresis. Phosphorylation of serum- and
      glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) and PKC-alpha was absent in Rictorfl/fl 
      Ksp-Cre mice, indicating a functional block in K+ secretion activation via ROMK
      channels. Indeed, patch-clamp experiments on split-open tubular segments from the
      transition zone of the late connecting tubule and early cortical collecting duct 
      demonstrated that Ba2+-sensitive apical K+ currents were barely detectable in the
      majority of Rictorfl/fl Ksp-Cre mice. Conversely, epithelial sodium channel
      (ENaC) activity was largely preserved, suggesting that the reduced ability to
      maintain K+ homeostasis is the result of impaired apical K+ conductance and not a
      reduced electrical driving force for K+ secretion. Thus, these data unravel a
      vital and nonredundant role of mTORC2 for distal tubular K+ handling.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) cells secrete osteoclastogenic factors that promote
      osteolytic lesions; however, the identity of these factors is largely unknown.
      Here, we performed a screen of human myeloma cells to identify
      pro-osteoclastogenic agents that could potentially serve as therapeutic targets
      for ameliorating MM-associated bone disease. We found that myeloma cells express 
      high levels of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13 and determined that MMP-13
      directly enhances osteoclast multinucleation and bone-resorptive activity by
      triggering upregulation of the cell fusogen DC-STAMP. Moreover, this effect was
      independent of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme. Further, in mouse
      xenograft models, silencing MMP-13 expression in myeloma cells inhibited the
      development of osteolytic lesions. In patient cohorts, MMP-13 expression was
      localized to BM-associated myeloma cells, while elevated MMP-13 serum levels were
      able to correctly predict the presence of active bone disease. Together, these
      data demonstrate that MMP-13 is critical for the development of osteolytic
      lesions in MM and that targeting the MMP-13 protein - rather than its catalytic
      activity - constitutes a potential approach to mitigating bone disease in
      affected patients.

PG  - 1745-58
LID - 10.1172/JCI78815 [doi]
LID - 78815 [pii]
AB  - The transcription factor SOX9 is critical for prostate development, and
      dysregulation of SOX9 is implicated in prostate cancer (PCa). However, the
      SOX9-dependent genes and pathways involved in both normal and neoplastic prostate
      epithelium are largely unknown. Here, we performed SOX9 ChIP sequencing analysis 
      and transcriptome profiling of PCa cells and determined that SOX9 positively
      regulates multiple WNT pathway genes, including those encoding WNT receptors
      (frizzled [FZD] and lipoprotein receptor-related protein [LRP] family members)
      and the downstream beta-catenin effector TCF4. Analyses of PCa xenografts and
      clinical samples both revealed an association between the expression of SOX9 and 
      WNT pathway components in PCa. Finally, treatment of SOX9-expressing PCa cells
      with a WNT synthesis inhibitor (LGK974) reduced WNT pathway signaling in vitro
      and tumor growth in murine xenograft models. Together, our data indicate that
      SOX9 expression drives PCa by reactivating the WNT/beta-catenin signaling that
      mediates ductal morphogenesis in fetal prostate and define a subgroup of patients
      who would benefit from WNT-targeted therapy.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from toxic substances within the
      peripheral circulation. It maintains brain homeostasis and is a hurdle for drug
      delivery to the CNS to treat neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's
      disease and brain tumors. The drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is
      highly expressed on brain endothelial cells and blocks the entry of most drugs
      delivered to the brain. Here, we show that activation of the A2A adenosine
      receptor (AR) with an FDA-approved A2A AR agonist (Lexiscan) rapidly and potently
      decreased P-gp expression and function in a time-dependent and reversible manner.
      We demonstrate that downmodulation of P-gp expression and function coincided with
      chemotherapeutic drug accumulation in brains of WT mice and in primary mouse and 
      human brain endothelial cells, which serve as in vitro BBB models. Lexiscan also 
      potently downregulated the expression of BCRP1, an efflux transporter that is
      highly expressed in the CNS vasculature and other tissues. Finally, we determined
      that multiple pathways, including MMP9 cleavage and ubiquitinylation, mediated
      P-gp downmodulation. Based on these data, we propose that A2A AR activation on
      BBB endothelial cells offers a therapeutic window that can be fine-tuned for drug
      delivery to the brain and has potential as a CNS drug-delivery technology.

LID - 10.1172/JCI84876 [doi]
LID - 84876 [pii]
AB  - Aberrant vascularization is a hallmark of cancer progression and treatment
      resistance. Here, we have shown that endothelial cell (EC) plasticity drives
      aberrant vascularization and chemoresistance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By
      utilizing human patient specimens, as well as allograft and genetic murine GBM
      models, we revealed that a robust endothelial plasticity in GBM allows
      acquisition of fibroblast transformation (also known as endothelial mesenchymal
      transition [Endo-MT]), which is characterized by EC expression of fibroblast
      markers, and determined that a prominent population of GBM-associated
      fibroblast-like cells have EC origin. Tumor ECs acquired the mesenchymal gene
      signature without the loss of EC functions, leading to enhanced cell
      proliferation and migration, as well as vessel permeability. Furthermore, we
      identified a c-Met/ETS-1/matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) axis that controls 
      VE-cadherin degradation, Endo-MT, and vascular abnormality. Pharmacological c-Met
      inhibition induced vessel normalization in patient tumor-derived ECs. Finally,
      EC-specific KO of Met inhibited vascular transformation, normalized blood
      vessels, and reduced intratumoral hypoxia, culminating in suppressed tumor growth
      and prolonged survival in GBM-bearing mice after temozolomide treatment.
      Together, these findings illustrate a mechanism that controls aberrant tumor
      vascularization and suggest that targeting Endo-MT may offer selective and
      efficient strategies for antivascular and vessel normalization therapies in GBM, 
      and possibly other malignant tumors.

AB  - A classic metabolic concept posits that insulin promotes energy storage and
      adipose expansion, while catecholamines stimulate release of adipose energy
      stores by hydrolysis of triglycerides through beta-adrenergic receptor (betaARs) 
      and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Here, we have shown that a key hub in the
      insulin signaling pathway, activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) through
      mTORC1, is also triggered by PKA activation in both mouse and human adipocytes.
      Mice with mTORC1 impairment, either through adipocyte-specific deletion of Raptor
      or pharmacologic rapamycin treatment, were refractory to the well-known
      betaAR-dependent increase of uncoupling protein UCP1 expression and expansion of 
      beige/brite adipocytes (so-called browning) in white adipose tissue (WAT).
      Mechanistically, PKA directly phosphorylated mTOR and RAPTOR on unique serine
      residues, an effect that was independent of insulin/AKT signaling. Abrogation of 
      the PKA site within RAPTOR disrupted betaAR/mTORC1 activation of S6K1 without
      affecting mTORC1 activation by insulin. Conversely, a phosphomimetic RAPTOR
      augmented S6K1 activity. Together, these studies reveal a signaling pathway from 
      betaARs and PKA through mTORC1 that is required for adipose browning by
      catecholamines and provides potential therapeutic strategies to enhance energy
      expenditure and combat metabolic disease.

TI  - MEIS1-mediated transactivation of synaptotagmin-like 1 promotes CXCL12/CXCR4
      signaling and leukemogenesis.
PG  - 1664-78

AB  - The TALE-class homeoprotein MEIS1 specifically collaborates with HOXA9 to drive
      myeloid leukemogenesis. Although MEIS1 alone has only a moderate effect on cell
      proliferation in vitro, it is essential for the development of HOXA9-induced
      leukemia in vivo. Here, using murine models of leukemogenesis, we have shown that
      MEIS1 promotes leukemic cell homing and engraftment in bone marrow and enhances
      cell-cell interactions and cytokine-mediated cell migration. We analyzed global
      DNA binding of MEIS1 in leukemic cells as well as gene expression alterations in 
      MEIS1-deficent cells and identified synaptotagmin-like 1 (Sytl1, also known as
      Slp1) as the MEIS1 target gene that cooperates with Hoxa9 in leukemogenesis.
      Replacement of SYTL1 in MEIS1-deficent cells restored both cell migration and
      engraftment. Further analysis revealed that SYTL1 promotes cell migration via
      activation of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, as SYTL1 determines intracellular
      trafficking of CXCR4. Together, our results reveal that MEIS1, through induction 
      of SYTL1, promotes leukemogenesis and supports leukemic cell homing and
      engraftment, facilitating interactions between leukemic cells and bone marrow
      stroma.

TI  - Protease-resistant modified human beta-hexosaminidase B ameliorates symptoms in
      GM2 gangliosidosis model.
PG  - 1691-703

LID - 85300 [pii]
AB  - GM2 gangliosidoses, including Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are
      neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases that are caused by deficiency of
      beta-hexosaminidase A, which comprises an alphabeta heterodimer. There are no
      effective treatments for these diseases; however, various strategies aimed at
      restoring beta-hexosaminidase A have been explored. Here, we produced a modified 
      human hexosaminidase subunit beta (HexB), which we have termed mod2B, composed of
      homodimeric beta subunits that contain amino acid sequences from the alpha
      subunit that confer GM2 ganglioside-degrading activity and protease resistance.
      We also developed fluorescent probes that allow visualization of endocytosis of
      mod2B via mannose 6-phosphate receptors and delivery of mod2B to lysosomes in GM2
      gangliosidosis models. In addition, we applied imaging mass spectrometry to
      monitor efficacy of this approach in Sandhoff disease model mice. Following
      i.c.v. administration, mod2B was widely distributed and reduced accumulation of
      GM2, asialo-GM2, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate in brain regions including the
      hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Moreover, mod2B administration
      markedly improved motor dysfunction and a prolonged lifespan in Sandhoff disease 
      mice. Together, the results of our study indicate that mod2B has potential for
      intracerebrospinal fluid enzyme replacement therapy and should be further
      explored as a gene therapy for GM2 gangliosidoses.

TI  - Hedgehog inhibits beta-catenin activity in synovial joint development and
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - 1649-63
LID - 10.1172/JCI80205 [doi]
LID - 80205 [pii]
AB  - Both the WNT/beta-catenin and hedgehog signaling pathways are important in the
      regulation of limb development, chondrocyte differentiation, and degeneration of 
      articular cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA). It is not clear how these signaling
      pathways interact in interzone cell differentiation and synovial joint
      morphogenesis. Here, we determined that constitutive activation of hedgehog
      signaling specifically within interzone cells induces joint morphological changes
      by selectively inhibiting beta-catenin-induced Fgf18 expression. Stabilization of
      beta-catenin or treatment with FGF18 rescued hedgehog-induced phenotypes.
      Hedgehog signaling induced expression of a dominant negative isoform of TCF7L2
      (dnTCF7L2) in interzone progeny, which may account for the selective regulation
      of beta-catenin target genes observed. Knockdown of TCF7L2 isoforms in mouse
      chondrocytes rescued hedgehog signaling-induced Fgf18 downregulation, while
      overexpression of the human dnTCF7L2 orthologue (dnTCF4) in human chondrocytes
      promoted the expression of catabolic enzymes associated with OA. Similarly,
      expression of dnTCF4 in human chondrocytes positively correlated with the
      aggrecanase ADAMTS4. Consistent with our developmental findings, activation of
      beta-catenin also attenuated hedgehog-induced or surgically induced articular
      cartilage degeneration in mouse models of OA. Thus, our results demonstrate that 
      hedgehog inhibits selective beta-catenin target gene expression to direct
      interzone progeny fates and articular cartilage development and disease.
      Moreover, agents that increase beta-catenin activity have the potential to
      therapeutically attenuate articular cartilage degeneration as part of OA.

LID - 86318 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical laboratory tests are now being prescribed and made directly 
      available to consumers through retail outlets in the USA. Concerns with these
      test have been raised regarding the uncertainty of testing methods used in these 
      venues and a lack of open, scientific validation of the technical accuracy and
      clinical equivalency of results obtained through these services. METHODS: We
      conducted a cohort study of 60 healthy adults to compare the uncertainty and
      accuracy in 22 common clinical lab tests between one company offering blood tests
      obtained from finger prick (Theranos) and 2 major clinical testing services that 
      require standard venipuncture draws (Quest and LabCorp). Samples were collected
      in Phoenix, Arizona, at an ambulatory clinic and at retail outlets with
      point-of-care services. RESULTS: Theranos flagged tests outside their normal
      range 1.6x more often than other testing services (P < 0.0001). Of the 22 lab
      measurements evaluated, 15 (68%) showed significant interservice variability (P <
      0.002). We found nonequivalent lipid panel test results between Theranos and
      other clinical services. Variability in testing services, sample collection
      times, and subjects markedly influenced lab results. CONCLUSION: While laboratory
      practice standards exist to control this variability, the disparities between
      testing services we observed could potentially alter clinical interpretation and 
      health care utilization. Greater transparency and evaluation of testing
      technologies would increase their utility in personalized health management.

AB  - Hemodynamic shear forces are intimately linked with cardiac development, during
      which trabeculae form a network of branching outgrowths from the myocardium.
      Mutations that alter Notch signaling also result in trabeculation defects. Here, 
      we assessed whether shear stress modulates trabeculation to influence contractile
      function. Specifically, we acquired 4D (3D + time) images with light sheets by
      selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) for rapid scanning and deep axial 
      penetration during zebrafish morphogenesis. Reduction of blood viscosity via
      gata1a morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) reduced shear stress, resulting in
      downregulation of Notch signaling and attenuation of trabeculation. Arrest of
      cardiomyocyte contraction either by troponin T type 2a (tnnt2a) MO or in weak
      atriumm58 (wea) mutants resulted in reduced shear stress and downregulation of
      Notch signaling and trabeculation. Integrating 4D SPIM imaging with
      synchronization algorithm demonstrated that coinjection of neuregulin1 mRNA with 
      gata1 MO rescued trabeculation to restore contractile function in association
      with upregulation of Notch-related genes. Crossbreeding of Tg(flk:mCherry) fish, 
      which allows visualization of the vascular system with the Tg(tp1:gfp) Notch
      reporter line, revealed that shear stress-mediated Notch activation localizes to 
      the endocardium. Deleting endocardium via the clochesk4 mutants downregulated
      Notch signaling, resulting in nontrabeculated ventricle. Subjecting endothelial
      cells to pulsatile flow in the presence of the ADAM10 inhibitor corroborated
      shear stress-activated Notch signaling to modulate trabeculation.

LID - 81137 [pii]
AB  - DC-derived exosomes (Dex) are nanometer-sized membrane vesicles that are secreted
      by the sentinel antigen-presenting cells of the immune system: DCs. Like DCs, the
      molecular composition of Dex includes surface expression of functional
      MHC-peptide complexes, costimulatory molecules, and other components that
      interact with immune cells. Dex have the potential to facilitate immune
      cell-dependent tumor rejection and have distinct advantages over cell-based
      immunotherapies involving DCs. Accordingly, Dex-based phase I and II clinical
      trials have been conducted in advanced malignancies, showing the feasibility and 
      safety of the approach, as well as the propensity of these nanovesicles to
      mediate T and NK cell-based immune responses in patients. This Review will
      evaluate the interactions of Dex with immune cells, their clinical progress, and 
      the future of Dex immunotherapy for cancer.

AB  - Humans circulate quadrillions of exosomes at all times. Exosomes are a class of
      extracellular vesicles released by all cells, with a size range of 40-150 nm and 
      a lipid bilayer membrane. Exosomes contain DNA, RNA, and proteins. Exosomes
      likely remove excess and/or unnecessary constituents from the cells, functioning 
      like garbage bags, although their precise physiological role remains unknown.
      Additionally, exosomes may mediate specific cell-to-cell communication and
      activate signaling pathways in cells they fuse or interact with. Exosomes are
      detected in the tumor microenvironment, and emerging evidence suggests that they 
      play a role in facilitating tumorigenesis by regulating angiogenesis, immunity,
      and metastasis. Circulating exosomes can be used as liquid biopsies and
      noninvasive biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer
      patients.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs, including exosomes) are implicated in many aspects
      of nervous system development and function, including regulation of synaptic
      communication, synaptic strength, and nerve regeneration. They mediate the
      transfer of packets of information in the form of nonsecreted proteins and
      DNA/RNA protected within a membrane compartment. EVs are essential for the
      packaging and transport of many cell-fate proteins during development as well as 
      many neurotoxic misfolded proteins during pathogenesis. This form of
      communication provides another dimension of cellular crosstalk, with the ability 
      to assemble a "kit" of directional instructions made up of different molecular
      entities and address it to specific recipient cells. This multidimensional form
      of communication has special significance in the nervous system. How EVs help to 
      orchestrate the wiring of the brain while allowing for plasticity associated with
      learning and memory and contribute to regeneration and degeneration are all under
      investigation. Because they carry specific disease-related RNAs and proteins,
      practical applications of EVs include potential uses as biomarkers and
      therapeutics. This Review describes our current understanding of EVs and serves
      as a springboard for future advances, which may reveal new important mechanisms
      by which EVs in coordinate brain and body function and dysfunction.

AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Stroke
      recovery is orchestrated by a set of highly interactive processes that involve
      the neurovascular unit and neural stem cells. Emerging data suggest that exosomes
      play an important role in intercellular communication by transferring exosomal
      protein and RNA cargo between source and target cells in the brain. Here, we
      review these advances and their impact on promoting coupled brain remodeling
      processes after stroke. The use of exosomes for therapeutic applications in
      stroke is also highlighted.

LID - 81132 [pii]
AB  - Exosomes and other extracellular microvesicles (ExMVs) have important functions
      in intercellular communication and regulation. During the course of infection,
      these vesicles can convey pathogen molecules that serve as antigens or agonists
      of innate immune receptors to induce host defense and immunity, or that serve as 
      regulators of host defense and mediators of immune evasion. These molecules may
      include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. Pathogen molecules
      may be disseminated by incorporation into vesicles that are created and shed by
      host cells, or they may be incorporated into vesicles shed from microbial cells. 
      Involvement of ExMVs in the induction of immunity and host defense is widespread 
      among many pathogens, whereas their involvement in immune evasion mechanisms is
      prominent among pathogens that establish chronic infection and is found in some
      that cause acute infection. Because of their immunogenicity and enrichment of
      pathogen molecules, exosomes may also have potential in vaccine preparations and 
      as diagnostic markers. Additionally, the ability of exosomes to deliver molecules
      to recipient cells raises the possibility of their use for drug/therapy delivery.
      Thus, ExMVs play a major role in the pathogenesis of infection and provide
      exciting potential for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic
      approaches.

AB  - Almost all cell types release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are derived
      either from multivesicular bodies or from the plasma membrane. EVs contain a
      subset of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids from the cell from which they are
      derived. EV factors, particularly small RNAs such as miRNAs, likely play
      important roles in cell-to-cell communication both locally and systemically. Most
      of the functions associated with EVs are in the regulation of immune responses to
      pathogens and cancer, as well as in regulating autoimmunity. This Review will
      focus on the different modes of immune regulation, both direct and indirect, by
      EVs. The therapeutic utility of EVs for the regulation of immune responses will
      also be discussed.

AB  - Two broad categories of extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes and shed
      microvesicles (sMVs), which differ in size distribution as well as protein and
      RNA profiles, have been described. EVs are known to play key roles in cell-cell
      communication, acting proximally as well as systemically. This Review discusses
      the nature of EV subtypes, strategies for isolating EVs from both cell-culture
      media and body fluids, and procedures for quantifying EVs. We also discuss
      proteins selectively enriched in exosomes and sMVs that have the potential for
      use as markers to discriminate between EV subtypes, as well as various
      applications of EVs in clinical diagnosis.

PG  - 1144-51

LID - 81128 [pii]
AB  - New biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Similarly 
      to healthy cells, prostate epithelial cancer cells produce extracellular vesicles
      (prostasomes) that can be isolated from seminal fluid, urine, and blood.
      Prostasomes contain ubiquitously expressed and prostate-specific membrane and
      cytosolic proteins, as well as RNA. Both quantitative and qualitative changes in 
      protein, mRNA, long noncoding RNA, and microRNA composition of extracellular
      vesicles isolated from prostate cancer patients have been reported. In general,
      however, the identified extracellular vesicle-associated single-marker molecules 
      or combinations of marker molecules require confirmation in large cohorts of
      patients to validate their specificity and sensitivity as prostate cancer
      markers. Complications include variable factors such as prostate manipulation and
      urine flux, as well as masking by ubiquitously expressed free molecules and
      extracellular vesicles from tissues other than the prostate. Herein, we propose
      that the most promising methods include comprehensive combinational screening for
      (mutant) RNA in prostasomes that are immunoisolated with antibodies targeting
      prostate-specific epitopes.

AB  - Intercellular signaling via extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an underappreciated
      modality of cell-cell crosstalk that enables cells to convey packages of complex 
      instructions to specific recipient cells. EVs transmit these instructions through
      their cargoes of multiple proteins, nucleic acids, and specialized lipids, which 
      are derived from their cells of origin and allow for combinatorial effects upon
      recipient cells. This Review series brings together the recent progress in our
      understanding of EV signaling in physiological and pathophysiological conditions,
      highlighting how certain EVs, particularly exosomes, can promote or regulate
      infections, host immune responses, development, and various diseases - notably
      cancer. Given the diverse nature of EVs and their abilities to profoundly
      modulate host cells, this series puts particular emphasis on the clinical
      applications of EVs as therapeutics and as diagnostic biomarkers.

      permeability.
PG  - 1581-91

LID - 84518 [pii]
AB  - Lymphatic collecting vessels direct lymph into and from lymph nodes (LNs) and can
      become hyperpermeable as the result of a previous infection. Enhanced
      permeability has been implicated in compromised immunity due to reduced flow of
      lymph and immune cells to LNs, which are the primary site of antigen presentation
      to T cells. Presently, very little is known about the molecular signals that
      affect lymphatic collecting vessel permeability. Here, we have shown that
      lymphatic collecting vessel permeability is controlled by CCR7 and that the
      chronic hyperpermeability of collecting vessels observed in Ccr7-/- mice is
      followed by vessel fibrosis. Reexpression of CCR7 in DCs, however, was sufficient
      to reverse the development of such fibrosis. IFN regulatory factor 4-positive
      (IRF4+) DCs constitutively interacted with collecting lymphatics, and selective
      ablation of this DC subset in Cd11c-Cre Irf4fl/fl mice also rendered lymphatic
      collecting vessels hyperpermeable and fibrotic. Together, our data reveal that
      CCR7 plays multifaceted roles in regulating collecting vessel permeability and
      fibrosis, with one of the key players being IRF4-dependent DCs.

PG  - 1233-5

LID - 86798 [pii]
AB  - Precise epigenetic modifications in stem cells control developmental programs and
      cell fate decisions. In particular, the addition or removal of trimethylation of 
      histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at lineage-specific genes has been linked to the
      repression of gene expression, and a precise balance of methyltransferases and
      demethylases within cells determines H3K27me3 levels. The demethylase UTX is
      essential for development and tissue homeostasis; however, a role for UTX in stem
      cell-mediated tissue regeneration is unknown. In this issue of the JCI, Dilworth 
      and colleagues reveal that UTX and its demethylase activity are required in the
      muscle stem cell lineage for muscle regeneration in response to injury.
      Specifically, UTX mediates the removal of H3K27me3 in the promoter of the
      transcription factor myogenin, which regulates myogenic differentiation. The
      results of this study provide important insight into the contribution of
      epigenetic regulation in stem cell-mediated regeneration of adult tissues.

TI  - Driving allotolerance: CAR-expressing Tregs for tolerance induction in organ and 
      stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 1248-50
LID - 10.1172/JCI86827 [doi]
LID - 86827 [pii]
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) modulate the function of a variety of immune cells and
      are critical for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing the development of
      autoimmune disease. Due to their ability to suppress effector T cells, Tregs have
      been increasingly explored for clinical use to suppress alloresponses. While this
      approach has been promising in preclinical models and early clinical trials,
      widespread clinical use of Tregs has been limited by the low number of these
      cells in the periphery and the unknown frequency of allo-responsive Tregs. In
      this issue of the JCI, MacDonald and colleagues transduced human Tregs with a
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets the HLA class I molecule A2. These
      CAR-expressing T cells were readily activated via CAR stimulation and exerted
      potent immunosuppressive effects when stimulated in vitro. In a murine model of
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CAR-modified Tregs were more effective
      in preventing the development of graft-versus-host disease compared with
      polyclonal Tregs. The results of this study lay the groundwork for the further
      evaluation of CAR-expressing Tregs in the prevention or treatment of transplant
      complications.

TI  - Schwann cells induce cancer cell dispersion and invasion.
PG  - 1538-54
LID - 10.1172/JCI82658 [doi]
LID - 82658 [pii]
AB  - Nerves enable cancer progression, as cancers have been shown to extend along
      nerves through the process of perineural invasion, which carries a poor
      prognosis. Furthermore, the innervation of some cancers promotes growth and
      metastases. It remains unclear, however, how nerves mechanistically contribute to
      cancer progression. Here, we demonstrated that Schwann cells promote cancer
      invasion through direct cancer cell contact. Histological evaluation of murine
      and human cancer specimens with perineural invasion uncovered a subpopulation of 
      Schwann cells that associates with cancer cells. Coculture of cancer cells with
      dorsal root ganglion extracts revealed that Schwann cells direct cancer cells to 
      migrate toward nerves and promote invasion in a contact-dependent manner. Upon
      contact, Schwann cells induced the formation of cancer cell protrusions in their 
      direction and intercalated between the cancer cells, leading to cancer cell
      dispersion. The formation of these processes was dependent on Schwann cell
      expression of neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) and ultimately promoted
      perineural invasion. Moreover, NCAM1-deficient mice showed decreased neural
      invasion and less paralysis. Such Schwann cell behavior reflects normal Schwann
      cell programs that are typically activated in nerve repair but are instead
      exploited by cancer cells to promote perineural invasion and cancer progression.

TI  - Estrogen turns down "the AIRE".
PG  - 1239-41
LID - 10.1172/JCI86800 [doi]
LID - 86800 [pii]
AB  - Genetic alterations are known drivers of autoimmune disease; however, there is a 
      much higher incidence of autoimmunity in women, implicating sex-specific factors 
      in disease development. The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene contributes to the
      maintenance of central tolerance, and complete loss of AIRE function results in
      the development of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1. In this issue
      of the JCI, Dragin and colleagues demonstrate that AIRE expression is
      downregulated in females as the result of estrogen-mediated alterations at the
      AIRE promoter. The association between estrogen and reduction of AIRE may at
      least partially account for the elevated incidence of autoimmune disease in women
      and has potential implications for sex hormone therapy.

AB  - Autoimmune diseases affect 5% to 8% of the population, and females are more
      susceptible to these diseases than males. Here, we analyzed human thymic
      transcriptome and revealed sex-associated differences in the expression of
      tissue-specific antigens that are controlled by the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), 
      a key factor in central tolerance. We hypothesized that the level of AIRE is
      linked to sexual dimorphism susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. In human and
      mouse thymus, females expressed less AIRE (mRNA and protein) than males after
      puberty. These results were confirmed in purified murine thymic epithelial cells 
      (TECs). We also demonstrated that AIRE expression is related to sexual hormones, 
      as male castration decreased AIRE thymic expression and estrogen receptor
      alpha-deficient mice did not show a sex disparity for AIRE expression. Moreover, 
      estrogen treatment resulted in downregulation of AIRE expression in cultured
      human TECs, human thymic tissue grafted to immunodeficient mice, and murine fetal
      thymus organ cultures. AIRE levels in human thymus grafted in immunodeficient
      mice depended upon the sex of the recipient. Estrogen also upregulated the number
      of methylated CpG sites in the AIRE promoter. Together, our results indicate that
      in females, estrogen induces epigenetic changes in the AIRE gene, leading to
      reduced AIRE expression under a threshold that increases female susceptibility to
      autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Modulation of LMNA splicing as a strategy to treat prelamin A diseases.
PG  - 1592-602
LID - 10.1172/JCI85908 [doi]
LID - 85908 [pii]
AB  - The alternatively spliced products of LMNA, lamin C and prelamin A (the precursor
      to lamin A), are produced in similar amounts in most tissues and have largely
      redundant functions. This redundancy suggests that diseases, such as
      Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), that are caused by prelamin
      A-specific mutations could be treated by shifting the output of LMNA more toward 
      lamin C. Here, we investigated mechanisms that regulate LMNA mRNA alternative
      splicing and assessed the feasibility of reducing prelamin A expression in vivo. 
      We identified an exon 11 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that increased lamin C
      production at the expense of prelamin A when transfected into mouse and human
      fibroblasts. The same ASO also reduced the expression of progerin, the mutant
      prelamin A protein in HGPS, in fibroblasts derived from patients with HGPS.
      Mechanistic studies revealed that the exon 11 sequences contain binding sites for
      serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), and SRSF2 knockdown lowered lamin
      A production in cells and in murine tissues. Moreover, administration of the exon
      11 ASO reduced lamin A expression in wild-type mice and progerin expression in an
      HGPS mouse model. Together, these studies identify ASO-mediated reduction of
      prelamin A as a potential strategy to treat prelamin A-specific diseases.

TI  - UTX demethylase activity is required for satellite cell-mediated muscle
      regeneration.
PG  - 1555-65
LID - 10.1172/JCI83239 [doi]
LID - 83239 [pii]
AB  - The X chromosome-encoded histone demethylase UTX (also known as KDM6A) mediates
      removal of repressive trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) to
      establish transcriptionally permissive chromatin. Loss of UTX in female mice is
      embryonic lethal. Unexpectedly, male UTX-null mice escape embryonic lethality due
      to expression of UTY, a paralog that lacks H3K27 demethylase activity, suggesting
      an enzyme-independent role for UTX in development and thereby challenging the
      need for active H3K27 demethylation in vivo. However, the requirement for active 
      H3K27 demethylation in stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration remains untested.
      Here, we employed an inducible mouse KO that specifically ablates Utx in
      satellite cells (SCs) and demonstrated that active H3K27 demethylation is
      necessary for muscle regeneration. Loss of UTX in SCs blocked myofiber
      regeneration in both male and female mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UTX 
      mediates muscle regeneration through its H3K27 demethylase activity, as loss of
      demethylase activity either by chemical inhibition or knock-in of
      demethylase-dead UTX resulted in defective muscle repair. Mechanistically,
      dissection of the muscle regenerative process revealed that the demethylase
      activity of UTX is required for expression of the transcription factor myogenin, 
      which in turn drives differentiation of muscle progenitors. Thus, we have
      identified a critical role for the enzymatic activity of UTX in activating
      muscle-specific gene expression during myofiber regeneration and have revealed a 
      physiological role for active H3K27 demethylation in vivo.

AB  - Exon skipping uses antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to alter transcript splicing
      for the purpose of rescuing or modulating protein expression. In this issue of
      the JCI, Lee and colleagues developed and evaluated an ASO-dependent method for
      treating certain molecularly defined diseases associated with alterations in
      lamin A/C (LMNA) splicing. Exon skipping by ASOs is gaining traction as a
      therapeutic strategy, and the use of ASOs is now being applied to bypass
      mutations and generate modified but functional proteins for an array of genetic
      disorders.

PG  - 1242-4

LID - 86801 [pii]
AB  - The invasion of cancer cells around and into nerves is associated with increased 
      cancer aggression and poor patient outcome. As this perineural invasion increases
      disease severity, a better understanding of how the process is regulated may help
      in the development of therapeutics to target neuronal involvement in cancer. In
      this issue of the JCI, Deborde and colleagues show that direct contact between
      Schwann cells and cancer cells promotes cancer cell dissociation, migration, and 
      invasion. Moreover, their data specifically suggest NCAM1 as an important
      molecular mediator of this Schwann cell-directed regulation of cancer cells in
      perineural invasion. The results of this study provide new insight into the
      cellular and molecular mechanisms of perineural invasion.

AB  - Adoptive immunotherapy with regulatory T cells (Tregs) is a promising treatment
      for allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Emerging data
      indicate that, compared with polyclonal Tregs, disease-relevant antigen-specific 
      Tregs may have numerous advantages, such as a need for fewer cells and reduced
      risk of nonspecific immune suppression. Current methods to generate
      alloantigen-specific Tregs rely on expansion with allogeneic antigen-presenting
      cells, which requires access to donor and recipient cells and multiple MHC
      mismatches. The successful use of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) for the
      generation of antigen-specific effector T cells suggests that a similar approach 
      could be used to generate alloantigen-specific Tregs. Here, we have described the
      creation of an HLA-A2-specific CAR (A2-CAR) and its application in the generation
      of alloantigen-specific human Tregs. In vitro, A2-CAR-expressing Tregs maintained
      their expected phenotype and suppressive function before, during, and after
      A2-CAR-mediated stimulation. In mouse models, human A2-CAR-expressing Tregs were 
      superior to Tregs expressing an irrelevant CAR at preventing xenogeneic GVHD
      caused by HLA-A2+ T cells. Together, our results demonstrate that use of CAR
      technology to generate potent, functional, and stable alloantigen-specific human 
      Tregs markedly enhances their therapeutic potential in transplantation and sets
      the stage for using this approach for making antigen-specific Tregs for therapy
      of multiple diseases.

AB  - Influenza A viruses (IAV) can cause lung injury and acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by accumulation of excessive fluid
      (edema) in the alveolar airspaces and leads to hypoxemia and death if not
      corrected. Clearance of excess edema fluid is driven mostly by the alveolar
      epithelial Na,K-ATPase and is crucial for survival of patients with ARDS. We
      therefore investigated whether IAV infection alters Na,K-ATPase expression and
      function in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and the ability of the lung to clear
      edema. IAV infection reduced Na,K-ATPase in the plasma membrane of human and
      murine AECs and in distal lung epithelium of infected mice. Moreover, induced
      Na,K-ATPase improved alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) in IAV-infected mice. We
      identified a paracrine cell communication network between infected and
      noninfected AECs and alveolar macrophages that leads to decreased alveolar
      epithelial Na,K-ATPase function and plasma membrane abundance and inhibition of
      AFC. We determined that the IAV-induced reduction of Na,K-ATPase is mediated by a
      host signaling pathway that involves epithelial type I IFN and an IFN-dependent
      elevation of macrophage TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Our data
      reveal that interruption of this cellular crosstalk improves edema resolution,
      which is of biologic and clinical importance to patients with IAV-induced lung
      injury.

LID - 86802 [pii]
AB  - Influenza infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading
      to poor disease outcome with high mortality. One of the driving features in the
      pathogenesis of ARDS is the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli, which causes
      severe pulmonary edema and impaired oxygen uptake. In this issue of the JCI,
      Peteranderl and colleagues define a paracrine communication between macrophages
      and type II alveolar epithelial cells during influenza infection where IFNalpha
      induces macrophage secretion of TRAIL that causes endocytosis of Na,K-ATPase by
      the alveolar epithelium. This reduction of Na,K-ATPase expression decreases
      alveolar fluid clearance, which in turn leads to pulmonary edema. Inhibition of
      the TRAIL signaling pathway has been shown to improve lung injury after influenza
      infection, and future studies will be needed to determine if blocking this
      pathway is a viable option in the treatment of ARDS.

PG  - 1163-72

LID - 81130 [pii]
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that non-cell-autonomous regulation of cancer cells
      is an important aspect of tumorigenesis. Cancer cells need to communicate with
      stromal cells by humoral factors such as VEGF, FGFs, and Wnt in order to survive.
      Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have also been shown to be involved in
      cell-cell communication between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment
      and to be important for the development of cancer. In addition, these EVs contain
      small noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), which contribute to the
      malignancy of cancer cells. Here, we provide an overview of current research on
      EVs, especially miRNAs in EVs. We also propose strategies to treat cancers by
      targeting EVs around cancer cells.

TI  - Loss of gastrokine-2 drives premalignant gastric inflammation and tumor
      progression.
PG  - 1383-400
LID - 10.1172/JCI82655 [doi]
LID - 82655 [pii]
AB  - Chronic mucosal inflammation is associated with a greater risk of gastric cancer 
      (GC) and, therefore, requires tight control by suppressive counter mechanisms.
      Gastrokine-2 (GKN2) belongs to a family of secreted proteins expressed within
      normal gastric mucosal cells. GKN2 expression is frequently lost during GC
      progression, suggesting an inhibitory role; however, a causal link remains
      unsubstantiated. Here, we developed Gkn2 knockout and transgenic overexpressing
      mice to investigate the functional impact of GKN2 loss in GC pathogenesis. In
      mouse models of GC, decreased GKN2 expression correlated with gastric pathology
      that paralleled human GC progression. At baseline, Gkn2 knockout mice exhibited
      defective gastric epithelial differentiation but not malignant progression.
      Conversely, Gkn2 knockout in the IL-11/STAT3-dependent gp130F/F GC model caused
      tumorigenesis of the proximal stomach. Additionally, gastric immunopathology was 
      accelerated in Helicobacter pylori-infected Gkn2 knockout mice and was associated
      with augmented T helper cell type 1 (Th1) but not Th17 immunity. Heightened Th1
      responses in Gkn2 knockout mice were linked to deregulated mucosal innate
      immunity and impaired myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation. Finally,
      transgenic overexpression of human gastrokines (GKNs) attenuated gastric tumor
      growth in gp130F/F mice. Together, these results reveal an antiinflammatory role 
      for GKN2, provide in vivo evidence that links GKN2 loss to GC pathogenesis, and
      suggest GKN restoration as a strategy to restrain GC progression.

PG  - 1401-12
LID - 10.1172/JCI84005 [doi]
LID - 84005 [pii]
AB  - The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is central to the
      action of insulin and many growth factors. Heterozygous mutations in the gene
      encoding the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1) have been identified in
      patients with SHORT syndrome - a disorder characterized by short stature, partial
      lipodystrophy, and insulin resistance. Here, we evaluated whether SHORT
      syndrome-associated PIK3R1 mutations account for the pathophysiology that
      underlies the abnormalities by generating knockin mice that are heterozygous for 
      the Pik3r1Arg649Trp mutation, which is homologous to the mutation found in the
      majority of affected individuals. Similar to the patients, mutant mice exhibited 
      a reduction in body weight and length, partial lipodystrophy, and systemic
      insulin resistance. These derangements were associated with a reduced capacity of
      insulin and other growth factors to activate PI3K in liver, muscle, and fat;
      marked insulin resistance in liver and fat of mutation-harboring animals; and
      insulin resistance in vitro in cells derived from these mice. In addition, mutant
      mice displayed defective insulin secretion and GLP-1 action on islets in vivo and
      in vitro. These data demonstrate the ability of this heterozygous mutation to
      alter PI3K activity in vivo and the central role of PI3K in insulin/growth factor
      action, adipocyte function, and glucose metabolism.

TI  - Matricellular protein CCN3 mitigates abdominal aortic aneurysm.
PG  - 1282-99
LID - 10.1172/JCI82337 [doi]
LID - 82337 [pii]
AB  - Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality;
      however, the mechanisms that are involved in disease initiation and progression
      are incompletely understood. Extracellular matrix proteins play an integral role 
      in modulating vascular homeostasis in health and disease. Here, we determined
      that the expression of the matricellular protein CCN3 is strongly reduced in
      rodent AAA models, including angiotensin II-induced AAA and elastase
      perfusion-stimulated AAA. CCN3 levels were also reduced in human AAA biopsies
      compared with those in controls. In murine models of induced AAA, germline
      deletion of Ccn3 resulted in severe phenotypes characterized by elastin
      fragmentation, vessel dilation, vascular inflammation, dissection, heightened ROS
      generation, and smooth muscle cell loss. Conversely, overexpression of CCN3
      mitigated both elastase- and angiotensin II-induced AAA formation in mice. BM
      transplantation experiments suggested that the AAA phenotype of CCN3-deficient
      mice is intrinsic to the vasculature, as AAA was not exacerbated in WT animals
      that received CCN3-deficient BM and WT BM did not reduce AAA severity in
      CCN3-deficient mice. Genetic and pharmacological approaches implicated the ERK1/2
      pathway as a critical regulator of CCN3-dependent AAA development. Together,
      these results demonstrate that CCN3 is a nodal regulator in AAA biology and
      identify CCN3 as a potential therapeutic target for vascular disease.

AB  - Vanishing white matter (VWM) is a fatal leukodystrophy that is caused by
      mutations in genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 
      2B (eIF2B). Disease onset and severity are codetermined by genotype. White matter
      astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are almost exclusively affected; however, the
      mechanisms of VWM development remain unclear. Here, we used VWM mouse models,
      patients' tissue, and cell cultures to investigate whether astrocytes or
      oligodendrocytes are the primary affected cell type. We generated 2 mouse models 
      with mutations (Eif2b5Arg191His/Arg191His and Eif2b4Arg484Trp/Arg484Trp) that
      cause severe VWM in humans and then crossed these strains to develop mice with
      various mutation combinations. Phenotypic severity was highly variable and
      dependent on genotype, reproducing the clinical spectrum of human VWM. In all
      mutant strains, impaired maturation of white matter astrocytes preceded onset and
      paralleled disease severity and progression. Bergmann glia and retinal Muller
      cells, nonforebrain astrocytes that have not been associated with VWM, were also 
      affected, and involvement of these cells was confirmed in VWM patients. In
      coculture, VWM astrocytes secreted factors that inhibited oligodendrocyte
      maturation, whereas WT astrocytes allowed normal maturation of VWM
      oligodendrocytes. These studies demonstrate that astrocytes are central in VWM
      pathomechanisms and constitute potential therapeutic targets. Importantly,
      astrocytes should also be considered in the pathophysiology of other white matter
      disorders.

AB  - Most skin cancers develop as the result of UV light-induced DNA damage; however, 
      a substantial number of cases appear to occur independently of UV damage. A
      causal link between UV-independent skin cancers and chronic inflammation has been
      suspected, although the precise mechanism underlying this association is unclear.
      Here, we have proposed that activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, encoded
      by AICDA) links chronic inflammation and skin cancer. We demonstrated that Tg
      mice expressing AID in the skin spontaneously developed skin squamous cell
      carcinoma with Hras and Trp53 mutations. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Aicda
      reduced tumor incidence in a murine model of chemical-induced skin
      carcinogenesis. AID was expressed in human primary keratinocytes in an
      inflammatory stimulus-dependent manner and was detectable in human skin cancers. 
      Together, the results of this study indicate that inflammation-induced AID
      expression promotes skin cancer development independently of UV damage and
      suggest AID as a potential target for skin cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a
      high-risk ALL commonly associated with alterations that affect the tyrosine
      kinase pathway, tumor suppressors, and lymphoid transcription factors.
      Loss-of-function mutations in the gene-encoding adaptor protein LNK (also known
      as SH2B3) are found in Ph-like ALLs; however, it is not clear how LNK regulates
      normal B cell development or promotes leukemogenesis. Here, we have shown that
      combined loss of Lnk and tumor suppressors Tp53 or Ink4a/Arf in mice triggers a
      highly aggressive and transplantable precursor B-ALL. Tp53-/-Lnk-/- B-ALLs
      displayed similar gene expression profiles to human Ph-like B-ALLs, supporting
      use of this model for preclinical and molecular studies. Preleukemic
      Tp53-/-Lnk-/- pro-B progenitors were hypersensitive to IL-7, exhibited marked
      self-renewal in vitro and in vivo, and were able to initiate B-ALL in transplant 
      recipients. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that LNK regulates pro-B progenitor 
      homeostasis by attenuating IL-7-stimuated JAK/STAT5 signaling via a direct
      interaction with phosphorylated JAK3. Moreover, JAK inhibitors were effective in 
      prolonging survival of mice transplanted with Lnk-/-Tp53-/- leukemia.
      Additionally, synergistic administration of PI3K/mTOR and JAK inhibitors further 
      abrogated leukemia development. Hence, our results suggest that LNK suppresses
      IL-7R/JAK/STAT signaling to restrict pro-/pre-B progenitor expansion and leukemia
      development, providing a pathogenic mechanism and a potential therapeutic
      approach for B-ALLs with LNK mutations.

AB  - Posttranscriptional control of gene expression is important for defining both
      normal and pathological cellular phenotypes. In vitro, RNA-binding proteins
      (RBPs) have recently been shown to play important roles in posttranscriptional
      regulation; however, the contribution of RBPs to cell specification is not well
      understood. Here, we determined that the RBP insulin-like growth factor 2
      mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) is specifically overexpressed in mixed lineage
      leukemia-rearranged (MLL-rearranged) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL),
      which constitutes a subtype of this malignancy associated with poor prognosis and
      high risk of relapse. IGF2BP3 was required for the survival of B-ALL cell lines, 
      as knockdown led to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Enforced
      expression of IGF2BP3 provided murine BM cells with a strong survival advantage, 
      led to proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and skewed
      hematopoietic development to the B cell/myeloid lineage. Cross-link
      immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing uncovered the
      IGF2BP3-regulated transcriptome, which includes oncogenes MYC and CDK6 as direct 
      targets. IGF2BP3 regulated transcripts via targeting elements within 3'
      untranslated regions (3'UTR), and enforced IGF2BP3 expression in mice resulted in
      enhanced expression of Myc and Cdk6 in BM. Together, our data suggest that
      IGF2BP3-mediated targeting of oncogenic transcripts may represent a critical
      pathogenetic mechanism in MLL-rearranged B-ALL and support IGF2BP3 and its
      cognate RNA-binding partners as potential therapeutic targets in this disease.

AB  - Avian H7N9 influenza viruses are group 2 influenza A viruses that have been
      identified as the etiologic agent for a current major outbreak that began in
      China in 2013 and may pose a pandemic threat. Here, we examined the human
      H7-reactive antibody response in 75 recipients of a monovalent inactivated
      A/Shanghai/02/2013 H7N9 vaccine. After 2 doses of vaccine, the majority of donors
      had memory B cells that secreted IgGs specific for H7 HA, with dominant responses
      against single HA subtypes, although frequencies of H7-reactive B cells ranged
      widely between donors. We isolated 12 naturally occurring mAbs with low
      half-maximal effective concentrations for binding, 5 of which possessed
      neutralizing and HA-inhibiting activities. The 5 neutralizing mAbs exhibited
      narrow breadth of reactivity with influenza H7 strains. Epitope-mapping studies
      using neutralization escape mutant analysis, deuterium exchange mass
      spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography revealed that these neutralizing mAbs
      bind near the receptor-binding pocket on HA. All 5 neutralizing mAbs possessed
      low numbers of somatic mutations, suggesting the clones arose from naive B cells.
      The most potent mAb, H7.167, was tested as a prophylactic treatment in a mouse
      intranasal virus challenge study, and systemic administration of the mAb markedly
      reduced viral lung titers.

TI  - NOTCH signaling in skeletal progenitors is critical for fracture repair.
PG  - 1471-81

LID - 80672 [pii]
AB  - Fracture nonunions develop in 10%-20% of patients with fractures, resulting in
      prolonged disability. Current data suggest that bone union during fracture repair
      is achieved via proliferation and differentiation of skeletal progenitors within 
      periosteal and soft tissues surrounding bone, while bone marrow stromal/stem
      cells (BMSCs) and other skeletal progenitors may also contribute. The NOTCH
      signaling pathway is a critical maintenance factor for BMSCs during skeletal
      development, although the precise role for NOTCH and the requisite nature of
      BMSCs following fracture is unknown. Here, we evaluated whether NOTCH and/or
      BMSCs are required for fracture repair by performing nonstabilized and stabilized
      fractures on NOTCH-deficient mice with targeted deletion of RBPjk in skeletal
      progenitors, maturing osteoblasts, and committed chondrocytes. We determined that
      removal of NOTCH signaling in BMSCs and subsequent depletion of this population
      result in fracture nonunion, as the fracture repair process was normal in animals
      harboring either osteoblast- or chondrocyte-specific deletion of RBPjk. Together,
      this work provides a genetic model of a fracture nonunion and demonstrates the
      requirement for NOTCH and BMSCs in fracture repair, irrespective of fracture
      stability and vascularity.

TI  - Targeting prion-like protein doppel selectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis.
PG  - 1251-66

LID - 83427 [pii]
AB  - Controlled and site-specific regulation of growth factor signaling remains a
      major challenge for current antiangiogenic therapies, as these antiangiogenic
      agents target normal vasculature as well tumor vasculature. In this article, we
      identified the prion-like protein doppel as a potential therapeutic target for
      tumor angiogenesis. We investigated the interactions between doppel and VEGFR2
      and evaluated whether blocking the doppel/VEGFR2 axis suppresses the process of
      angiogenesis. We discovered that tumor endothelial cells (TECs), but not normal
      ECs, express doppel; tumors from patients and mouse xenografts expressed doppel
      in their vasculatures. Induced doppel overexpression in ECs enhanced
      vascularization, whereas doppel constitutively colocalized and complexed with
      VEGFR2 in TECs. Doppel inhibition depleted VEGFR2 from the cell membrane,
      subsequently inducing the internalization and degradation of VEGFR2 and thereby
      attenuating VEGFR2 signaling. We also synthesized an orally active
      glycosaminoglycan (LHbisD4) that specifically binds with doppel. We determined
      that LHbisD4 concentrates over the tumor site and that genetic loss of doppel in 
      TECs decreases LHbisD4 binding and targeting both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover,
      LHbisD4 eliminated VEGFR2 from the cell membrane, prevented VEGF binding in TECs,
      and suppressed tumor growth. Together, our results demonstrate that blocking
      doppel can control VEGF signaling in TECs and selectively inhibit tumor
      angiogenesis.

LID - 10.1172/JCI82587 [doi]
LID - 82587 [pii]
AB  - Alloreactive donor T cells are the driving force in the induction of
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), yet little is known about T cell metabolism in 
      response to alloantigens after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Here, we
      have demonstrated that donor T cells undergo metabolic reprograming after
      allogeneic HCT. Specifically, we employed a murine allogeneic BM transplant model
      and determined that T cells switch from fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) and
      pyruvate oxidation via the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle to aerobic glycolysis,
      thereby increasing dependence upon glutaminolysis and the pentose phosphate
      pathway. Glycolysis was required for optimal function of alloantigen-activated T 
      cells and induction of GVHD, as inhibition of glycolysis by targeting mTORC1 or
      6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) ameliorated GVHD
      mortality and morbidity. Together, our results indicate that donor T cells use
      glycolysis as the predominant metabolic process after allogeneic HCT and suggest 
      that glycolysis has potential as a therapeutic target for the control of GVHD.

PG  - 1353-66

LID - 84456 [pii]
AB  - Macrophages have long been considered to contribute to HIV infection of the CNS; 
      however, a recent study has contradicted this early work and suggests that
      myeloid cells are not an in vivo source of virus production. Here, we addressed
      the role of macrophages in HIV infection by first analyzing monocytes isolated
      from viremic patients and patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment. We were
      unable to find viral DNA or viral outgrowth in monocytes isolated from peripheral
      blood. To determine whether tissue macrophages are productively infected, we used
      3 different but complementary humanized mouse models. Two of these models (bone
      marrow/liver/thymus [BLT] mice and T cell-only mice [ToM]) have been previously
      described, and the third model was generated by reconstituting immunodeficient
      mice with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells that were devoid of human T cells 
      (myeloid-only mice [MoM]) to specifically evaluate HIV replication in this
      population. Using MoM, we demonstrated that macrophages can sustain HIV
      replication in the absence of T cells; HIV-infected macrophages are distributed
      in various tissues including the brain; replication-competent virus can be
      rescued ex vivo from infected macrophages; and infected macrophages can establish
      de novo infection. Together, these results demonstrate that macrophages represent
      a genuine target for HIV infection in vivo that can sustain and transmit
      infection.

TI  - Sortilin mediates vascular calcification via its recruitment into extracellular
      vesicles.
PG  - 1323-36

LID - 80851 [pii]
AB  - Vascular calcification is a common feature of major cardiovascular diseases.
      Extracellular vesicles participate in the formation of microcalcifications that
      are implicated in atherosclerotic plaque rupture; however, the mechanisms that
      regulate formation of calcifying extracellular vesicles remain obscure. Here, we 
      have demonstrated that sortilin is a key regulator of smooth muscle cell (SMC)
      calcification via its recruitment to extracellular vesicles. Sortilin localized
      to calcifying vessels in human and mouse atheromata and participated in formation
      of microcalcifications in SMC culture. Sortilin regulated the loading of the
      calcification protein tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) into
      extracellular vesicles, thereby conferring its calcification potential.
      Furthermore, SMC calcification required Rab11-dependent trafficking and
      FAM20C/casein kinase 2-dependent C-terminal phosphorylation of sortilin. In a
      murine model, Sort1-deficiency reduced arterial calcification but did not affect 
      bone mineralization. Additionally, transfer of sortilin-deficient BM cells to
      irradiated atherosclerotic mice did not affect vascular calcification, indicating
      a primary role of SMC-derived sortilin. Together, the results of this study
      identify sortilin phosphorylation as a potential therapeutic target for ectopic
      calcification/microcalcification and may clarify the mechanism that underlies the
      genetic association between the SORT1 gene locus and coronary artery
      calcification.

TI  - MLL1 and DOT1L cooperate with meningioma-1 to induce acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1438-50
LID - 10.1172/JCI80825 [doi]
LID - 80825 [pii]
AB  - Meningioma-1 (MN1) overexpression is frequently observed in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) and is predictive of poor prognosis. In murine models,
      forced expression of MN1 in hematopoietic progenitors induces an aggressive
      myeloid leukemia that is strictly dependent on a defined gene expression program 
      in the cell of origin, which includes the homeobox genes Hoxa9 and Meis1 as key
      components. Here, we have shown that this program is controlled by two histone
      methyltransferases, MLL1 and DOT1L, as deletion of either Mll1 or Dot1l in
      MN1-expressing cells abrogated the cell of origin-derived gene expression
      program, including the expression of Hoxa cluster genes. In murine models,
      genetic inactivation of either Mll1 or Dot1l impaired MN1-mediated
      leukemogenesis. We determined that HOXA9 and MEIS1 are coexpressed with MN1 in a 
      subset of clinical MN1hi leukemia, and human MN1hi/HOXA9hi leukemias were
      sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of DOT1L. Together, these data point to
      DOT1L as a potential therapeutic target in MN1hi AML. In addition, our findings
      suggest that epigenetic modulation of the interplay between an oncogenic lesion
      and its cooperating developmental program has therapeutic potential in AML.

LID - 81136 [pii]
AB  - Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) are harbingers of tumor-induced immune suppression: 
      they carry immunosuppressive molecules and factors known to interfere with immune
      cell functions. By delivering suppressive cargos consisting of proteins similar
      to those in parent tumor cells to immune cells, TEX directly or indirectly
      influence the development, maturation, and antitumor activities of immune cells. 
      TEX also deliver genomic DNA, mRNA, and microRNAs to immune cells, thereby
      reprogramming functions of responder cells to promote tumor progression. TEX
      carrying tumor-associated antigens can interfere with antitumor immunotherapies. 
      TEX also have the potential to serve as noninvasive biomarkers of tumor
      progression. In the tumor microenvironment, TEX may be involved in operating
      numerous signaling pathways responsible for the downregulation of antitumor
      immunity.

TI  - Dose-escalation study of octanoic acid in patients with essential tremor.
PG  - 1451-7
LID - 10.1172/JCI83621 [doi]
LID - 83621 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, 1-octanol has been shown to have efficacy in treating
      patients with essential tremor (ET). The primary metabolite of 1-octanol is
      octanoic acid (OA), which is now thought to be the active substance that mediates
      tremor suppression. Our aim was to describe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      oral OA in patients with ET and assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) profile of OA. METHODS: The MTD was studied using an
      open-label, single-ascending 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Predefined single
      doses ranged from 8 to 128 mg/kg, with grade 2 adverse events (AEs) defined as
      dose-limiting toxicity. Tremor was assessed using accelerometry, digital spiral
      analysis, and a standard clinical rating scale at baseline and up to 600 minutes 
      after intake. Safety assessments and PK sampling were also performed. RESULTS:
      Dose-limiting toxicity was not reached. The most frequent AE was mild abdominal
      discomfort. Exposure (AUC) increased linearly with the dose. Secondary efficacy
      measures suggested a dose-dependent reduction of tremor. Accordingly, a single
      unified PK/PD model with an effect compartment and sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) 
      response could be built that accounted well for the time profiles of plasma
      concentrations as well as effects on tremor severity across the 5 dose levels.
      CONCLUSION: Although our trial did not reach an MTD, a dose-dependent effect was 
      demonstrated in the PK/PD model as well as in secondary efficacy outcomes. Future
      studies are needed to explore the safety in higher dose ranges and to confirm
      dose-dependent efficacy in a placebo-controlled design. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Acute and chronic tissue injury results in the generation of a myriad of
      environmental cues that macrophages respond to by changing their phenotype and
      function. This phenotypic regulation is critical for controlling tissue
      inflammation and resolution. Here, we have identified the adaptor protein
      disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) as a regulator of phenotypic switching in macrophages. 
      Dab2 expression was upregulated in M2 macrophages and suppressed in M1
      macrophages isolated from both mice and humans, and genetic deletion of Dab2
      predisposed macrophages to adopt a proinflammatory M1 phenotype. In mice with
      myeloid cell-specific deletion of Dab2 (Dab2fl/fl Lysm-Cre), treatment with
      sublethal doses of LPS resulted in increased proinflammatory gene expression and 
      macrophage activation. Moreover, chronic high-fat feeding exacerbated adipose
      tissue inflammation, M1 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages, and the
      development of insulin resistance in DAB2-deficient animals compared with
      controls. Mutational analyses revealed that DAB2 interacts with TNF
      receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and attenuates IkappaB kinase beta-dependent
      (IKKbeta-dependent) phosphorylation of Ser536 in the transactivation domain of
      NF-kappaB p65. Together, these findings reveal that DAB2 is critical for
      controlling inflammatory signaling during phenotypic polarization of macrophages 
      and suggest that manipulation of DAB2 expression and function may hold
      therapeutic potential for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory
      disorders.

AB  - The adult kidney plays a central role in erythropoiesis and is the main source of
      erythropoietin (EPO), an oxygen-sensitive glycoprotein that is essential for red 
      blood cell production. Decreases of renal pO2 promote hypoxia-inducible factor
      2-mediated (HIF-2-mediated) induction of EPO in peritubular interstitial
      fibroblast-like cells, which serve as the cellular site of EPO synthesis in the
      kidney. It is not clear whether HIF signaling in other renal cell types also
      contributes to the regulation of EPO production. Here, we used a genetic approach
      in mice to investigate the role of renal epithelial HIF in erythropoiesis.
      Specifically, we found that HIF activation in the proximal nephron via induced
      inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets the
      HIF-alpha subunit for proteasomal degradation, led to rapid development of
      hypoproliferative anemia that was associated with a reduction in the number of
      EPO-producing renal interstitial cells. Moreover, suppression of renal EPO
      production was associated with increased glucose uptake, enhanced glycolysis,
      reduced mitochondrial mass, diminished O2 consumption, and elevated renal tissue 
      pO2. Our genetic analysis suggests that tubulointerstitial cellular crosstalk
      modulates renal EPO production under conditions of epithelial HIF activation in
      the kidney.

TI  - Endogenous transmembrane protein UT2 inhibits pSTAT3 and suppresses hematological
      malignancy.
PG  - 1300-10
LID - 10.1172/JCI84620 [doi]
LID - 84620 [pii]
AB  - Regulation of STAT3 activation is critical for normal and malignant hematopoietic
      cell proliferation. Here, we have reported that the endogenous transmembrane
      protein upstream-of-mTORC2 (UT2) negatively regulates activation of STAT3.
      Specifically, we determined that UT2 interacts directly with GP130 and inhibits
      phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine 705 (STAT3Y705). This reduces cytokine
      signaling including IL6 that is implicated in multiple myeloma and other
      hematopoietic malignancies. Modulation of UT2 resulted in inverse effects on
      animal survival in myeloma models. Samples from multiple myeloma patients also
      revealed a decreased copy number of UT2 and decreased expression of UT2 in
      genomic and transcriptomic analyses, respectively. Together, these studies
      identify a transmembrane protein that functions to negatively regulate cytokine
      signaling through GP130 and pSTAT3Y705 and is molecularly and mechanistically
      distinct from the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of genes.
      Moreover, this work provides evidence that perturbations of this
      activation-dampening molecule participate in hematologic malignancies and may
      serve as a key determinant of multiple myeloma pathophysiology. UT2 is a negative
      regulator shared across STAT3 and mTORC2 signaling cascades, functioning as a
      tumor suppressor in hematologic malignancies driven by those pathways.

LID - 83724 [pii]
AB  - Advances in the field of cancer immunology, including studies on
      tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), have led to new
      immunotherapeutics with proven efficacy against late-stage cancers. However, the 
      antitumor potential of the immune system in targeting early-stage cancers remains
      uncertain. Here, we demonstrated that both genetic and chemical induction of
      thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) at a distant site leads to robust antitumor
      immunity against spontaneous breast carcinogenesis in mice. Breast tumors exposed
      to high circulating levels of TSLP were arrested at an early adenoma-like stage
      and were prevented from advancing to late carcinoma and metastasis. Additionally,
      CD4+ Th2 cells mediated the antitumor effects of TSLP, challenging the notion
      that Th2 cells only promote cancer. We also discovered that TSLP is expressed by 
      the breast tumor cells themselves and acts to block breast cancer promotion.
      Moreover, TSLP-induced immunity also blocked early stages of pancreatic cancer
      development. Together, our findings demonstrate that TSLP potently induces
      immunity directed against early stages of breast cancer development without
      causing inflammation in the normal breast tissue. Moreover, our results highlight
      a previously unappreciated function of the immune system in controlling the early
      development of cancer and establish a fundamental role for TSLP and Th2 cells in 
      tumor immunity against early-stage cancers.

LID - 83083 [pii]
AB  - Endothelial cells transduce the frictional force from blood flow (fluid shear
      stress) into biochemical signals that regulate gene expression and cell behavior 
      via specialized mechanisms and pathways. These pathways shape the vascular system
      during development and during postnatal and adult life to optimize flow to
      tissues. The same pathways also contribute to atherosclerosis and vascular
      malformations. This Review covers recent advances in basic mechanisms of flow
      signaling and the involvement of these mechanisms in vascular physiology,
      remodeling, and these diseases. We propose that flow sensing pathways that govern
      normal morphogenesis can contribute to disease under pathological conditions or
      can be altered to induce disease. Viewing atherosclerosis and vascular
      malformations as instances of pathological morphogenesis provides a unifying
      perspective that may aid in developing new therapies.

PG  - 809-20

LID - 81113 [pii]
AB  - Mitochondria are a distinguishing feature of eukaryotic cells. Best known for
      their critical function in energy production via oxidative phosphorylation
      (OXPHOS), mitochondria are essential for nutrient and oxygen sensing and for the 
      regulation of critical cellular processes, including cell death and inflammation.
      Such diverse functional roles for organelles that were once thought to be simple 
      may be attributed to their distinct heteroplasmic genome, exclusive maternal
      lineage of inheritance, and ability to generate signals to communicate with other
      cellular organelles. Mitochondria are now thought of as one of the cell's most
      sophisticated and dynamic responsive sensing systems. Specific signatures of
      mitochondrial dysfunction that are associated with disease pathogenesis and/or
      progression are becoming increasingly important. In particular, the centrality of
      mitochondria in the pathological processes and clinical phenotypes associated
      with a range of lung diseases is emerging. Understanding the molecular mechanisms
      regulating the mitochondrial processes of lung cells will help to better define
      phenotypes and clinical manifestations associated with respiratory disease and to

TI  - Beyond antigens and adjuvants: formulating future vaccines.
PG  - 799-808
LID - 10.1172/JCI81083 [doi]
LID - 81083 [pii]
AB  - The need to optimize vaccine potency while minimizing toxicity in healthy
      recipients has motivated studies of the formulation of vaccines to control how,
      when, and where antigens and adjuvants encounter immune cells and other
      cells/tissues following administration. An effective subunit vaccine must traffic
      to lymph nodes (LNs), activate both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune
      system, and persist for a sufficient time to promote a mature immune response.
      Here, we review approaches to tailor these three aspects of vaccine function
      through optimized formulations. Traditional vaccine adjuvants activate innate
      immune cells, promote cell-mediated transport of antigen to lymphoid tissues, and
      promote antigen retention in LNs. Recent studies using nanoparticles and other
      lymphatic-targeting strategies suggest that direct targeting of antigens and
      adjuvant compounds to LNs can also enhance vaccine potency without sacrificing
      safety. The use of formulations to regulate biodistribution and promote antigen
      and inflammatory cue co-uptake in immune cells may be important for
      next-generation molecular adjuvants. Finally, strategies to program vaccine
      kinetics through novel formulation and delivery strategies provide another means 
      to enhance immune responses independent of the choice of adjuvant. These
      technologies offer the prospect of enhanced efficacy while maintaining high
      safety profiles necessary for successful vaccines.

TI  - Xenotropic retrovirus Bxv1 in human pancreatic beta cell lines.
PG  - 1109-13
LID - 10.1172/JCI83573 [doi]
LID - 83573 [pii]
AB  - It has been reported that endogenous retroviruses can contaminate human cell
      lines that have been passaged as xenotransplants in immunocompromised mice. We
      previously developed and described 2 human pancreatic beta cell lines
      (EndoC-betaH1 and EndoC-betaH2) that were generated in this way. Here, we have
      shown that B10 xenotropic virus 1 (Bxv1), a xenotropic endogenous murine leukemia
      virus (MuLV), is present in these 2 recently described cell lines. We determined 
      that Bxv1 was also present in SCID mice that were used for in vivo propagation of
      EndoC-betaH1/2 cells, suggesting that contamination occurred during
      xenotransplantation. EndoC-betaH1/2 cells released Bxv1 particles that propagated
      to human 293T and Mus dunni cells. Mobilization assays demonstrated that Bxv1
      transcomplements defective MuLV-based retrovectors. In contrast, common rodent
      beta cell lines, rat INS-1E and RIN-5F cells and mouse MIN6 and betaTC3 cells,
      displayed either no or extremely weak xenotropic helper activity toward
      MuLV-based retrovectors, although xenotropic retrovirus sequences and transcripts
      were detected in both mouse cell lines. Bxv1 propagation from EndoC-betaH1/2 to
      293T cells occurred only under optimized conditions and was overall poorly
      efficient. Thus, although our data imply that MuLV-based retrovectors should be
      cautiously used in EndoC-betaH1/2 cells, our results indicate that an involuntary
      propagation of Bxv1 from these cells can be easily avoided with good laboratory
      practices.

TI  - A role for genetic susceptibility in sporadic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
PG  - 1067-78
LID - 10.1172/JCI82592 [doi]
LID - 82592 [pii]
AB  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a syndrome that involves kidney
      podocyte dysfunction and causes chronic kidney disease. Multiple factors
      including chemical toxicity, inflammation, and infection underlie FSGS; however, 
      highly penetrant disease genes have been identified in a small fraction of
      patients with a family history of FSGS. Variants of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1)
      have been linked to FSGS in African Americans with HIV or hypertension,
      supporting the proposal that genetic factors enhance FSGS susceptibility. Here,
      we used sequencing to investigate whether genetics plays a role in the majority
      of FSGS cases that are identified as primary or sporadic FSGS and have no known
      cause. Given the limited number of biopsy-proven cases with ethnically matched
      controls, we devised an analytic strategy to identify and rank potential
      candidate genes and used an animal model for validation. Nine candidate FSGS
      susceptibility genes were identified in our patient cohort, and three were
      validated using a high-throughput mouse method that we developed. Specifically,
      we introduced a podocyte-specific, doxycycline-inducible transactivator into a
      murine embryonic stem cell line with an FSGS-susceptible genetic background that 
      allows shRNA-mediated targeting of candidate genes in the adult kidney. Our
      analysis supports a broader role for genetic susceptibility of both sporadic and 
      familial cases of FSGS and provides a tool to rapidly evaluate candidate
      FSGS-associated genes.

LID - 86650 [pii]
AB  - The central role of the transcriptional template of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), 
      covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), has been difficult to study in patients 
      with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. In this issue of the JCI, Zhang and
      colleagues reveal a mosaic distribution of viral antigens and nucleic acids and a
      mismatch between HBV cccDNA, RNA, and expression of the hepatitis B surface
      antigen (HBsAg). These unusual patterns varied over the natural history of CHB,
      prompting the authors to propose a new three-stage model of the HBV life cycle at
      the single-cell level.

TI  - Neonatal thymectomy reveals differentiation and plasticity within human naive T
      cells.
PG  - 1126-36
LID - 10.1172/JCI84997 [doi]
LID - 84997 [pii]
AB  - The generation of naive T cells is dependent on thymic output, but in adults, the
      naive T cell pool is primarily maintained by peripheral proliferation. Naive T
      cells have long been regarded as relatively quiescent cells; however, it was
      recently shown that IL-8 production is a signatory effector function of naive T
      cells, at least in newborns. How this functional signature relates to naive T
      cell dynamics and aging is unknown. Using a cohort of children and adolescents
      who underwent neonatal thymectomy, we demonstrate that the naive CD4+ T cell
      compartment in healthy humans is functionally heterogeneous and that this
      functional diversity is lost after neonatal thymectomy. Thymic tissue
      regeneration later in life resulted in functional restoration of the naive T cell
      compartment, implicating the thymus as having functional regenerative capacity.
      Together, these data shed further light on functional differentiation within the 
      naive T cell compartment and the importance of the thymus in human naive T cell
      homeostasis and premature aging. In addition, these results affect and alter our 
      current understanding on the identification of truly naive T cells and recent
      thymic emigrants.

AB  - In extrapulmonary tuberculosis, the most common site of infection is within the
      lymphatic system, and there is growing recognition that lymphatic endothelial
      cells (LECs) are involved in immune function. Here, we identified LECs, which
      line the lymphatic vessels, as a niche for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the
      lymph nodes of patients with tuberculosis. In cultured primary human LECs
      (hLECs), we determined that M. tuberculosis replicates both in the cytosol and
      within autophagosomes, but the bacteria failed to replicate when the virulence
      locus RD1 was deleted. Activation by IFN-gamma induced a cell-autonomous response
      in hLECs via autophagy and NO production that restricted M. tuberculosis growth. 
      Thus, depending on the activation status of LECs, autophagy can both promote and 
      restrict replication. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized
      role for hLECs and autophagy in tuberculosis pathogenesis and suggest that hLECs 
      are a potential niche for M. tuberculosis that allows establishment of persistent
      infection in lymph nodes.

TI  - Gonadal steroid-dependent effects on bone turnover and bone mineral density in
      men.
PG  - 1114-25
LID - 10.1172/JCI84137 [doi]
LID - 84137 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe gonadal steroid deficiency induces bone loss in adult men;
      however, the specific roles of androgen and estrogen deficiency in hypogonadal
      bone loss are unclear. Additionally, the threshold levels of testosterone and
      estradiol that initiate bone loss are uncertain. METHODS: One hundred
      ninety-eight healthy men, ages 20-50, received goserelin acetate, which
      suppresses endogenous gonadal steroid production, and were randomized to
      treatment with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 grams of testosterone gel daily for 16
      weeks. An additional cohort of 202 men was randomized to receive these treatments
      plus anastrozole, which suppresses conversion of androgens to estrogens.
      Thirty-seven men served as controls and received placebos for goserelin and
      testosterone. Changes in bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD) by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and BMD by quantitative computed
      tomography (QCT) were assessed in all men. Bone microarchitecture was assessed in
      100 men. RESULTS: As testosterone dosage decreased, the percent change in
      C-telopeptide increased. These increases were considerably greater when
      aromatization of testosterone to estradiol was also suppressed, suggesting
      effects of both testosterone and estradiol deficiency. Decreases in DXA BMD were 
      observed when aromatization was suppressed but were modest in most groups. QCT
      spine BMD fell substantially in all testosterone-dose groups in which
      aromatization was also suppressed, and this decline was independent of
      testosterone dose. Estradiol deficiency disrupted cortical microarchitecture at
      peripheral sites. Estradiol levels above 10 pg/ml and testosterone levels above
      200 ng/dl were generally sufficient to prevent increases in bone resorption and
      decreases in BMD in men. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogens primarily regulate bone
      homeostasis in adult men, and testosterone and estradiol levels must decline
      substantially to impact the skeleton. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,

AB  - Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is established by the formation of
      an intranuclear pool of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the liver.
      Very little is known about the intrahepatic distribution of HBV cccDNA in
      infected patients, particularly at the single-cell level. Here, we established a 
      highly sensitive and specific ISH assay for the detection of HBV RNA, DNA, and
      cccDNA. The specificity of our cccDNA probe set was confirmed by its strict
      intranuclear signal and by a series of Southern blot analyses. Use of our in situ
      assay in conjunction with IHC or immunofluorescence uncovered a surprisingly
      mosaic distribution of viral antigens and nucleic acids. Most strikingly, a
      mutually exclusive pattern was found between HBV surface antigen-positive
      (HBsA-positive) and HBV DNA- and cccDNA-positive cells. A longitudinal
      observation of patients over a 1-year period of adeforvir therapy confirmed the
      persistence of a nuclear reservoir of viral DNA, although cytoplasmic DNA was
      effectively depleted in these individuals. In conclusion, our method for
      detecting viral nucleic acids, including cccDNA, with single-cell resolution
      provides a means for monitoring intrahepatic virological events in chronic HBV
      infection. More important, our observations unravel the complexity of the HBV
      life cycle in vivo.

AB  - Male osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease, although it is often in part
      related to hypogonadism. While testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to
      improve bone mineral density, studies have also linked bone loss and higher
      fracture risk in men to low estrogen levels. In this issue of the JCI,
      Finkelstein and colleagues report the results of a clinical study in a cohort of 
      healthy adult men aimed at further discerning the specific roles of androgen and 
      estrogen deficiency in bone loss. The results of their study support previous
      findings that estrogen deficiency has a dramatic effect on bone homeostasis in
      men. Future studies to corroborate and expand on these findings have potential to
      influence the clinical management of male osteoporosis.

TI  - MLL-AF9- and HOXA9-mediated acute myeloid leukemia stem cell self-renewal
      requires JMJD1C.
PG  - 997-1011
LID - 10.1172/JCI82978 [doi]
LID - 82978 [pii]
AB  - Self-renewal is a hallmark of both hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia
      stem cells (LSCs); therefore, the identification of mechanisms that are required 
      for LSC, but not HSC, function could provide therapeutic opportunities that are
      more effective and less toxic than current treatments. Here, we employed an in
      vivo shRNA screen and identified jumonji domain-containing protein JMJD1C as an
      important driver of MLL-AF9 leukemia. Using a conditional mouse model, we showed 
      that loss of JMJD1C substantially decreased LSC frequency and caused
      differentiation of MLL-AF9- and homeobox A9-driven (HOXA9-driven) leukemias. We
      determined that JMJD1C directly interacts with HOXA9 and modulates a
      HOXA9-controlled gene-expression program. In contrast, loss of JMJD1C led to only
      minor defects in blood homeostasis and modest effects on HSC self-renewal.
      Together, these data establish JMJD1C as an important mediator of MLL-AF9- and
      HOXA9-driven LSC function that is largely dispensable for HSC function.

LID - 79196 [pii]
AB  - Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from transformation of a long-term
      hematopoietic stem cell (LTHSC) by expression of the BCR-ABL fusion gene.
      However, BCR-ABL-expressing LTHSCs are heterogeneous in their capacity as
      leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Although discrepancies in proliferative,
      self-renewal, and differentiation properties of normal LTHSCs are being
      increasingly recognized, the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity of leukemic
      LTHSCs are poorly understood. Using a CML mouse model, we identified gene
      expression differences between leukemic and nonleukemic LTHSCs. Expression of the
      thrombopoietin (THPO) receptor MPL was elevated in leukemic LTHSC populations.
      Compared with LTHSCs with low MPL expression, LTHSCs with high MPL expression
      showed enhanced JAK/STAT signaling and proliferation in response to THPO in vitro
      and increased leukemogenic capacity in vivo. Although both G0 and S phase
      subpopulations were increased in LTHSCs with high MPL expression, LSC capacity
      was restricted to quiescent cells. Inhibition of MPL expression in CML LTHSCs
      reduced THPO-induced JAK/STAT signaling and leukemogenic potential. These same
      phenotypes were also present in LTHSCs from patients with CML, and patient LTHSCs
      with high MPL expression had reduced sensitivity to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor treatment but increased sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Together, our
      studies identify MPL expression levels as a key determinant of heterogeneous
      leukemia-initiating capacity and drug sensitivity of CML LTHSCs and suggest that 
      high MPL-expressing CML stem cells are potential targets for therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid
      cancer (ATC) are rare and frequently lethal tumors that so far have not been
      subjected to comprehensive genetic characterization. METHODS: We performed
      next-generation sequencing of 341 cancer genes from 117 patient-derived PDTCs and
      ATCs and analyzed the transcriptome of a representative subset of 37 tumors.
      Results were analyzed in the context of The Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA
      study) of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). RESULTS: Compared to PDTCs, ATCs had a
      greater mutation burden, including a higher frequency of mutations in TP53, TERT 
      promoter, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway effectors, SWI/SNF subunits, and histone
      methyltransferases. BRAF and RAS were the predominant drivers and dictated
      distinct tropism for nodal versus distant metastases in PDTC. RAS and BRAF
      sharply distinguished between PDTCs defined by the Turin (PDTC-Turin) versus
      MSKCC (PDTC-MSK) criteria, respectively. Mutations of EIF1AX, a component of the 
      translational preinitiation complex, were markedly enriched in PDTCs and ATCs and
      had a striking pattern of co-occurrence with RAS mutations. While TERT promoter
      mutations were rare and subclonal in PTCs, they were clonal and highly prevalent 
      in advanced cancers. Application of the TCGA-derived BRAF-RAS score (a measure of
      MAPK transcriptional output) revealed a preserved relationship with BRAF/RAS
      mutation in PDTCs, whereas ATCs were BRAF-like irrespective of driver mutation.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data support a model of tumorigenesis whereby PDTCs and ATCs
      arise from well-differentiated tumors through the accumulation of key additional 
      genetic abnormalities, many of which have prognostic and possible therapeutic
      relevance. The widespread genomic disruptions in ATC compared with PDTC
      underscore their greater virulence and higher mortality. FUNDING: This work was

TI  - Blocking mitochondrial calcium release in Schwann cells prevents demyelinating
      neuropathies.
PG  - 1023-38
LID - 10.1172/JCI84505 [doi]
LID - 84505 [pii]
AB  - Schwann cells produce myelin sheath around peripheral nerve axons. Myelination is
      critical for rapid propagation of action potentials, as illustrated by the large 
      number of acquired and hereditary peripheral neuropathies, such as diabetic
      neuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases, that are commonly associated with a
      process of demyelination. However, the early molecular events that trigger the
      demyelination program in these diseases remain unknown. Here, we used virally
      delivered fluorescent probes and in vivo time-lapse imaging in a mouse model of
      demyelination to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the demyelination
      process. We demonstrated that mitochondrial calcium released by voltage-dependent
      anion channel 1 (VDAC1) after sciatic nerve injury triggers Schwann cell
      demyelination via ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and c-JUN activation. In diabetic mice, VDAC1
      activity was altered, resulting in a mitochondrial calcium leak in Schwann cell
      cytoplasm, thereby priming the cell for demyelination. Moreover, reduction of
      mitochondrial calcium release, either by shRNA-mediated VDAC1 silencing or
      pharmacological inhibition, prevented demyelination, leading to nerve conduction 
      and neuromuscular performance recovery in rodent models of diabetic neuropathy
      and Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. Therefore, this study identifies mitochondria
      as the early key factor in the molecular mechanism of peripheral demyelination
      and opens a potential opportunity for the treatment of demyelinating peripheral
      neuropathies.

TI  - FGF23 signaling impairs neutrophil recruitment and host defense during CKD.
PG  - 962-74
LID - 10.1172/JCI83470 [doi]
LID - 83470 [pii]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been associated with impaired host response and 
      increased susceptibility to infections. Leukocyte recruitment during inflammation
      must be tightly regulated to protect the host against pathogens. FGF23 levels are
      increased in blood during CKD, and levels of this hormone have been associated
      with a variety of adverse effects in CKD patients. Here, we have shown that CKD
      impairs leukocyte recruitment into inflamed tissue and host defense in mice and
      humans. FGF23 neutralization during CKD in murine models restored leukocyte
      recruitment and host defense. Intravital microscopy of animals with chronic
      kidney failure showed that FGF23 inhibits chemokine-activated leukocyte arrest on
      the endothelium, and downregulation of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) on PMNs rescued
      host defense in these mice. In vitro, FGF23 inhibited PMN adhesion, arrest under 
      flow, and transendothelial migration. Mechanistically, FGF23 binding to FGFR2
      counteracted selectin- and chemokine-triggered beta2 integrin activation on PMNs 
      by activating protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibiting activation of the small
      GTPase Rap1. Moreover, knockdown of PKA abolished the inhibitory effect of FGF23 
      on integrin activation. Together, our data reveal that FGF23 acts directly on
      PMNs and dampens host defense by direct interference with chemokine signaling and
      integrin activation.

TI  - Measles virus nucleocapsid protein increases osteoblast differentiation in
      Paget's disease.
PG  - 1012-22
LID - 10.1172/JCI82012 [doi]
LID - 82012 [pii]
AB  - Paget's disease (PD) is characterized by focal and dramatic bone resorption and
      formation. Treatments that target osteoclasts (OCLs) block both pagetic bone
      resorption and formation; therefore, PD offers key insights into mechanisms that 
      couple bone resorption and formation. Here, we evaluated OCLs from 3 patients
      with PD and determined that measles virus nucleocapsid protein (MVNP) was
      expressed in 70% of these OCLs. Moreover, transgenic mice with OCL-specific
      expression of MVNP (MVNP mice) developed PD-like bone lesions that required
      MVNP-dependent induction of high IL-6 expression levels in OCLs. In contrast,
      mice harboring a knockin of p62P394L (p62-KI mice), which is the most frequent
      PD-associated mutation, exhibited increased bone resorption, but not formation.
      Evaluation of OCLs from MVNP, p62-KI, and WT mice revealed increased IGF1
      expression in MVNP-expressing OCLs that resulted from the high IL-6 expression
      levels in these cells. IL-6, in turn, increased the expression of coupling
      factors, specifically ephrinB2 on OCLs and EphB4 on osteoblasts (OBs). IGF1
      enhanced ephrinB2 expression on OCLs and OB differentiation. Importantly,
      ephrinB2 and IGF1 levels were increased in MVNP-expressing OCLs from patients
      with PD and MVNP-transduced human OCLs compared with levels detected in controls.
      Further, anti-IGF1 or anti-IGF1R blocked Runx2 and osteocalcin upregulation in
      OBs cocultured with MVNP-expressing OCLs. These results suggest that in PD, MVNP 
      upregulates IL-6 and IGF1 in OCLs to increase ephrinB2-EphB4 coupling and bone
      formation.

AB  - Melanoma prognosis is dictated by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the migratory
      and functional behavior of which is guided by chemokine or cytokine gradients.
      Here, we retrospectively analyzed the expression patterns of 9 homing receptors
      (CCR/CXCR) in naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 57 patients with
      metastatic melanoma (MMel) with various sites of metastases to evaluate whether T
      cell CCR/CXCR expression correlates with intratumoral accumulation, metastatic
      progression, and/or overall survival (OS). Homing receptor expression on
      lymphocytes strongly correlated with MMel dissemination. Loss of CCR6 or CXCR3,
      but not cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), on circulating T cell subsets was
      associated with skin or lymph node metastases, loss of CXCR4, CXCR5, and CCR9
      corresponded with lung involvement, and a rise in CCR10 or CD103 was associated
      with widespread dissemination. High frequencies of CD8+CCR9+ naive T cells
      correlated with prolonged OS, while neutralizing the CCR9/CCL25 axis in mice
      stimulated tumor progression. The expansion of CLA-expressing effector memory
      CD8+ T cells in response to a single administration of CTLA4 blockade predicted
      disease control at 3 months in 47 patients with MMel. Thus, specific CCR/CXCR
      expression patterns on circulating T lymphocytes may guide potential diagnostic
      and therapeutic approaches.

AB  - T regulatory cells (Tregs) control immune homeostasis by preventing inappropriate
      responses to self and nonharmful foreign antigens. Tregs use multiple mechanisms 
      to control immune responses, all of which require these cells to be near their
      targets of suppression; however, it is not known how Treg-to-target proximity is 
      controlled. Here, we found that Tregs attract CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by producing 
      chemokines. Specifically, Tregs produced both CCL3 and CCL4 in response to
      stimulation, and production of these chemokines was critical for migration of
      target T cells, as Tregs from Ccl3-/- mice, which are also deficient for CCL4
      production, did not promote migration. Moreover, CCR5 expression by target T
      cells was required for migration of these cells to supernatants conditioned by
      Tregs. Tregs deficient for expression of CCL3 and CCL4 were impaired in their
      ability to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or islet allograft 
      rejection in murine models. Moreover, Tregs from subjects with established type 1
      diabetes were impaired in their ability to produce CCL3 and CCL4. Together, these
      results demonstrate a previously unappreciated facet of Treg function and suggest
      that chemokine secretion by Tregs is a fundamental aspect of their therapeutic
      effect in autoimmunity and transplantation.

TI  - Temporal integration of light flashes by the human circadian system.
PG  - 938-47
LID - 10.1172/JCI82306 [doi]
LID - 82306 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beyond image formation, the light that is detected by retinal
      photoreceptors influences subcortical functions, including circadian timing,
      sleep, and arousal. The physiology of nonimage-forming (NIF) photoresponses in
      humans is not well understood; therefore, the development of therapeutic
      interventions based on this physiology, such as bright light therapy to treat
      chronobiological disorders, remains challenging. METHODS: Thirty-nine
      participants were exposed to 60 minutes of either continuous light (n = 8) or
      sequences of 2-millisecond light flashes (n = 31) with different interstimulus
      intervals (ISIs; ranging from 2.5 to 240 seconds). Melatonin phase shift and
      suppression, along with changes in alertness and sleepiness, were assessed.
      RESULTS: We determined that the human circadian system integrates flash sequences
      in a nonlinear fashion with a linear rise to a peak response (ISI = 7.6 +/- 0.53 
      seconds) and a power function decrease following the peak of responsivity. At
      peak ISI, flashes were at least 2-fold more effective in phase delaying the
      circadian system as compared with exposure to equiluminous continuous light 3,800
      times the duration. Flashes did not change melatonin concentrations or alertness 
      in an ISI-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that intermittent
      light is more effective than continuous light at eliciting circadian changes.
      These findings cast light on the phenomenology of photic integration and suggest 
      a dichotomous retinohypothalamic network leading to circadian phase shifting and 
      other NIF photoresponses. Further clinical trials are required to judge the
      practicality of light flash protocols. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov

TI  - FOXE3 mutations predispose to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.
PG  - 948-61
LID - 10.1172/JCI83778 [doi]
LID - 83778 [pii]
AB  - The ascending thoracic aorta is designed to withstand biomechanical forces from
      pulsatile blood. Thoracic aortic aneurysms and acute aortic dissections (TAADs)
      occur as a result of genetically triggered defects in aortic structure and a
      dysfunctional response to these forces. Here, we describe mutations in the
      forkhead transcription factor FOXE3 that predispose mutation-bearing individuals 
      to TAAD. We performed exome sequencing of a large family with multiple members
      with TAADs and identified a rare variant in FOXE3 with an altered amino acid in
      the DNA-binding domain (p.Asp153His) that segregated with disease in this family.
      Additional pathogenic FOXE3 variants were identified in unrelated TAAD families. 
      In mice, Foxe3 deficiency reduced smooth muscle cell (SMC) density and impaired
      SMC differentiation in the ascending aorta. Foxe3 expression was induced in
      aortic SMCs after transverse aortic constriction, and Foxe3 deficiency increased 
      SMC apoptosis and ascending aortic rupture with increased aortic pressure. These 
      phenotypes were rescued by inhibiting p53 activity, either by administration of a
      p53 inhibitor (pifithrin-alpha), or by crossing Foxe3-/- mice with p53-/- mice.
      Our data demonstrate that FOXE3 mutations lead to a reduced number of aortic SMCs
      during development and increased SMC apoptosis in the ascending aorta in response
      to increased biomechanical forces, thus defining an additional molecular pathway 
      that leads to familial thoracic aortic disease.

PG  - 992-6
LID - 10.1172/JCI84747 [doi]
LID - 84747 [pii]
AB  - Selenium is a trace element that is essential for human health and is
      incorporated into more than 25 human selenocysteine-containing (Sec-containing)
      proteins via unique Sec-insertion machinery that includes a specific, nuclear
      genome-encoded, transfer RNA (tRNA[Ser]Sec). Here, we have identified a human
      tRNA[Ser]Sec mutation in a proband who presented with a variety of symptoms,
      including abdominal pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, and low plasma levels of
      selenium. This mutation resulted in a marked reduction in expression of
      stress-related, but not housekeeping, selenoproteins. Evaluation of primary cells
      from the homozygous proband and a heterozygous parent indicated that the observed
      deficit in stress-related selenoprotein production is likely mediated by reduced 
      expression and diminished 2'-O-methylribosylation at uridine 34 in mutant
      tRNA[Ser]Sec. Moreover, this methylribosylation defect was restored by cellular
      complementation with normal tRNA[Ser]Sec. This study identifies a tRNA mutation
      that selectively impairs synthesis of stress-related selenoproteins and
      demonstrates the importance of tRNA modification for normal selenoprotein
      synthesis.

      therapy (ART). However, the cellular and virological events that occur in the
      female reproductive tract (FRT) during ART that result in such a drastic decrease
      in transmission were not studied and remain unknown. Here, we implemented an in
      vivo model of ART in BM/liver/thymus (BLT) humanized mice in order to better
      understand the ability of ART to prevent secondary HIV transmission. We
      demonstrated that the entire FRT of BLT mice is reconstituted with human CD4+
      cells that are shed into cervicovaginal secretions (CVS). A high percentage of
      the CD4+ T cells in the FRT and CVS expressed CCR5 and therefore are potential
      HIV target cells. Infection with HIV increased the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T
      cells in CVS of BLT mice. Furthermore, HIV was present in CVS during infection.
      Finally, we evaluated the effect of ART on HIV levels in the FRT and CVS and
      demonstrated that ART can efficiently suppress cell-free HIV-RNA in CVS, despite 
      residual levels of HIV-RNA+ cells in both the FRT and CVS.

AB  - The development of the hematopoietic system is a dynamic process that is
      controlled by the interplay between transcriptional and epigenetic networks to
      determine cellular identity. These networks are critical for lineage
      specification and are frequently dysregulated in leukemias. Here, we identified
      histone demethylase KDM2B as a critical regulator of definitive hematopoiesis and
      lineage commitment of murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). RNA
      sequencing of Kdm2b-null HSPCs and genome-wide ChIP studies in human leukemias
      revealed that KDM2B cooperates with polycomb and trithorax complexes to regulate 
      differentiation, lineage choice, cytokine signaling, and cell cycle. Furthermore,
      we demonstrated that KDM2B exhibits a dichotomous role in hematopoietic
      malignancies. Specifically, we determined that KDM2B maintains lymphoid
      leukemias, but restrains RAS-driven myeloid transformation. Our study reveals
      that KDM2B is an important mediator of hematopoietic cell development and has
      opposing roles in tumor progression that are dependent on cellular context.

LID - 83894 [pii]
AB  - The transcription factor GATA3 is essential for the genesis and maturation of the
      T cell lineage, and GATA3 dysregulation has pathological consequences. Previous
      studies have shown that GATA3 function in T cell development is regulated by
      multiple signaling pathways and that the Notch nuclear effector, RBP-J, binds
      specifically to the Gata3 promoter. We previously identified a T cell-specific
      Gata3 enhancer (Tce1) lying 280 kb downstream from the structural gene and
      demonstrated in transgenic mice that Tce1 promoted T lymphocyte-specific
      transcription of reporter genes throughout T cell development; however, it was
      not clear if Tce1 is required for Gata3 transcription in vivo. Here, we
      determined that the canonical Gata3 promoter is insufficient for Gata3
      transcriptional activation in T cells in vivo, precluding the possibility that
      promoter binding by a host of previously implicated transcription factors alone
      is responsible for Gata3 expression in T cells. Instead, we demonstrated that
      multiple lineage-affiliated transcription factors bind to Tce1 and that this
      enhancer confers T lymphocyte-specific Gata3 activation in vivo, as targeted
      deletion of Tce1 in a mouse model abrogated critical functions of this T
      cell-regulatory element. Together, our data show that Tce1 is both necessary and 
      sufficient for critical aspects of Gata3 T cell-specific transcriptional
      activity.

LID - 83922 [pii]
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) disrupts respiratory host defenses, allowing bacterial
      infection, inflammation, and mucus accumulation to progressively destroy the
      lungs. Our previous studies revealed that mucus with abnormal behavior impaired
      mucociliary transport in newborn CF piglets prior to the onset of secondary
      manifestations. To further investigate mucus abnormalities, here we studied
      airway surface liquid (ASL) collected from newborn piglets and ASL on cultured
      airway epithelia. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed that the
      viscosity of CF ASL was increased relative to that of non-CF ASL. CF ASL had a
      reduced pH, which was necessary and sufficient for genotype-dependent viscosity
      differences. The increased viscosity of CF ASL was not explained by
      pH-independent changes in HCO3- concentration, altered glycosylation, additional 
      pH-induced disulfide bond formation, increased percentage of nonvolatile
      material, or increased sulfation. Treating acidic ASL with hypertonic saline or
      heparin largely reversed the increased viscosity, suggesting that acidic pH
      influences mucin electrostatic interactions. These findings link loss of cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-dependent alkalinization to abnormal
      CF ASL. In addition, we found that increasing Ca2+ concentrations elevated ASL
      viscosity, in part, independently of pH. The results suggest that increasing pH, 
      reducing Ca2+ concentration, and/or altering electrostatic interactions in ASL
      might benefit early CF.

TI  - Targeting human melanoma neoantigens by T cell receptor gene therapy.
PG  - 854-8
LID - 10.1172/JCI83465 [doi]
LID - 83465 [pii]
AB  - In successful cancer immunotherapy, T cell responses appear to be directed toward
      neoantigens created by somatic mutations; however, direct evidence that
      neoantigen-specific T cells cause regression of established cancer is lacking.
      Here, we generated T cells expressing a mutation-specific transgenic T cell
      receptor (TCR) to target different immunogenic mutations in cyclin-dependent
      kinase 4 (CDK4) that naturally occur in human melanoma. Two mutant CDK4 isoforms 
      (R24C, R24L) similarly stimulated T cell responses in vitro and were analyzed as 
      therapeutic targets for TCR gene therapy. In a syngeneic HLA-A2-transgenic mouse 
      model of large established tumors, we found that both mutations differed
      dramatically as targets for TCR-modified T cells in vivo. While T cells expanded 
      efficiently and produced IFN-gamma in response to R24L, R24C failed to induce an 
      effective antitumor response. Such differences in neoantigen quality might
      explain why cancer immunotherapy induces tumor regression in some individuals,
      while others do not respond, despite similar mutational load. We confirmed the
      validity of the in vivo model by showing that the melan-A-specific
      (MART-1-specific) TCR DMF5 induces rejection of tumors expressing analog, but not
      native, MART-1 epitopes. The described model allows identification of those
      neoantigens in human cancer that serve as suitable T cell targets and may help to
      predict clinical efficacy.

LID - 82788 [pii]
AB  - Abnormal fibroblast function underlies poor wound healing in patients with
      diabetes; however, the mechanisms that impair wound healing are poorly defined.
      Here, we evaluated fibroblasts from individuals who had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for
      50 years or more (Medalists, n = 26) and from age-matched controls (n = 7).
      Compared with those from controls, Medalist fibroblasts demonstrated a reduced
      migration response to insulin, lower VEGF expression, and less phosphorylated AKT
      (p-AKT), but not p-ERK, activation. Medalist fibroblasts were also functionally
      less effective at wound closure in nude mice. Activation of the delta isoform of 
      protein kinase C (PKCdelta) was increased in postmortem fibroblasts from
      Medalists, fibroblasts from living T1D subjects, biopsies of active wounds of
      living T1D subjects, and granulation tissues from mice with
      streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Diabetes-induced PKCD mRNA expression was
      related to a 2-fold increase in the mRNA half-life. Pharmacologic inhibition and 
      siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCdelta or expression of a dominant-negative isoform
      restored insulin signaling of p-AKT and VEGF expression in vitro and improved
      wound healing in vivo. Additionally, increasing PKCdelta expression in control
      fibroblasts produced the same abnormalities as those seen in Medalist
      fibroblasts. Our results indicate that persistent PKCdelta elevation in
      fibroblasts from diabetic patients inhibits insulin signaling and function to
      impair wound healing and suggest PKCdelta inhibition as a potential therapy to
      improve wound healing in diabetic patients.

AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common liver disease in
      industrialized countries. NASH is a progressive disease that can lead to
      cirrhosis, cancer, and death, and there are currently no approved therapies. The 
      development of NASH in animal models requires intact TLR9, but how the TLR9
      pathway is activated in NASH is not clear. Our objectives in this study were to
      identify NASH-associated ligands for TLR9, establish the cellular requirement for
      TLR9, and evaluate the role of obesity-induced changes in TLR9 pathway
      activation. We demonstrated that plasma from mice and patients with NASH contains
      high levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and intact mitochondria and has the
      ability to activate TLR9. Most of the plasma mtDNA was contained in
      microparticles (MPs) of hepatocyte origin, and removal of these MPs from plasma
      resulted in a substantial decrease in TLR9 activation capacity. In mice, NASH
      development in response to a high-fat diet required TLR9 on lysozyme-expressing
      cells, and a clinically applicable TLR9 antagonist blocked the development of
      NASH when given prophylactically and therapeutically. These data demonstrate that
      activation of the TLR9 pathway provides a link between the key metabolic and
      inflammatory phenotypes in NASH.

AB  - Current efforts toward achieving a cure for HIV are focused on developing
      strategies to eliminate latently infected CD4+ T cells, which represent the major
      barrier to virus eradication. Sensitive, precise, and practical assays that can
      reliably characterize and measure this HIV reservoir and can reliably measure the
      impact of a candidate treatment strategy are essential. PCR-based procedures for 
      detecting integrated HIV DNA will overestimate the size of the reservoir by
      detecting replication-incompetent proviruses; however, viral outgrowth assays
      underestimate the size of the reservoir. Here, we describe the attributes and
      limitations of current procedures for measuring the HIV reservoir. Characterizing
      their relative merits will require rigorous evaluation of their performance
      characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, etc.) and their
      relationship to the results of clinical studies.

LID - 80564 [pii]
AB  - A substantial research effort has been directed to identifying strategies to
      eradicate or control HIV infection without a requirement for combination
      antiretroviral therapy (cART). A number of obstacles prevent HIV eradication,
      including low-level viral persistence during cART, long-term persistence of
      HIV-infected cells, and latent infection of resting CD4+ T cells. Mechanisms of
      persistence remain uncertain, but integration of the provirus into the host
      genome represents a central event in replication and pathogenesis of all
      retroviruses, including HIV. Analysis of HIV proviruses in CD4+ lymphocytes from 
      individuals after prolonged cART revealed that a substantial proportion of the
      infected cells that persist have undergone clonal expansion and frequently have
      proviruses integrated in genes associated with regulation of cell growth. These
      data suggest that integration may influence persistence and clonal expansion of
      HIV-infected cells after cART is introduced, and these processes may represent
      key mechanisms for HIV persistence. Determining the diversity of host genes with 
      integrants in HIV-infected cells that persist for prolonged periods may yield
      useful information regarding pathways by which infected cells persist for
      prolonged periods. Moreover, many integrants are defective, and new studies are
      required to characterize the role of clonal expansion in the persistence of
      replication-competent HIV.

AB  - HIV persistence in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy is a major
      impediment to the cure of HIV/AIDS. The molecular and cellular mechanisms
      underlying HIV persistence in vivo have not been fully elucidated. This lack of
      basic knowledge has hindered progress in this area. The in vivo analysis of HIV
      persistence and the implementation of curative strategies would benefit from
      animal models that accurately recapitulate key aspects of the human condition.
      This Review summarizes the contribution that humanized mouse models of HIV
      infection have made to the field of HIV cure research. Even though these models
      have been shown to be highly informative in many specific areas, their great
      potential to serve as excellent platforms for discovery in HIV pathogenesis and
      treatment has yet to be fully developed.

AB  - Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress plasma HIV to undetectable 
      levels, allowing HIV-infected individuals who are treated early a nearly normal
      life span. Despite the clear ability of ART to prevent morbidity and mortality,
      it is not curative. Even in individuals who have full suppression of viral
      replication on ART, there are resting memory CD4+ T cells that harbor stably
      integrated HIV genomes, which are capable of producing infectious virus upon T
      cell activation. This latent viral reservoir is considered the primary obstacle
      to the development of an HIV cure, and recent efforts in multiple areas of HIV
      research have been brought to bear on the development of strategies to eradicate 
      or develop a functional cure for HIV. Reviews in this series detail progress in
      our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of viral latency,
      efforts to accurately assess the size and composition of the latent reservoir,
      the characterization and development of HIV-targeted broadly neutralizing
      antibodies and cytolytic T lymphocytes, and animal models for the study HIV
      latency and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Training the next generation of biomedical investigators in glycosciences.
PG  - 405-8
LID - 10.1172/JCI85905 [doi]
LID - 85905 [pii]
AB  - This position statement originated from a working group meeting convened on April
      15, 2015, by the NHLBI and incorporates follow-up contributions by the
      participants as well as other thought leaders subsequently consulted, who
      together represent research fields relevant to all branches of the NIH. The group
      was deliberately composed not only of individuals with a current research
      emphasis in the glycosciences, but also of many experts from other fields, who
      evinced a strong interest in being involved in the discussions. The original goal
      was to discuss the value of creating centers of excellence for training the next 
      generation of biomedical investigators in the glycosciences. A broader theme that
      emerged was the urgent need to bring the glycosciences back into the mainstream
      of biology by integrating relevant education into the curricula of medical,
      graduate, and postgraduate training programs, thus generating a critical
      sustainable workforce that can advance the much-needed translation of
      glycosciences into a more complete understanding of biology and the enhanced
      practice of medicine.

TI  - TGF-beta/beta2-spectrin/CTCF-regulated tumor suppression in human stem cell
      disorder Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
PG  - 527-42
LID - 10.1172/JCI80937 [doi]
LID - 80937 [pii]
AB  - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a human stem cell disorder, and individuals 
      with this disease have a substantially increased risk (~800-fold) of developing
      tumors. Epigenetic silencing of beta2-spectrin (beta2SP, encoded by SPTBN1), a
      SMAD adaptor for TGF-beta signaling, is causally associated with BWS; however, a 
      role of TGF-beta deficiency in BWS-associated neoplastic transformation is
      unexplored. Here, we have reported that double-heterozygous Sptbn1+/- Smad3+/-
      mice, which have defective TGF-beta signaling, develop multiple tumors that are
      phenotypically similar to those of BWS patients. Moreover,
      tumorigenesis-associated genes IGF2 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
      were overexpressed in fibroblasts from BWS patients and TGF-beta-defective mice. 
      We further determined that chromatin insulator CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is
      TGF-beta inducible and facilitates TGF-beta-mediated repression of TERT
      transcription via interactions with beta2SP and SMAD3. This regulation was
      abrogated in TGF-beta-defective mice and BWS, resulting in TERT overexpression.
      Imprinting of the IGF2/H19 locus and the CDKN1C/KCNQ1 locus on chromosome 11p15.5
      is mediated by CTCF, and this regulation is lost in BWS, leading to aberrant
      overexpression of growth-promoting genes. Therefore, we propose that loss of
      CTCF-dependent imprinting of tumor-promoting genes, such as IGF2 and TERT,
      results from a defective TGF-beta pathway and is responsible at least in part for
      BWS-associated tumorigenesis as well as sporadic human cancers that are
      frequently associated with SPTBN1 and SMAD3 mutations.

TI  - PKLR promotes colorectal cancer liver colonization through induction of
      glutathione synthesis.
PG  - 681-94
LID - 10.1172/JCI83587 [doi]
LID - 83587 [pii]
AB  - Colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver is a major cause of cancer-related
      death; however, the genes and pathways that govern this metastatic colonization
      event remain poorly characterized. Here, using a large-scale in vivo RNAi screen,
      we identified liver and red blood cell pyruvate kinase (PKLR) as a driver of
      metastatic liver colonization. PKLR expression was increased in liver metastases 
      as well as in primary colorectal tumors of patients with metastatic disease.
      Evaluation of a murine liver colonization model revealed that PKLR promotes cell 
      survival in the tumor core during conditions of high cell density and oxygen
      deprivation by increasing glutathione, the primary endogenous antioxidant. PKLR
      negatively regulated the glycolytic activity of PKM2, the major pyruvate kinase
      isoenzyme known to regulate cellular glutathione levels. Glutathione is critical 
      for metastasis, and we determined that the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione
      synthesis, GCLC, becomes overexpressed in patient liver metastases, promotes cell
      survival under hypoxic and cell-dense conditions, and mediates metastatic liver
      colonization. RNAi-mediated inhibition of glutathione synthesis impaired survival
      of multiple colon cancer cell lines, and pharmacological targeting of this
      metabolic pathway reduced colonization in a primary patient-derived xenograft
      model. Our findings highlight the impact of metabolic reprogramming within the
      niche as metastases progress and suggest clinical potential for targeting this
      pathway in colorectal cancer.

TI  - Tetraspanin CD37 protects against the development of B cell lymphoma.
PG  - 653-66

AB  - Worldwide, B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common hematological
      malignancy and represents a substantial clinical problem. The molecular events
      that lead to B cell lymphoma are only partially defined. Here, we have provided
      evidence that deficiency of tetraspanin superfamily member CD37, which is
      important for B cell function, induces the development of B cell lymphoma. Mice
      lacking CD37 developed germinal center-derived B cell lymphoma in lymph nodes and
      spleens with a higher incidence than Bcl2 transgenic mice. We discovered that
      CD37 interacts with suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3); therefore,
      absence of CD37 drives tumor development through constitutive activation of the
      IL-6 signaling pathway. Moreover, animals deficient for both Cd37 and Il6 were
      fully protected against lymphoma development, confirming the involvement of the
      IL-6 pathway in driving tumorigenesis. Loss of CD37 on neoplastic cells in
      patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) directly correlated with
      activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway and with worse progression-free and
      overall survival. Together, this study identifies CD37 as a tumor suppressor that
      directly protects against B cell lymphomagenesis and provides a strong rationale 
      for blocking the IL-6 pathway in patients with CD37- B cell malignancies as a
      possible therapeutic intervention.

TI  - TAP-independent self-peptides enhance T cell recognition of immune-escaped
      tumors.
PG  - 784-94
LID - 10.1172/JCI83671 [doi]
LID - 83671 [pii]
AB  - Tumor cells frequently escape from CD8+ T cell recognition by abrogating MHC-I
      antigen presentation. Deficiency in processing components, like the transporter
      associated with antigen processing (TAP), results in strongly decreased surface
      display of peptide/MHC-I complexes. We previously identified a class of hidden
      self-antigens known as T cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide
      processing (TEIPP), which emerge on tumor cells with such processing defects. In 
      the present study, we analyzed thymus selection and peripheral behavior of T
      cells with specificity for the prototypic TEIPP antigen, the "self" TRH4
      peptide/Db complex. TEIPP T cells were efficiently selected in the thymus,
      egressed with a naive phenotype, and could be exploited for immunotherapy against
      immune-escaped, TAP-deficient tumor cells expressing low levels of MHC-I
      (MHC-Ilo). In contrast, overt thymus deletion and functionally impaired TEIPP T
      cells were observed in mice deficient for TAP1 due to TEIPP antigen presentation 
      on all body cells in these mice. Our results strongly support the concept that
      TEIPPs derive from ubiquitous, nonmutated self-antigens and constitute a class of
      immunogenic neoantigens that are unmasked during tumor immune evasion. These data
      suggest that TEIPP-specific CD8+ T cells are promising candidates in the
      treatment of tumors that have escaped from conventional immunotherapies.

LID - 78464 [pii]
AB  - Analogous behavioral assays are needed across animal models and human patients to
      improve translational research. Here, we examined the extent to which performance
      in the Morris water maze - the most frequently used behavioral assay of spatial
      learning and memory in rodents - translates to humans. We designed a virtual
      version of the assay for human subjects that includes the visible-target
      training, hidden-target learning, and probe trials that are typically
      administered in the mouse version. We compared transgenic mice that express human
      amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and patients with mild cognitive impairment due 
      to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) to evaluate the sensitivity of performance
      measures in detecting deficits. Patients performed normally during visible-target
      training, while hAPP mice showed procedural learning deficits. In hidden-target
      learning and probe trials, hAPP mice and MCI-AD patients showed similar deficits 
      in learning and remembering the target location. In addition, we have provided
      recommendations for selecting performance measures and sample sizes to make these
      assays sensitive to learning and memory deficits in humans with MCI-AD and in
      mouse models. Together, our results demonstrate that with careful study design
      and analysis, the Morris maze is a sensitive assay for detecting AD-relevant
      impairments across species.

TI  - CYP24 inhibition as a therapeutic target in FGF23-mediated renal phosphate
      wasting disorders.
PG  - 667-80
LID - 10.1172/JCI81928 [doi]
LID - 81928 [pii]
AB  - CYP24A1 (hereafter referred to as CYP24) enzymatic activity is pivotal in the
      inactivation of vitamin D metabolites. Basal renal and extrarenal CYP24 is
      usually low but is highly induced by its substrate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
      Unbalanced high and/or long-lasting CYP24 expression has been proposed to
      underlie diseases like chronic kidney disease, cancers, and psoriasis that
      otherwise should favorably respond to supplemental vitamin D. Using genetically
      modified mice, we have shown that renal phosphate wasting hypophosphatemic states
      arising from high levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are also
      associated with increased renal Cyp24 expression, suggesting that elevated CYP24 
      activity is pivotal to the pathophysiology of these disorders. We therefore
      crossed 2 mouse strains, each with distinct etiology for high levels of
      circulating FGF23, onto a Cyp24-null background. Specifically, we evaluated Cyp24
      deficiency in Hyp mice, the murine homolog of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic 
      rickets, and transgenic mice that overexpress a mutant FGF23 (FGF23R176Q) that is
      associated with the autosomal dominant form of hypophosphatemic rickets. Loss of 
      Cyp24 in these murine models of human disease resulted in near-complete recovery 
      of rachitic/osteomalacic bony abnormalities in the absence of any improvement in 
      the serum biochemical profile. Moreover, treatment of Hyp and
      FGF23R1760-transgenic mice with the CYP24 inhibitor CTA102 also ameliorated their
      rachitic bones. Our results link CYP24 activity to the pathophysiology of
      FGF23-dependent renal phosphate wasting states and implicate pharmacologic CYP24 
      inhibition as a therapeutic adjunct for their treatment.

AB  - Overexpression of FGF23 results in hypophosphatemic rickets, which is
      characterized by renal phosphate wasting, inappropriately low circulating levels 
      of the active form of vitamin D, and skeletal abnormalities. The precise
      mechanisms of how excess FGF23 leads to hypophosphatemic rickets are not clear.
      In this issue of the JCI, Bai and colleagues demonstrate that deletion or
      inhibition of CYP24A1, which initiates degradation of the active form of vitamin 
      D, ameliorates skeletal abnormalities in two mouse models of hypophosphatemic
      rickets. While this work supports an important role for excess CYP24A1 activity
      in the pathogenesis of FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemic rickets, more work will
      need to be done before CYP24A1 inhibition can be integrated into the management
      of patients living with these diseases.

AB  - Cancer immunotherapy in which cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) target tumor-specific
      antigens complexed to MHC-I molecules has been used successfully for several
      types of cancer; however, MHC-I is frequently downregulated in tumors, resulting 
      in CTL evasion. Recently, it has been shown that MHC-Ilo tumors produce a set of 
      T cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing (TEIPP) that have
      potential to be exploited for immunotherapy. TEIPP-specific CTLs recognize tumors
      defective in antigen presentation machinery (APM) but not those with intact APM. 
      In this issue of the JCI, Doorduljn et al. evaluated thymus selection and
      peripheral behavior of TEIPP-specific T cells, using a unique T cell receptor
      (TCR) transgenic mouse model. They demonstrated that TEIPP-specific T cells in
      TAP-deficient mice have largely been deleted by central tolerance, while the same
      T cells in WT mice are naive and sustained. The results of this study suggest
      that TIEPPs have potential to be successful targets for elimination of MHC-Ilo
      tumors.

AB  - Although the cognitive and biological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      are well known and mouse models of AD are available, current treatments for
      AD-related cognitive deficits have quite limited efficacy. The development of
      tasks with cross-species validity may enable better prediction of the efficacy of
      potential new treatments. In this issue of the JCI, Possin et al. present a
      virtual version of the Morris water maze (a common test of spatial learning and
      memory for rodents) that is designed for use with humans. The authors tested a
      mouse model of AD (transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein
      [hAPP]) and patients in the earlier mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD
      in their respective versions of the maze. Using novel statistical methods, they
      detected similar deficits across species, providing support for the hAPP model
      and use of the virtual water maze. Importantly, this work enabled recommendations
      for appropriate sample sizes when developing potential therapeutics for AD.

TI  - Rho-A prenylation and signaling link epithelial homeostasis to intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - 611-26
LID - 10.1172/JCI80997 [doi]
LID - 80997 [pii]
AB  - Although defects in intestinal barrier function are a key pathogenic factor in
      patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), the molecular pathways driving 
      disease-specific alterations of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are largely
      unknown. Here, we addressed this issue by characterizing the transcriptome of
      IECs from IBD patients using a genome-wide approach. We observed disease-specific
      alterations in IECs with markedly impaired Rho-A signaling in active IBD
      patients. Localization of epithelial Rho-A was shifted to the cytosol in IBDs,
      and inflammation was associated with suppressed Rho-A activation due to reduced
      expression of the Rho-A prenylation enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase-I
      (GGTase-I). Functionally, we found that mice with conditional loss of Rhoa or the
      gene encoding GGTase-I, Pggt1b, in IECs exhibit spontaneous chronic intestinal
      inflammation with accumulation of granulocytes and CD4+ T cells. This phenotype
      was associated with cytoskeleton rearrangement and aberrant cell shedding,
      ultimately leading to loss of epithelial integrity and subsequent inflammation.
      These findings uncover deficient prenylation of Rho-A as a key player in the
      pathogenesis of IBDs. As therapeutic triggering of Rho-A signaling suppressed
      intestinal inflammation in mice with GGTase-I-deficient IECs, our findings
      suggest new avenues for treatment of epithelial injury and mucosal inflammation
      in IBD patients.

AB  - Deregulated protein and Ca2+ homeostasis underlie synaptic dysfunction and
      neurodegeneration in Huntington disease (HD); however, the factors that disrupt
      homeostasis are not fully understood. Here, we determined that expression of
      downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM), a multifunctional
      Ca2+-binding protein, is reduced in murine in vivo and in vitro HD models and in 
      HD patients. DREAM downregulation was observed early after birth and was
      associated with endogenous neuroprotection. In the R6/2 mouse HD model, induced
      DREAM haplodeficiency or blockade of DREAM activity by chronic administration of 
      the drug repaglinide delayed onset of motor dysfunction, reduced striatal
      atrophy, and prolonged life span. DREAM-related neuroprotection was linked to an 
      interaction between DREAM and the unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor
      activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Repaglinide blocked this interaction
      and enhanced ATF6 processing and nuclear accumulation of transcriptionally active
      ATF6, improving prosurvival UPR function in striatal neurons. Together, our
      results identify a role for DREAM silencing in the activation of ATF6 signaling, 
      which promotes early neuroprotection in HD.

TI  - Molecular etiology of arthrogryposis in multiple families of mostly Turkish
      origin.
PG  - 762-78
LID - 10.1172/JCI84457 [doi]
LID - 84457 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthrogryposis, defined as congenital joint contractures in 2 or more
      body areas, is a clinical sign rather than a specific disease diagnosis. To date,
      more than 400 different disorders have been described that present with
      arthrogryposis, and variants of more than 220 genes have been associated with
      these disorders; however, the underlying molecular etiology remains unknown in
      the considerable majority of these cases. METHODS: We performed whole exome
      sequencing (WES) of 52 patients with clinical presentation of arthrogryposis from
      48 different families. RESULTS: Affected individuals from 17 families (35.4%) had
      variants in known arthrogryposis-associated genes, including homozygous variants 
      of cholinergic gamma nicotinic receptor (CHRNG, 6 subjects) and endothelin
      converting enzyme-like 1 (ECEL1, 4 subjects). Deleterious variants in candidate
      arthrogryposis-causing genes (fibrillin 3 [FBN3], myosin IXA [MYO9A], and
      pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing 3 [PSD3]) were identified in 3 families
      (6.2%). Moreover, in 8 families with a homozygous mutation in an
      arthrogryposis-associated gene, we identified a second locus with either a
      homozygous or compound heterozygous variant in a candidate gene (myosin binding
      protein C, fast type [MYBPC2] and vacuolar protein sorting 8 [VPS8], 2 families, 
      4.2%) or in another disease-associated genes (6 families, 12.5%), indicating a
      potential mutational burden contributing to disease expression. CONCLUSION: In
      58.3% of families, the arthrogryposis manifestation could be explained by a
      molecular diagnosis; however, the molecular etiology in subjects from 20 families
      remained unsolved by WES. Only 5 of these 20 unrelated subjects had a clinical
      presentation consistent with amyoplasia; a phenotype not thought to be of genetic
      origin. Our results indicate that increased use of genome-wide technologies will 
      provide opportunities to better understand genetic models for diseases and
      molecular mechanisms of genetically heterogeneous disorders, such as
      arthrogryposis. FUNDING: This work was supported in part by US National Human

AB  - Colon tumors arise in a stepwise fashion from either discrete genetic
      perturbations or epigenetic dysregulation. To uncover the key epigenetic
      regulators that drive colon cancer growth, we used a CRISPR loss-of-function
      screen and identified a number of essential genes, including the bromodomain and 
      extraterminal (BET) protein BRD4. We found that BRD4 is critical for colon cancer
      proliferation, and its knockdown led to differentiation effects in vivo. JQ1, a
      BET inhibitor, preferentially reduced growth in a subset of epigenetically
      dysregulated colon cancers characterized by the CpG island methylator phenotype
      (CIMP). Integrated transcriptomic and genomic analyses defined a distinct
      superenhancer in CIMP+ colon cancers that regulates cMYC transcription. We found 
      that the long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 1 (CCAT1) is
      transcribed from this superenhancer and is exquisitely sensitive to BET
      inhibition. Concordantly, cMYC transcription and cell growth were tightly
      correlated with the presence of CCAT1 RNA in a variety of tumor types. Taken
      together, we propose that CCAT1 is a clinically tractable biomarker for
      identifying patients who are likely to benefit from BET inhibitors.

TI  - Transcription factor ICBP90 regulates the MIF promoter and immune susceptibility 
      locus.
PG  - 732-44
LID - 10.1172/JCI81937 [doi]
LID - 81937 [pii]
AB  - The immunoregulatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is
      encoded in a functionally polymorphic locus that is linked to the susceptibility 
      of autoimmune and infectious diseases. The MIF promoter contains a 4-nucleotide
      microsatellite polymorphism (-794 CATT) that repeats 5 to 8 times in the locus,
      with greater numbers of repeats associated with higher mRNA levels. Because there
      is no information about the transcriptional regulation of these common alleles,
      we used oligonucleotide affinity chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry to identify nuclear proteins that interact with the -794 CATT5-8
      site. An analysis of monocyte nuclear lysates revealed that the transcription
      factor ICBP90 (also known as UHRF1) is the major protein interacting with the MIF
      microsatellite. We found that ICBP90 is essential for MIF transcription from
      monocytes/macrophages, B and T lymphocytes, and synovial fibroblasts, and
      TLR-induced MIF transcription is regulated in an ICBP90- and -794 CATT5-8
      length-dependent manner. Whole-genome transcription analysis of ICBP90
      shRNA-treated rheumatoid synoviocytes uncovered a subset of proinflammatory and
      immune response genes that overlapped with those regulated by MIF shRNA. In
      addition, the expression levels of ICBP90 and MIF were correlated in joint
      synovia from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These findings identify ICBP90
      as a key regulator of MIF transcription and provide functional insight into the
      regulation of the polymorphic MIF locus.

TI  - CXCL13 drives spinal astrocyte activation and neuropathic pain via CXCR5.
PG  - 745-61
LID - 10.1172/JCI81950 [doi]
LID - 81950 [pii]
AB  - Recent studies have implicated chemokines in microglial activation and
      pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) is a B
      lymphocyte chemoattractant that activates CXCR5. Using the spinal nerve ligation 
      (SNL) model of neuropathic pain, we found that CXCL13 was persistently
      upregulated in spinal cord neurons after SNL, resulting in spinal astrocyte
      activation via CXCR5 in mice. shRNA-mediated inhibition of CXCL13 in the spinal
      cord persistently attenuated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Interestingly, CXCL13 
      expression was suppressed by miR-186-5p, a microRNA that colocalized with CXCL13 
      and was downregulated after SNL. Spinal overexpression of miR-186-5p decreased
      CXCL13 expression, alleviating neuropathic pain. Furthermore, SNL induced CXCR5
      expression in spinal astrocytes, and neuropathic pain was abrogated in Cxcr5-/-
      mice. CXCR5 expression induced by SNL was required for the SNL-induced activation
      of spinal astrocytes and microglia. Intrathecal injection of CXCL13 was
      sufficient to induce pain hypersensitivity and astrocyte activation via CXCR5 and
      ERK. Finally, intrathecal injection of CXCL13-activated astrocytes induced
      mechanical allodynia in naive mice. Collectively, our findings reveal a
      neuronal/astrocytic interaction in the spinal cord by which neuronally produced
      CXCL13 activates astrocytes via CXCR5 to facilitate neuropathic pain. Thus,
      miR-186-5p and CXCL13/CXCR5-mediated astrocyte signaling may be suitable
      therapeutic targets for neuropathic pain.

PG  - 415-23

LID - 80561 [pii]
AB  - Current antiretroviral drug therapies do not cure HIV-1 because they do not
      eliminate a pool of long-lived cells harboring immunologically silent but
      replication-competent proviruses - termed the latent reservoir. Eliminating this 
      reservoir and stimulating the immune response to control infection in the absence
      of therapy remain important but unsolved goals of HIV-1 cure research. Recently
      discovered broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) exhibit remarkable breadth and
      potency in their ability to neutralize HIV-1 in vitro, and recent studies have
      demonstrated new therapeutic applications for passively administered bNAbs in
      vivo. This Review discusses the roles bNAbs might play in HIV-1 treatment
      regimens, including prevention, therapy, and cure.

TI  - Histone demethylase JMJD2A drives prostate tumorigenesis through transcription
      factor ETV1.
PG  - 706-20
LID - 10.1172/JCI78132 [doi]
LID - 78132 [pii]
AB  - Histone demethylase upregulation has been observed in human cancers, yet it is
      unknown whether this is a bystander event or a driver of tumorigenesis. We found 
      that overexpression of lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A, also known as
      JMJD2A) was positively correlated with Gleason score and metastasis in human
      prostate tumors. Overexpression of JMJD2A resulted in the development of
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in mice, demonstrating that JMJD2A can
      initiate prostate cancer development. Moreover, combined overexpression of JMJD2A
      and the ETS transcription factor ETV1, a JMJD2A-binding protein, resulted in
      prostate carcinoma formation in mice haplodeficient for the phosphatase and
      tensin homolog (Pten) tumor-suppressor gene. Additionally, JMJD2A cooperated with
      ETV1 to increase expression of yes associated protein 1 (YAP1), a Hippo pathway
      component that itself was associated with prostate tumor aggressiveness. ETV1
      facilitated the recruitment of JMJD2A to the YAP1 promoter, leading to changes in
      histone lysine methylation in a human prostate cancer cell line. Further, YAP1
      expression largely rescued the growth inhibitory effects of JMJD2A depletion in
      prostate cancer cells, indicating that YAP1 is a downstream effector of JMJD2A.
      Taken together, these data reveal a JMJD2A/ETV1/YAP1 axis that promotes prostate 
      cancer initiation and that may be a suitable target for therapeutic inhibition.

TI  - The transcription factor BACH2 promotes tumor immunosuppression.
PG  - 599-604
LID - 10.1172/JCI82884 [doi]
LID - 82884 [pii]
AB  - The immune system has a powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells, but 
      its function is often suppressed within tumors, preventing clearance of disease. 
      Functionally diverse innate and adaptive cellular lineages either drive or
      constrain immune reactions within tumors. The transcription factor (TF) BACH2
      regulates the differentiation of multiple innate and adaptive cellular lineages, 
      but its role in controlling tumor immunity has not been elucidated. Here, we
      demonstrate that BACH2 is required to establish immunosuppression within tumors. 
      Tumor growth was markedly impaired in Bach2-deficient mice and coincided with
      intratumoral activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. However, augmented 
      tumor clearance in the absence of Bach2 was dependent upon the adaptive immune
      system. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from Bach2-deficient mice
      revealed high frequencies of rapidly proliferating effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
      that expressed the inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma. Effector T cell activation
      coincided with a reduction in the frequency of intratumoral Foxp3+ Tregs.
      Mechanistically, BACH2 promoted tumor immunosuppression through Treg-mediated
      inhibition of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma. These findings demonstrate
      that BACH2 is a key component of the molecular program of tumor immunosuppression
      and identify therapeutic targets for the reversal of immunosuppression in cancer.

AB  - Renal erythropoietin-producing cells (REPCs) remain in the kidneys of patients
      with chronic kidney disease, but these cells do not produce sufficient
      erythropoietin in response to hypoxic stimuli. Treatment with HIF stabilizers
      rescues erythropoietin production in these cells, but the mechanisms underlying
      the decreased response of REPCs in fibrotic kidneys to anemic stimulation remain 
      elusive. Here, we show that fibroblast-like FOXD1+ progenitor-derived kidney
      pericytes, which are characterized by the expression of alpha1 type I collagen
      and PDGFRbeta, produce erythropoietin through HIF2alpha regulation but that
      production is repressed when these cells differentiate into myofibroblasts. DNA
      methyltransferases and erythropoietin hypermethylation are upregulated in
      myofibroblasts. Exposure of myofibroblasts to nanomolar concentrations of the
      demethylating agent 5-azacytidine increased basal expression and hypoxic
      induction of erythropoietin. Mechanistically, the profibrotic factor TGF-beta1
      induced hypermethylation and repression of erythropoietin in pericytes; these
      effects were prevented by 5-azacytidine treatment. These findings shed light on
      the molecular mechanisms underlying erythropoietin repression in kidney
      myofibroblasts and demonstrate that clinically relevant, nontoxic doses of
      5-azacytidine can restore erythropoietin production and ameliorate anemia in the 
      setting of kidney fibrosis in mice.

AB  - In vivo protection by antimicrobial neutralizing Abs can require the contribution
      of effector functions mediated by Fc-Fcgamma receptor (Fc-FcgammaR) interactions 
      for optimal efficacy. In influenza, broadly neutralizing anti-hemagglutinin
      (anti-HA) stalk mAbs require Fc-FcgammaR interactions to mediate in vivo
      protection, but strain-specific anti-HA head mAbs do not. Whether this rule
      applies only to anti-stalk Abs or is applicable to any broadly neutralizing Ab
      (bNAb) against influenza is unknown. Here, we characterized the contribution of
      Fc-FcgammaR interactions during in vivo protection for a panel of 13 anti-HA
      mAbs, including bNAbs and non-neutralizing Abs, against both the stalk and head
      domains. All classes of broadly binding anti-HA mAbs required Fc-FcgammaR
      interactions to provide protection in vivo, including those mAbs that bind the HA
      head and those that do not neutralize virus in vitro. Further, a broadly
      neutralizing anti-neuraminidase (anti-NA) mAb also required FcgammaRs to provide 
      protection in vivo, but a strain-specific anti-NA mAb did not. Thus, these
      findings suggest that the breadth of reactivity of anti-influenza Abs, regardless
      of their epitope, necessitates interactions with FcgammaRs on effector cell
      populations to mediate in vivo protection. These findings will guide the design
      of antiviral Ab therapeutics and inform vaccine design to elicit Abs with optimal
      binding properties and effector functions.

TI  - Osteoblast-derived VEGF regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation
      during bone repair.
PG  - 509-26
LID - 10.1172/JCI82585 [doi]
LID - 82585 [pii]
AB  - Osteoblast-derived VEGF is important for bone development and postnatal bone
      homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that VEGF affects bone repair and
      regeneration; however, the cellular mechanisms by which it works are not fully
      understood. In this study, we investigated the functions of osteoblast-derived
      VEGF in healing of a bone defect. The results indicate that osteoblast-derived
      VEGF plays critical roles at several stages in the repair process. Using
      transgenic mice with osteoblast-specific deletion of Vegfa, we demonstrated that 
      VEGF promoted macrophage recruitment and angiogenic responses in the inflammation
      phase, and optimal levels of VEGF were required for coupling of angiogenesis and 
      osteogenesis in areas where repair occurs by intramembranous ossification. VEGF
      likely functions as a paracrine factor in this process because deletion of Vegfr2
      in osteoblastic lineage cells enhanced osteoblastic maturation and
      mineralization. Furthermore, osteoblast- and hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived
      VEGF stimulated recruitment of blood vessels and osteoclasts and promoted
      cartilage resorption at the repair site during the periosteal endochondral
      ossification stage. Finally, osteoblast-derived VEGF stimulated osteoclast
      formation in the final remodeling phase of the repair process. These findings
      provide a basis for clinical strategies to improve bone regeneration and treat
      defects in bone healing.

TI  - Nuclear pore protein NUP88 activates anaphase-promoting complex to promote
      aneuploidy.
PG  - 543-59
LID - 10.1172/JCI82277 [doi]
LID - 82277 [pii]
AB  - The nuclear pore complex protein NUP88 is frequently elevated in aggressive human
      cancers and correlates with reduced patient survival; however, it is unclear
      whether and how NUP88 overexpression drives tumorigenesis. Here, we show that
      mice overexpressing NUP88 are cancer prone and form intestinal tumors. To
      determine whether overexpression of NUP88 drives tumorigenesis, we engineered
      transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of Nup88. Surprisingly,
      NUP88 overexpression did not alter global nuclear transport, but was a potent
      inducer of aneuploidy and chromosomal instability. We determined that NUP88 and
      the nuclear transport factors NUP98 and RAE1 comprise a regulatory network that
      inhibits premitotic activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C).
      When overexpressed, NUP88 sequesters NUP98-RAE1 away from APC/CCDH1, triggering
      proteolysis of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a tumor suppressor and multitasking
      mitotic kinase. Premitotic destruction of PLK1 disrupts centrosome separation,
      causing mitotic spindle asymmetry, merotelic microtubule-kinetochore attachments,
      lagging chromosomes, and aneuploidy. These effects were replicated by PLK1
      insufficiency, indicating that PLK1 is responsible for the mitotic defects
      associated with NUP88 overexpression. These findings demonstrate that the
      NUP88-NUP98-RAE1-APC/CCDH1 axis contributes to aneuploidy and suggest that it may
      be deregulated in the initiating stages of a broad spectrum of human cancers.

AB  - HIV seeds reservoirs of latent proviruses in the earliest phases of infection.
      These reservoirs are found in many sites, including circulating cells, the
      lymphoid system, the brain, and other tissues. The "shock and kill" strategy,
      where HIV transcription is reactivated so that antiretroviral therapy and the
      immune system clear the infection, has been proposed as one approach to curing
      AIDS. In addition to many defective viruses, resting hematopoietic cells harbor
      transcriptionally latent HIV. Understanding basic mechanisms of HIV gene
      expression provides a road map for this strategy, allowing for manipulation of
      critical cellular and viral transcription factors in such a way as to maximize
      HIV gene expression while avoiding global T cell activation. These transcription 
      factors include NF-kappaB and the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) as
      well as the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK13 and CDK11 and positive transcription
      elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Possible therapies involve agents that activate
      these proteins or release P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK small nuclear
      ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). These proposed therapies include PKC and MAPK agonists
      as well as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) and bromodomain and
      extraterminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitors (BETis), which act synergistically to 
      reactivate HIV in latently infected cells.

AB  - After the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to treat HIV
      infection, the next great frontier is to cure infected persons, a formidable
      challenge. HIV persists in a quiescent state in resting CD4+ T cells, where the
      replicative enzymes targeted by cART are not active. Although low levels of HIV
      transcripts are detectable in these resting cells, little to no viral protein is 
      produced, rendering this reservoir difficult to detect by the host CD8+ T cell
      response. However, recent advances suggest that this state of latency might be
      pharmacologically reversed, resulting in viral protein expression without the
      adverse effects of massive cellular activation. Emerging data suggest that with
      this approach, infected cells will not die of viral cytopathic effects, but might
      be eliminated if HIV-specific CD8+ T cells can be effectively harnessed. Here, we
      address the antiviral properties of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and how these cells
      might be harnessed to greater effect toward achieving viral eradication or a
      functional cure.

AB  - The apparent cure of an HIV-infected person following hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) from an allogeneic donor homozygous for the ccr5Delta32
      mutation has stimulated the search for strategies to eradicate HIV or to induce
      long-term remission without requiring ongoing antiretroviral therapy. A variety
      of approaches, including allogeneic HSCT from CCR5-deficient donors and
      autologous transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells, are 
      currently under investigation. This Review covers the experience with HSCT in HIV
      infection to date and provides a survey of ongoing work in the field. The
      challenges of developing HSCT for HIV cure in the context of safe, effective, and
      convenient once-daily antiretroviral therapy are also discussed.

TI  - The AMPK-related kinase SNARK regulates muscle mass and myocyte survival.
PG  - 560-70
AB  - The maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is critical for sustaining health;
      however, the mechanisms responsible for muscle loss with aging and chronic
      diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, are poorly understood. We found that
      expression of a member of the AMPK-related kinase family, the SNF1-AMPK-related
      kinase (SNARK, also known as NUAK2), increased with muscle cell differentiation. 
      SNARK expression increased in skeletal muscles from young mice exposed to
      metabolic stress and in muscles from healthy older human subjects. The regulation
      of SNARK expression in muscle with differentiation and physiological stress
      suggests that SNARK may function in the maintenance of muscle mass. Consistent
      with this hypothesis, decreased endogenous SNARK expression (using siRNA) in
      cultured muscle cells resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased cell survival
      under conditions of metabolic stress. Likewise, muscle-specific transgenic
      animals expressing a SNARK dominant-negative inactive mutant (SDN) had increased 
      myonuclear apoptosis and activation of apoptotic mediators in muscle. Moreover,
      animals expressing SDN had severe, age-accelerated muscle atrophy and increased
      adiposity, consistent with sarcopenic obesity. Reduced SNARK activity, in vivo
      and in vitro, caused downregulation of the Rho kinase signaling pathway, a key
      mediator of cell survival. These findings reveal a critical role for SNARK in
      myocyte survival and the maintenance of muscle mass with age.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 4-mediated lymphocyte influx induces neonatal necrotizing
      enterocolitis.
PG  - 495-508
AB  - The nature and role of the intestinal leukocytes in necrotizing enterocolitis
      (NEC), a severe disease affecting premature infants, remain unknown. We now show 
      that the intestine in mouse and human NEC is rich in lymphocytes that are
      required for NEC development, as recombination activating gene 1-deficient
      (Rag1-/-) mice were protected from NEC and transfer of intestinal lymphocytes
      from NEC mice into naive mice induced intestinal inflammation. The intestinal
      expression of the lipopolysaccharide receptor TLR4, which is higher in the
      premature compared with full-term human and mouse intestine, is required for
      lymphocyte influx through TLR4-mediated upregulation of CCR9/CCL25 signaling.
      TLR4 also mediates a STAT3-dependent polarization toward increased
      proinflammatory CD3+CD4+IL-17+ and reduced tolerogenic Foxp3+ Treg lymphocytes
      (Tregs). Th17 lymphocytes were required for NEC development, as inhibition of
      STAT3 or IL-17 receptor signaling attenuated NEC in mice, while IL-17 release
      impaired enterocyte tight junctions, increased enterocyte apoptosis, and reduced 
      enterocyte proliferation, leading to NEC. Importantly, TLR4-dependent Th17
      polarization could be reversed by the enteral administration of retinoic acid,
      which induced Tregs and decreased NEC severity. These findings identify an
      important role for proinflammatory lymphocytes in NEC development via intestinal 
      epithelial TLR4 that could be reversed through dietary modification.

TI  - Placenta growth factor augments airway hyperresponsiveness via leukotrienes and

PG  - 571-84
LID - 10.1172/JCI77250 [doi]
LID - 77250 [pii]
AB  - Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) affects 55%-77% of children with sickle cell
      disease (SCD) and occurs even in the absence of asthma. While asthma increases
      SCD morbidity and mortality, the mechanisms underlying the high AHR prevalence in
      a hemoglobinopathy remain unknown. We hypothesized that placenta growth factor
      (PlGF), an erythroblast-secreted factor that is elevated in SCD, mediates AHR. In
      allergen-exposed mice, loss of Plgf dampened AHR, reduced inflammation and
      eosinophilia, and decreased expression of the Th2 cytokine IL-13 and the
      leukotriene-synthesizing enzymes 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene-C4-synthase.
      Plgf-/- mice treated with leukotrienes phenocopied the WT response to allergen
      exposure; conversely, anti-PlGF Ab administration in WT animals blunted the AHR. 
      Notably, Th2-mediated STAT6 activation further increased PlGF expression from
      lung epithelium, eosinophils, and macrophages, creating a
      PlGF/leukotriene/Th2-response positive feedback loop. Similarly, we found that
      the Th2 response in asthma patients is associated with increased expression of
      PlGF and its downstream genes in respiratory epithelial cells. In an SCD mouse
      model, we observed increased AHR and higher leukotriene levels that were
      abrogated by anti-PlGF Ab or the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton. Overall, our 
      findings indicate that PlGF exacerbates AHR and uniquely links the leukotriene
      and Th2 pathways in asthma. These data also suggest that zileuton and anti-PlGF
      Ab could be promising therapies to reduce pulmonary morbidity in SCD.

TI  - Wnt5a induces ROR1/ROR2 heterooligomerization to enhance leukemia chemotaxis and 
      proliferation.
PG  - 585-98
AB  - Evolutionarily conserved receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor-1 and -2
      (ROR1/2) are considered distinct receptors for Wnt5a and are implicated in
      noncanonical Wnt signaling in organogenesis and cancer metastasis. We found that 
      Wnt5a enhanced proliferation and migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
      cells and that these effects were blocked by the humanized anti-ROR1 mAb
      cirmtuzumab (UC-961). Treatment of CLL cells with Wnt5a induced ROR1 to
      oligomerize with ROR2 and recruit guanine exchange factors (GEFs), which
      activated Rac1 and RhoA; siRNA-mediated silencing of either ROR1 or ROR2 or
      treatment with UC-961 inhibited these effects. Using the ROR1-deficient CLL cell 
      line MEC1, we demonstrated that ectopic ROR1 expression induced ROR1/ROR2
      heterooligomers, which recruited GEFs, and enhanced proliferation,
      cytokine-directed migration, and engraftment potential of MEC1 cells in
      immune-deficient mice. Notably, treatment with UC-961 inhibited engraftment of
      ROR1+ leukemia cells in immune-competent ROR1-transgenic mice. Molecular analysis
      revealed that the extracellular Kringle domain is required for ROR1/ROR2
      heterooligomerization and the cysteine-rich domain or intracellular proline-rich 
      domain is required for Wnt5a-induced recruitment of GEFs to ROR1/ROR2. This study
      identifies an interaction between ROR1 and ROR2 that is required for Wnt5a
      signaling that promotes leukemia chemotaxis and proliferation.

TI  - A chimeric platelet-targeted urokinase prodrug selectively blocks new thrombus
      formation.
PG  - 483-94
AB  - The use of fibrinolytic agents to prevent new thrombus formation is limited by an
      increased risk of bleeding due to lysis of hemostatic clots that prevent
      hemorrhage in damaged blood vessels. We sought to develop an agent that provides 
      thromboprophylaxis without carrying a significant risk of causing systemic
      fibrinolysis or disrupting hemostatic clots. We previously showed that platelet
      (PLT) alpha granule-delivered urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is highly
      effective in preventing thrombosis, while being associated with little systemic
      fibrinolysis or bleeding. Here, we generated a chimeric prodrug composed of a
      single-chain version of the variable region of an anti-alphaIIbbeta3 mAb fused to
      a thrombin-activatable, low-molecular-weight pro-uPA (PLT/uPA-T). PLT/uPA-T
      recognizes human alphaIIbbeta3 on both quiescent and activated platelets and is
      enzymatically activated specifically by thrombin. We found that this prodrug
      binds tightly to human platelets even after gel filtration, has a prolonged
      half-life in mice transgenic for human alphaIIb compared with that of uPA-T, and 
      prevents clot formation in a microfluidic system. Importantly, in two murine
      injury models, PLT/uPA-T did not lyse preexisting clots, even when administration
      was delayed by as little as 10 minutes, while it concurrently prevented the
      development of nascent thrombi. Thus, PLT/uPA-T represents the prototype of a
      platelet-targeted thromboprophylactic agent that selectively targets nascent over
      preexisting thrombi.

TI  - Prostaglandin-dependent modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission elicits

PG  - 695-705
AB  - Systemic inflammation causes malaise and general feelings of discomfort. This
      fundamental aspect of the sickness response reduces the quality of life for
      people suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases and is a nuisance during mild
      infections like common colds or the flu. To investigate how inflammation is
      perceived as unpleasant and causes negative affect, we used a behavioral test in 
      which mice avoid an environment that they have learned to associate with
      inflammation-induced discomfort. Using a combination of cell-type-specific gene
      deletions, pharmacology, and chemogenetics, we found that systemic inflammation
      triggered aversion through MyD88-dependent activation of the brain endothelium
      followed by COX1-mediated cerebral prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. Further, we
      showed that inflammation-induced PGE2 targeted EP1 receptors on striatal dopamine
      D1 receptor-expressing neurons and that this signaling sequence induced aversion 
      through GABA-mediated inhibition of dopaminergic cells. Finally, we demonstrated 
      that inflammation-induced aversion was not an indirect consequence of fever or
      anorexia but that it constituted an independent inflammatory symptom triggered by
      a unique molecular mechanism. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that
      PGE2-mediated modulation of the dopaminergic motivational circuitry is a key
      mechanism underlying the negative affect induced by inflammation.

TI  - Sepsis-induced immune dysfunction: can immune therapies reduce mortality?
PG  - 23-31
LID - 10.1172/JCI82224 [doi]
LID - 82224 [pii]
AB  - Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response induced by an infection, leading to
      organ dysfunction and mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction
      and lethality were attributed to the interplay between inflammatory and
      antiinflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care management and
      goal-directed interventions, early sepsis mortality has diminished, only to surge
      later after "recovery" from acute events, prompting a search for sepsis-induced
      alterations in immune function. Sepsis is well known to alter innate and adaptive
      immune responses for sustained periods after clinical "recovery," with
      immunosuppression being a prominent example of such alterations. Recent studies
      have centered on immune-modulatory therapy. These efforts are focused on defining
      and reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction that is associated with
      mortality long after the acute events of sepsis have resolved.

LID - 77812 [pii]
AB  - Insulin resistance arises when the nutrient storage pathways evolved to maximize 
      efficient energy utilization are exposed to chronic energy surplus. Ectopic lipid
      accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle triggers pathways that impair insulin
      signaling, leading to reduced muscle glucose uptake and decreased hepatic
      glycogen synthesis. Muscle insulin resistance, due to ectopic lipid, precedes
      liver insulin resistance and diverts ingested glucose to the liver, resulting in 
      increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and hyperlipidemia. Subsequent macrophage
      infiltration into white adipose tissue (WAT) leads to increased lipolysis, which 
      further increases hepatic triglyceride synthesis and hyperlipidemia due to
      increased fatty acid esterification. Macrophage-induced WAT lipolysis also
      stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis, promoting fasting and postprandial
      hyperglycemia through increased fatty acid delivery to the liver, which results
      in increased hepatic acetyl-CoA content, a potent activator of pyruvate
      carboxylase, and increased glycerol conversion to glucose. These
      substrate-regulated processes are mostly independent of insulin signaling in the 
      liver but are dependent on insulin signaling in WAT, which becomes defective with
      inflammation. Therapies that decrease ectopic lipid storage and diminish
      macrophage-induced WAT lipolysis will reverse the root causes of type 2 diabetes.

LID - 85446 [pii]
AB  - Identification of HPV infection as the etiologic agent of virtually all cases of 
      cervical cancer, as well as a proportion of other epithelial cancers, has led to 
      development of three FDA-approved multivalent prophylactic HPV vaccines composed 
      of virus-like particles (VLPs). This essay describes the research and development
      that led to the VLP vaccines; discusses their safety, efficacy, and short-term
      effect on HPV-associated disease; and speculates that even a single dose of these
      vaccines, when given to adolescents, might be able to confer long-term
      protection. The HPV field exemplifies how long-term funding for basic research
      has lead to clinical interventions with the long-term potential to eradicate most
      cancers attributable to HPV infection. Although this essay is the result of my
      receiving the 2015 Harrington Prize for Innovation in Medicine from the
      Harrington Discovery Institute and the American Society for Clinical
      Investigation, this clinical advance has depended on the research of many
      investigators, development of commercial vaccines by the pharmaceutical

TI  - CDK4 is an essential insulin effector in adipocytes.
PG  - 335-48
LID - 10.1172/JCI81480 [doi]
LID - 81480 [pii]
AB  - Insulin resistance is a fundamental pathogenic factor that characterizes various 
      metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue
      contributes to the development of obesity-related insulin resistance through
      increased release of fatty acids, altered adipokine secretion, and/or macrophage 
      infiltration and cytokine release. Here, we aimed to analyze the participation of
      the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in adipose tissue biology. We determined
      that white adipose tissue (WAT) from CDK4-deficient mice exhibits impaired
      lipogenesis and increased lipolysis. Conversely, lipolysis was decreased and
      lipogenesis was increased in mice expressing a mutant hyperactive form of CDK4
      (CDK4(R24C)). A global kinome analysis of CDK4-deficient mice following insulin
      stimulation revealed that insulin signaling is impaired in these animals. We
      determined that insulin activates the CCND3-CDK4 complex, which in turn
      phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) at serine 388, thereby
      creating a positive feedback loop that maintains adipocyte insulin signaling.
      Furthermore, we found that CCND3 expression and IRS2 serine 388 phosphorylation
      are increased in human obese subjects. Together, our results demonstrate that
      CDK4 is a major regulator of insulin signaling in WAT.

TI  - Progesterone receptor membrane component-1 regulates hepcidin biosynthesis.
PG  - 389-401
LID - 10.1172/JCI83831 [doi]
LID - 83831 [pii]
AB  - Iron homeostasis is tightly regulated by the membrane iron exporter ferroportin
      and its regulatory peptide hormone hepcidin. The hepcidin/ferroportin axis is
      considered a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases of iron
      overload or deficiency. Here, we conducted a chemical screen in zebrafish to
      identify small molecules that decrease ferroportin protein levels. The chemical
      screen led to the identification of 3 steroid molecules, epitiostanol,
      progesterone, and mifepristone, which decrease ferroportin levels by increasing
      the biosynthesis of hepcidin. These hepcidin-inducing steroids (HISs) did not
      activate known hepcidin-inducing pathways, including the BMP and JAK/STAT3
      pathways. Progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1) was required for
      HIS-dependent increases in hepcidin biosynthesis, as PGRMC1 depletion in cultured
      hepatoma cells and zebrafish blocked the ability of HISs to increase hepcidin
      mRNA levels. Neutralizing antibodies directed against PGRMC1 attenuated the
      ability of HISs to induce hepcidin gene expression. Inhibiting the kinases of the
      SRC family, which are downstream of PGRMC1, blocked the ability of HISs to
      increase hepcidin mRNA levels. Furthermore, HIS treatment increased hepcidin
      biosynthesis in mice and humans. Together, these data indicate that PGRMC1
      regulates hepcidin gene expression through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.
      These studies have identified drug candidates and potential therapeutic targets
      for the treatment of diseases of abnormal iron metabolism.

TI  - MicroRNA-31 initiates lung tumorigenesis and promotes mutant KRAS-driven lung
      cancer.
PG  - 349-64

LID - 82720 [pii]
AB  - MicroRNA (miR) are important regulators of gene expression, and aberrant miR
      expression has been linked to oncogenesis; however, little is understood about
      their contribution to lung tumorigenesis. Here, we determined that miR-31 is
      overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma and this overexpression independently 
      correlates with decreased patient survival. We developed a transgenic mouse model
      that allows for lung-specific expression of miR-31 to test the oncogenic
      potential of miR-31 in the lung. Using this model, we observed that miR-31
      induction results in lung hyperplasia, followed by adenoma formation and later
      adenocarcinoma development. Moreover, induced expression of miR-31 in mice
      cooperated with mutant KRAS to accelerate lung tumorigenesis. We determined that 
      miR-31 regulates lung epithelial cell growth and identified 6 negative regulators
      of RAS/MAPK signaling as direct targets of miR-31. Our study distinguishes miR-31
      as a driver of lung tumorigenesis that promotes mutant KRAS-mediated oncogenesis 
      and reveals that miR-31 directly targets and reduces expression of negative
      regulators of RAS/MAPK signaling.

TI  - MicroRNA-155 controls affinity-based selection by protecting c-MYC+ B cells from 
      apoptosis.

LID - 82914 [pii]
AB  - The production of high-affinity antibodies by B cells is essential for pathogen
      clearance. Antibody affinity for antigen is increased through the affinity
      maturation in germinal centers (GCs). This is an iterative process in which B
      cells cycle between proliferation coupled with the acquisition of mutations and
      antigen-based positive selection, resulting in retention of the highest-affinity 
      B cell clones. The posttranscriptional regulator microRNA-155 (miR-155) is
      critical for efficient affinity maturation and the maintenance of the GCs;
      however, the cellular and molecular mechanism by which miR-155 regulates GC
      responses is not well understood. Here, we utilized a miR-155 reporter mouse
      strain and showed that miR-155 is coexpressed with the proto-oncogene encoding
      c-MYC in positively selected B cells. Functionally, miR-155 protected positively 
      selected c-MYC+ B cells from apoptosis, allowing clonal expansion of this
      population, providing an explanation as to why Mir155 deletion impairs affinity
      maturation and promotes the premature collapse of GCs. We determined that miR-155
      directly inhibits the Jumonji family member JARID2, which enhances B cell
      apoptosis when overexpressed, and thereby promotes GC B cell survival. Our
      findings also suggest that there is cooperation between c-MYC and miR-155 during 
      the normal GC response, a cooperation that may explain how c-MYC and miR-155 can 
      collaboratively function as oncogenes.

LID - 81217 [pii]
AB  - Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of purified naive, stem cell memory, and central
      memory T cell subsets results in superior persistence and antitumor immunity
      compared with ACT of populations containing more-differentiated effector memory
      and effector T cells. Despite a clear advantage of the less-differentiated
      populations, the majority of ACT trials utilize unfractionated T cell subsets.
      Here, we have challenged the notion that the mere presence of less-differentiated
      T cells in starting populations used to generate therapeutic T cells is
      sufficient to convey their desirable attributes. Using both mouse and human
      cells, we identified a T cell-T cell interaction whereby antigen-experienced
      subsets directly promote the phenotypic, functional, and metabolic
      differentiation of naive T cells. This process led to the loss of
      less-differentiated T cell subsets and resulted in impaired cellular persistence 
      and tumor regression in mouse models following ACT. The T memory-induced
      conversion of naive T cells was mediated by a nonapoptotic Fas signal, resulting 
      in Akt-driven cellular differentiation. Thus, induction of Fas signaling enhanced
      T cell differentiation and impaired antitumor immunity, while Fas signaling
      blockade preserved the antitumor efficacy of naive cells within mixed
      populations. These findings reveal that T cell subsets can synchronize their
      differentiation state in a process similar to quorum sensing in unicellular
      organisms and suggest that disruption of this quorum-like behavior among T cells 
      has potential to enhance T cell-based immunotherapies.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent and debilitating joint disease, and
      there are currently no effective disease-modifying treatments available. Multiple
      risk factors for OA, such as aging, result in progressive damage and loss of
      articular cartilage. Autonomous circadian clocks have been identified in mouse
      cartilage, and environmental disruption of circadian rhythms in mice predisposes 
      animals to OA-like damage. However, the contribution of the cartilage clock
      mechanisms to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis is still unclear. Here, we
      have shown that expression of the core clock transcription factor BMAL1 is
      disrupted in human OA cartilage and in aged mouse cartilage. Furthermore,
      targeted Bmal1 ablation in mouse chondrocytes abolished their circadian rhythm
      and caused progressive degeneration of articular cartilage. We determined that
      BMAL1 directs the circadian expression of many genes implicated in cartilage
      homeostasis, including those involved in catabolic, anabolic, and apoptotic
      pathways. Loss of BMAL1 reduced the levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (p-SMAD2/3) 
      and NFATC2 and decreased expression of the major matrix-related genes Sox9, Acan,
      and Col2a1, but increased p-SMAD1/5 levels. Together, these results define a
      regulatory mechanism that links chondrocyte BMAL1 to the maintenance and repair
      of cartilage and suggest that circadian rhythm disruption is a risk factor for
      joint diseases such as OA.

TI  - Circulating protein synthesis rates reveal skeletal muscle proteome dynamics.
PG  - 288-302

LID - 79639 [pii]
AB  - Here, we have described and validated a strategy for monitoring skeletal muscle
      protein synthesis rates in rodents and humans over days or weeks from blood
      samples. We based this approach on label incorporation into proteins that are
      synthesized specifically in skeletal muscle and escape into the circulation.
      Heavy water labeling combined with sensitive tandem mass spectrometric analysis
      allowed integrated synthesis rates of proteins in muscle tissue across the
      proteome to be measured over several weeks. Fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of
      plasma creatine kinase M-type (CK-M) and carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA-3) in the
      blood, more than 90% of which is derived from skeletal muscle, correlated closely
      with FSR of CK-M, CA-3, and other proteins of various ontologies in skeletal
      muscle tissue in both rodents and humans. Protein synthesis rates across the
      muscle proteome generally changed in a coordinate manner in response to a sprint 
      interval exercise training regimen in humans and to denervation or clenbuterol
      treatment in rodents. FSR of plasma CK-M and CA-3 revealed changes and
      interindividual differences in muscle tissue proteome dynamics. In human
      subjects, sprint interval training primarily stimulated synthesis of structural
      and glycolytic proteins. Together, our results indicate that this approach
      provides a virtual biopsy, sensitively revealing individualized changes in
      proteome-wide synthesis rates in skeletal muscle without a muscle biopsy.
      Accordingly, this approach has potential applications for the diagnosis,
      management, and treatment of muscle disorders.

TI  - Group A Streptococcus intranasal infection promotes CNS infiltration by
      streptococcal-specific Th17 cells.
PG  - 303-17
LID - 10.1172/JCI80792 [doi]
LID - 80792 [pii]
AB  - Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection induces the production of Abs that
      cross-react with host neuronal proteins, and these anti-GAS mimetic Abs are
      associated with autoimmune diseases of the CNS. However, the mechanisms that
      allow these Abs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induce neuropathology 
      remain unresolved. We have previously shown that GAS infection in mouse models
      induces a robust Th17 response in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). Here, 
      we identified GAS-specific Th17 cells in tonsils of humans naturally exposed to
      GAS, prompting us to explore whether GAS-specific CD4+ T cells home to mouse
      brains following i.n. infection. Intranasal challenge of repeatedly
      GAS-inoculated mice promoted migration of GAS-specific Th17 cells from NALT into 
      the brain, BBB breakdown, serum IgG deposition, microglial activation, and loss
      of excitatory synaptic proteins under conditions in which no viable bacteria were
      detected in CNS tissue. CD4+ T cells were predominantly located in the olfactory 
      bulb (OB) and in other brain regions that receive direct input from the OB.
      Together, these findings provide insight into the immunopathology of
      neuropsychiatric complications that are associated with GAS infections and
      suggest that crosstalk between the CNS and cellular immunity may be a general
      mechanism by which infectious agents exacerbate symptoms associated with other
      CNS autoimmune disorders.

PG  - 32-4
LID - 10.1172/JCI85627 [doi]
LID - 85627 [pii]
AB  - The development of high-affinity antibodies in response to infection is an
      iterative process in which B cells cycle between proliferation/somatic
      hypermutation and antigen-driven selection. These processes occur within specific
      regions of the secondary lymphoid structures known as germinal centers (GCs) and 
      the environmental and signaling cues provided by these regions guide the GC
      reactions that drive B cell maturation and antibody production, ultimately
      determining B cell fate. In this issue of the JCI, Nakagawa and colleagues
      examine the role of miR-155, a microRNA that is required for GC development and
      the production of high-affinity antibodies. They show that miR-155 is highly
      expressed in positively selected B cells and promotes survival of these cells by 
      orienting the Myc transcription program toward survival rather than apoptosis
      through the inhibition of the transcriptional regulator JARID2. These findings
      illustrate the fine balance between apoptosis and proliferation that is required 
      for the development of high-affinity antibodies.

PG  - 35-7

LID - 85631 [pii]
AB  - The clinical application of T cell immunotherapy depends on ex vivo modification 
      and expansion of T cells for adoptive transfer. In preclinical models, the use of
      a purified, naive T cell subset enhances persistence and antitumor immunity;
      however, the majority of clinical studies rely on modification of mixed
      populations of T cells that contain only a small subset of highly functional T
      cells with less-differentiated phenotype. In this month's issue of the JCI,
      Klebanoff and colleagues uncover a Fas-mediated interaction between naive T cells
      and antigen-experienced T cells that drives differentiation and impairs adoptive 
      immunotherapy. Further, they show that blockade of Fas signaling enhances
      antitumor immunity and increases survival in a mouse model of melanoma. Their
      work supports a growing body of evidence that the use of naive T cells enhances
      the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy and suggests a new therapeutic strategy
      for preserving less-differentiated T cell populations.

AB  - Circadian rhythms mediated by both central and tissue-specific peripheral clocks 
      allow for the synchronization of biological processes with diurnal cycles such as
      activity and rest. Disruption of these rhythms can be caused by altered
      sleep-awake patterns or by pathological conditions and can initiate or exacerbate
      human disease through mechanisms that are only partially understood. In this
      issue, Dudek et al. identify a chondrocyte-autonomous cartilage clock and
      demonstrate that expression of an important circadian pacemaker, BMAL1, decreases
      during osteoarthritis progression. They show that chondrocyte-specific deletion
      of BMAL1 leads to cartilage degradation and disruption of key pathways, shifting 
      cartilage homeostasis toward a catabolic state. These findings provide insight
      into the interplay between circadian rhythm and cartilage in osteoarthritis.

AB  - Sphingolipids make up a family of molecules associated with an array of
      biological functions, including cell death and migration. Sphingolipids are often
      altered in cancer, though how these alterations lead to tumor formation and
      progression is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) specimens and cell lines and determined that ceramide synthase 6 (CERS6) 
      is markedly overexpressed compared with controls. Elevated CERS6 expression was
      due in part to reduction of microRNA-101 (miR-101) and was associated with
      increased invasion and poor prognosis. CERS6 knockdown in NSCLC cells altered the
      ceramide profile, resulting in decreased cell migration and invasion in vitro,
      and decreased the frequency of RAC1-positive lamellipodia formation while CERS6
      overexpression promoted it. In murine models, CERS6 knockdown in transplanted
      NSCLC cells attenuated lung metastasis. Furthermore, combined treatment with
      l-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposome and the glucosylceramide synthase
      inhibitor D-PDMP induced cell death in association with ceramide accumulation and
      promoted cancer cell apoptosis and tumor regression in murine models. Together,
      these results indicate that CERS6-dependent ceramide synthesis and maintenance of
      ceramide in the cellular membrane are essential for lamellipodia formation and
      metastasis. Moreover, these results suggest that targeting this homeostasis has
      potential as a therapeutic strategy for CERS6-overexpressing NSCLC.

TI  - Heparan sulfate mimetic PG545-mediated antilymphoma effects require
      TLR9-dependent NK cell activation.
PG  - 207-19
LID - 10.1172/JCI76566 [doi]
LID - 76566 [pii]
AB  - Heparan sulfate (HS) is an essential component of the extracellular matrix (ECM),
      which serves as a barrier to tumor invasion and metastasis. Heparanase promotes
      tumor growth by cleaving HS chains of proteoglycan and releasing HS-bound
      angiogenic growth factors and facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis by
      degrading the ECM. HS mimetics, such as PG545, have been developed as antitumor
      agents and are designed to suppress angiogenesis and metastasis by inhibiting
      heparanase and competing for the HS-binding domain of angiogenic growth factors. 
      However, how PG545 exerts its antitumor effect remains incompletely defined.
      Here, using murine models of lymphoma, we determined that the antitumor effects
      of PG545 are critically dependent on NK cell activation and that NK cell
      activation by PG545 requires TLR9. We demonstrate that PG545 does not activate
      TLR9 directly but instead enhances TLR9 activation through the elevation of the
      TLR9 ligand CpG in DCs. Specifically, PG545 treatment resulted in CpG
      accumulation in the lysosomal compartment of DCs, leading to enhanced production 
      of IL-12, which is essential for PG545-mediated NK cell activation. Overall,
      these results reveal that PG545 activates NK cells and that this activation is
      critical for the antitumor effect of PG545. Moreover, our findings may have
      important implications for improving NK cell-based antitumor therapies.

TI  - Loss of CD73-mediated actin polymerization promotes endometrial tumor
      progression.
PG  - 220-38
LID - 10.1172/JCI79380 [doi]
LID - 79380 [pii]
AB  - Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is central to the generation of extracellular
      adenosine. Previous studies have highlighted a detrimental role for extracellular
      adenosine in cancer, as it dampens T cell-mediated immune responses. Here, we
      determined that, in contrast to other cancers, CD73 is markedly downregulated in 
      poorly differentiated and advanced-stage endometrial carcinoma compared with
      levels in normal endometrium and low-grade tumors. In murine models, CD73
      deficiency led to a loss of endometrial epithelial barrier function, and
      pharmacological CD73 inhibition increased in vitro migration and invasion of
      endometrial carcinoma cells. Given that CD73-generated adenosine is central to
      regulating tissue protection and physiology in normal tissues, we hypothesized
      that CD73-generated adenosine in endometrial carcinoma induces an innate reflex
      to protect epithelial integrity. CD73 associated with cell-cell contacts,
      filopodia, and membrane zippers, indicative of involvement in cell-cell adhesion 
      and actin polymerization-dependent processes. We determined that CD73-generated
      adenosine induces cortical actin polymerization via adenosine A1 receptor (A1R)
      induction of a Rho GTPase CDC42-dependent conformational change of the
      actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (ARP2/3) actin polymerization complex member
      N-WASP. Cortical F-actin elevation increased membrane E-cadherin, beta-catenin,
      and Na(+)K(+) ATPase. Together, these findings reveal that CD73-generated
      adenosine promotes epithelial integrity and suggest why loss of CD73 in
      endometrial cancer allows for tumor progression. Moreover, our data indicate that
      the role of CD73 in cancer is more complex than previously described.

LID - 83840 [pii]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients show abnormalities in early B cell tolerance
      checkpoints, resulting in the accumulation of large numbers of autoreactive B
      cells in their blood. Treatment with rituximab, an anti-CD20 mAb that depletes B 
      cells, has been shown to preserve beta cell function in T1D patients and improve 
      other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
      However, it remains largely unknown how anti-B cell therapy thwarts autoimmunity 
      in these pathologies. Here, we analyzed the reactivity of Abs expressed by
      single, mature naive B cells from 4 patients with T1D before and 52 weeks after
      treatment to determine whether rituximab resets early B cell tolerance
      checkpoints. We found that anti-B cell therapy did not alter the frequencies of
      autoreactive and polyreactive B cells, which remained elevated in the blood of
      all patients after rituximab treatment. Moreover, the limited proliferative
      history of autoreactive B cells after treatment revealed that these clones were
      newly generated B cells and not self-reactive B cells that had escaped depletion 
      and repopulated the periphery through homeostatic expansion. We conclude that
      anti-B cell therapy may provide a temporary dampening of autoimmune processes
      through B cell depletion. However, repletion with autoreactive B cells may
      explain the relapse that occurs in many autoimmune patients after anti-B cell
      therapy.

AB  - HDL from healthy humans and lean mice inhibits palmitate-induced adipocyte
      inflammation; however, the effect of the inflammatory state on the functional
      properties of HDL on adipocytes is unknown. Here, we found that HDL from mice
      injected with AgNO3 fails to inhibit palmitate-induced inflammation and reduces
      cholesterol efflux from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, HDL isolated from obese mice
      with moderate inflammation and humans with systemic lupus erythematosus had
      similar effects. Since serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations in HDL increase with 
      inflammation, we investigated whether elevated SAA is a causal factor in HDL
      dysfunction. HDL from AgNO3-injected mice lacking Saa1.1 and Saa2.1 exhibited a
      partial restoration of antiinflammatory and cholesterol efflux properties in
      adipocytes. Conversely, incorporation of SAA into HDL preparations reduced
      antiinflammatory properties but not to the same extent as HDL from AgNO3-injected
      mice. SAA-enriched HDL colocalized with cell surface-associated extracellular
      matrix (ECM) of adipocytes, suggesting impaired access to the plasma membrane.
      Enzymatic digestion of proteoglycans in the ECM restored the ability of
      SAA-containing HDL to inhibit palmitate-induced inflammation and cholesterol
      efflux. Collectively, these findings indicate that inflammation results in a loss
      of the antiinflammatory properties of HDL on adipocytes, which appears to
      partially result from the SAA component of HDL binding to cell-surface
      proteoglycans, thereby preventing access of HDL to the plasma membrane.

TI  - POPDC1(S201F) causes muscular dystrophy and arrhythmia by affecting protein
      trafficking.

AB  - The Popeye domain-containing 1 (POPDC1) gene encodes a plasma membrane-localized 
      cAMP-binding protein that is abundantly expressed in striated muscle. In animal
      models, POPDC1 is an essential regulator of structure and function of cardiac and
      skeletal muscle; however, POPDC1 mutations have not been associated with human
      cardiac and muscular diseases. Here, we have described a homozygous missense
      variant (c.602C>T, p.S201F) in POPDC1, identified by whole-exome sequencing, in a
      family of 4 with cardiac arrhythmia and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD).
      This allele was absent in known databases and segregated with the pathological
      phenotype in this family. We did not find the allele in a further screen of 104
      patients with a similar phenotype, suggesting this mutation to be family
      specific. Compared with WT protein, POPDC1(S201F) displayed a 50% reduction in
      cAMP affinity, and in skeletal muscle from patients, both POPDC1(S201F) and WT
      POPDC2 displayed impaired membrane trafficking. Forced expression of
      POPDC1(S201F) in a murine cardiac muscle cell line (HL-1) increased
      hyperpolarization and upstroke velocity of the action potential. In zebrafish,
      expression of the homologous mutation (popdc1(S191F)) caused heart and skeletal
      muscle phenotypes that resembled those observed in patients. Our study therefore 
      identifies POPDC1 as a disease gene causing a very rare autosomal recessive
      cardiac arrhythmia and LGMD, expanding the genetic causes of this heterogeneous
      group of inherited rare diseases.

PG  - 169-80

LID - 82066 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrence and/or metastasis occurs in more than half of patients
      with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and these events pose the
      greatest threats to long-term survival. We set out to identify genetic
      alterations that underlie recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. METHODS: Whole-exome
      sequencing (WES) was performed on genomic DNA extracted from fresh-frozen whole
      blood and patient-matched tumor pairs from 13 HNSCC patients with synchronous
      lymph node metastases and 10 patients with metachronous recurrent tumors.
      Mutational concordance within and between tumor pairs was used to analyze the
      spatiotemporal evolution of HNSCC in individual patients and to identify
      potential therapeutic targets for functional evaluation. RESULTS: Approximately
      86% and 60% of single somatic nucleotide variants (SSNVs) identified in
      synchronous nodal metastases and metachronous recurrent tumors, respectively,
      were transmitted from the primary index tumor. Genes that were mutated in more
      than one metastatic or recurrent tumor, but not in the respective primary tumors,
      include C17orf104, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 3 (ITPR3), and
      discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2). Select DDR2 mutations have
      been shown to confer enhanced sensitivity to SRC-family kinase (SFK) inhibitors
      in other malignancies. Similarly, HNSCC cell lines harboring endogenous and
      engineered DDR2 mutations were more sensitive to the SFK inhibitor dasatinib than
      those with WT DDR2. CONCLUSION: In this WES study of patient-matched tumor pairs 
      in HNSCC, we found synchronous lymph node metastases to be genetically more
      similar to their paired index primary tumors than metachronous recurrent tumors. 
      This study outlines a compendium of somatic mutations in primary, metastatic,
      and/or recurrent HNSCC cancers, with potential implications for precision
      medicine approaches. FUNDING: National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society,

TI  - TRAF6 regulates satellite stem cell self-renewal and function during regenerative
      myogenesis.
PG  - 151-68
LID - 10.1172/JCI81655 [doi]
LID - 81655 [pii]
AB  - Satellite cells are a stem cell population within adult muscle and are
      responsible for myofiber regeneration upon injury. Satellite cell dysfunction has
      been shown to underlie the loss of skeletal muscle mass in many acquired and
      genetic muscle disorders. The transcription factor paired box-protein-7 (PAX7) is
      indispensable for supplementing the reservoir of satellite cells and driving
      regeneration in normal and diseased muscle. TNF receptor-associated factor 6
      (TRAF6) is an adaptor protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the
      activation of multiple cell signaling pathways in a context-dependent manner.
      Here, we demonstrated that TRAF6-mediated signaling is critical for homeostasis
      of satellite cells and their function during regenerative myogenesis. Selective
      deletion of Traf6 in satellite cells of adult mice led to profound muscle
      regeneration defects and dramatically reduced levels of PAX7 and late myogenesis 
      markers. TRAF6 was required for the activation of MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which 
      in turn activated the transcription factor c-JUN, which binds the Pax7 promoter
      and augments Pax7 expression. Moreover, TRAF6/c-JUN signaling repressed the
      levels of the microRNAs miR-1 and miR-206, which promote differentiation, to
      maintain PAX7 levels in satellite cells. We also determined that satellite
      cell-specific deletion of Traf6 exaggerates the dystrophic phenotype in the mdx
      (a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy) mouse by blunting the regeneration
      of injured myofibers. Collectively, our study reveals an essential role for TRAF6
      in satellite stem cell function.

PG  - 195-206
LID - 10.1172/JCI84015 [doi]
LID - 84015 [pii]
AB  - RNA splicing is a major contributor to total transcriptome complexity; however,
      the functional role and regulation of splicing in heart failure remain poorly
      understood. Here, we used a total transcriptome profiling and bioinformatic
      analysis approach and identified a muscle-specific isoform of an RNA splicing
      regulator, RBFox1 (also known as A2BP1), as a prominent regulator of alternative 
      RNA splicing during heart failure. Evaluation of developing murine and zebrafish 
      hearts revealed that RBFox1 is induced during postnatal cardiac maturation.
      However, we found that RBFox1 is markedly diminished in failing human and mouse
      hearts. In a mouse model, RBFox1 deficiency in the heart promoted pressure
      overload-induced heart failure. We determined that RBFox1 is a potent regulator
      of RNA splicing and is required for a conserved splicing process of transcription
      factor MEF2 family members that yields different MEF2 isoforms with differential 
      effects on cardiac hypertrophic gene expression. Finally, induction of RBFox1
      expression in murine pressure overload models substantially attenuated cardiac
      hypertrophy and pathological manifestations. Together, this study identifies
      regulation of RNA splicing by RBFox1 as an important player in transcriptome
      reprogramming during heart failure that influence pathogenesis of the disease.

AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a variable disease; therefore, markers to
      identify aggressive forms are essential for patient management. Here, we have
      shown that expression of the costimulatory molecule and microbial sensor SLAMF1
      (also known as CD150) is lost in a subset of patients with an aggressive CLL that
      associates with a shorter time to first treatment and reduced overall survival.
      SLAMF1 silencing in CLL-like Mec-1 cells, which constitutively express SLAMF1,
      modulated pathways related to cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and
      intracellular vesicle formation and recirculation. SLAMF1 deficiency associated
      with increased expression of CXCR4, CD38, and CD44, thereby positively affecting 
      chemotactic responses to CXCL12. SLAMF1 ligation with an agonistic monoclonal
      antibody increased ROS accumulation and induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK1/2,
      and BCL2, thereby promoting the autophagic flux. Beclin1 dissociated from BCL2 in
      response to SLAMF1 ligation, resulting in formation of the autophagy
      macrocomplex, which contains SLAMF1, beclin1, and the enzyme VPS34. Accordingly, 
      SLAMF1-silenced cells or SLAMF1(lo) primary CLL cells were resistant to
      autophagy-activating therapeutic agents, such as fludarabine and the BCL2
      homology domain 3 mimetic ABT-737. Together, these results indicate that loss of 
      SLAMF1 expression in CLL modulates genetic pathways that regulate chemotaxis and 
      autophagy and that potentially affect drug responses, and suggest that these
      effects underlie unfavorable clinical outcome experienced by SLAMF1(lo) patients.

PG  - 123-36
LID - 10.1172/JCI81108 [doi]
LID - 81108 [pii]
AB  - According to the neurovascular hypothesis, impairment of low-density lipoprotein 
      receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in brain capillaries of the blood-brain barrier
      (BBB) contributes to neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) brain accumulation and
      drives Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, due to conflicting reports on
      the involvement of LRP1 in Abeta transport and the expression of LRP1 in brain
      endothelium, the role of LRP1 at the BBB is uncertain. As global Lrp1 deletion in
      mice is lethal, appropriate models to study the function of LRP1 are lacking.
      Moreover, the relevance of systemic Abeta clearance to AD pathology remains
      unclear, as no BBB-specific knockout models have been available. Here, we
      developed transgenic mouse strains that allow for tamoxifen-inducible deletion of
      Lrp1 specifically within brain endothelial cells (Slco1c1-CreER(T2) Lrp1(fl/fl)
      mice) and used these mice to accurately evaluate LRP1-mediated Abeta BBB
      clearance in vivo. Selective deletion of Lrp1 in the brain endothelium of C57BL/6
      mice strongly reduced brain efflux of injected [125I] Abeta(1-42). Additionally, 
      in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, brain endothelial-specific Lrp1 deletion reduced 
      plasma Abeta levels and elevated soluble brain Abeta, leading to aggravated
      spatial learning and memory deficits, thus emphasizing the importance of systemic
      Abeta elimination via the BBB. Together, our results suggest that
      receptor-mediated Abeta BBB clearance may be a potential target for treatment and
      prevention of Abeta brain accumulation in AD.

PG  - 137-50

LID - 81542 [pii]
AB  - E2F transcription factors are known regulators of the cell cycle, proliferation, 
      apoptosis, and differentiation. Here, we reveal that E2F1 plays an essential role
      in liver physiopathology through the regulation of glycolysis and lipogenesis. We
      demonstrate that E2F1 deficiency leads to a decrease in glycolysis and de novo
      synthesis of fatty acids in hepatocytes. We further demonstrate that E2F1
      directly binds to the promoters of key lipogenic genes, including Fasn, but does 
      not bind directly to genes encoding glycolysis pathway components, suggesting an 
      indirect effect. In murine models, E2F1 expression and activity increased in
      response to feeding and upon insulin stimulation through canonical activation of 
      the CDK4/pRB pathway. Moreover, E2F1 expression was increased in liver biopsies
      from obese, glucose-intolerant humans compared with biopsies from lean subjects. 
      Finally, E2f1 deletion completely abrogated hepatic steatosis in different murine
      models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In conclusion, our data
      demonstrate that E2F1 regulates lipid synthesis and glycolysis and thus
      contributes to the development of liver pathology.

TI  - Ultrasound ablation enhances drug accumulation and survival in mammary carcinoma 
      models.
PG  - 99-111
LID - 10.1172/JCI83312 [doi]
LID - 83312 [pii]
AB  - Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) facilitates noninvasive
      image-guided conformal thermal therapy of cancer. Yet in many scenarios, the
      sensitive tissues surrounding the tumor constrain the margins of ablation;
      therefore, augmentation of MRgFUS with chemotherapy may be required to destroy
      remaining tumor. Here, we used 64Cu-PET-CT, MRI, autoradiography, and
      fluorescence imaging to track the kinetics of long-circulating liposomes in
      immunocompetent mammary carcinoma-bearing FVB/n and BALB/c mice. We observed a
      5-fold and 50-fold enhancement of liposome and drug concentration, respectively, 
      within MRgFUS thermal ablation-treated tumors along with dense accumulation
      within the surrounding tissue rim. Ultrasound-enhanced drug accumulation was
      rapid and durable and greatly increased total tumor drug exposure over time. In
      addition, we found that the small molecule gadoteridol accumulates around and
      within ablated tissue. We further demonstrated that dilated vasculature, loss of 
      vascular integrity resulting in extravasation of blood cells, stromal
      inflammation, and loss of cell-cell adhesion and tissue architecture all
      contribute to the enhanced accumulation of the liposomes and small molecule
      probe. The locally enhanced liposome accumulation was preserved even after a
      multiweek protocol of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes and partial ablation. Finally,
      by supplementing ablation with concurrent liposomal drug therapy, a complete and 
      durable response was obtained using protocols for which a sub-mm rim of tumor
      remained after ablation.

TI  - Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated MDM4 exon 6 skipping impairs tumor growth.
PG  - 68-84
LID - 10.1172/JCI82534 [doi]
LID - 82534 [pii]
AB  - MDM4 is a promising target for cancer therapy, as it is undetectable in most
      normal adult tissues but often upregulated in cancer cells to dampen p53
      tumor-suppressor function. The mechanisms that underlie MDM4 upregulation in
      cancer cells are largely unknown. Here, we have shown that this key oncogenic
      event mainly depends on a specific alternative splicing switch. We determined
      that while a nonsense-mediated, decay-targeted isoform of MDM4 (MDM4-S) is
      produced in normal adult tissues as a result of exon 6 skipping, enhanced exon 6 
      inclusion leads to expression of full-length MDM4 in a large number of human
      cancers. Although this alternative splicing event is likely regulated by multiple
      splicing factors, we identified the SRSF3 oncoprotein as a key enhancer of exon 6
      inclusion. In multiple human melanoma cell lines and in melanoma patient-derived 
      xenograft (PDX) mouse models, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated (ASO-mediated)
      skipping of exon 6 decreased MDM4 abundance, inhibited melanoma growth, and
      enhanced sensitivity to MAPK-targeting therapeutics. Additionally, ASO-based MDM4
      targeting reduced diffuse large B cell lymphoma PDX growth. As full-length MDM4
      is enhanced in multiple human tumors, our data indicate that this strategy is
      applicable to a wide range of tumor types. We conclude that enhanced MDM4 exon 6 
      inclusion is a common oncogenic event and has potential as a clinically
      compatible therapeutic target.

AB  - The DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B are primarily responsible for de
      novo methylation of specific cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides during
      mammalian development. While loss-of-function mutations in DNMT3A are highly
      recurrent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DNMT3A mutations are almost never
      found in AML patients with translocations that create oncogenic fusion genes such
      as PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and MLL-AF9. Here, we explored how DNMT3A is involved
      in the function of these fusion genes. We used retroviral vectors to express
      PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, or MLL-AF9 in bone marrow cells derived from WT or
      DNMT3A-deficient mice. Additionally, we examined the phenotypes of hematopoietic 
      cells from Ctsg-PML-RARA mice, which express PML-RARA in early hematopoietic
      progenitors and myeloid precursors, with or without DNMT3A. We determined that
      the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, is required for
      aberrant PML-RARA-driven self-renewal ex vivo and that DNMT3A is dispensable for 
      RUNX1-RUNX1T1- and MLL-AF9-driven self-renewal. Furthermore, both the
      PML-RARA-driven competitive transplantation advantage and development of acute
      promyelocytic leukemia (APL) required DNMT3A. Together, these findings suggest
      that PML-RARA requires DNMT3A to initiate APL in mice.

AB  - Vascular oxidative injury accompanies many common conditions associated with
      hypertension. In the present study, we employed mouse models with excessive
      vascular production of ROS (tg(sm/p22phox) mice, which overexpress the NADPH
      oxidase subunit p22(phox) in smooth muscle, and mice with vascular-specific
      deletion of extracellular SOD) and have shown that these animals develop vascular
      collagen deposition, aortic stiffening, renal dysfunction, and hypertension with 
      age. T cells from tg(sm/p22phox) mice produced high levels of IL-17A and
      IFN-gamma. Crossing tg(sm/p22phox) mice with lymphocyte-deficient Rag1(-/-) mice 
      eliminated vascular inflammation, aortic stiffening, renal dysfunction, and
      hypertension; however, adoptive transfer of T cells restored these processes.
      Isoketal-protein adducts, which are immunogenic, were increased in aortas, DCs,
      and macrophages of tg(sm/p22phox) mice. Autologous pulsing with tg(sm/p22phox)
      aortic homogenates promoted DCs of tg(sm/p22phox) mice to stimulate T cell
      proliferation and production of IFN-gamma, IL-17A, and TNF-alpha. Treatment with 
      the superoxide scavenger tempol or the isoketal scavenger 2-hydroxybenzylamine
      (2-HOBA) normalized blood pressure; prevented vascular inflammation, aortic
      stiffening, and hypertension; and prevented DC and T cell activation. Moreover,
      in human aortas, the aortic content of isoketal adducts correlated with fibrosis 
      and inflammation severity. Together, these results define a pathway linking
      vascular oxidant stress to immune activation and aortic stiffening and provide
      insight into the systemic inflammation encountered in common vascular diseases.

TI  - G(q/11)alpha and G(s)alpha mediate distinct physiological responses to central
      melanocortins.
PG  - 40-9
LID - 10.1172/JCI76348 [doi]
LID - 76348 [pii]
AB  - Activation of brain melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4Rs) leads to reduced food
      intake, increased energy expenditure, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced 
      linear growth. MC4R effects on energy expenditure and glucose metabolism are
      primarily mediated by the G protein G(s)alpha in brain regions outside of the
      paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). However, the G protein(s) that
      is involved in MC4R-mediated suppression of food intake and linear growth, which 
      are believed to be regulated primarily though action in the PVN, is unknown.
      Here, we show that PVN-specific loss of G(q)alpha and G11alpha, which stimulate
      PLC, leads to severe hyperphagic obesity, increased linear growth, and
      inactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, without affecting energy
      expenditure or glucose metabolism. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ability of
      an MC4R agonist delivered to PVN to inhibit food intake is lost in mice lacking
      G(q/11)alpha in the PVN but not in animals deficient for G(s)alpha. The blood
      pressure response to the same MC4R agonist was only lost in animals lacking
      G(s)alpha specifically in the PVN. Together, our results exemplify how different 
      physiological effects of GPCRs may be mediated by different G proteins and
      identify a pathway for appetite regulation that could be selectively targeted by 
      G(q/11)alpha-biased MC4R agonists as a potential treatment for obesity.

PG  - 112-22
LID - 10.1172/JCI84669 [doi]
LID - 84669 [pii]
AB  - Increased sodium influx via incomplete inactivation of the major cardiac sodium
      channel Na(V)1.5 is correlated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation
      (AF) in humans. Here, we sought to determine whether increased sodium entry is
      sufficient to cause the structural and electrophysiological perturbations that
      are required to initiate and sustain AF. We used mice expressing a human Na(V)1.5
      variant with a mutation in the anesthetic-binding site (F1759A-Na(V)1.5) and
      demonstrated that incomplete Na+ channel inactivation is sufficient to drive
      structural alterations, including atrial and ventricular enlargement, myofibril
      disarray, fibrosis and mitochondrial injury, and electrophysiological
      dysfunctions that together lead to spontaneous and prolonged episodes of AF in
      these mice. Using this model, we determined that the increase in a persistent
      sodium current causes heterogeneously prolonged action potential duration and
      rotors, as well as wave and wavelets in the atria, and thereby mimics mechanistic
      theories that have been proposed for AF in humans. Acute inhibition of the
      sodium-calcium exchanger, which targets the downstream effects of enhanced sodium
      entry, markedly reduced the burden of AF and ventricular arrhythmias in this
      model, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for AF. Together, our results 
      indicate that these mice will be important for assessing the cellular mechanisms 
      and potential effectiveness of antiarrhythmic therapies.
