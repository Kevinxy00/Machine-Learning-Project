TI  - Semantic representation in the white matter pathway.

AB  - Object conceptual processing has been localized to distributed cortical regions
      that represent specific attributes. A challenging question is how object semantic
      space is formed. We tested a novel framework of representing semantic space in
      the pattern of white matter (WM) connections by extending the representational
      similarity analysis (RSA) to structural lesion pattern and behavioral data in 80 
      brain-damaged patients. For each WM connection, a neural representational
      dissimilarity matrix (RDM) was computed by first building machine-learning models
      with the voxel-wise WM lesion patterns as features to predict naming performance 
      of a particular item and then computing the correlation between the predicted
      naming score and the actual naming score of another item in the testing patients.
      This correlation was used to build the neural RDM based on the assumption that if
      the connection pattern contains certain aspects of information shared by the
      naming processes of these two items, models trained with one item should also
      predict naming accuracy of the other. Correlating the neural RDM with various
      cognitive RDMs revealed that neural patterns in several WM connections that
      connect left occipital/middle temporal regions and anterior temporal regions
      associated with the object semantic space. Such associations were not
      attributable to modality-specific attributes (shape, manipulation, color, and
      motion), to peripheral picture-naming processes (picture visual similarity,
      phonological similarity), to broad semantic categories, or to the properties of
      the cortical regions that they connected, which tended to represent multiple
      modality-specific attributes. That is, the semantic space could be represented
      through WM connection patterns across cortical regions representing
      modality-specific attributes.

TI  - Ultrastructural localisation of protein interactions using conditionally stable
      nanobodies.
PG  - e2005473
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473 [doi]
AB  - We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for
      high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by
      electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding
      nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a
      cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate
      peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently
      labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas
      unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly 
      simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and
      eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled
      and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this
      system to bimolecular complementation ('EM split-fluorescent protein'), for
      localisation of protein-protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.

TI  - Amino acid starvation sensing dampens IL-1beta production by activating
      riboclustering and autophagy.
PG  - e2005317
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005317 [doi]
AB  - Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and
      acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the
      underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR
      pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the
      proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and provides protection
      from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1beta through general
      control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)-dependent activation of the
      cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting
      of IL-1beta mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster
      complexes-such as stress granules (SGs)-via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins
      (RBPs) T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1-related (TIAR),
      which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted 
      in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with
      IL-1beta production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through
      suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a
      novel mechanism by which IL-1beta is regulated by AAR and further suggests that
      administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against
      inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Degenerate time-dependent network dynamics anticipate seizures in human epileptic
      brain.
PG  - e2002580
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002580 [doi]
AB  - Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While 
      some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding
      of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still 
      lacking. Here, we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated
      by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our
      analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from a
      group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which
      time-dependent network states become less variable ("degenerate"), and this phase
      is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset.
      This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly
      correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the 
      activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome.
      Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2
      sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.

TI  - Preclinical efficacy studies in investigator brochures: Do they enable
      risk-benefit assessment?
PG  - e2004879
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004879 [doi]
AB  - Human protection policies require favorable risk-benefit judgments prior to
      launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment 
      often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic 
      investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented
      for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties 
      of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3
      institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years
      2010-2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for
      their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether 
      they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results.
      Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs
      described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization,
      sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no
      reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an
      outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were
      described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for
      phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the
      strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs
      that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting
      biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk-benefit evaluation during
      ethical review of phase I/II studies.

PG  - e2005282
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282 [doi]
AB  - Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or
      units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the
      entity-intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis
      of statistical inference. If the wrong entity-intervention pair is chosen, an
      experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample
      of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were
      applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory
      authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found
      that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17%-29%) replicated the correct
      entity-intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half 
      of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38%-53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 
      26%-39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication
      artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific
      claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between
      biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where
      replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and
      provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.

AB  - Meta-research is research about research. Meta-research may not be as
      click-worthy as a meta-pug-a pug dog dressed up in a pug costume-but it is
      crucial to understanding research. A particularly valuable contribution of
      meta-research is to identify biases in a body of evidence. Bias can occur in the 
      design, conduct, or publication of research and is a systematic deviation from
      the truth in results or inferences. The findings of meta-research can tell us
      which evidence to trust and what must be done to improve future research. We
      should be using meta-research to provide the evidence base for implementing
      systemic changes to improve research, not for discrediting it.

AB  - With over 1 million species on earth, each biologically unique, do we have any
      hope of understanding whether species will persist in a warming world? We might, 
      because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming
      accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge
      has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of
      species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature
      but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the
      effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with
      general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.

AB  - How do we rapidly process incoming streams of information in working memory, a
      cognitive mechanism central to human behavior? Dominant views of working memory
      focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but human hippocampal recordings provide a 
      neurophysiological signature distinct from the PFC. Are these regions
      independent, or do they interact in the service of working memory? We addressed
      this core issue in behavior by recording directly from frontotemporal sites in
      humans performing a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the
      types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. Theta
      band oscillations drove bidirectional interactions between the PFC and medial
      temporal lobe (MTL; including the hippocampus). MTL theta oscillations directed
      the PFC preferentially during the processing of spatiotemporal information, while
      PFC theta oscillations directed the MTL for all types of information being
      processed in working memory. These findings reveal an MTL theta mechanism for
      processing space and time and a domain-general PFC theta mechanism, providing
      evidence that rapid, dynamic MTL-PFC interactions underlie working memory for
      everyday experiences.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition driven by loss of
      homeostasis between the mucosal immune system, the commensal gut microbiota, and 
      the intestinal epithelium. Our goal is to understand how these components of the 
      intestinal ecosystem cooperate to control homeostasis. By combining quantitative 
      measures of epithelial hyperplasia and immune infiltration with multivariate
      analysis of inter- and intracellular signaling, we identified epithelial
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a potential driver of
      inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition
      revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn
      controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, 
      we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of
      bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study
      suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature 
      of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory
      cytokines.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004089 [doi]
AB  - Assessment of researchers is necessary for decisions of hiring, promotion, and
      tenure. A burgeoning number of scientific leaders believe the current system of
      faculty incentives and rewards is misaligned with the needs of society and
      disconnected from the evidence about the causes of the reproducibility crisis and
      suboptimal quality of the scientific publication record. To address this issue,
      particularly for the clinical and life sciences, we convened a 22-member expert
      panel workshop in Washington, DC, in January 2017. Twenty-two academic leaders,
      funders, and scientists participated in the meeting. As background for the
      meeting, we completed a selective literature review of 22 key documents
      critiquing the current incentive system. From each document, we extracted how the
      authors perceived the problems of assessing science and scientists, the
      unintended consequences of maintaining the status quo for assessing scientists,
      and details of their proposed solutions. The resulting table was used as a seed
      for participant discussion. This resulted in six principles for assessing
      scientists and associated research and policy implications. We hope the content
      of this paper will serve as a basis for establishing best practices and
      redesigning the current approaches to assessing scientists by the many players
      involved in that process.

TI  - Identifying off-target effects of etomoxir reveals that carnitine
      palmitoyltransferase I is essential for cancer cell proliferation independent of 
      beta-oxidation.
PG  - e2003782
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003782 [doi]
AB  - It has been suggested that some cancer cells rely upon fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
      for energy. Here we show that when FAO was reduced approximately 90% by
      pharmacological inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) with low
      concentrations of etomoxir, the proliferation rate of various cancer cells was
      unaffected. Efforts to pharmacologically inhibit FAO more than 90% revealed that 
      high concentrations of etomoxir (200 muM) have an off-target effect of inhibiting
      complex I of the electron transport chain. Surprisingly, however, when FAO was
      reduced further by genetic knockdown of CPT1, the proliferation rate of these
      same cells decreased nearly 2-fold and could not be restored by acetate or
      octanoic acid supplementation. Moreover, CPT1 knockdowns had altered
      mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitochondrial coupling, whereas cells in
      which CPT1 had been approximately 90% inhibited by etomoxir did not. Lipidomic
      profiling of mitochondria isolated from CPT1 knockdowns showed depleted
      concentrations of complex structural and signaling lipids. Additionally,
      expression of a catalytically dead CPT1 in CPT1 knockdowns did not restore
      mitochondrial coupling. Taken together, these results suggest that transport of
      at least some long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria by CPT1 may be
      required for anabolic processes that support healthy mitochondrial function and
      cancer cell proliferation independent of FAO.

TI  - Effects of multiple sources of genetic drift on pathogen variation within hosts.

AB  - Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread 
      of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and
      public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen
      variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen
      population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale-such
      as within hosts or between hosts-or by making drastic simplifying assumptions,
      for example, that host immune systems can be ignored or that transmission
      bottlenecks are complete. Moreover, previous studies have used genetic data to
      infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift
      imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We 
      first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth
      baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts.
      We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within
      each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally,
      we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host-pathogen population
      dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We
      found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales-including within
      hosts, between hosts, and between years-it can accurately reproduce the data, but
      when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks
      and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de
      novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the
      data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining
      pathogen variation and that mathematical models that account for pathogen
      population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to
      explain this variation.

TI  - Autophagy is essential for maintaining the growth of a human (mini-)organ:
      Evidence from scalp hair follicle organ culture.
PG  - e2002864
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular
      processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development,
      and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly
      understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the
      efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a
      complete, cyclically remodelling (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp
      hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter
      into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a
      model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of
      organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation
      of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62)
      proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of
      the autophagy. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic
      inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti-hair
      loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen
      prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human
      hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent
      preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue
      physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate
      autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.

TI  - Rapid evolution of a voltage-gated sodium channel gene in a lineage of electric
      fish leads to a persistent sodium current.
PG  - e2004892
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004892 [doi]
AB  - Most weakly electric fish navigate and communicate by sensing electric signals
      generated by their muscle-derived electric organs. Adults of one lineage
      (Apteronotidae), which discharge their electric organs in excess of 1 kHz,
      instead have an electric organ derived from the axons of specialized spinal
      neurons (electromotorneurons [EMNs]). EMNs fire spontaneously and are the
      fastest-firing neurons known. This biophysically extreme phenotype depends upon a
      persistent sodium current, the molecular underpinnings of which remain unknown.
      We show that a skeletal muscle-specific sodium channel gene duplicated in this
      lineage and, within approximately 2 million years, began expressing in the spinal
      cord, a novel site of expression for this isoform. Concurrently, amino acid
      replacements that cause a persistent sodium current accumulated in the regions of
      the channel underlying inactivation. Therefore, a novel adaptation allowing
      extreme neuronal firing arose from the duplication, change in expression, and
      rapid sequence evolution of a muscle-expressing sodium channel gene.

      assay.
PG  - e2003904
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003904 [doi]
AB  - The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol 
      (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring.
      There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have
      been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a
      3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly 
      triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated
      that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number 
      of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids.
      Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that
      e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated
      that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was
      likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher
      toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization
      revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not
      triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available 
      searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available
      e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of
      this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity 
      of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to
      enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate
      e-liquid composition.

AB  - In Europe, responsible research and innovation (RRI) has emerged as a science
      policy measure that demands the early integration of a broad range of social
      actors and perspectives into research and development (R&D). More collaboration
      of the social sciences and humanities (SSH) with science and engineering appears 
      within this policy framework as a crucial element that will enable better
      technological development. However, RRI is new to both natural scientists and SSH
      scholars, and interdisciplinary collaborations are challenging for many reasons. 
      In this paper, we discuss these challenges while suggesting that what RRI can be 
      in a particular project is not a given but remains an empirical question. Natural
      scientists and SSH scholars need to coresearch RRI in an experimental mode.

AB  - Vocal development is usually studied from the perspective of neuroscience. In
      this issue, Zhang and Ghazanfar propose a way in which body growth might
      condition the process. They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a
      wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that
      mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that
      occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the
      nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration. This work
      illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.

TI  - Inflammation arising from obesity reduces taste bud abundance and inhibits
      renewal.
PG  - e2001959
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001959 [doi]
AB  - Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be
      rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the
      molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo
      continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a
      few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death.
      Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We
      demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the
      number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice-and is likely the cause of
      taste dysfunction seen in obese populations-by upsetting this balance of renewal 
      and cell death.

TI  - Memory instability as a gateway to generalization.
PG  - e2004633
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004633 [doi]
AB  - Our present frequently resembles our past. Patterns of actions and events repeat 
      throughout our lives like a motif. Identifying and exploiting these patterns are 
      fundamental to many behaviours, from creating grammar to the application of skill
      across diverse situations. Such generalization may be dependent upon memory
      instability. Following their formation, memories are unstable and able to
      interact with one another, allowing, at least in principle, common features to be
      extracted. Exploiting these common features creates generalized knowledge that
      can be applied across varied circumstances. Memory instability explains many of
      the biological and behavioural conditions necessary for generalization and offers
      predictions for how generalization is produced.

PG  - e2005245
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005245 [doi]
AB  - Microbiome science is revealing that the phenotype and health of animals,
      including humans, depend on the sustained function of their resident
      microorganisms. In this essay, I argue for thoughtful choice of model systems for
      human microbiome science. A greater variety of experimental systems, including
      wider use of invertebrate models, would benefit biomedical research, while
      systems ill-suited to experimental and genetic manipulation can be used to
      address very limited sets of scientific questions. Microbiome science benefits
      from the coordinated use of multiple systems, which is facilitated by networks of
      researchers with expertise in different experimental systems.

TI  - A population genetic interpretation of GWAS findings for human quantitative
      traits.
PG  - e2002985
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002985 [doi]
AB  - Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic
      architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and 
      effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To
      interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is
      shaped by basic population genetics processes-notably, by mutation, natural
      selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to
      stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often 
      affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that
      arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve
      the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state
      and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic
      architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing
      heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution
      of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a
      simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected
      contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait.
      We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass
      index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences
      about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our
      findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable
      variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in
      explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic
      history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further 
      find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that 
      arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with
      selection coefficients around s = 10-3.

TI  - Negative regulation of amino acid signaling by MAPK-regulated 4F2hc/Girdin
      complex.
PG  - e2005090
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005090 [doi]
AB  - Amino acid signaling mediated by the activation of mechanistic target of
      rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is fundamental to cell growth and metabolism.
      However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely
      unknown. Here, we show that interaction between 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a
      subunit of multiple amino acid transporters, and the multifunctional hub protein 
      girders of actin filaments (Girdin) down-regulates mTORC1 activity. 4F2hc
      interacts with Girdin in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and amino acid 
      signaling-dependent manners to translocate to the lysosome. The resultant
      decrease in cell surface 4F2hc leads to lowered cytoplasmic glutamine (Gln) and
      leucine (Leu) content, which down-regulates amino acid signaling. Consistently,
      Girdin depletion augments amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation and inhibits amino
      acid deprivation-induced autophagy. These findings uncovered the mechanism
      underlying negative regulation of amino acid signaling, which may play a role in 
      tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.

TI  - The speed of parietal theta frequency drives visuospatial working memory
      capacity.
PG  - e2005348
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005348 [doi]
AB  - The speed of theta brain oscillatory activity is thought to play a key role in
      determining working memory (WM) capacity. Individual differences in the length of
      a theta cycle (ranging between 4 and 7 Hz) might determine how many gamma cycles 
      (>30 Hz) can be nested into a theta wave. Gamma cycles are thought to represent
      single memory items; therefore, this interplay could determine individual memory 
      capacity. We directly tested this hypothesis by means of parietal transcranial
      alternating current stimulation (tACS) set at slower (4 Hz) and faster (7 Hz)
      theta frequencies during a visuospatial WM paradigm. Accordingly, we found that
      4-Hz tACS enhanced WM capacity, while 7-Hz tACS reduced WM capacity. Notably,
      these effects were found only for items presented to the hemifield contralateral 
      to the stimulation site. This provides causal evidence for a frequency-dependent 
      and spatially specific organization of WM storage, supporting the theta-gamma
      phase coupling theory of WM capacity.

TI  - Modifying and reacting to the environmental pH can drive bacterial interactions.
PG  - e2004248
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004248 [doi]
AB  - Microbes usually exist in communities consisting of myriad different but
      interacting species. These interactions are typically mediated through
      environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up
      resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves 
      and also other microbes. We show here that the way microbes modify their
      environment and react to it sets the interactions within single-species
      populations and also between different species. A very common environmental
      modification is a change of the environmental pH. We find experimentally that
      these pH changes create feedback loops that can determine the fate of bacterial
      populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases
      will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Understanding how single
      species change the pH and react to these changes allowed us to estimate their
      pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic
      interaction motifs-bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and
      stabilization-that may be independent of which environmental parameter is
      modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.

AB  - Spinal motoneurones (Mns) constitute the final output for the execution of motor 
      tasks. In addition to innervating muscles, Mns project excitatory collateral
      connections to Renshaw cells (RCs) and other Mns, but the latter have received
      little attention. We show that Mns receive strong synaptic input from other Mns
      throughout development and into maturity, with fast-type Mns systematically
      receiving greater recurrent excitation than slow-type Mns. Optical recordings
      show that activation of Mns in one spinal segment can propagate to adjacent
      segments even in the presence of intact recurrent inhibition. While it is known
      that transmission at the neuromuscular junction is purely cholinergic and RCs are
      excited through both acetylcholine and glutamate receptors, here we show that
      neurotransmission between Mns is purely glutamatergic, indicating that synaptic
      transmission systems are differentiated at different postsynaptic targets of Mns.

TI  - Early uneven ear input induces long-lasting differences in left-right motor
      function.
PG  - e2002988
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002988 [doi]
AB  - How asymmetries in motor behavior become established normally or atypically in
      mammals remains unclear. An established model for motor asymmetry that is
      conserved across mammals can be obtained by experimentally inducing asymmetric
      striatal dopamine activity. However, the factors that can cause motor asymmetries
      in the absence of experimental manipulations to the brain remain unknown. Here,
      we show that mice with inner ear dysfunction display a robust left or right
      rotational preference, and this motor preference reflects an atypical asymmetry
      in cortico-striatal neurotransmission. By unilaterally targeting striatal
      activity with an antagonist of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a
      downstream integrator of striatal neurotransmitter signaling, we can reverse or
      exaggerate rotational preference in these mice. By surgically biasing vestibular 
      failure to one ear, we can dictate the direction of motor preference,
      illustrating the influence of uneven vestibular failure in establishing the
      outward asymmetries in motor preference. The inner ear-induced striatal
      asymmetries identified here intersect with non-ear-induced asymmetries previously
      linked to lateralized motor behavior across species and suggest that aspects of
      left-right brain function in mammals can be ontogenetically influenced by inner
      ear input. Consistent with inner ear input contributing to motor asymmetry, we
      also show that, in humans with normal ear function, the motor-dominant
      hemisphere, measured as handedness, is ipsilateral to the ear with weaker
      vestibular input.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005468 [doi]
AB  - Meta-research is the study of research itself: its methods, reporting,
      reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Given that science is the key driver
      of human progress, improving the efficiency of scientific investigation and
      yielding more credible and more useful research results can translate to major
      benefits. The research enterprise grows very fast. Both new opportunities for
      knowledge and innovation and new threats to validity and scientific integrity
      emerge. Old biases abound, and new ones continuously appear as novel disciplines 
      emerge with different standards and challenges. Meta-research uses an
      interdisciplinary approach to study, promote, and defend robust science. Major
      disruptions are likely to happen in the way we pursue scientific investigation,
      and it is important to ensure that these disruptions are evidence based.

      Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.
PG  - e2001663
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001663 [doi]
AB  - Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight and the largest
      animals to ever take wing. The pterosaurs persisted for over 150 million years
      before disappearing at the end of the Cretaceous, but the patterns of and
      processes driving their extinction remain unclear. Only a single family,
      Azhdarchidae, is definitively known from the late Maastrichtian, suggesting a
      gradual decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous, with the
      Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction eliminating a few late-surviving species. 
      However, this apparent pattern may simply reflect poor sampling of fossils. Here,
      we describe a diverse pterosaur assemblage from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco
      that includes not only Azhdarchidae but the youngest known Pteranodontidae and
      Nyctosauridae. With 3 families and at least 7 species present, the assemblage
      represents the most diverse known Late Cretaceous pterosaur assemblage and
      dramatically increases the diversity of Maastrichtian pterosaurs. At least 3
      families-Pteranodontidae, Nyctosauridae, and Azhdarchidae-persisted into the late
      Maastrichtian. Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs show increased niche occupation
      relative to earlier, Santonian-Campanian faunas and successfully outcompeted
      birds at large sizes. These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of
      pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.

TI  - The Plasmodium falciparum transcriptome in severe malaria reveals altered
      expression of genes involved in important processes including surface
      antigen-encoding var genes.

AB  - Within the human host, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is exposed to
      multiple selection pressures. The host environment changes dramatically in severe
      malaria, but the extent to which the parasite responds to-or is selected by-this 
      environment remains unclear. From previous studies, the parasites that cause
      severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined
      subset of the PfEMP1 variant, surface antigens. PfEMP1s are major targets of
      protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyse gene
      expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria
      in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with
      severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without
      activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably
      transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface
      expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone
      proteins. Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity 
      and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed
      all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and
      severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets
      for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to-or are selected
      by-the host environment in severe malaria.

TI  - Perceptually relevant speech tracking in auditory and motor cortex reflects
      distinct linguistic features.
PG  - e2004473
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004473 [doi]
AB  - During online speech processing, our brain tracks the acoustic fluctuations in
      speech at different timescales. Previous research has focused on generic
      timescales (for example, delta or theta bands) that are assumed to map onto
      linguistic features such as prosody or syllables. However, given the high
      intersubject variability in speaking patterns, such a generic association between
      the timescales of brain activity and speech properties can be ambiguous. Here, we
      analyse speech tracking in source-localised magnetoencephalographic data by
      directly focusing on timescales extracted from statistical regularities in our
      speech material. This revealed widespread significant tracking at the timescales 
      of phrases (0.6-1.3 Hz), words (1.8-3 Hz), syllables (2.8-4.8 Hz), and phonemes
      (8-12.4 Hz). Importantly, when examining its perceptual relevance, we found
      stronger tracking for correctly comprehended trials in the left premotor (PM)
      cortex at the phrasal scale as well as in left middle temporal cortex at the word
      scale. Control analyses using generic bands confirmed that these effects were
      specific to the speech regularities in our stimuli. Furthermore, we found that
      the phase at the phrasal timescale coupled to power at beta frequency (13-30 Hz) 
      in motor areas. This cross-frequency coupling presumably reflects top-down
      temporal prediction in ongoing speech perception. Together, our results reveal
      specific functional and perceptually relevant roles of distinct tracking and
      cross-frequency processes along the auditory-motor pathway.

TI  - Cell signaling heterogeneity is modulated by both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic
      mechanisms: An integrated approach to understanding targeted therapy.
PG  - e2002930
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002930 [doi]
AB  - During the last decade, our understanding of cancer cell signaling networks has
      significantly improved, leading to the development of various targeted therapies 
      that have elicited profound but, unfortunately, short-lived responses. This is,
      in part, due to the fact that these targeted therapies ignore context and average
      out heterogeneity. Here, we present a mathematical framework that addresses the
      impact of signaling heterogeneity on targeted therapy outcomes. We employ a
      simplified oncogenic rat sarcoma (RAS)-driven mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling
      pathway in lung cancer as an experimental model system and develop a network
      model of the pathway. We measure how inhibition of the pathway modulates protein 
      phosphorylation as well as cell viability under different microenvironmental
      conditions. Training the model on this data using Monte Carlo simulation results 
      in a suite of in silico cells whose relative protein activities and cell
      viability match experimental observation. The calibrated model predicts
      distributional responses to kinase inhibitors and suggests drug resistance
      mechanisms that can be exploited in drug combination strategies. The suggested
      combination strategies are validated using in vitro experimental data. The
      validated in silico cells are further interrogated through an unsupervised
      clustering analysis and then integrated into a mathematical model of tumor growth
      in a homogeneous and resource-limited microenvironment. We assess posttreatment
      heterogeneity and predict vast differences across treatments with similar
      efficacy, further emphasizing that heterogeneity should modulate treatment
      strategies. The signaling model is also integrated into a hybrid cellular
      automata (HCA) model of tumor growth in a spatially heterogeneous
      microenvironment. As a proof of concept, we simulate tumor responses to targeted 
      therapies in a spatially segregated tissue structure containing tumor and stroma 
      (derived from patient tissue) and predict complex cell signaling responses that
      suggest a novel combination treatment strategy.

PG  - e2004108
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004108 [doi]
AB  - Genetic and environmental factors shape host susceptibility to infection, but how
      and how rapidly environmental variation might alter the susceptibility of
      mammalian genotypes remains unknown. Here, we investigate the impacts of
      seminatural environments upon the nematode susceptibility profiles of inbred
      C57BL/6 mice. We hypothesized that natural exposure to microbes might directly
      (e.g., via trophic interactions) or indirectly (e.g., via microbe-induced immune 
      responses) alter the hatching, growth, and survival of nematodes in mice housed
      outdoors. We found that while C57BL/6 mice are resistant to high doses of
      nematode (Trichuris muris) eggs under clean laboratory conditions, exposure to
      outdoor environments significantly increased their susceptibility to infection,
      as evidenced by increased worm burdens and worm biomass. Indeed, mice kept
      outdoors harbored as many worms as signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 6 (STAT6) knockout mice, which are genetically deficient in the
      type 2 immune response essential for clearing nematodes. Using 16S ribosomal RNA 
      sequencing of fecal samples, we discovered enhanced microbial diversity and
      specific bacterial taxa predictive of nematode burden in outdoor mice. We also
      observed decreased type 2 and increased type 1 immune responses in lamina propria
      and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells from infected mice residing outdoors.
      Importantly, in our experimental design, different groups of mice received
      nematode eggs either before or after moving outdoors. This contrasting timing of 
      rewilding revealed that enhanced hatching of worms was not sufficient to explain 
      the increased worm burdens; instead, microbial enhancement and type 1 immune
      facilitation of worm growth and survival, as hypothesized, were also necessary to
      explain our results. These findings demonstrate that environment can rapidly and 
      significantly shape gut microbial communities and mucosal responses to nematode
      infections, leading to variation in parasite expulsion rates among genetically
      similar hosts.

      category-specific ventral visual areas during reading acquisition.
PG  - e2004103
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004103 [doi]
AB  - How does education affect cortical organization? All literate adults possess a
      region specialized for letter strings, the visual word form area (VWFA), within
      the mosaic of ventral regions involved in processing other visual categories such
      as objects, places, faces, or body parts. Therefore, the acquisition of literacy 
      may induce a reorientation of cortical maps towards letters at the expense of
      other categories such as faces. To test this cortical recycling hypothesis, we
      studied how the visual cortex of individual children changes during the first
      months of reading acquisition. Ten 6-year-old children were scanned
      longitudinally 6 or 7 times with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      before and throughout the first year of school. Subjects were exposed to a
      variety of pictures (words, numbers, tools, houses, faces, and bodies) while
      performing an unrelated target-detection task. Behavioral assessment indicated a 
      sharp rise in grapheme-phoneme knowledge and reading speed in the first trimester
      of school. Concurrently, voxels specific to written words and digits emerged at
      the VWFA location. The responses to other categories remained largely stable,
      although right-hemispheric face-related activity increased in proportion to
      reading scores. Retrospective examination of the VWFA voxels prior to reading
      acquisition showed that reading encroaches on voxels that are initially weakly
      specialized for tools and close to but distinct from those responsive to faces.
      Remarkably, those voxels appear to keep their initial category selectivity while 
      acquiring an additional and stronger responsivity to words. We propose a revised 
      model of the neuronal recycling process in which new visual categories invade
      weakly specified cortex while leaving previously stabilized cortical responses
      unchanged.

AB  - Translational failures and replication issues of published research are
      undermining preclinical research and, if the outcomes are questionable, raise
      ethical implications over the continued use of animals. Standardization of
      procedures, environmental conditions, and genetic background has traditionally
      been proposed as the gold standard approach, as it reduces variability, thereby
      enhancing sensitivity and supporting reproducibility when the environment is
      defined precisely. An alternative view is that standardization can identify
      idiosyncratic effects and hence decrease reproducibility. In support of this
      alternative view, Voelkl and colleagues present evidence from resampling a large 
      quantity of research data exploring a variety of treatments. They demonstrate
      that by implementing multi-laboratory experiments with as few as two sites, we
      can increase reproducibility by embracing variation without increasing the sample
      size.

TI  - Spliced integrated retrotransposed element (SpIRE) formation in the human genome.
PG  - e2003067
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003067 [doi]
AB  - Human Long interspersed element-1 (L1) retrotransposons contain an internal RNA
      polymerase II promoter within their 5' untranslated region (UTR) and encode two
      proteins, (ORF1p and ORF2p) required for their mobilization (i.e.,
      retrotransposition). The evolutionary success of L1 relies on the continuous
      retrotransposition of full-length L1 mRNAs. Previous studies identified
      functional splice donor (SD), splice acceptor (SA), and polyadenylation sequences
      in L1 mRNA and provided evidence that a small number of spliced L1 mRNAs
      retrotransposed in the human genome. Here, we demonstrate that the
      retrotransposition of intra-5'UTR or 5'UTR/ORF1 spliced L1 mRNAs leads to the
      generation of spliced integrated retrotransposed elements (SpIREs). We identified
      a new intra-5'UTR SpIRE that is ten times more abundant than previously
      identified SpIREs. Functional analyses demonstrated that both intra-5'UTR and
      5'UTR/ORF1 SpIREs lack Cis-acting transcription factor binding sites and exhibit 
      reduced promoter activity. The 5'UTR/ORF1 SpIREs also produce nonfunctional ORF1p
      variants. Finally, we demonstrate that sequence changes within the L1 5'UTR over 
      evolutionary time, which permitted L1 to evade the repressive effects of a host
      protein, can lead to the generation of new L1 splicing events, which, upon
      retrotransposition, generates a new SpIRE subfamily. We conclude that splicing
      inhibits L1 retrotransposition, SpIREs generally represent evolutionary
      "dead-ends" in the L1 retrotransposition process, mutations within the L1 5'UTR
      alter L1 splicing dynamics, and that retrotransposition of the resultant spliced 
      transcripts can generate interindividual genomic variation.

TI  - Reading the tea leaves: Dead transposon copies reveal novel host and transposon
      biology.
PG  - e2005470
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005470 [doi]
AB  - Transposable elements comprise a huge portion of most animal genomes. Unlike many
      pathogens, these elements leave a mark of their impact via their insertion into
      host genomes. With proper teasing, these sequences can relay information about
      the evolutionary history of transposons and their hosts. In a new publication,
      Larson and colleagues describe a previously unappreciated density of long
      interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) sequences that have been spliced (LINE-1 and
      other reverse transcribing elements are necessarily intronless). They provide
      data to suggest that the retention of these potentially deleterious splice sites 
      in LINE-1 results from the sites' overlap with an important transcription factor 
      binding site. These spliced LINE-1s (i.e., spliced integrated retrotransposed
      elements [SpiREs]) lose their ability to replicate, suggesting they are
      evolutionary dead ends. However, the lethality of this splicing could be an
      efficient means of blocking continued replication of LINE-1. In this way, the
      record of inactive LINE-1 sequences in the human genome revealed a new, though
      infrequent, event in the LINE-1 replication cycle and motivates future studies to
      test whether splicing might be another weapon in the anti-LINE-1 arsenal of host 
      genomes.

TI  - Bonobo and chimpanzee gestures overlap extensively in meaning.
PG  - e2004825
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004825 [doi]
AB  - Cross-species comparison of great ape gesturing has so far been limited to the
      physical form of gestures in the repertoire, without questioning whether gestures
      share the same meanings. Researchers have recently catalogued the meanings of
      chimpanzee gestures, but little is known about the gesture meanings of our other 
      closest living relative, the bonobo. The bonobo gestural repertoire overlaps by
      approximately 90% with that of the chimpanzee, but such overlap might not extend 
      to meanings. Here, we first determine the meanings of bonobo gestures by
      analysing the outcomes of gesturing that apparently satisfy the signaller. Around
      half of bonobo gestures have a single meaning, while half are more ambiguous.
      Moreover, all but 1 gesture type have distinct meanings, achieving a different
      distribution of intended meanings to the average distribution for all gesture
      types. We then employ a randomisation procedure in a novel way to test the
      likelihood that the observed between-species overlap in the assignment of
      meanings to gestures would arise by chance under a set of different constraints. 
      We compare a matrix of the meanings of bonobo gestures with a matrix for those of
      chimpanzees against 10,000 randomised iterations of matrices constrained to the
      original data at 4 different levels. We find that the similarity between the 2
      species is much greater than would be expected by chance. Bonobos and chimpanzees
      share not only the physical form of the gestures but also many gesture meanings.

AB  - Dissecting how bacterial pathogens escape immune destruction and cause
      respiratory infections in humans is a work in progress. One tactic employed by
      microbes is to use bacterial adenylate cyclase toxins (ACTs) to disarm immune
      cells and disrupt cellular signaling in host cells, which facilitates the
      infection process. Several clinically significant pathogens, such as Bacillus
      anthracis and Bordetella pertussis, have ACTs that are stimulated by an activator
      protein in human cells. Research has shown that these bacterial ACTs have evolved
      distinct ways of controlling their activities, but our understanding of how the
      B. pertussis ACT does this is limited. In a recent study, O'Brien and colleagues 
      provide new and exciting evidence demonstrating that the regulation of B.
      pertussis ACT involves conformational switching between flexible and rigid
      states, which is triggered upon binding the host activator protein. This study
      increases our knowledge of how bacterial ACTs are unique enzymes, representing a 
      potentially novel class of drug targets that may open new pathways to combat
      reemerging infectious diseases.

AB  - The use of consumer-grade wearables for purposes beyond fitness tracking has not

      from 233 normal volunteers, integrating wearable data, lifestyle questionnaires, 
      cardiac imaging, sphingolipid profiling, and multiple clinical-grade
      cardiovascular and metabolic disease markers. We show that subjects can be
      stratified into distinct clusters based on daily activity patterns and that these
      clusters are marked by distinct demographic and behavioral patterns. While
      resting heart rates (RHRs) performed better than step counts in being associated 
      with cardiovascular and metabolic disease markers, step counts identified
      relationships between physical activity and cardiac remodeling, suggesting that
      wearable data may play a role in reducing overdiagnosis of cardiac hypertrophy or
      dilatation in active individuals. Wearable-derived activity levels can be used to
      identify known and novel activity-modulated sphingolipids that are in turn
      associated with insulin sensitivity. Our findings demonstrate the potential for
      wearables in biomedical research and personalized health.

AB  - Lipids are essential components of biological membranes that present a wide
      diversity in eukaryotic cells. Recent impressive advances in lipid biochemistry
      and biophysics have enabled a refocus of our view of lipids as functional units
      for cellular activity. However, the gap between molecular and cellular processes 
      remains to be bridged. Here, 2 papers meet the burden of proof that choline
      transporters participate in local lipid composition modifications at the
      trans-Golgi network, an intracellular compartment that serves as the main sorting
      station in the cell. Localization of choline transporters to this precise
      compartment could be a way for plant cells to quickly modify the membrane lipid
      composition and asymmetry during both the allocation of cargos and the
      recruitment of trafficking machineries into distinct subcellular pathways.

      the plant life cycle in field-grown rice.

AB  - Bacterial communities associated with roots impact the health and nutrition of
      the host plant. The dynamics of these microbial assemblies over the plant life
      cycle are, however, not well understood. Here, we use dense temporal sampling of 
      1,510 samples from root spatial compartments to characterize the bacterial and
      archaeal components of the root-associated microbiota of field grown rice (Oryza 
      sativa) over the course of 3 consecutive growing seasons, as well as 2 sites in
      diverse geographic regions. The root microbiota was found to be highly dynamic
      during the vegetative phase of plant growth and then stabilized compositionally
      for the remainder of the life cycle. Bacterial and archaeal taxa conserved
      between field sites were defined as predictive features of rice plant age by
      modeling using a random forest approach. The age-prediction models revealed that 
      drought-stressed plants have developmentally immature microbiota compared to
      unstressed plants. Further, by using genotypes with varying developmental rates, 
      we show that shifts in the microbiome are correlated with rates of developmental 
      transitions rather than age alone, such that different microbiota compositions
      reflect juvenile and adult life stages. These results suggest a model for
      successional dynamics of the root-associated microbiota over the plant life
      cycle.

AB  - Single-laboratory studies conducted under highly standardized conditions are the 
      gold standard in preclinical animal research. Using simulations based on 440
      preclinical studies across 13 different interventions in animal models of stroke,
      myocardial infarction, and breast cancer, we compared the accuracy of effect size
      estimates between single-laboratory and multi-laboratory study designs.
      Single-laboratory studies generally failed to predict effect size accurately, and
      larger sample sizes rendered effect size estimates even less accurate. By
      contrast, multi-laboratory designs including as few as 2 to 4 laboratories
      increased coverage probability by up to 42 percentage points without a need for
      larger sample sizes. These findings demonstrate that within-study standardization
      is a major cause of poor reproducibility. More representative study samples are
      required to improve the external validity and reproducibility of preclinical
      animal research and to prevent wasting animals and resources for inconclusive
      research.

      evolvability.
PG  - e2004644
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004644 [doi]
AB  - Whether mutations in bacteria exhibit a noticeable delay before expressing their 
      corresponding mutant phenotype was discussed intensively in the 1940s to 1950s,
      but the discussion eventually waned for lack of supportive evidence and perceived
      incompatibility with observed mutant distributions in fluctuation tests.
      Phenotypic delay in bacteria is widely assumed to be negligible, despite the lack
      of direct evidence. Here, we revisited the question using recombineering to
      introduce antibiotic resistance mutations into E. coli at defined time points and
      then tracking expression of the corresponding mutant phenotype over time.
      Contrary to previous assumptions, we found a substantial median phenotypic delay 
      of three to four generations. We provided evidence that the primary source of
      this delay is multifork replication causing cells to be effectively polyploid,
      whereby wild-type gene copies transiently mask the phenotype of recessive mutant 
      gene copies in the same cell. Using modeling and simulation methods, we explored 
      the consequences of effective polyploidy for mutation rate estimation by
      fluctuation tests and sequencing-based methods. For recessive mutations, despite 
      the substantial phenotypic delay, the per-copy or per-genome mutation rate is
      accurately estimated. However, the per-cell rate cannot be estimated by existing 
      methods. Finally, with a mathematical model, we showed that effective polyploidy 
      increases the frequency of costly recessive mutations in the standing genetic
      variation (SGV), and thus their potential contribution to evolutionary
      adaptation, while drastically reducing the chance that de novo recessive
      mutations can rescue populations facing a harsh environmental change such as
      antibiotic treatment. Overall, we have identified phenotypic delay and effective 
      polyploidy as previously overlooked but essential components in bacterial
      evolvability, including antibiotic resistance evolution.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003962 [doi]
AB  - Specific members of complex microbiota can influence host phenotypes, depending
      on both the abiotic environment and the presence of other microorganisms.
      Therefore, it is challenging to define bacterial combinations that have
      predictable host phenotypic outputs. We demonstrate that plant-bacterium
      binary-association assays inform the design of small synthetic communities with
      predictable phenotypes in the host. Specifically, we constructed synthetic
      communities that modified phosphate accumulation in the shoot and induced
      phosphate starvation-responsive genes in a predictable fashion. We found that
      bacterial colonization of the plant is not a predictor of the plant phenotypes we
      analyzed. Finally, we demonstrated that characterizing a subset of all possible
      bacterial synthetic communities is sufficient to predict the outcome of untested 
      bacterial consortia. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to infer causal 
      relationships between microbiota membership and host phenotypes and to use these 
      inferences to rationally design novel communities.

TI  - Vocal development through morphological computation.
PG  - e2003933
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003933 [doi]
AB  - The vocal behavior of infants changes dramatically during early life. Whether or 
      not such a change results from the growth of the body during development-as
      opposed to solely neural changes-has rarely been investigated. In this study of
      vocal development in marmoset monkeys, we tested the putative causal relationship
      between bodily growth and vocal development. During the first two months of life,
      the spontaneous vocalizations of marmosets undergo (1) a gradual disappearance of
      context-inappropriate call types and (2) an elongation in the duration of
      context-appropriate contact calls. We hypothesized that both changes are the
      natural consequences of lung growth and do not require any changes at the neural 
      level. To test this idea, we first present a central pattern generator model of
      marmoset vocal production to demonstrate that lung growth can affect the temporal
      and oscillatory dynamics of neural circuits via sensory feedback from the lungs. 
      Lung growth qualitatively shifted vocal behavior in the direction observed in
      real marmoset monkey vocal development. We then empirically tested this
      hypothesis by placing the marmoset infants in a helium-oxygen (heliox)
      environment in which air is much lighter. This simulated a reversal in
      development by decreasing the effort required to respire, thus increasing the
      respiration rate (as though the lungs were smaller). The heliox manipulation
      increased the proportions of inappropriate call types and decreased the duration 
      of contact calls, consistent with a brief reversal of vocal development. These
      results suggest that bodily growth alone can play a major role in shaping the
      development of vocal behavior.

AB  - Insects determine their body segments in two different ways. Short-germband
      insects, such as the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, use a molecular clock to
      establish segments sequentially. In contrast, long-germband insects, such as the 
      vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, determine all segments simultaneously
      through a hierarchical cascade of gene regulation. Gap genes constitute the first
      layer of the Drosophila segmentation gene hierarchy, downstream of maternal
      gradients such as that of Caudal (Cad). We use data-driven mathematical modelling
      and phase space analysis to show that shifting gap domains in the posterior half 
      of the Drosophila embryo are an emergent property of a robust damped oscillator
      mechanism, suggesting that the regulatory dynamics underlying long- and
      short-germband segmentation are much more similar than previously thought. In
      Tribolium, Cad has been proposed to modulate the frequency of the segmentation
      oscillator. Surprisingly, our simulations and experiments show that the shift
      rate of posterior gap domains is independent of maternal Cad levels in
      Drosophila. Our results suggest a novel evolutionary scenario for the short- to
      long-germband transition and help explain why this transition occurred
      convergently multiple times during the radiation of the holometabolan insects.

TI  - Identification of FAM173B as a protein methyltransferase promoting chronic pain.
PG  - e2003452
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003452 [doi]
AB  - Chronic pain is a debilitating problem, and insights in the neurobiology of
      chronic pain are needed for the development of novel pain therapies. A
      genome-wide association study implicated the 5p15.2 region in chronic widespread 
      pain. This region includes the coding region for FAM173B, a functionally
      uncharacterized protein. We demonstrate here that FAM173B is a mitochondrial
      lysine methyltransferase that promotes chronic pain. Knockdown and sensory neuron
      overexpression strategies showed that FAM173B is involved in persistent
      inflammatory and neuropathic pain via a pathway dependent on its
      methyltransferase activity. FAM173B methyltransferase activity in sensory neurons
      hyperpolarized mitochondria and promoted macrophage/microglia activation through 
      a reactive oxygen species-dependent pathway. In summary, we uncover a role for
      methyltransferase activity of FAM173B in the neurobiology of pain. These results 
      also highlight FAM173B methyltransferase activity as a potential therapeutic
      target to treat debilitating chronic pain conditions.

TI  - Fruit flies are multistable geniuses.
PG  - e2005429
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005429 [doi]
AB  - Our sensory systems have evolved to provide us with information about the
      external world. Such information is useful only insofar as it leads to actions
      that enhance fitness, and thus, the link between sensation and action has been
      thoroughly studied in many species. In insects, for example, specific visual
      stimuli lead to highly stereotyped responses. In contrast, humans can exhibit a
      wide range of responses to the same stimulus, as occurs most notably in the
      phenomenon of multistable perception. On this basis, one might think that humans 
      have a fundamentally different way of generating actions from sensory inputs, but
      Toepfer et al. show that flies show evidence of multistable perception as well.
      Specifically, when confronted with a sensory stimulus that can yield different
      motor responses, flies switch from one response to another with temporal dynamics
      that are similar to those of humans and other animals. This suggests that the
      mechanisms that give rise to the rich repertoire of sensory experience in humans 
      have correlates in much simpler nervous systems.

PG  - e2003113
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003113 [doi]
AB  - It is widely accepted for humans and higher animals that vision is an active
      process in which the organism interprets the stimulus. To find out whether this
      also holds for lower animals, we designed an ambiguous motion stimulus, which
      serves as something like a multi-stable perception paradigm in Drosophila
      behavior. Confronted with a uniform panoramic texture in a closed-loop situation 
      in stationary flight, the flies adjust their yaw torque to stabilize their
      virtual self-rotation. To make the visual input ambiguous, we added a second
      texture. Both textures got a rotatory bias to move into opposite directions at a 
      constant relative angular velocity. The results indicate that the fly now had
      three possible frames of reference for self-rotation: either of the two motion
      components as well as the integrated motion vector of the two. In this ambiguous 
      stimulus situation, the flies generated a continuous sequence of behaviors, each 
      one adjusted to one or another of the three references.

TI  - How the microbiome challenges our concept of self.
PG  - e2005358
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005358 [doi]
AB  - Today, the three classical biological explanations of the individual self--the
      immune system, the brain, the genome--are being challenged by the new field of
      microbiome research. Evidence shows that our resident microbes orchestrate the
      adaptive immune system, influence the brain, and contribute more gene functions
      than our own genome. The realization that humans are not individual, discrete
      entities but rather the outcome of ever-changing interactions with microorganisms
      has consequences beyond the biological disciplines. In particular, it calls into 
      question the assumption that distinctive human traits set us apart from all other
      animals--and therefore also the traditional disciplinary divisions between the
      arts and the sciences.

TI  - Catecholamines alter the intrinsic variability of cortical population activity
      and perception.
PG  - e2003453
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003453 [doi]
AB  - The ascending modulatory systems of the brain stem are powerful regulators of
      global brain state. Disturbances of these systems are implicated in several major
      neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, how these systems interact with specific neural 
      computations in the cerebral cortex to shape perception, cognition, and behavior 
      remains poorly understood. Here, we probed into the effect of two such systems,
      the catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and noradrenergic) and cholinergic systems,
      on an important aspect of cortical computation: its intrinsic variability. To
      this end, we combined placebo-controlled pharmacological intervention in humans, 
      recordings of cortical population activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG),
      and psychophysical measurements of the perception of ambiguous visual input. A
      low-dose catecholaminergic, but not cholinergic, manipulation altered the rate of
      spontaneous perceptual fluctuations as well as the temporal structure of
      "scale-free" population activity of large swaths of the visual and parietal
      cortices. Computational analyses indicate that both effects were consistent with 
      an increase in excitatory relative to inhibitory activity in the cortical areas
      underlying visual perceptual inference. We propose that catecholamines regulate
      the variability of perception and cognition through dynamically changing the
      cortical excitation-inhibition ratio. The combined readout of fluctuations in
      perception and cortical activity we established here may prove useful as an
      efficient and easily accessible marker of altered cortical computation in
      neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - The complexity of host-parasite interactions makes it difficult to predict how
      host-parasite systems will respond to climate change. In particular, host and
      parasite traits such as survival and virulence may have distinct temperature
      dependencies that must be integrated into models of disease dynamics. Using
      experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microsporidian parasite, we fitted a
      mechanistic model of the within-host parasite population dynamics. Model
      parameters comprising host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth,
      virulence, and equilibrium abundance, were specified by relationships arising
      from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicts host
      survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while
      using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely.
      Our results serve as a proof of concept that linking simple metabolic models with
      a mechanistic host-parasite framework can be used to predict temperature
      responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level.

TI  - Neutrophils kill the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis using trogocytosis.
PG  - e2003885
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003885 [doi]
AB  - T. vaginalis, a human-infective parasite, causes the most common nonviral
      sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide and contributes to adverse
      inflammatory disorders. The immune response to T. vaginalis is poorly understood.
      Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells [PMNs]) are the major immune cell present at
      the T. vaginalis-host interface and are thought to clear T. vaginalis. However,
      the mechanism of PMN clearance of T. vaginalis has not been characterized. We
      demonstrate that human PMNs rapidly kill T. vaginalis in a dose-dependent,
      contact-dependent, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-independent manner. In
      contrast to phagocytosis, we observed that PMN killing of T. vaginalis involves
      taking "bites" of T. vaginalis prior to parasite death, using trogocytosis to
      achieve pathogen killing. Both trogocytosis and parasite killing are dependent on
      the presence of PMN serine proteases and human serum factors. Our analyses
      provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a mammalian phagocyte using
      trogocytosis for pathogen clearance and reveal a novel mechanism used by PMNs to 
      kill a large, highly motile target.

AB  - Noninvasive imaging and tractography methods have yielded information on broad
      communication networks but lack resolution to delineate intralaminar cortical and
      subcortical pathways in humans. An important unanswered question is whether we
      can use the wealth of precise information on pathways from monkeys to understand 
      connections in humans. We addressed this question within a theoretical framework 
      of systematic cortical variation and used identical high-resolution methods to
      compare the architecture of cortical gray matter and the white matter beneath,
      which gives rise to short- and long-distance pathways in humans and rhesus
      monkeys. We used the prefrontal cortex as a model system because of its key role 
      in attention, emotions, and executive function, which are processes often
      affected in brain diseases. We found striking parallels and consistent trends in 
      the gray and white matter architecture in humans and monkeys and between the
      architecture and actual connections mapped with neural tracers in rhesus monkeys 
      and, by extension, in humans. Using the novel architectonic portrait as a base,
      we found significant changes in pathways between nearby prefrontal and distant
      areas in autism. Our findings reveal that a theoretical framework allows study of
      normal neural communication in humans at high resolution and specific disruptions
      in diverse psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The cellular adjustment of Bacteria and Archaea to high-salinity habitats is well
      studied and has generally been classified into one of two strategies. These are
      to accumulate high levels either of ions (the "salt-in" strategy) or of
      physiologically compliant organic osmolytes, the compatible solutes (the
      "salt-out" strategy). Halophilic protists are ecophysiological important
      inhabitants of salt-stressed ecosystems because they are not only very abundant
      but also represent the majority of eukaryotic lineages in nature. However, their 
      cellular osmostress responses have been largely neglected. Recent reports have
      now shed new light on this issue using the geographically widely distributed
      halophilic heterotrophic protists Halocafeteria seosinensis, Pharyngomonas
      kirbyi, and Schmidingerothrix salinarum as model systems. Different approaches
      led to the joint conclusion that these unicellular Eukarya use the salt-out
      strategy to cope successfully with the persistent high salinity in their habitat.
      They accumulate various compatible solutes, e.g., glycine betaine, myo-inositol, 
      and ectoines. The finding of intron-containing biosynthetic genes for ectoine and
      hydroxyectoine, their salt stress-responsive transcription in H. seosinensis, and
      the production of ectoine and its import by S. salinarum come as a considerable
      surprise because ectoines have thus far been considered exclusive prokaryotic
      compatible solutes. Phylogenetic considerations of the ectoine/hydroxyectoine
      biosynthetic genes of H. seosinensis suggest that they have been acquired via
      lateral gene transfer by these bacterivorous Eukarya from
      ectoine/hydroxyectoine-producing food bacteria that populate the same habitat.

AB  - During tissue development, multipotent progenitors differentiate into specific
      cell types in characteristic spatial and temporal patterns. We addressed the
      mechanism linking progenitor identity and differentiation rate in the neural
      tube, where motor neuron (MN) progenitors differentiate more rapidly than other
      progenitors. Using single cell transcriptomics, we defined the transcriptional
      changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs.
      Reconstruction of gene expression dynamics from these data indicate a pivotal
      role for the MN determinant Olig2 just prior to MN differentiation. Olig2
      represses expression of the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5.
      Olig2 repression of Hes5 appears to be direct, via a conserved regulatory element
      within the Hes5 locus that restricts expression from MN progenitors. These
      findings reveal a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control
      patterning and neuronal differentiation and demonstrate how Olig2 acts as the
      developmental pacemaker coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN
      generation.

      songbirds.

AB  - Competition between closely related species has long been viewed as a powerful
      selective force that drives trait diversification, thereby generating phenotypic 
      diversity over macroevolutionary timescales. However, although the impact of
      interspecific competition has been documented in a handful of iconic insular
      radiations, most previous studies have focused on traits involved in resource
      use, and few have examined the role of competition across large, continental
      radiations. Thus, the extent to which broad-scale patterns of phenotypic
      diversity are shaped by competition remain largely unclear, particularly for
      social traits. Here, we estimate the effect of competition between interacting
      lineages by applying new phylogenetic models that account for such interactions
      to an exceptionally complete dataset of resource-use traits and social signaling 
      traits for the entire radiation of tanagers (Aves, Thraupidae), the largest
      family of songbirds. We find that interspecific competition strongly influences
      the evolution of traits involved in resource use, with a weaker effect on plumage
      signals, and very little effect on song. Our results provide compelling evidence 
      that interspecific exploitative competition contributes to ecological trait
      diversification among coexisting species, even in a large continental radiation. 
      In comparison, signal traits mediating mate choice and social competition seem to
      diversify under different evolutionary models, including rapid diversification in
      the allopatric stage of speciation.

TI  - Role of the AP-5 adaptor protein complex in late endosome-to-Golgi retrieval.
PG  - e2004411
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004411 [doi]
AB  - The AP-5 adaptor protein complex is presumed to function in membrane traffic, but
      so far nothing is known about its pathway or its cargo. We have used CRISPR-Cas9 
      to knock out the AP-5 zeta subunit gene, AP5Z1, in HeLa cells, and then analysed 
      the phenotype by subcellular fractionation profiling and quantitative mass
      spectrometry. The retromer complex had an altered steady-state distribution in
      the knockout cells, and several Golgi proteins, including GOLIM4 and GOLM1, were 
      depleted from vesicle-enriched fractions. Immunolocalisation showed that loss of 
      AP-5 led to impaired retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate
      receptor (CIMPR), GOLIM4, and GOLM1 from endosomes back to the Golgi region.
      Knocking down the retromer complex exacerbated this phenotype. Both the CIMPR and
      sortilin interacted with the AP-5-associated protein SPG15 in pull-down assays,
      and we propose that sortilin may act as a link between Golgi proteins and the
      AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 complex. Together, our findings suggest that AP-5 functions in a
      novel sorting step out of late endosomes, acting as a backup pathway for
      retromer. This provides a mechanistic explanation for why mutations in
      AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 cause cells to accumulate aberrant endolysosomes, and highlights
      the role of endosome/lysosome dysfunction in the pathology of hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia and other neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Mitochondria are physiologically maintained at close to 50 degrees C.
PG  - e2003992
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003992 [doi]
AB  - In endothermic species, heat released as a product of metabolism ensures stable
      internal temperature throughout the organism, despite varying environmental
      conditions. Mitochondria are major actors in this thermogenic process. Part of
      the energy released by the oxidation of respiratory substrates drives ATP
      synthesis and metabolite transport, but a substantial proportion is released as
      heat. Using a temperature-sensitive fluorescent probe targeted to mitochondria,
      we measured mitochondrial temperature in situ under different physiological
      conditions. At a constant external temperature of 38 degrees C, mitochondria were
      more than 10 degrees C warmer when the respiratory chain (RC) was fully
      functional, both in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and primary skin
      fibroblasts. This differential was abolished in cells depleted of mitochondrial
      DNA or treated with respiratory inhibitors but preserved or enhanced by
      expressing thermogenic enzymes, such as the alternative oxidase or the uncoupling
      protein 1. The activity of various RC enzymes was maximal at or slightly above 50
      degrees C. In view of their potential consequences, these observations need to be
      further validated and explored by independent methods. Our study prompts a
      critical re-examination of the literature on mitochondria.

TI  - Hot mitochondria?
PG  - e2005113
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005113 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria generate most of the heat in endotherms. Given some impedance of
      heat transfer across protein-rich bioenergetic membranes, mitochondria must
      operate at a higher temperature than body temperature in mammals and birds. But
      exactly how much hotter has been controversial, with physical calculations
      suggesting that maximal heat gradients across cells could not be greater than
      10-5 K. Using the thermosensitive mitochondrial-targeted fluorescent dye Mito
      Thermo Yellow (MTY), Chretien and colleagues suggest that mitochondria are
      optimised to nearly 50 degrees C, 10 degrees C hotter than body temperature. This
      extreme value questions what temperature really means in confined
      far-from-equilibrium systems but encourages a reconsideration of thermal biology.

      activation.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004111 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors are required for
      induction of T-cell cytokine production and effector function. Although it is
      known that activation via the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) results in 2 critical
      steps, calcineurin-mediated NFAT1 dephosphorylation and NFAT2 up-regulation, the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying each are poorly understood. Here we find that T
      cell p38, which is activated by an alternative pathway independent of the
      mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade and with different substrate
      specificities, directly controls these events. First, alternatively (but not
      classically) activated p38 was required to induce the expression of the AP-1
      component c-Fos, which was necessary for NFAT2 expression and cytokine
      production. Second, alternatively (but not classically) activated p38
      phosphorylated NFAT1 on a heretofore unidentified site, S79, and in its absence
      NFAT1 was unable to interact with calcineurin or migrate to the nucleus. These
      results demonstrate that the acquisition of unique specificities by TCR-activated
      p38 orchestrates NFAT-dependent T-cell functions.

TI  - Identification of osmoadaptive strategies in the halophile, heterotrophic ciliate
      Schmidingerothrix salinarum.
PG  - e2003892

AB  - Hypersaline environments pose major challenges to their microbial residents.
      Microorganisms have to cope with increased osmotic pressure and low water
      activity and therefore require specific adaptation mechanisms. Although
      mechanisms have already been thoroughly investigated in the green alga Dunaliella
      salina and some halophilic yeasts, strategies for osmoadaptation in other
      protistan groups (especially heterotrophs) are neither as well known nor as
      deeply investigated as for their prokaryotic counterpart. This is not only due to
      the recent awareness of the high protistan diversity and ecological relevance in 
      hypersaline systems, but also due to methodological shortcomings. We provide the 
      first experimental study on haloadaptation in heterotrophic microeukaryotes,
      using the halophilic ciliate Schmidingerothrix salinarum as a model organism. We 
      established three approaches to investigate fundamental adaptation strategies
      known from prokaryotes. First, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR)
      spectroscopy was used for the detection, identification, and quantification of
      intracellular compatible solutes. Second, ion-imaging with cation-specific
      fluorescent dyes was employed to analyze changes in the relative ion
      concentrations in intact cells. Third, the effect of salt concentrations on the
      catalytic performance of S. salinarum malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and isocitrate
      dehydrogenase (ICDH) was determined. 1H-NMR spectroscopy identified glycine
      betaine (GB) and ectoine (Ect) as the main compatible solutes in S. salinarum.
      Moreover, a significant positive correlation of intracellular GB and Ect
      concentrations and external salinity was observed. The addition of exogenous GB, 
      Ect, and choline (Ch) stimulated the cell growth notably, indicating that S.
      salinarum accumulates the solutes from the external medium. Addition of external 
      13C2-Ch resulted in conversion to 13C2-GB, indicating biosynthesis of GB from Ch.
      An increase of external salinity up to 21% did not result in an increase in
      cytoplasmic sodium concentration in S. salinarum. This, together with the
      decrease in the catalytic activities of MDH and ICDH at high salt concentration, 
      demonstrates that S. salinarum employs the salt-out strategy for haloadaptation.

PG  - e2002399
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002399 [doi]
AB  - The Hippo pathway plays a key role in regulating cell turnover in adult tissues, 
      and abnormalities in this pathway are consistently associated with human cancers.
      Hippo was initially implicated in the control of cell proliferation and death,
      and its inhibition is linked to the expansion of stem cells and progenitors,
      leading to larger organ size and tumor formation. To understand the mechanism by 
      which Hippo directs cell renewal and promotes stemness, we studied its function
      in planarians. These stem cell-based organisms are ideal models for the analysis 
      of the complex cellular events underlying tissue renewal in the whole organism.
      hippo RNA interference (RNAi) in planarians decreased apoptotic cell death,
      induced cell cycle arrest, and could promote the dedifferentiation of postmitotic
      cells. hippo RNAi resulted in extensive undifferentiated areas and overgrowths,
      with no effect on body size or cell number. We propose an essential role for
      hippo in controlling cell cycle, restricting cell plasticity, and thereby
      preventing tumoral transformation.

TI  - Evolution of mitotic spindle behavior during the first asymmetric embryonic
      division of nematodes.
PG  - e2005099
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005099 [doi]
AB  - Asymmetric cell division is essential to generate cellular diversity. In many
      animal cells, the cleavage plane lies perpendicular to the mitotic spindle, and
      it is the spindle positioning that dictates the size of the daughter cells.
      Although some properties of spindle positioning are conserved between distantly
      related model species and different cell types, little is known of the
      evolutionary robustness of the mechanisms underlying this event. We recorded the 
      first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes closely related to
      Caenorhabditis elegans, which is an excellent model system to study the
      biophysical properties of asymmetric spindle positioning. Our recordings,
      corresponding to 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis
      species (accessible at http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LBMC/NematodeCell/videos/),
      constitute a powerful collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution
      of various cellular processes across species. In the present work, we analyzed
      our collection to the study of asymmetric spindle positioning. Although all the
      strains underwent an asymmetric first cell division, they exhibited large intra- 
      and inter-species variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and in several
      parameters controlling spindle movement, including spindle oscillation,
      elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed frequently during
      evolution with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, with the
      exception of spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary
      innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. These changes were also
      unrelated to evolutionary variations in embryo size. Importantly, spindle
      elongation, displacement, and oscillation each evolved independently. This
      finding contrasts starkly with expectations based on C. elegans studies and
      reveals previously unrecognized evolutionary changes in spindle mechanics.
      Collectively, these data demonstrate that, while the essential process of
      asymmetric cell division has been conserved over the course of nematode
      evolution, the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various
      ways. Like other developmental processes, asymmetric cell division is subject to 
      system drift.

PG  - e2003354
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003354 [doi]
AB  - Behavior is used to assess memory and cognitive deficits in animals like
      Fmr1-null mice that model Fragile X Syndrome, but behavior is a proxy for unknown
      neural events that define cognitive variables like recollection. We identified an
      electrophysiological signature of recollection in mouse dorsal Cornu Ammonis 1
      (CA1) hippocampus. During a shocked-place avoidance task, slow gamma (SG) (30-50 
      Hz) dominates mid-frequency gamma (MG) (70-90 Hz) oscillations 2-3 s before
      successful avoidance, but not failures. Wild-type (WT) but not Fmr1-null mice
      rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdom)
      decrease in WT but not in cognitively inflexible Fmr1-null mice. During SGdom,
      putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place
      avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, WT ensembles
      represent distant locations near the currently correct shock zone, but Fmr1-null 
      ensembles represent the formerly correct zone. These findings indicate that
      recollection occurs when CA1 SG dominates MG and that accurate recollection of
      inappropriate memories explains Fmr1-null cognitive inflexibility.

AB  - The human body is a complex organism, the gross mechanical properties of which
      are enabled by an interconnected musculoskeletal network controlled by the
      nervous system. The nature of musculoskeletal interconnection facilitates
      stability, voluntary movement, and robustness to injury. However, a fundamental
      understanding of this network and its control by neural systems has remained
      elusive. Here we address this gap in knowledge by utilizing medical databases and
      mathematical modeling to reveal the organizational structure, predicted function,
      and neural control of the musculoskeletal system. We constructed a highly
      simplified whole-body musculoskeletal network in which single muscles connect to 
      multiple bones via both origin and insertion points. We demonstrated that, using 
      this simplified model, a muscle's role in this network could offer a theoretical 
      prediction of the susceptibility of surrounding components to secondary injury.
      Finally, we illustrated that sets of muscles cluster into network communities
      that mimic the organization of control modules in primary motor cortex. This
      novel formalism for describing interactions between the muscular and skeletal
      systems serves as a foundation to develop and test therapeutic responses to
      injury, inspiring future advances in clinical treatments.

PG  - e2004935
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004935 [doi]
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by two membrane bilayers separated by a
      space termed the periplasm. The periplasm is a multipurpose compartment separate 
      from the cytoplasm whose distinct reducing environment allows more efficient and 
      diverse mechanisms of protein oxidation, folding, and quality control. The
      periplasm also contains structural elements and important environmental sensing
      modules, and it allows complex nanomachines to span the cell envelope. Recent
      work indicates that the size or intermembrane distance of the periplasm is
      controlled by periplasmic lipoproteins that anchor the outer membrane to the
      periplasmic peptidoglycan polymer. This periplasm intermembrane distance is
      critical for sensing outer membrane damage and dictates length of the flagellar
      periplasmic rotor, which controls motility. These exciting results resolve
      longstanding debates about whether the periplasmic distance has a biological
      function and raise the possibility that the mechanisms for maintenance of
      periplasmic size could be exploited for antibiotic development.

TI  - Identification of a noncanonical function for ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A
      promotes colorectal cancer formation by stabilizing and activating beta-catenin
      via a novel C-terminal domain.
PG  - e2003714
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003714 [doi]
AB  - Altered metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancers. Deregulation of
      ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA) in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is
      known to promote tumorigenesis in liver, lung, and breast tissues. Yet, the
      molecular mechanism of RPIA-mediated colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. Our
      study demonstrates a noncanonical function of RPIA in CRC. Data from the mRNAs of
      80 patients' CRC tissues and paired nontumor tissues and protein levels, as well 
      as a CRC tissue array, indicate RPIA is significantly elevated in CRC. RPIA
      modulates cell proliferation and oncogenicity via activation of beta-catenin in
      colon cancer cell lines. Unlike its role in PPP in which RPIA functions within
      the cytosol, RPIA enters the nucleus to form a complex with the adenomatous
      polyposis coli (APC) and beta-catenin. This association protects beta-catenin by 
      preventing its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. The
      C-terminus of RPIA (amino acids 290 to 311), a region distinct from its enzymatic
      domain, is necessary for RPIA-mediated tumorigenesis. Consistent with results in 
      vitro, RPIA increases the expression of beta-catenin and its target genes, and
      induces tumorigenesis in gut-specific promotor-carrying RPIA transgenic
      zebrafish. Together, we demonstrate a novel function of RPIA in CRC formation in 
      which RPIA enters the nucleus and stabilizes beta-catenin activity and suggests
      that RPIA might be a biomarker for targeted therapy and prognosis.

TI  - Anteroposterior axis patterning by early canonical Wnt signaling during
      hemichordate development.
PG  - e2003698
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003698 [doi]
AB  - The Wnt family of secreted proteins has been proposed to play a conserved role in
      early specification of the bilaterian anteroposterior (A/P) axis. This hypothesis
      is based predominantly on data from vertebrate embryogenesis as well as planarian
      regeneration and homeostasis, indicating that canonical Wnt (cWnt) signaling
      endows cells with positional information along the A/P axis. Outside of these
      phyla, there is strong support for a conserved role of cWnt signaling in the
      repression of anterior fates, but little comparative support for a conserved role
      in promotion of posterior fates. We further test the hypothesis by investigating 
      the role of cWnt signaling during early patterning along the A/P axis of the
      hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. We have cloned and investigated the
      expression of the complete Wnt ligand and Frizzled receptor complement of S.
      kowalevskii during early development along with many secreted Wnt modifiers.
      Eleven of the 13 Wnt ligands are ectodermally expressed in overlapping domains,
      predominantly in the posterior, and Wnt antagonists are localized predominantly
      to the anterior ectoderm in a pattern reminiscent of their distribution in
      vertebrate embryos. Overexpression and knockdown experiments, in combination with
      embryological manipulations, establish the importance of cWnt signaling for
      repression of anterior fates and activation of mid-axial ectodermal fates during 
      the early development of S. kowalevskii. However, surprisingly, terminal
      posterior fates, defined by posterior Hox genes, are unresponsive to manipulation
      of cWnt levels during the early establishment of the A/P axis at late blastula
      and early gastrula. We establish experimental support for a conserved role of Wnt
      signaling in the early specification of the A/P axis during deuterostome body
      plan diversification, and further build support for an ancestral role of this
      pathway in early evolution of the bilaterian A/P axis. We find strong support for
      a role of cWnt in suppression of anterior fates and promotion of mid-axial fates,
      but we find no evidence that cWnt signaling plays a role in the early
      specification of the most posterior axial fates in S. kowalevskii. This posterior
      autonomy may be a conserved feature of early deuterostome axis specification.

      plants.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003706 [doi]
AB  - The abrupt origin and rapid diversification of the flowering plants during the
      Cretaceous has long been considered an "abominable mystery." While the cause of
      their high diversity has been attributed largely to coevolution with pollinators 
      and herbivores, their ability to outcompete the previously dominant ferns and
      gymnosperms has been the subject of many hypotheses. Common among these is that
      the angiosperms alone developed leaves with smaller, more numerous stomata and
      more highly branching venation networks that enable higher rates of
      transpiration, photosynthesis, and growth. Yet, how angiosperms pack their leaves
      with smaller, more abundant stomata and more veins is unknown but linked-we
      show-to simple biophysical constraints on cell size. Only angiosperm lineages
      underwent rapid genome downsizing during the early Cretaceous period, which
      facilitated the reductions in cell size necessary to pack more veins and stomata 
      into their leaves, effectively bringing actual primary productivity closer to its
      maximum potential. Thus, the angiosperms' heightened competitive abilities are
      due in no small part to genome downsizing.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004538 [doi]
AB  - Gene expression variation is a major contributor to phenotypic diversity within
      species and is thought to play an important role in adaptation. However, examples
      of adaptive regulatory polymorphism are rare, especially those that have been
      characterized at both the molecular genetic level and the organismal level. In
      this study, we perform a functional analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster
      CG9509 enhancer, a cis-regulatory element that shows evidence of adaptive
      evolution in populations outside the species' ancestral range in sub-Saharan
      Africa. Using site-directed mutagenesis and transgenic reporter gene assays, we
      determined that 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms are responsible for the
      difference in CG9509 expression that is observed between sub-Saharan African and 
      cosmopolitan populations. Interestingly, while 2 of these variants appear to have
      been the targets of a selective sweep outside of sub-Saharan Africa, the variant 
      with the largest effect on expression remains polymorphic in cosmopolitan
      populations, suggesting it may be subject to a different mode of selection. To
      elucidate the function of CG9509, we performed a series of functional and
      tolerance assays on flies in which CG9509 expression was disrupted. We found that
      CG9509 plays a role in larval growth and influences adult body and wing size, as 
      well as wing loading. Furthermore, variation in several of these traits was
      associated with variation within the CG9509 enhancer. The effect on growth
      appears to result from a modulation of active ecdysone levels and expression of
      growth factors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selection acted on 3
      sites within the CG9509 enhancer to increase CG9509 expression and, as a result, 
      reduce wing loading as D. melanogaster expanded out of sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Metallochaperone UreG serves as a new target for design of urease inhibitor: A
      novel strategy for development of antimicrobials.
PG  - e2003887
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003887 [doi]
AB  - Urease as a potential target of antimicrobial drugs has received considerable
      attention given its versatile roles in microbial infection. Development of
      effective urease inhibitors, however, is a significant challenge due to the
      deeply buried active site and highly specific substrate of a bacterial urease.
      Conventionally, urease inhibitors are designed by either targeting the active
      site or mimicking substrate of urease, which is not efficient. Up to now, only
      one effective inhibitor-acetohydroxamic acid (AHA)-is clinically available, but
      it has adverse side effects. Herein, we demonstrate that a clinically used drug, 
      colloidal bismuth subcitrate, utilizes an unusual way to inhibit urease activity,
      i.e., disruption of urease maturation process via functional perturbation of a
      metallochaperone, UreG. Similar phenomena were also observed in various
      pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that UreG may serve as a general target for
      design of new types of urease inhibitors. Using Helicobacter pylori UreG as a
      showcase, by virtual screening combined with experimental validation, we show
      that two compounds targeting UreG also efficiently inhibited urease activity with
      inhibitory concentration (IC)50 values of micromolar level, resulting in
      attenuated virulence of the pathogen. We further demonstrate the efficacy of the 
      compounds in a mammalian cell infection model. This study opens up a new
      opportunity for the design of more effective urease inhibitors and clearly
      indicates that metallochaperones involved in the maturation of important
      microbial metalloenzymes serve as new targets for devising a new type of
      antimicrobial drugs.

TI  - Climate change could drive marine food web collapse through altered trophic flows
      and cyanobacterial proliferation.
PG  - e2003446
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003446 [doi]
AB  - Global warming and ocean acidification are forecast to exert significant impacts 
      on marine ecosystems worldwide. However, most of these projections are based on
      ecological proxies or experiments on single species or simplified food webs. How 
      energy fluxes are likely to change in marine food webs in response to future
      climates remains unclear, hampering forecasts of ecosystem functioning. Using a
      sophisticated mesocosm experiment, we model energy flows through a species-rich
      multilevel food web, with live habitats, natural abiotic variability, and the
      potential for intra- and intergenerational adaptation. We show experimentally
      that the combined stress of acidification and warming reduced energy flows from
      the first trophic level (primary producers and detritus) to the second
      (herbivores), and from the second to the third trophic level (carnivores).
      Warming in isolation also reduced the energy flow from herbivores to carnivores, 
      the efficiency of energy transfer from primary producers and detritus to
      herbivores and detritivores, and the living biomass of detritivores, herbivores, 
      and carnivores. Whilst warming and acidification jointly boosted primary producer
      biomass through an expansion of cyanobacteria, this biomass was converted to
      detritus rather than to biomass at higher trophic levels-i.e., production was
      constrained to the base of the food web. In contrast, ocean acidification
      affected the food web positively by enhancing trophic flow from detritus and
      primary producers to herbivores, and by increasing the biomass of carnivores. Our
      results show how future climate change can potentially weaken marine food webs
      through reduced energy flow to higher trophic levels and a shift towards a more
      detritus-based system, leading to food web simplification and altered
      producer-consumer dynamics, both of which have important implications for the
      structuring of benthic communities.

TI  - Population genomics of Mesolithic Scandinavia: Investigating early postglacial
      migration routes and high-latitude adaptation.
PG  - e2003703
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003703 [doi]
AB  - Scandinavia was one of the last geographic areas in Europe to become habitable
      for humans after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, the routes and genetic 
      composition of these postglacial migrants remain unclear. We sequenced the
      genomes, up to 57x coverage, of seven hunter-gatherers excavated across
      Scandinavia and dated from 9,500-6,000 years before present (BP). Surprisingly,
      among the Scandinavian Mesolithic individuals, the genetic data display an
      east-west genetic gradient that opposes the pattern seen in other parts of
      Mesolithic Europe. Our results suggest two different early postglacial migrations
      into Scandinavia: initially from the south, and later, from the northeast. The
      latter followed the ice-free Norwegian north Atlantic coast, along which novel
      and advanced pressure-blade stone-tool techniques may have spread. These two
      groups met and mixed in Scandinavia, creating a genetically diverse population,
      which shows patterns of genetic adaptation to high latitude environments. These
      potential adaptations include high frequencies of low pigmentation variants and a
      gene region associated with physical performance, which shows strong continuity
      into modern-day northern Europeans.

      marine algae.
PG  - e2003502
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003502 [doi]
AB  - The smallest algae, less than 3 mum in diameter, are the most abundant eukaryotes
      of the World Ocean. Their feeding on planktonic bacteria of similar size is
      globally important but physically enigmatic. Tiny algal cells tightly packed with
      the voluminous chloroplasts, nucleus, and mitochondria appear to have
      insufficient organelle-free space for prey internalization. Here, we present the 
      first direct observations of how the 1.3-mum algae, which are only 1.6 times
      bigger in diameter than their prey, hold individual Prochlorococcus cells in
      their open hemispheric cytostomes. We explain this semi-extracellular
      phagocytosis by the cell size limitation of the predatory alga, identified as the
      Braarudosphaera haptophyte with a nitrogen (N2)-fixing endosymbiont. Because the 
      observed semi-extracellular phagocytosis differs from all other types of
      protistan phagocytosis, we propose to name it "pomacytosis" (from the Greek
      piomegamualpha for "plug").

PG  - e2002226
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002226 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal migration during embryonic development contributes to functional brain
      circuitry. Many neurons migrate in morphologically distinct stages that coincide 
      with differentiation, requiring tight spatial regulation. It had been proposed
      that neurotransmitter-mediated activity could exert this control. Here, we
      demonstrate that intracellular calcium transients occur in cerebellar neurons of 
      zebrafish embryos during migration. We show that depolarization increases and
      hyperpolarization reduces the speed of tegmental hindbrain neurons using
      optogenetic tools and advanced track analysis optimized for in vivo migration.
      Finally, we introduce a compound screening assay to identify acetylcholine (ACh),
      glutamate, and glycine as regulators of migration, which act regionally along the
      neurons' route. We summarize our findings in a model describing how different
      neurotransmitters spatially interact to control neuronal migration. The high
      evolutionary conservation of the cerebellum and hindbrain makes it likely that
      polarization state-driven motility constitutes an important principle in building
      a functional brain.

PG  - e2004218
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004218 [doi]
AB  - One goal of modern day neuroscience is the establishment of molecular maps that
      assign unique features to individual neuron types. Such maps provide important
      starting points for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for
      developmental studies aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms of neuron
      identity acquisition and neuron identity diversification. In this resource paper,
      we describe a nervous system-wide map of the potential expression sites of 244
      members of the largest gene family in the C. elegans genome, rhodopsin-like
      (class A) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) chemoreceptors, using classic gfp
      reporter gene technology. We cover representatives of all sequence families of
      chemoreceptor GPCRs, some of which were previously entirely uncharacterized. Most
      reporters are expressed in a very restricted number of cells, often just in
      single cells. We assign GPCR reporter expression to all but two of the 37 sensory
      neuron classes of the sex-shared, core nervous system. Some sensory neurons
      express a very small number of receptors, while others, particularly nociceptive 
      neurons, coexpress several dozen GPCR reporter genes. GPCR reporters are also
      expressed in a wide range of inter- and motorneurons, as well as non-neuronal
      cells, suggesting that GPCRs may constitute receptors not just for environmental 
      signals, but also for internal cues. We observe only one notable, frequent
      association of coexpression patterns, namely in one nociceptive amphid (ASH) and 
      two nociceptive phasmid sensory neurons (PHA, PHB). We identified GPCRs with
      sexually dimorphic expression and several GPCR reporters that are expressed in a 
      left/right asymmetric manner. We identified a substantial degree of GPCR
      expression plasticity; particularly in the context of the environmentally-induced
      dauer diapause stage when one third of all tested GPCRs alter the cellular
      specificity of their expression within and outside the nervous system.
      Intriguingly, in a number of cases, the dauer-specific alterations of GPCR
      reporter expression in specific neuron classes are maintained during postdauer
      life and in some case new patterns are induced post-dauer, demonstrating that
      GPCR gene expression may serve as traits of life history. Taken together, our
      resource provides an entry point for functional studies and also offers a host of
      molecular markers for studying molecular patterning and plasticity of the nervous
      system.

TI  - Calmodulin fishing with a structurally disordered bait triggers CyaA catalysis.
PG  - e2004486
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004486 [doi]
AB  - Once translocated into the cytosol of target cells, the catalytic domain (AC) of 
      the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA), a major virulence factor of Bordetella
      pertussis, is potently activated by binding calmodulin (CaM) to produce
      supraphysiological levels of cAMP, inducing cell death. Using a combination of
      small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass
      spectrometry (HDX-MS), and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SR-CD), we
      show that, in the absence of CaM, AC exhibits significant structural disorder,
      and a 75-residue-long stretch within AC undergoes a disorder-to-order transition 
      upon CaM binding. Beyond this local folding, CaM binding induces long-range
      allosteric effects that stabilize the distant catalytic site, whilst preserving
      catalytic loop flexibility. We propose that the high enzymatic activity of AC is 
      due to a tight balance between the CaM-induced decrease of structural flexibility
      around the catalytic site and the preservation of catalytic loop flexibility,
      allowing for fast substrate binding and product release. The CaM-induced
      dampening of AC conformational disorder is likely relevant to other CaM-activated
      enzymes.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003691 [doi]
AB  - Developmental biology (including embryology) is proposed as "the stem cell of
      biological disciplines." Genetics, cell biology, oncology, immunology,
      evolutionary mechanisms, neurobiology, and systems biology each has its ancestry 
      in developmental biology. Moreover, developmental biology continues to roll on,
      budding off more disciplines, while retaining its own identity. While its
      descendant disciplines differentiate into sciences with a restricted set of
      paradigms, examples, and techniques, developmental biology remains vigorous,
      pluripotent, and relatively undifferentiated. In many disciplines, especially in 
      evolutionary biology and oncology, the developmental perspective is being
      reasserted as an important research program.

TI  - A new vesicle trafficking regulator CTL1 plays a crucial role in ion homeostasis.
PG  - e2002978
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002978 [doi]
AB  - Ion homeostasis is essential for plant growth and environmental adaptation, and
      maintaining ion homeostasis requires the precise regulation of various ion
      transporters, as well as correct root patterning. However, the mechanisms
      underlying these processes remain largely elusive. Here, we reported that a
      choline transporter gene, CTL1, controls ionome homeostasis by regulating the
      secretory trafficking of proteins required for plasmodesmata (PD) development, as
      well as the transport of some ion transporters. Map-based cloning studies
      revealed that CTL1 mutations alter the ion profile of Arabidopsis thaliana. We
      found that the phenotypes associated with these mutations are caused by a
      combination of PD defects and ion transporter misregulation. We also established 
      that CTL1 is involved in regulating vesicle trafficking and is thus required for 
      the trafficking of proteins essential for ion transport and PD development.
      Characterizing choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) as a new regulator of protein
      sorting may enable researchers to understand not only ion homeostasis in plants
      but also vesicle trafficking in general.

      antibiotic resistance challenge.
PG  - e2003533
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003533 [doi]
AB  - Alternative therapeutics for infectious diseases is a top priority, but what
      infections should be the primary targets? At present there is a focus on
      therapies for severe infections, for which effective treatment is most needed,
      but these infections are hard to manage, and progress has been limited. Here, we 
      explore a different approach. Applying an evolutionary perspective to a review of
      antibiotic prescription studies, we identify infections that likely make a large 
      contribution to resistance evolution across multiple taxa but are clinically mild
      and thus present easier targets for therapeutics development. Alternative
      therapeutics for these infections, we argue, would save lives indirectly by
      preserving the high efficacy of existing antibiotics for the patients who need
      them the most.

TI  - Common genes associated with antidepressant response in mouse and man identify
      key role of glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity.
PG  - e2002690
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002690 [doi]
AB  - Response to antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD) cannot be
      predicted currently, leading to uncertainty in medication selection, increasing
      costs, and prolonged suffering for many patients. Despite tremendous efforts in
      identifying response-associated genes in large genome-wide association studies,
      the results have been fairly modest, underlining the need to establish
      conceptually novel strategies. For the identification of transcriptome signatures
      that can distinguish between treatment responders and nonresponders, we herein
      submit a novel animal experimental approach focusing on extreme phenotypes. We
      utilized the large variance in response to antidepressant treatment occurring in 
      DBA/2J mice, enabling sample stratification into subpopulations of good and poor 
      treatment responders to delineate response-associated signature transcript
      profiles in peripheral blood samples. As a proof of concept, we translated our
      murine data to the transcriptome data of a clinically relevant human cohort. A
      cluster of 259 differentially regulated genes was identified when peripheral
      transcriptome profiles of good and poor treatment responders were compared in the
      murine model. Differences in expression profiles from baseline to week 12 of the 
      human orthologues selected on the basis of the murine transcript signature
      allowed prediction of response status with an accuracy of 76% in the patient
      population. Finally, we show that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated genes
      are significantly enriched in this cluster of antidepressant-response genes. Our 
      findings point to the involvement of GR sensitivity as a potential key mechanism 
      shaping response to antidepressant treatment and support the hypothesis that
      antidepressants could stimulate resilience-promoting molecular mechanisms. Our
      data highlight the suitability of an appropriate animal experimental approach for
      the discovery of treatment response-associated pathways across species.

TI  - Arabidopsis choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) regulates secretory trafficking of 
      auxin transporters to control seedling growth.
PG  - e2004310
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004310 [doi]
AB  - Auxin controls a myriad of plant developmental processes and plant response to
      environmental conditions. Precise trafficking of auxin transporters is essential 
      for auxin homeostasis in plants. Here, we report characterization of Arabidopsis 
      CTL1, which controls seedling growth and apical hook development by regulating
      intracellular trafficking of PIN-type auxin transporters. The CTL1 gene encodes a
      choline transporter-like protein with an expression pattern highly correlated
      with auxin distribution and is enriched in shoot and root apical meristems,
      lateral root primordia, the vascular system, and the concave side of the apical
      hook. The choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) protein is localized to the
      trans-Golgi network (TGN), prevacuolar compartment (PVC), and plasma membrane
      (PM). Disruption of CTL1 gene expression alters the trafficking of 2 auxin efflux
      transporters-Arabidopsis PM-located auxin efflux transporter PIN-formed 1 (PIN1) 
      and Arabidopsis PM-located auxin efflux transporter PIN-formed 3 (PIN3)-to the
      PM, thereby affecting auxin distribution and plant growth and development. We
      further found that phospholipids, sphingolipids, and other membrane lipids were
      significantly altered in the ctl1 mutant, linking CTL1 function to lipid
      homeostasis. We propose that CTL1 regulates protein sorting from the TGN to the
      PM through its function in lipid homeostasis.

TI  - Full mutational mapping of titratable residues helps to identify proton-sensors
      involved in the control of channel gating in the Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric
      ligand-gated ion channel.
PG  - e2004470
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004470 [doi]
AB  - The Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) has been extensively
      studied by X-ray crystallography and other biophysical techniques. This provided 
      key insights into the general gating mechanism of pentameric ligand-gated ion
      channel (pLGIC) signal transduction. However, the GLIC is activated by lowering
      the pH and the location of its putative proton activation site(s) still remain(s)
      unknown. To this end, every Asp, Glu, and His residue was mutated individually or
      in combination and investigated by electrophysiology. In addition to the
      mutational analysis, key mutations were structurally resolved to address whether 
      particular residues contribute to proton sensing, or alternatively to
      GLIC-gating, independently of the side chain protonation. The data show that
      multiple residues located below the orthosteric site, notably E26, D32, E35, and 
      D122 in the lower part of the extracellular domain (ECD), along with E222, H235, 
      E243, and H277 in the transmembrane domain (TMD), alter GLIC activation. D122 and
      H235 were found to also alter GLIC expression. E35 is identified as a key
      proton-sensing residue, whereby neutralization of its side chain carboxylate
      stabilizes the active state. Thus, proton activation occurs allosterically to the
      orthosteric site, at the level of multiple loci with a key contribution of the
      coupling interface between the ECD and TMD.

PG  - e2003671
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003671 [doi]
AB  - Strong evidence now supports the notion that organophosphate pesticides damage
      the fetal brain and produce cognitive and behavioral dysfunction through multiple
      mechanisms, including thyroid disruption. A regulatory ban was proposed, but
      actions to end the use of one such pesticide, chlorpyrifos, in agriculture were
      recently stopped by the Environmental Protection Agency under false scientific
      pretenses. This manuscript describes the costs and consequences of this policy
      failure and notes how this case study is emblematic of a broader dismissal of
      scientific evidence and attacks on scientific norms. Scientists have a
      responsibility to rebut and decry these serious challenges to human health and
      scientific integrity.

      children from the potential adverse effects of pesticide exposure?
PG  - e2004741
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004741 [doi]
AB  - California has proposed limiting agricultural pesticide use within 0.4 km of
      schools and childcare facilities. However, the 0.4-km buffer may not be
      appropriate for all pesticides because of differing toxicities, fate, and
      application methods. Living near pesticide use has been associated with poorer
      birth outcomes, neurodevelopment, and respiratory function in children. More
      research about exposures in schools, childcare facilities, and homes is needed.
      Despite incomplete science, this regulation is an important step to reduce
      potential exposures to children. The most vulnerable exposure period may be in
      utero, and future regulations should also aim to reduce exposures to pregnant
      women.

AB  - The American diet has changed dramatically since 1958, when Congress gave the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to ensure the
      safety of chemicals in food. Since then, thousands of chemicals have entered the 
      food system. Yet their long-term, chronic effects have been woefully
      understudied, their health risks inadequately assessed. The FDA has been sluggish
      in considering scientific knowledge about the impact of exposures-particularly at
      low levels and during susceptible developmental stages. The agency's failure to
      adequately account for the risks of perchlorate-a well-characterized
      endocrine-disrupting chemical-to vulnerable populations is representative of
      systemic problems plaguing the regulation of chemicals in food. Today, we are
      faced with a regulatory system that, weakened by decades of limited resources,
      has fallen short of fully enforcing its mandates. The FDA's inability to
      effectively manage the safety of hundreds of chemicals is putting our children's 
      health at risk.

TI  - Key scientific issues in developing drinking water guidelines for perfluoroalkyl 
      acids: Contaminants of emerging concern.
PG  - e2002855
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002855 [doi]
AB  - Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), a group of synthetic organic chemicals with
      industrial and commercial uses, are of current concern because of increasing
      awareness of their presence in drinking water and their potential to cause
      adverse health effects. PFAAs are distinctive among persistent, bioaccumulative, 
      and toxic (PBT) contaminants because they are water soluble and do not break down
      in the environment. This commentary discusses scientific and risk assessment
      issues that impact the development of drinking water guidelines for PFAAs,
      including choice of toxicological endpoints, uncertainty factors, and exposure
      assumptions used as their basis. In experimental animals, PFAAs cause toxicity to
      the liver, the immune, endocrine, and male reproductive systems, and the
      developing fetus and neonate. Low-dose effects include persistent delays in
      mammary gland development (perfluorooctanoic acid; PFOA) and suppression of
      immune response (perfluorooctane sulfonate; PFOS). In humans, even general
      population level exposures to some PFAAs are associated with health effects such 
      as increased serum lipids and liver enzymes, decreased vaccine response, and
      decreased birth weight. Ongoing exposures to even relatively low drinking water
      concentrations of long-chain PFAAs substantially increase human body burdens,
      which remain elevated for many years after exposure ends. Notably, infants are a 
      sensitive subpopulation for PFAA's developmental effects and receive higher
      exposures than adults from the same drinking water source. This information, as
      well as emerging data from future studies, should be considered in the

AB  - Sixty-five years after Turing first revealed the potential of systems with local 
      activation and long-range inhibition to generate pattern, we have only recently
      begun to identify the biological elements that operate at many scales to generate
      periodic patterns in nature. In this Primer, we first review the theoretical
      framework provided by Turing, Meinhardt, and others that suggests how periodic
      patterns could self-organize in developing animals. This Primer was developed to 
      provide context for recent studies that reveal how diverse molecular, cellular,
      and physical mechanisms contribute to the establishment of the periodic pattern
      of hair or feather buds in the developing skin. From an initial emphasis on
      trying to disambiguate which specific mechanism plays a primary role in hair or
      feather bud development, we are beginning to discover that multiple mechanisms
      may, in at least some contexts, operate together. While the emergence of the
      diverse mechanisms underlying pattern formation in specific biological contexts
      probably reflects the contingencies of evolutionary history, an intriguing
      possibility is that these mechanisms interact and reinforce each other, producing
      emergent systems that are more robust.

TI  - Communication across the bacterial cell envelope depends on the size of the
      periplasm.
PG  - e2004303
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004303 [doi]
AB  - The cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria, a structure comprising an outer (OM)
      and an inner (IM) membrane, is essential for life. The OM and the IM are
      separated by the periplasm, a compartment that contains the peptidoglycan. The OM
      is tethered to the peptidoglycan via the lipoprotein, Lpp. However, the
      importance of the envelope's multilayered architecture remains unknown. Here,
      when we removed physical coupling between the OM and the peptidoglycan, cells
      lost the ability to sense defects in envelope integrity. Further experiments
      revealed that the critical parameter for the transmission of stress signals from 
      the envelope to the cytoplasm, where cellular behaviour is controlled, is the
      IM-to-OM distance. Augmenting this distance by increasing the length of the
      lipoprotein Lpp destroyed signalling, whereas simultaneously increasing the
      length of the stress-sensing lipoprotein RcsF restored signalling. Our results
      demonstrate the physiological importance of the size of the periplasm. They also 
      reveal that strict control over the IM-to-OM distance is required for effective
      envelope surveillance and protection, suggesting that cellular architecture and
      the structure of transenvelope protein complexes have been evolutionarily
      co-optimised for correct function. Similar strategies are likely at play in
      cellular compartments surrounded by 2 concentric membranes, such as chloroplasts 
      and mitochondria.

AB  - Epidemiological studies play an important role in quantifying how early life
      environmental chemical exposures influence the risk of childhood diseases. These 
      studies face at least four major challenges that can produce noise when trying to
      identify signals of associations between chemical exposure and childhood health. 
      Challenges include accurately estimating chemical exposure, confounding from
      causes of both exposure and disease, identifying periods of heightened
      vulnerability to chemical exposures, and determining the effects of chemical
      mixtures. We provide recommendations that will aid in identifying these signals
      with more precision.

PG  - e2003066
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003066 [doi]
AB  - Over the past 3 decades, in a series of studies on some of the most extensively
      studied toxic chemicals and pollutants, scientists have found that the amount of 
      toxic chemical linked with the development of a disease or death-which is central
      to determining "safe" or "hazardous" levels-is proportionately greater at the
      lowest dose or levels of exposure. These results, which are contrary to the way
      the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory
      agencies assess the risk of chemicals, indicate that we have underestimated the
      impact of toxic chemicals on death and disease. If widely disseminated chemicals 
      and pollutants-like radon, lead, airborne particles, asbestos, tobacco, and
      benzene-do not exhibit a threshold and are proportionately more toxic at the
      lowest levels of exposure, we will need to achieve near-zero exposures to protect
      public health.

TI  - Unique double concentric ring organization of light harvesting complexes in
      Gemmatimonas phototrophica.
PG  - e2003943
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003943 [doi]
AB  - The majority of life on Earth depends directly or indirectly on the sun as a
      source of energy. The initial step of photosynthesis is facilitated by
      light-harvesting complexes, which capture and transfer light energy into the
      reaction centers (RCs). Here, we analyzed the organization of photosynthetic (PS)
      complexes in the bacterium G. phototrophica, which so far is the only
      phototrophic representative of the bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadetes. The
      isolated complex has a molecular weight of about 800 +/- 100 kDa, which is
      approximately 2 times larger than the core complex of Rhodospirillum rubrum. The 
      complex contains 62.4 +/- 4.7 bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a molecules absorbing in
      2 distinct infrared absorption bands with maxima at 816 and 868 nm. Using
      femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we determined the energy transfer 
      time between these spectral bands as 2 ps. Single particle analyses of the
      purified complexes showed that they were circular structures with an outer
      diameter of approximately 18 nm and a thickness of 7 nm. Based on the obtained,
      we propose that the light-harvesting complexes in G. phototrophica form 2
      concentric rings surrounding the type 2 RC. The inner ring (corresponding to the 
      B868 absorption band) is composed of 15 subunits and is analogous to the inner
      light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1) in purple bacteria. The outer ring is composed
      of 15 more distant BChl dimers with no or slow energy transfer between them,
      resulting in the B816 absorption band. This completely unique and elegant
      organization offers good structural stability, as well as high efficiency of
      light harvesting. Our results reveal that while the PS apparatus of
      Gemmatimonadetes was acquired via horizontal gene transfer from purple bacteria, 
      it later evolved along its own pathway, devising a new arrangement of its light
      harvesting complexes.

      multispecies comparison of type I interferon responses.
PG  - e2004086
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004086 [doi]
AB  - The host innate immune response mediated by type I interferon (IFN) and the
      resulting up-regulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) provide
      an immediate barrier to virus infection. Studies of the type I 'interferome' have
      mainly been carried out at a single species level, often lacking the power
      necessary to understand key evolutionary features of this pathway. Here, using a 
      single experimental platform, we determined the properties of the interferomes of
      multiple vertebrate species and developed a webserver to mine the dataset. This
      approach revealed a conserved 'core' of 62 ISGs, including genes not previously
      associated with IFN, underscoring the ancestral functions associated with this
      antiviral host response. We show that gene expansion contributes to the evolution
      of the IFN system and that interferomes are shaped by lineage-specific pressures.
      Consequently, each mammal possesses a unique repertoire of ISGs, including genes 
      common to all mammals and others unique to their specific species or phylogenetic
      lineages. An analysis of genes commonly down-regulated by IFN suggests that
      epigenetic regulation of transcription is a fundamental aspect of the IFN
      response. Our study provides a resource for the scientific community highlighting
      key paradigms of the type I IFN response.

AB  - After 40 years, the 1976 US Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was revised under
      the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. Its original
      goals of protecting the public from hazardous chemicals were hindered by complex 
      and cumbersome administrative burdens, data limitations, vulnerabilities in risk 
      assessments, and recurring corporate lawsuits. As a result, countless chemicals
      were entered into commercial use without toxicological information. Few chemicals
      of the many identified as potential public health threats were regulated or
      banned. This paper explores the factors that have worked against a comprehensive 
      and rational policy for regulating toxic chemicals and discusses whether the TSCA
      revisions offer greater public protection against existing and new chemicals.

TI  - Tongue-driven sonar beam steering by a lingual-echolocating fruit bat.
PG  - e2003148
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003148 [doi]
AB  - Animals enhance sensory acquisition from a specific direction by movements of
      head, ears, or eyes. As active sensing animals, echolocating bats also aim their 
      directional sonar beam to selectively "illuminate" a confined volume of space,
      facilitating efficient information processing by reducing echo interference and
      clutter. Such sonar beam control is generally achieved by head movements or shape
      changes of the sound-emitting mouth or nose. However, lingual-echolocating
      Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus, which produce sound by clicking their
      tongue, can dramatically change beam direction at very short temporal intervals
      without visible morphological changes. The mechanism supporting this capability
      has remained a mystery. Here, we measured signals from free-flying Egyptian fruit
      bats and discovered a systematic angular sweep of beam focus across increasing
      frequency. This unusual signal structure has not been observed in other animals
      and cannot be explained by the conventional and widely-used "piston model" that
      describes the emission pattern of other bat species. Through modeling, we show
      that the observed beam features can be captured by an array of tongue-driven
      sound sources located along the side of the mouth, and that the sonar beam
      direction can be steered parsimoniously by inducing changes to the pattern of
      phase differences through moving tongue location. The effects are broadly similar
      to those found in a phased array-an engineering design widely found in human-made
      sonar systems that enables beam direction changes without changes in the physical
      transducer assembly. Our study reveals an intriguing parallel between biology and
      human engineering in solving problems in fundamentally similar ways.

      heterogeneity in yeast responding to stress.
PG  - e2004050
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004050 [doi]
AB  - From bacteria to humans, individual cells within isogenic populations can show
      significant variation in stress tolerance, but the nature of this heterogeneity
      is not clear. To investigate this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify
      transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with
      and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular
      covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the
      extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant
      regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We 
      also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of
      ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly
      correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic
      cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators,
      including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1,
      revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together
      with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular 
      filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a
      stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed
      cells.

      transparency in in vivo biomedical research.

AB  - In the European Union (EU), animal welfare is seen as a matter of great
      importance. However, with respect to animal experimentation, European citizens
      feel quite uninformed. The European Directive 2010/63/EU for the protection of
      laboratory animals aims for greater transparency and requires that a
      comprehensible, nontechnical summary (NTS) of each authorised research project
      involving animals is published by the respective Member State. However, the NTSs 
      remain sleeping beauties if their contents are not easily and systematically
      accessible. The German web-based NTS database AnimalTestInfo is a unique channel 
      for scientists to communicate their work, and provides the opportunity for
      large-scale analyses of planned animal studies to inform researchers and the
      public. For an in-depth meta-analysis, we classified the duly completed NTSs
      submitted to AnimalTestInfo in 2014 and 2015 according to the International
      Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) system. Indexing the
      NTSs with ICD codes provided a fine-grained overview of the prospective uses of
      experimental animals. Using this approach, transparency, especially for highly
      controversial animal research involving, for example, nonhuman primates, is
      fostered, as it enables pinpointing the envisaged beneficiary down to the level
      of the addressed disease. Moreover, research areas with many planned projects
      involving animals can be specified in detail. The development of 3R (replacement,
      reduction, and refinement) measures in these research areas may be most
      efficient, as a large number of experimental animals would benefit from it.
      Indexing NTSs with ICD codes can support governments and funding agencies in
      advancing target-oriented funding of 3R research. Data drawn from NTSs can
      provide a basis for the development, validation, and implementation of directed
      3R strategies as well as guidance for rethinking the role of animal research
      models.

PG  - e2002039
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002039 [doi]
AB  - Growing cells are subject to cycles of nutrient depletion and repletion. A
      shortage of nutrients activates a starvation program that promotes growth in
      limiting conditions. To examine whether nutrient-deprived cells prepare also for 
      their subsequent recovery, we followed the transcription program activated in
      budding yeast transferred to low-phosphate media and defined its contribution to 
      cell growth during phosphate limitation and upon recovery. An initial
      transcription wave was induced by moderate phosphate depletion that did not
      affect cell growth. A second transcription wave followed when phosphate became
      growth limiting. The starvation program contributed to growth only in the second,
      growth-limiting phase. Notably, the early response, activated at moderate
      depletion, promoted recovery from starvation by increasing phosphate influx upon 
      transfer to rich medium. Our results suggest that cells subject to nutrient
      depletion prepare not only for growth in the limiting conditions but also for
      their predicted recovery once nutrients are replenished.

AB  - The scholars comprising journal editorial boards play a critical role in defining
      the trajectory of knowledge in their field. Nevertheless, studies of editorial
      board composition remain rare, especially those focusing on journals publishing
      research in the increasingly globalized fields of science, technology,
      engineering, and math (STEM). Using metrics for quantifying the diversity of
      ecological communities, we quantified international representation on the
      1985-2014 editorial boards of 24 environmental biology journals. Over the course 
      of 3 decades, there were 3,827 unique scientists based in 70 countries who served
      as editors. The size of the editorial community increased over time-the number of
      editors serving in 2014 was 4-fold greater than in 1985-as did the number of
      countries in which editors were based. Nevertheless, editors based outside the
      "Global North" (the group of economically developed countries with high per
      capita gross domestic product [GDP] that collectively concentrate most global
      wealth) were extremely rare. Furthermore, 67.18% of all editors were based in
      either the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, geographic
      diversity-already low in 1985-remained unchanged through 2014. We argue that this
      limited geographic diversity can detrimentally affect the creativity of
      scholarship published in journals, the progress and direction of research, the
      composition of the STEM workforce, and the development of science in Latin
      America, Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia (i.e., the "Global South").

TI  - Disentangling metabolic functions of bacteria in the honey bee gut.
PG  - e2003467
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003467 [doi]
AB  - It is presently unclear how much individual community members contribute to the
      overall metabolic output of a gut microbiota. To address this question, we used
      the honey bee, which harbors a relatively simple and remarkably conserved gut
      microbiota with striking parallels to the mammalian system and importance for bee
      health. Using untargeted metabolomics, we profiled metabolic changes in
      gnotobiotic bees that were colonized with the complete microbiota reconstituted
      from cultured strains. We then determined the contribution of individual
      community members in mono-colonized bees and recapitulated our findings using in 
      vitro cultures. Our results show that the honey bee gut microbiota utilizes a
      wide range of pollen-derived substrates, including flavonoids and outer pollen
      wall components, suggesting a key role for degradation of recalcitrant secondary 
      plant metabolites and pollen digestion. In turn, multiple species were
      responsible for the accumulation of organic acids and aromatic compound
      degradation intermediates. Moreover, a specific gut symbiont, Bifidobacterium
      asteroides, stimulated the production of host hormones known to impact bee
      development. While we found evidence for cross-feeding interactions,
      approximately 80% of the identified metabolic changes were also observed in
      mono-colonized bees, with Lactobacilli being responsible for the largest share of
      the metabolic output. These results show that, despite prolonged evolutionary
      associations, honey bee gut bacteria can independently establish and metabolize a
      wide range of compounds in the gut. Our study reveals diverse bacterial functions
      that are likely to contribute to bee health and provide fundamental insights into
      how metabolic activities are partitioned within gut communities.

TI  - The Ink4a/Arf locus operates as a regulator of the circadian clock modulating RAS
      activity.
PG  - e2002940
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002940 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian circadian clock and the cell cycle are two major biological
      oscillators whose coupling influences cell fate decisions. In the present study, 
      we use a model-driven experimental approach to investigate the interplay between 
      clock and cell cycle components and the dysregulatory effects of RAS on this
      coupled system. In particular, we focus on the Ink4a/Arf locus as one of the
      bridging clock-cell cycle elements. Upon perturbations by the rat sarcoma viral
      oncogene (RAS), differential effects on the circadian phenotype were observed in 
      wild-type and Ink4a/Arf knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which could
      be reproduced by our modelling simulations and correlated with opposing cell
      cycle fate decisions. Interestingly, the observed changes can be attributed to in
      silico phase shifts in the expression of core-clock elements. A genome-wide
      analysis revealed a set of differentially expressed genes that form an intricate 
      network with the circadian system with enriched pathways involved in opposing
      cell cycle phenotypes. In addition, a machine learning approach complemented by
      cell cycle analysis classified the observed cell cycle fate decisions as
      dependent on Ink4a/Arf and the oncogene RAS and highlighted a putative
      fine-tuning role of Bmal1 as an elicitor of such processes, ultimately resulting 
      in increased cell proliferation in the Ink4a/Arf knock-out scenario. This
      indicates that the dysregulation of the core-clock might work as an enhancer of
      RAS-mediated regulation of the cell cycle. Our combined in silico and in vitro
      approach highlights the important role of the circadian clock as an
      Ink4a/Arf-dependent modulator of oncogene-induced cell fate decisions,
      reinforcing its function as a tumour-suppressor and the close interplay between
      the clock and the cell cycle network.

TI  - Slam protein dictates subcellular localization and translation of its own mRNA.
PG  - e2003315
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003315 [doi]
AB  - Many mRNAs specifically localize within the cytoplasm and are present in
      RNA-protein complexes. It is generally assumed that localization and complex
      formation of these RNAs are controlled by trans-acting proteins encoded by genes 
      different than the RNAs themselves. Here, we analyze slow as molasses (slam) mRNA
      that prominently colocalizes with its encoded protein at the basal cortical
      compartment during cellularization. The functional implications of this striking 
      colocalization have been unknown. Here, we show that slam mRNA translation is
      spatiotemporally controlled. We found that translation was largely restricted to 
      the onset of cellularization when Slam protein levels at the basal domain sharply
      increase. slam mRNA was translated locally, at least partially, as not yet
      translated mRNA transiently accumulated at the basal region. Slam RNA accumulated
      at the basal domain only if Slam protein was present. Furthermore, a slam RNA
      with impaired localization but full coding capacity was only weakly translated.
      We detected a biochemical interaction of slam mRNA and protein as demonstrated by
      specific co-immunoprecipitation from embryonic lysate. The intimate relationship 
      of slam mRNA and protein may constitute a positive feedback loop that facilitates
      and controls timely and rapid accumulation of Slam protein at the prospective
      basal region.

AB  - The brain is thought to generate internal predictions to optimize behaviour.
      However, it is unclear whether predictions signalling is an automatic brain
      function or depends on task demands. Here, we manipulated the spatial/temporal
      predictability of visual targets, and the relevance of spatial/temporal
      information provided by auditory cues. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to
      measure participants' brain activity during task performance. Task relevance
      modulated the influence of predictions on behaviour: spatial/temporal
      predictability improved spatial/temporal discrimination accuracy, but not vice
      versa. To explain these effects, we used behavioural responses to estimate
      subjective predictions under an ideal-observer model. Model-based time-series of 
      predictions and prediction errors (PEs) were associated with dissociable neural
      responses: predictions correlated with cue-induced beta-band activity in auditory
      regions and alpha-band activity in visual regions, while stimulus-bound PEs
      correlated with gamma-band activity in posterior regions. Crucially, task
      relevance modulated these spectral correlates, suggesting that current goals
      influence PE and prediction signalling.

      profiling in the Connectivity Map.

AB  - The application of RNA interference (RNAi) to mammalian cells has provided the
      means to perform phenotypic screens to determine the functions of genes. Although
      RNAi has revolutionized loss-of-function genetic experiments, it has been
      difficult to systematically assess the prevalence and consequences of off-target 
      effects. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) represents an unprecedented resource to
      study the gene expression consequences of expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs).
      Analysis of signatures for over 13,000 shRNAs applied in 9 cell lines revealed
      that microRNA (miRNA)-like off-target effects of RNAi are far stronger and more
      pervasive than generally appreciated. We show that mitigating off-target effects 
      is feasible in these datasets via computational methodologies to produce a
      consensus gene signature (CGS). In addition, we compared RNAi technology to
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based knockout 
      by analysis of 373 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in 6 cells lines and show that the 
      on-target efficacies are comparable, but CRISPR technology is far less
      susceptible to systematic off-target effects. These results will help guide the
      proper use and analysis of loss-of-function reagents for the determination of
      gene function.

TI  - Perceptual integration rapidly activates dorsal visual pathway to guide local
      processing in early visual areas.
PG  - e2003646
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003646 [doi]
AB  - Rapidly grouping local elements into an organized object (i.e., perceptual
      integration) is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially in noisy contexts.
      Previous studies demonstrate that ventral visual pathway, which is widely known
      to mediate object recognition, engages in the process by conveying object-level
      information processed in high-level areas to modulate low-level sensory areas.
      Meanwhile, recent evidence suggests that the dorsal visual pathway, which is not 
      typically attributable to object recognition, is also involved in the process.
      However, the underlying whole-brain fine spatiotemporal neuronal dynamics remains
      unknown. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in combination with
      a temporal response function (TRF) approach to dissociate the time-resolved
      neuronal response that specifically tracks the perceptual grouping course. We
      demonstrate that perceptual integration initiates robust and rapid responses
      along the dorsal visual pathway in a reversed hierarchical manner, faster than
      the ventral pathway. Specifically, the anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS)
      responds first (i.e., within 100 ms), followed by activities backpropagating
      along the dorsal pathway to early visual areas (EVAs). The IPS activity causally 
      modulates the EVA response, even when the global form information is
      task-irrelevant. The IPS-to-EVA response profile fails to appear when the global 
      form could not be perceived. Our results support the crucial function of the
      dorsal visual pathway in perceptual integration, by quickly extracting a coarse
      global template (i.e., an initial object representation) within first 100 ms to
      guide subsequent local sensory processing so that the ambiguities in the visual
      inputs can be efficiently resolved.

AB  - The Sonic Kayak is a musical instrument used to investigate nature and developed 
      during open hacklab events. The kayaks are rigged with underwater environmental
      sensors, which allow paddlers to hear real-time water temperature sonifications
      and underwater sounds, generating live music from the marine world. Sensor data
      is also logged every second with location, time and date, which allows for
      fine-scale mapping of water temperatures and underwater noise that was previously
      unattainable using standard research equipment. The system can be used as a
      citizen science data collection device, research equipment for professional
      scientists, or a sound art installation in its own right.

TI  - Regulation of actions and habits by ventral hippocampal trkB and adolescent
      corticosteroid exposure.
PG  - e2003000
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003000 [doi]
AB  - In humans and rodents, stress promotes habit-based behaviors that can interfere
      with action-outcome decision-making. Further, developmental stressor exposure
      confers long-term habit biases across rodent-primate species. Despite these
      homologies, mechanisms remain unclear. We first report that exposure to the
      primary glucocorticoid corticosterone (CORT) in adolescent mice recapitulates
      multiple neurobehavioral consequences of stressor exposure, including
      long-lasting biases towards habit-based responding in a food-reinforced operant
      conditioning task. In both adolescents and adults, CORT also caused a shift in
      the balance between full-length tyrosine kinase receptor B (trkB) and a truncated
      form of this neurotrophin receptor, favoring the inactive form throughout
      multiple corticolimbic brain regions. In adolescents, phosphorylation of the trkB
      substrate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 42/44 (ERK42/44) in the ventral
      hippocampus was also diminished, a long-term effect that persisted for at least
      12 wk. Administration of the trkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) during
      adolescence at doses that stimulated ERK42/44 corrected long-lasting
      corticosterone-induced behavioral abnormalities. Meanwhile, viral-mediated
      overexpression of truncated trkB in the ventral hippocampus reduced local
      ERK42/44 phosphorylation and was sufficient to induce habit-based and
      depression-like behaviors. Together, our findings indicate that ventral
      hippocampal trkB is essential to goal-directed action selection, countering
      habit-based behavior otherwise facilitated by developmental stress hormone
      exposure. They also reveal an early-life sensitive period during which
      trkB-ERK42/44 tone determines long-term behavioral outcomes.

TI  - Connectivity and systemic resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.
PG  - e2003355
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003355 [doi]
AB  - Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR) continues to suffer from repeated
      impacts of cyclones, coral bleaching, and outbreaks of the coral-eating
      crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), losing much of its coral cover in the process.
      This raises the question of the ecosystem's systemic resilience and its ability
      to rebound after large-scale population loss. Here, we reveal that around 100
      reefs of the GBR, or around 3%, have the ideal properties to facilitate recovery 
      of disturbed areas, thereby imparting a level of systemic resilience and aiding
      its continued recovery. These reefs (1) are highly connected by ocean currents to
      the wider reef network, (2) have a relatively low risk of exposure to
      disturbances so that they are likely to provide replenishment when other reefs
      are depleted, and (3) have an ability to promote recovery of desirable species
      but are unlikely to either experience or spread COTS outbreaks. The great
      replenishment potential of these 'robust source reefs', which may supply 47% of
      the ecosystem in a single dispersal event, emerges from the interaction between
      oceanographic conditions and geographic location, a process that is likely to be 
      repeated in other reef systems. Such natural resilience of reef systems will
      become increasingly important as the frequency of disturbances accelerates under 
      climate change.

TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoproducts determine antibiotic efficacy against
      Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - e2003981
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003981 [doi]
AB  - Chronic coinfections of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      frequently fail to respond to antibiotic treatment, leading to significant
      patient morbidity and mortality. Currently, the impact of interspecies
      interaction on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility remains poorly understood. In 
      this study, we utilize a panel of P. aeruginosa burn wound and cystic fibrosis
      (CF) lung isolates to demonstrate that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus
      susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner
      and further identify 3 independent interactions responsible for antagonizing or
      potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus. We find that P. aeruginosa
      LasA endopeptidase potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin, rhamnolipids
      facilitate proton-motive force-independent tobramycin uptake, and
      2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) induces multidrug tolerance in S.
      aureus through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP. We find that
      the production of each of these factors varies between clinical isolates and
      corresponds to the capacity of each isolate to alter S. aureus antibiotic
      susceptibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vancomycin treatment of a S.
      aureus mouse burn infection is potentiated by the presence of a LasA-producing P.
      aeruginosa population. These findings demonstrate that antibiotic susceptibility 
      is complex and dependent not only upon the genotype of the pathogen being
      targeted, but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the infection
      environment. Consideration of these interactions will improve the treatment of
      polymicrobial infections.

TI  - Nucleic acid purification from plants, animals and microbes in under 30 seconds.
PG  - e2003916
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003916 [doi]
AB  - Nucleic acid amplification is a powerful molecular biology tool, although its use
      outside the modern laboratory environment is limited due to the relatively
      cumbersome methods required to extract nucleic acids from biological samples. To 
      address this issue, we investigated a variety of materials for their suitability 
      for nucleic acid capture and purification. We report here that untreated
      cellulose-based paper can rapidly capture nucleic acids within seconds and retain
      them during a single washing step, while contaminants present in complex
      biological samples are quickly removed. Building on this knowledge, we have
      successfully created an equipment-free nucleic acid extraction dipstick
      methodology that can obtain amplification-ready DNA and RNA from plants, animals,
      and microbes from difficult biological samples such as blood and leaves from
      adult trees in less than 30 seconds. The simplicity and speed of this method as
      well as the low cost and availability of suitable materials (e.g., common paper
      towelling), means that nucleic acid extraction is now more accessible and
      affordable for researchers and the broader community. Furthermore, when combined 
      with recent advancements in isothermal amplification and naked eye DNA
      visualization techniques, the dipstick extraction technology makes performing
      molecular diagnostic assays achievable in limited resource settings including
      university and high school classrooms, field-based environments, and developing
      countries.

TI  - Sugar industry sponsorship of germ-free rodent studies linking sucrose to
      hyperlipidemia and cancer: An historical analysis of internal documents.
PG  - e2003460
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003460 [doi]
AB  - In 1965, the Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) secretly funded a review in the New 
      England Journal of Medicine that discounted evidence linking sucrose consumption 
      to blood lipid levels and hence coronary heart disease (CHD). SRF subsequently
      funded animal research to evaluate sucrose's CHD risks. The objective of this
      study was to examine the planning, funding, and internal evaluation of an
      SRF-funded research project titled "Project 259: Dietary Carbohydrate and Blood
      Lipids in Germ-Free Rats," led by Dr. W.F.R. Pover at the University of
      Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom, between 1967 and 1971. A narrative case
      study method was used to assess SRF Project 259 from 1967 to 1971 based on sugar 
      industry internal documents. Project 259 found a statistically significant
      decrease in serum triglycerides in germ-free rats fed a high sugar diet compared 
      to conventional rats fed a basic PRM diet (a pelleted diet containing cereal
      meals, soybean meals, whitefish meal, and dried yeast, fortified with a balanced 
      vitamin supplement and trace element mixture). The results suggested to SRF that 
      gut microbiota have a causal role in carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia. A
      study comparing conventional rats fed a high-sugar diet to those fed a
      high-starch diet suggested that sucrose consumption might be associated with
      elevated levels of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme previously associated with
      bladder cancer in humans. SRF terminated Project 259 without publishing the
      results. The sugar industry did not disclose evidence of harm from animal studies
      that would have (1) strengthened the case that the CHD risk of sucrose is greater
      than starch and (2) caused sucrose to be scrutinized as a potential carcinogen.
      The influence of the gut microbiota in the differential effects of sucrose and
      starch on blood lipids, as well as the influence of carbohydrate quality on
      beta-glucuronidase and cancer activity, deserve further scrutiny.

      science. This decade-long effort to increase student participation in collections
      demonstrates the mutual benefits of undergraduate involvement. Museums benefit
      from critical help in collections care and an increased intellectual vitality,
      while students simultaneously gain essential research skills and an unparalleled 
      exposure to biodiversity. Five first steps to creating a program are: dedicate a 
      coordinator, offer credit, diversify participation, create a tiered structure,
      and build community.

TI  - Drivers of genetic diversity in secondary metabolic gene clusters within a fungal
      species.
PG  - e2003583
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003583 [doi]
AB  - Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites (SMs) critical
      for defense, virulence, and communication. The metabolic pathways that produce
      SMs are found in contiguous gene clusters in fungal genomes, an atypical
      arrangement for metabolic pathways in other eukaryotes. Comparative studies of
      filamentous fungal species have shown that SM gene clusters are often either
      highly divergent or uniquely present in one or a handful of species, hampering
      efforts to determine the genetic basis and evolutionary drivers of SM gene
      cluster divergence. Here, we examined SM variation in 66 cosmopolitan strains of 
      a single species, the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.
      Investigation of genome-wide within-species variation revealed 5 general types of
      variation in SM gene clusters: nonfunctional gene polymorphisms; gene gain and
      loss polymorphisms; whole cluster gain and loss polymorphisms; allelic
      polymorphisms, in which different alleles corresponded to distinct, nonhomologous
      clusters; and location polymorphisms, in which a cluster was found to differ in
      its genomic location across strains. These polymorphisms affect the function of
      representative A. fumigatus SM gene clusters, such as those involved in the
      production of gliotoxin, fumigaclavine, and helvolic acid as well as the function
      of clusters with undefined products. In addition to enabling the identification
      of polymorphisms, the detection of which requires extensive genome-wide synteny
      conservation (e.g., mobile gene clusters and nonhomologous cluster alleles), our 
      approach also implicated multiple underlying genetic drivers, including point
      mutations, recombination, and genomic deletion and insertion events as well as
      horizontal gene transfer from distant fungi. Finally, most of the variants that
      we uncover within A. fumigatus have been previously hypothesized to contribute to
      SM gene cluster diversity across entire fungal classes and phyla. We suggest that
      the drivers of genetic diversity operating within a fungal species shown here are
      sufficient to explain SM cluster macroevolutionary patterns.

AB  - In 1961, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began to circulate biological
      preprints in a forgotten experiment called the Information Exchange Groups
      (IEGs). This system eventually attracted over 3,600 participants and saw the
      production of over 2,500 different documents, but by 1967, it was effectively
      shut down following the refusal of journals to accept articles that had been
      circulated as preprints. This article charts the rise and fall of the IEGs and
      explores the parallels with the 1990s and the biomedical preprint movement of
      today.

AB  - Interest in developing gene drive systems to control invasive species is growing,
      with New Zealand reportedly considering the nascent technology as a way to
      locally eliminate the mammalian pests that threaten its unique flora and fauna.
      If gene drives successfully eradicated these invasive populations, many would
      rejoice, but what are the possible consequences? Here, we explore the risk of
      accidental spread posed by self-propagating gene drive technologies, highlight
      new gene drive designs that might achieve better outcomes, and explain why we
      need open and international discussions concerning a technology that could have
      global ramifications.

TI  - Correlates of decisional dynamics in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
PG  - e2003091
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003091 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that during binary economic choice, decision makers use the first
      option they attend as a default to which they compare the second. To test this
      idea, we recorded activity of neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
      (dACC) of macaques choosing between gambles presented asynchronously. We find
      that ensemble encoding of the value of the first offer includes both
      choice-dependent and choice-independent aspects, as if reflecting a partial
      decision. That is, its responses are neither entirely pre- nor post-decisional.
      In contrast, coding of the value of the second offer is entirely decision
      dependent (i.e., post-decisional). This result holds even when offer-value
      encodings are compared within the same time period. Additionally, we see no
      evidence for 2 pools of neurons linked to the 2 offers; instead, all comparison
      appears to occur within a single functionally homogenous pool of task-selective
      neurons. These observations suggest that economic choices reflect a
      context-dependent evaluation of attended options. Moreover, they raise the
      possibility that value representations reflect, to some extent, a tentative
      commitment to a choice.

PG  - e2003476
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003476 [doi]
AB  - To thrive in an ever-changing environment, microbes must widely distribute their 
      progeny to colonize new territory. Simultaneously, they must evolve and adapt to 
      the stresses of unpredictable surroundings. In both of these regards, diversity
      is key-if an entire population moved together or responded to the environment in 
      the same way, it could easily go extinct. Here, we show that the epigenetic prion
      switch [SWI+] establishes a specialized subpopulation with a "pioneer" phenotypic
      program in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells in the pioneer state readily disperse 
      in water, enabling them to migrate and colonize new territory. Pioneers are also 
      more likely to find and mate with genetically diverse partners, as inhibited
      mating-type switching causes mother cells to shun their own daughters. In the
      nonprion [swi-] state, cells instead have a "settler" phenotype, forming
      protective flocs and tending to remain in their current position. Settler cells
      are better able to withstand harsh conditions like drought and alkaline pH. We
      propose that these laboratory observations reveal a strategy employed in the wild
      to rapidly diversify and grant distinct, useful roles to cellular subpopulations 
      that benefit the population as a whole.

PG  - e2004186

AB  - Together, malaria and the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) kill more than
      800,000 people annually, while creating long-term disability in millions more.
      International support for mass drug administration, bed nets, and other
      preventive measures has resulted in huge public health gains, while support for
      translational research is leading to the development of some new neglected
      disease drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines. However, funding for basic science
      research has not kept up, such that we are missing opportunities to create a more
      innovative pipeline of control tools for parasitic and related diseases. There is
      an urgent need to expand basic science approaches for neglected diseases,
      especially in the areas of systems biology and immunology; ecology, evolution,
      and mathematical biology; functional and comparative OMICs; gene editing;
      expanded use of model organisms; and a new single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA
      sequencing approach. The world's poor deserve access to innovation for neglected 
      diseases. It should be considered a fundamental human right.

TI  - Capacity of tTreg generation is not impaired in the atrophied thymus.

AB  - Postnatal thymic epithelial cell (TEC) homeostatic defect- or natural
      aging-induced thymic atrophy results in a decline in central T-cell tolerance
      establishment, which is constituted by thymocyte negative selection and cluster
      of differentiation (CD) 4+ thymic regulatory T (tTreg) cell generation. Emerging 
      evidence shows this decline mainly results from defects in negative selection,
      but there is insufficient evidence regarding whether tTreg cell generation is
      also impaired. We mechanistically studied tTreg cell generation in the atrophied 
      thymus by utilizing both postnatal TEC-defective (resulting from FoxN1-floxed
      conditional knockout [cKO]) and naturally aged mouse models. We found that the
      capacity of tTreg cell generation was not impaired compared to CD4+ thymic
      conventional T cells, suggesting thymic atrophy positively influences tTreg cell 
      generation. This is potentially attributed to decreased T cell receptor (TCR)
      signaling strength due to inefficiency in promiscuous expression of self-antigens
      or presenting a neo-self-antigen by medullary TECs, displaying decreased negative
      selection-related marker genes (Nur77 and CD5high) in CD4 single positive (SP)
      thymocytes. Our results provide evidence that the atrophied thymus attempts to
      balance the defective negative selection by enhancing tTreg cell generation to
      maintain central T-cell tolerance in the elderly. Once the balance is broken,
      age-related diseases could take place.

TI  - Stochastic loss and gain of symmetric divisions in the C. elegans epidermis
      perturbs robustness of stem cell number.
PG  - e2002429
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002429 [doi]
AB  - Biological systems are subject to inherent stochasticity. Nevertheless,
      development is remarkably robust, ensuring the consistency of key phenotypic
      traits such as correct cell numbers in a certain tissue. It is currently unclear 
      which genes modulate phenotypic variability, what their relationship is to core
      components of developmental gene networks, and what is the developmental basis of
      variable phenotypes. Here, we start addressing these questions using the robust
      number of Caenorhabditis elegans epidermal stem cells, known as seam cells, as a 
      readout. We employ genetics, cell lineage tracing, and single molecule imaging to
      show that mutations in lin-22, a Hes-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
      transcription factor, increase seam cell number variability. We show that the
      increase in phenotypic variability is due to stochastic conversion of normally
      symmetric cell divisions to asymmetric and vice versa during development, which
      affect the terminal seam cell number in opposing directions. We demonstrate that 
      LIN-22 acts within the epidermal gene network to antagonise the Wnt signalling
      pathway. However, lin-22 mutants exhibit cell-to-cell variability in Wnt pathway 
      activation, which correlates with and may drive phenotypic variability. Our study
      demonstrates the feasibility to study phenotypic trait variance in tractable
      model organisms using unbiased mutagenesis screens.

TI  - Glutamine deficiency induces DNA alkylation damage and sensitizes cancer cells to
      alkylating agents through inhibition of ALKBH enzymes.
PG  - e2002810
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002810 [doi]
AB  - Driven by oncogenic signaling, glutamine addiction exhibited by cancer cells
      often leads to severe glutamine depletion in solid tumors. Despite this
      nutritional environment that tumor cells often experience, the effect of
      glutamine deficiency on cellular responses to DNA damage and chemotherapeutic
      treatment remains unclear. Here, we show that glutamine deficiency, through the
      reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate, inhibits the AlkB homolog (ALKBH) enzymes
      activity and induces DNA alkylation damage. As a result, glutamine deprivation or
      glutaminase inhibitor treatment triggers DNA damage accumulation independent of
      cell death. In addition, low glutamine-induced DNA damage is abolished in ALKBH
      deficient cells. Importantly, we show that glutaminase inhibitors,
      6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) or CB-839, hypersensitize cancer cells to
      alkylating agents both in vitro and in vivo. Together, the crosstalk between
      glutamine metabolism and the DNA repair pathway identified in this study
      highlights a potential role of metabolic stress in genomic instability and
      therapeutic response in cancer.

TI  - Concurrent temporal channels for auditory processing: Oscillatory neural
      entrainment reveals segregation of function at different scales.
PG  - e2000812
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000812 [doi]
AB  - Natural sounds convey perceptually relevant information over multiple timescales,
      and the necessary extraction of multi-timescale information requires the auditory
      system to work over distinct ranges. The simplest hypothesis suggests that
      temporal modulations are encoded in an equivalent manner within a reasonable
      intermediate range. We show that the human auditory system selectively and
      preferentially tracks acoustic dynamics concurrently at 2 timescales
      corresponding to the neurophysiological theta band (4-7 Hz) and gamma band ranges
      (31-45 Hz) but, contrary to expectation, not at the timescale corresponding to
      alpha (8-12 Hz), which has also been found to be related to auditory perception. 
      Listeners heard synthetic acoustic stimuli with temporally modulated structures
      at 3 timescales (approximately 190-, approximately 100-, and approximately 30-ms 
      modulation periods) and identified the stimuli while undergoing
      magnetoencephalography recording. There was strong intertrial phase coherence in 
      the theta band for stimuli of all modulation rates and in the gamma band for
      stimuli with corresponding modulation rates. The alpha band did not respond in a 
      similar manner. Classification analyses also revealed that oscillatory phase
      reliably tracked temporal dynamics but not equivalently across rates. Finally,
      mutual information analyses quantifying the relation between phase and
      cochlear-scaled correlations also showed preferential processing in 2 distinct
      regimes, with the alpha range again yielding different patterns. The results
      support the hypothesis that the human auditory system employs (at least) a
      2-timescale processing mode, in which lower and higher perceptual sampling scales
      are segregated by an intermediate temporal regime in the alpha band that likely
      reflects different underlying computations.

TI  - Rate, not selectivity, determines neuronal population coding accuracy in auditory
      cortex.
PG  - e2002459
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002459 [doi]
AB  - The notion that neurons with higher selectivity carry more information about
      external sensory inputs is widely accepted in neuroscience. High-selectivity
      neurons respond to a narrow range of sensory inputs, and thus would be considered
      highly informative by rejecting a large proportion of possible inputs. In
      auditory cortex, neuronal responses are less selective immediately after the
      onset of a sound and then become highly selective in the following sustained
      response epoch. These 2 temporal response epochs have thus been interpreted to
      encode first the presence and then the content of a sound input. Contrary to
      predictions from that prevailing theory, however, we found that the neural
      population conveys similar information about sound input across the 2 epochs in
      spite of the neuronal selectivity differences. The amount of information encoded 
      turns out to be almost completely dependent upon the total number of population
      spikes in the read-out window for this system. Moreover, inhomogeneous Poisson
      spiking behavior is sufficient to account for this property. These results imply 
      a novel principle of sensory encoding that is potentially shared widely among
      multiple sensory systems.

AB  - How can we provide fertile ground for students to simultaneously explore a
      breadth of foundational knowledge, develop cross-disciplinary problem-solving
      skills, gain resiliency, and learn to work as a member of a team? One way is to
      integrate original research in the context of an undergraduate biochemistry
      course. In this Community Page, we discuss the development and execution of an
      interdisciplinary and cross-departmental undergraduate biochemistry laboratory
      course. We present a template for how a similar course can be replicated at other
      institutions and provide pedagogical and research results from a sample module in
      which we challenged our students to study the binding interface between 2
      important biosynthetic proteins. Finally, we address the community and invite
      others to join us in making a larger impact on undergraduate education and the
      field of biochemistry by coordinating efforts to integrate research and teaching 
      across campuses.

TI  - Crowd vocal learning induces vocal dialects in bats: Playback of conspecifics
      shapes fundamental frequency usage by pups.
PG  - e2002556
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002556 [doi]
AB  - Vocal learning, the substrate of human language acquisition, has rarely been
      described in other mammals. Often, group-specific vocal dialects in wild
      populations provide the main evidence for vocal learning. While social learning
      is often the most plausible explanation for these intergroup differences, it is
      usually impossible to exclude other driving factors, such as genetic or
      ecological backgrounds. Here, we show the formation of dialects through social
      vocal learning in fruit bats under controlled conditions. We raised 3 groups of
      pups in conditions mimicking their natural roosts. Namely, pups could hear their 
      mothers' vocalizations but were also exposed to a manipulation playback. The
      vocalizations in the 3 playbacks mainly differed in their fundamental frequency. 
      From the age of approximately 6 months and onwards, the pups demonstrated
      distinct dialects, where each group was biased towards its playback. We
      demonstrate the emergence of dialects through social learning in a mammalian
      model in a tightly controlled environment. Unlike in the extensively studied case
      of songbirds where specific tutors are imitated, we demonstrate that bats do not 
      only learn their vocalizations directly from their mothers, but that they are
      actually influenced by the sounds of the entire crowd. This process, which we
      term "crowd vocal learning," might be relevant to many other social animals such 
      as cetaceans and pinnipeds.

TI  - Prediction of drug cocktail effects when the number of measurements is limited.
PG  - e2002518
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002518 [doi]
AB  - Cocktails of drugs can be more effective than single drugs, because they can
      potentially work at lower doses and avoid resistance. However, it is impossible
      to test all drug cocktails drawn from a large set of drugs because of the huge
      number of combinations. To overcome this combinatorial explosion problem, one can
      sample a relatively small number of combinations and use a model to predict the
      rest. Recently, Zimmer and Katzir et al. presented a model that accurately
      predicted the effects of cocktails at all doses based on measuring pairs of
      drugs. This model requires measuring each pair at several different doses and
      uses interpolation to reduce experimental noise. However, often, it is not
      possible to measure each pair at multiple doses (for example, in scarce
      patient-derived tumor material or in large screens). Here, we ask whether
      measurements at only a single dose can also predict high-order drug cocktails. To
      address this, we present a fully factorial experimental dataset on all drug
      cocktails built of 6 chemotherapy drugs on 2 cancer cell lines. We develop a
      formula that uses only pair measurements at a single dose to predict much of the 
      variation up to 6-drug cocktails in the present data, outperforming commonly used
      Bliss independence and regression approaches. This model, called the pairs model,
      is an extension of the Bliss independence model to pairs: For M drugs, it equals 
      the product of all pair effects to the power 1/(M-1). The pairs model also shows 
      good agreement with previously published data on antibiotic triplets and
      quadruplets. The present model can only predict combinations at the same doses in
      which the pairs were measured and is not able to predict effects at other doses. 
      This study indicates that pair-based approaches might be able to usefully predict
      and prioritize high-order combinations, even in large screens or when material
      for testing is limited.

      education.
PG  - e1002614
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002614 [doi]
AB  - Open scholarship, such as the sharing of articles, code, data, and educational
      resources, has the potential to improve university research and education as well
      as increase the impact universities can have beyond their own walls. To support
      this perspective, I present evidence from case studies, published literature, and
      personal experiences as a practicing open scholar. I describe some of the
      challenges inherent to practicing open scholarship and some of the tensions
      created by incompatibilities between institutional policies and personal
      practice. To address this, I propose several concrete actions universities could 
      take to support open scholarship and outline ways in which such initiatives could
      benefit the public as well as institutions. Importantly, I do not think most of
      these actions would require new funding but rather a redistribution of existing
      funds and a rewriting of internal policies to better align with university
      missions of knowledge dissemination and societal impact.

TI  - Magnetoreception-A sense without a receptor.
PG  - e2003234
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003234 [doi]
AB  - Evolution has equipped life on our planet with an array of extraordinary senses, 
      but perhaps the least understood is magnetoreception. Despite compelling
      behavioral evidence that this sense exists, the cells, molecules, and mechanisms 
      that mediate sensory transduction remain unknown. So how could animals detect
      magnetic fields? We introduce and discuss 3 concepts that attempt to address this
      question: (1) a mechanically sensitive magnetite-based magnetoreceptor, (2) a
      light-sensitive chemical-based mechanism, and (3) electromagnetic induction
      within accessory structures. In discussing the merits and issues with each of
      these ideas, we draw on existing precepts in sensory biology. We argue that
      solving this scientific mystery will require the development of new genetic tools
      in magnetosensitive species, coupled with an interdisciplinary approach that
      bridges physics, behavior, anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, and genetics.

TI  - A molecular atlas of the developing ectoderm defines neural, neural crest,
      placode, and nonneural progenitor identity in vertebrates.
PG  - e2004045
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004045 [doi]
AB  - During vertebrate neurulation, the embryonic ectoderm is patterned into lineage
      progenitors for neural plate, neural crest, placodes and epidermis. Here, we use 
      Xenopus laevis embryos to analyze the spatial and temporal transcriptome of
      distinct ectodermal domains in the course of neurulation, during the
      establishment of cell lineages. In order to define the transcriptome of small
      groups of cells from a single germ layer and to retain spatial information,
      dorsal and ventral ectoderm was subdivided along the anterior-posterior and
      medial-lateral axes by microdissections. Principal component analysis on the
      transcriptomes of these ectoderm fragments primarily identifies embryonic axes
      and temporal dynamics. This provides a genetic code to define positional
      information of any ectoderm sample along the anterior-posterior and
      dorsal-ventral axes directly from its transcriptome. In parallel, we use
      nonnegative matrix factorization to predict enhanced gene expression maps onto
      early and mid-neurula embryos, and specific signatures for each ectoderm area.
      The clustering of spatial and temporal datasets allowed detection of multiple
      biologically relevant groups (e.g., Wnt signaling, neural crest development,
      sensory placode specification, ciliogenesis, germ layer specification). We
      provide an interactive network interface, EctoMap, for exploring synexpression
      relationships among genes expressed in the neurula, and suggest several
      strategies to use this comprehensive dataset to address questions in
      developmental biology as well as stem cell or cancer research.

AB  - Here, we present the use of ethoscopes, which are machines for high-throughput
      analysis of behavior in Drosophila and other animals. Ethoscopes provide a
      software and hardware solution that is reproducible and easily scalable. They
      perform, in real-time, tracking and profiling of behavior by using a supervised
      machine learning algorithm, are able to deliver behaviorally triggered stimuli to
      flies in a feedback-loop mode, and are highly customizable and open source.
      Ethoscopes can be built easily by using 3D printing technology and rely on
      Raspberry Pi microcomputers and Arduino boards to provide affordable and flexible
      hardware. All software and construction specifications are available at
      http://lab.gilest.ro/ethoscope.

TI  - Nonlatching positive feedback enables robust bimodality by decoupling expression 
      noise from the mean.
PG  - e2000841
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000841 [doi]
AB  - Fundamental to biological decision-making is the ability to generate bimodal
      expression patterns where 2 alternate expression states simultaneously exist.
      Here, we use a combination of single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling to
      examine the sources of bimodality in the transcriptional program controlling
      HIV's fate decision between active replication and viral latency. We find that
      the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein manipulates the intrinsic
      toggling of HIV's promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR), to generate bimodal
      ON-OFF expression and that transcriptional positive feedback from Tat shifts and 
      expands the regime of LTR bimodality. This result holds for both minimal
      synthetic viral circuits and full-length virus. Strikingly, computational
      analysis indicates that the Tat circuit's noncooperative "nonlatching" feedback
      architecture is optimized to slow the promoter's toggling and generate bimodality
      by stochastic extinction of Tat. In contrast to the standard Poisson model,
      theory and experiment show that nonlatching positive feedback substantially
      dampens the inverse noise-mean relationship to maintain stochastic bimodality
      despite increasing mean expression levels. Given the rapid evolution of HIV, the 
      presence of a circuit optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression appears
      consistent with the hypothesis that HIV's decision between active replication and
      latency provides a viral fitness advantage. More broadly, the results suggest
      that positive-feedback circuits may have evolved not only for signal
      amplification but also for robustly generating bimodality by decoupling
      expression fluctuations (noise) from mean expression levels.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of temperature on mosquito and parasite traits that
      determine the transmission potential of human malaria.
PG  - e2003489
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003489 [doi]
AB  - Malaria transmission is known to be strongly impacted by temperature. The current
      understanding of how temperature affects mosquito and parasite life history
      traits derives from a limited number of empirical studies. These studies, some
      dating back to the early part of last century, are often poorly controlled, have 
      limited replication, explore a narrow range of temperatures, and use a mixture of
      parasite and mosquito species. Here, we use a single pairing of the Asian
      mosquito vector, An. stephensi and the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum to
      conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the thermal performance curves of a range
      of mosquito and parasite traits relevant to transmission. We show that biting
      rate, adult mortality rate, parasite development rate, and vector competence are 
      temperature sensitive. Importantly, we find qualitative and quantitative
      differences to the assumed temperature-dependent relationships. To explore the
      overall implications of temperature for transmission, we first use a standard
      model of relative vectorial capacity. This approach suggests a temperature
      optimum for transmission of 29 degrees C, with minimum and maximum temperatures
      of 12 degrees C and 38 degrees C, respectively. However, the robustness of the
      vectorial capacity approach is challenged by the fact that the empirical data
      violate several of the model's simplifying assumptions. Accordingly, we present
      an alternative model of relative force of infection that better captures the
      observed biology of the vector-parasite interaction. This model suggests a
      temperature optimum for transmission of 26 degrees C, with a minimum and maximum 
      of 17 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively. The differences between the
      models lead to potentially divergent predictions for the potential impacts of
      current and future climate change on malaria transmission. The study provides a
      framework for more detailed, system-specific studies that are essential to
      develop an improved understanding on the effects of temperature on malaria
      transmission.

TI  - The sea cucumber genome provides insights into morphological evolution and
      visceral regeneration.
PG  - e2003790
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003790 [doi]
AB  - Apart from sharing common ancestry with chordates, sea cucumbers exhibit a unique
      morphology and exceptional regenerative capacity. Here we present the complete
      genome sequence of an economically important sea cucumber, A. japonicus,
      generated using Illumina and PacBio platforms, to achieve an assembly of
      approximately 805 Mb (contig N50 of 190 Kb and scaffold N50 of 486 Kb), with
      30,350 protein-coding genes and high continuity. We used this resource to explore
      key genetic mechanisms behind the unique biological characters of sea cucumbers. 
      Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses revealed the presence of marker
      genes associated with notochord and gill slits, suggesting that these chordate
      features were present in ancestral echinoderms. The unique shape and weak
      mineralization of the sea cucumber adult body were also preliminarily explained
      by the contraction of biomineralization genes. Genome, transcriptome, and
      proteome analyses of organ regrowth after induced evisceration provided insight
      into the molecular underpinnings of visceral regeneration, including a specific
      tandem-duplicated prostatic secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94)-like gene
      family and a significantly expanded fibrinogen-related protein (FREP) gene
      family. This high-quality genome resource will provide a useful framework for
      future research into biological processes and evolution in deuterostomes,
      including remarkable regenerative abilities that could have medical applications.
      Moreover, the multiomics data will be of prime value for commercial sea cucumber 
      breeding programs.

TI  - The sex of specific neurons controls female body growth in Drosophila.
PG  - e2002252
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002252 [doi]
AB  - Sexual dimorphisms in body size are widespread throughout the animal kingdom but 
      their underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. Most models for how sex
      chromosome genes specify size dimorphism have emphasized the importance of
      gonadal hormones and cell-autonomous influences in mammals versus strictly
      cell-autonomous mechanisms in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we use
      tissue-specific genetics to investigate how sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is
      established in Drosophila. We find that the larger body size characteristic of
      Drosophila females is established very early in larval development via an
      increase in the growth rate per unit of body mass. We demonstrate that the female
      sex determination gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl), functions in central nervous system
      (CNS) neurons as part of a relay that specifies the early sex-specific growth
      trajectories of larval but not imaginal tissues. Neuronal Sxl acts additively in 
      2 neuronal subpopulations, one of which corresponds to 7 median neurosecretory
      cells: the insulin-producing cells (IPCs). Surprisingly, however, male-female
      differences in the production of insulin-like peptides (Ilps) from the IPCs do
      not appear to be involved in establishing SSD in early larvae, although they may 
      play a later role. These findings support a relay model in which Sxl in neurons
      and Sxl in local tissues act together to specify the female-specific growth of
      the larval body. They also reveal that, even though the sex determination
      pathways in Drosophila and mammals are different, they both modulate body growth 
      via a combination of tissue-autonomous and nonautonomous inputs.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of hypoxic cancer cells uncovers intron retention in
      EIF2B5 as a mechanism to inhibit translation.
PG  - e2002623
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002623 [doi]
AB  - Cells adjust to hypoxic stress within the tumor microenvironment by
      downregulating energy-consuming processes including translation. To delineate
      mechanisms of cellular adaptation to hypoxia, we performed RNA-Seq of normoxic
      and hypoxic head and neck cancer cells. These data revealed a significant down
      regulation of genes known to regulate RNA processing and splicing. Exon-level
      analyses classified > 1,000 mRNAs as alternatively spliced under hypoxia and
      uncovered a unique retained intron (RI) in the master regulator of translation
      initiation, EIF2B5. Notably, this intron was expressed in solid tumors in a
      stage-dependent manner. We investigated the biological consequence of this RI and
      demonstrate that its inclusion creates a premature termination codon (PTC), that 
      leads to a 65kDa truncated protein isoform that opposes full-length eIF2Bepsilon 
      to inhibit global translation. Furthermore, expression of 65kDa eIF2Bepsilon led 
      to increased survival of head and neck cancer cells under hypoxia, providing
      evidence that this isoform enables cells to adapt to conditions of low oxygen.
      Additional work to uncover -cis and -trans regulators of EIF2B5 splicing
      identified several factors that influence intron retention in EIF2B5: a weak
      splicing potential at the RI, hypoxia-induced expression and binding of the
      splicing factor SRSF3, and increased binding of total and phospho-Ser2 RNA
      polymerase II specifically at the intron retained under hypoxia. Altogether,
      these data reveal differential splicing as a previously uncharacterized mode of
      translational control under hypoxia and are supported by a model in which
      hypoxia-induced changes to cotranscriptional processing lead to selective
      retention of a PTC-containing intron in EIF2B5.

AB  - Addressing the common problems that researchers encounter when designing and
      analysing animal experiments will improve the reliability of in vivo research. In
      this article, the Experimental Design Assistant (EDA) is introduced. The EDA is a
      web-based tool that guides the in vivo researcher through the experimental design
      and analysis process, providing automated feedback on the proposed design and
      generating a graphical summary that aids communication with colleagues, funders, 
      regulatory authorities, and the wider scientific community. It will have an
      important role in addressing causes of irreproducibility.

TI  - Dynamic patterning by the Drosophila pair-rule network reconciles long-germ and
      short-germ segmentation.
PG  - e2002439
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002439 [doi]
AB  - Drosophila segmentation is a well-established paradigm for developmental pattern 
      formation. However, the later stages of segment patterning, regulated by the
      "pair-rule" genes, are still not well understood at the system level. Building on
      established genetic interactions, I construct a logical model of the Drosophila
      pair-rule system that takes into account the demonstrated stage-specific
      architecture of the pair-rule gene network. Simulation of this model can
      accurately recapitulate the observed spatiotemporal expression of the pair-rule
      genes, but only when the system is provided with dynamic "gap" inputs. This
      result suggests that dynamic shifts of pair-rule stripes are essential for
      segment patterning in the trunk and provides a functional role for observed
      posterior-to-anterior gap domain shifts that occur during cellularisation. The
      model also suggests revised patterning mechanisms for the parasegment boundaries 
      and explains the aetiology of the even-skipped null mutant phenotype. Strikingly,
      a slightly modified version of the model is able to pattern segments in either
      simultaneous or sequential modes, depending only on initial conditions. This
      suggests that fundamentally similar mechanisms may underlie segmentation in
      short-germ and long-germ arthropods.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of bacterial plant colonization genes.

AB  - Diverse soil-resident bacteria can contribute to plant growth and health, but the
      molecular mechanisms enabling them to effectively colonize their plant hosts
      remain poorly understood. We used randomly barcoded transposon mutagenesis
      sequencing (RB-TnSeq) in Pseudomonas simiae, a model root-colonizing bacterium,
      to establish a genome-wide map of bacterial genes required for colonization of
      the Arabidopsis thaliana root system. We identified 115 genes (2% of all P.
      simiae genes) with functions that are required for maximal competitive
      colonization of the root system. Among the genes we identified were some with
      obvious colonization-related roles in motility and carbon metabolism, as well as 
      44 other genes that had no or vague functional predictions. Independent
      validation assays of individual genes confirmed colonization functions for 20 of 
      22 (91%) cases tested. To further characterize genes identified by our screen, we
      compared the functional contributions of P. simiae genes to growth in 90 distinct
      in vitro conditions by RB-TnSeq, highlighting specific metabolic functions
      associated with root colonization genes. Our analysis of bacterial genes by
      sequence-driven saturation mutagenesis revealed a genome-wide map of the genetic 
      determinants of plant root colonization and offers a starting point for targeted 
      improvement of the colonization capabilities of plant-beneficial microbes.

TI  - A new discrete dynamic model of ABA-induced stomatal closure predicts key
      feedback loops.
PG  - e2003451
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003451 [doi]
AB  - Stomata, microscopic pores in leaf surfaces through which water loss and carbon
      dioxide uptake occur, are closed in response to drought by the phytohormone
      abscisic acid (ABA). This process is vital for drought tolerance and has been the
      topic of extensive experimental investigation in the last decades. Although a
      core signaling chain has been elucidated consisting of ABA binding to receptors, 
      which alleviates negative regulation by protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs) of the
      protein kinase OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) and ultimately results in activation of
      anion channels, osmotic water loss, and stomatal closure, over 70 additional
      components have been identified, yet their relationships with each other and the 
      core components are poorly elucidated. We integrated and processed hundreds of
      disparate observations regarding ABA signal transduction responses underlying
      stomatal closure into a network of 84 nodes and 156 edges and, as a result,
      established those relationships, including identification of a 36-node, strongly 
      connected (feedback-rich) component as well as its in- and out-components. The
      network's domination by a feedback-rich component may reflect a general feature
      of rapid signaling events. We developed a discrete dynamic model of this network 
      and elucidated the effects of ABA plus knockout or constitutive activity of 79
      nodes on both the outcome of the system (closure) and the status of all internal 
      nodes. The model, with more than 1024 system states, is far from fully determined
      by the available data, yet model results agree with existing experiments in 82
      cases and disagree in only 17 cases, a validation rate of 75%. Our results reveal
      nodes that could be engineered to impact stomatal closure in a controlled fashion
      and also provide over 140 novel predictions for which experimental data are
      currently lacking. Noting the paucity of wet-bench data regarding combinatorial
      effects of ABA and internal node activation, we experimentally confirmed several 
      predictions of the model with regard to reactive oxygen species, cytosolic Ca2+
      (Ca2+c), and heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. We analyzed dynamics-determining
      positive and negative feedback loops, thereby elucidating the attractor (dynamic 
      behavior) repertoire of the system and the groups of nodes that determine each
      attractor. Based on this analysis, we predict the likely presence of a previously
      unrecognized feedback mechanism dependent on Ca2+c. This mechanism would provide 
      model agreement with 10 additional experimental observations, for a validation
      rate of 85%. Our research underscores the importance of feedback regulation in
      generating robust and adaptable biological responses. The high validation rate of
      our model illustrates the advantages of discrete dynamic modeling for complex,
      nonlinear systems common in biology.

TI  - Development of rat female genital cortex and control of female puberty by sexual 
      touch.
PG  - e2001283
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001283 [doi]
AB  - Rat somatosensory cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic genital
      representation. Genital cortex undergoes an unusual 2-fold expansion during
      puberty. Here, we investigate genital cortex development and female rat sexual
      maturation. Ovariectomies and estradiol injections suggested sex hormones cause
      the pubertal genital cortex expansion but not its maintenance at adult size.
      Genital cortex expanded by thalamic afferents invading surrounding dysgranular
      cortex. Genital touch was a dominant factor driving female sexual maturation.
      Raising female rats in contact with adult males promoted genital cortex
      expansion, whereas contact to adult females or nontactile
      (audio-visual-olfactory) male cues did not. Genital touch imposed by human
      experimenters powerfully advanced female genital cortex development and sexual
      maturation. Long-term blocking of genital cortex by tetrodotoxin in pubescent
      females housed with males prevented genital cortex expansion and decelerated
      vaginal opening. Sex hormones, sexual experience, and neural activity shape
      genital cortex, which contributes to the puberty promoting effects of sexual
      touch.

TI  - Reduced insulin signaling maintains electrical transmission in a neural circuit
      in aging flies.
PG  - e2001655
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001655 [doi]
AB  - Lowered insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) can extend
      healthy lifespan in worms, flies, and mice, but it can also have adverse effects 
      (the "insulin paradox"). Chronic, moderately lowered IIS rescues age-related
      decline in neurotransmission through the Drosophila giant fiber system (GFS), a
      simple escape response neuronal circuit, by increasing targeting of the gap
      junctional protein innexin shaking-B to gap junctions (GJs). Endosomal recycling 
      of GJs was also stimulated in cultured human cells when IIS was reduced.
      Furthermore, increasing the activity of the recycling small guanosine
      triphosphatases (GTPases) Rab4 or Rab11 was sufficient to maintain GJs upon
      elevated IIS in cultured human cells and in flies, and to rescue age-related loss
      of GJs and of GFS function. Lowered IIS thus elevates endosomal recycling of GJs 
      in neurons and other cell types, pointing to a cellular mechanism for therapeutic
      intervention into aging-related neuronal disorders.

AB  - The hippocampus is the main locus of episodic memory formation and the neurons
      there encode the spatial map of the environment. Hippocampal place cells
      represent location, but their role in the learning of preferential location
      remains unclear. The hippocampus may encode locations independently from the
      stimuli and events that are associated with these locations. We have discovered a
      unique population code for the experience-dependent value of the context. The
      degree of reward-driven navigation preference highly correlates with the spatial 
      distribution of the place fields recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
      We show place field clustering towards rewarded locations. Optogenetic
      manipulation of the ventral tegmental area demonstrates that the
      experience-dependent place field assembly distribution is directed by tegmental
      dopaminergic activity. The ability of the place cells to remap parallels the
      acquisition of reward context. Our findings present key evidence that the
      hippocampal neurons are not merely mapping the static environment but also store 
      the concurrent context reward value, enabling episodic memory for past experience
      to support future adaptive behavior.

TI  - Extreme genome diversity in the hyper-prevalent parasitic eukaryote Blastocystis.
PG  - e2003769
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003769 [doi]
AB  - Blastocystis is the most prevalent eukaryotic microbe colonizing the human gut,
      infecting approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Although Blastocystis
      has been linked to intestinal disorders, its pathogenicity remains controversial 
      because most carriers are asymptomatic. Here, the genome sequence of Blastocystis
      subtype (ST) 1 is presented and compared to previously published sequences for
      ST4 and ST7. Despite a conserved core of genes, there is unexpected diversity
      between these STs in terms of their genome sizes, guanine-cytosine (GC) content, 
      intron numbers, and gene content. ST1 has 6,544 protein-coding genes, which is
      several hundred more than reported for ST4 and ST7. The percentage of proteins
      unique to each ST ranges from 6.2% to 20.5%, greatly exceeding the differences
      observed within parasite genera. Orthologous proteins also display extreme
      divergence in amino acid sequence identity between STs (i.e., 59%-61% median
      identity), on par with observations of the most distantly related species pairs
      of parasite genera. The STs also display substantial variation in gene family
      distributions and sizes, especially for protein kinase and protease gene
      families, which could reflect differences in virulence. It remains to be seen to 
      what extent these inter-ST differences persist at the intra-ST level. A full 26% 
      of genes in ST1 have stop codons that are created on the mRNA level by a novel
      polyadenylation mechanism found only in Blastocystis. Reconstructions of pathways
      and organellar systems revealed that ST1 has a relatively complete
      membrane-trafficking system and a near-complete meiotic toolkit, possibly
      indicating a sexual cycle. Unlike some intestinal protistan parasites,
      Blastocystis ST1 has near-complete de novo pyrimidine, purine, and thiamine
      biosynthesis pathways and is unique amongst studied stramenopiles in being able
      to metabolize alpha-glucans rather than beta-glucans. It lacks all genes encoding
      heme-containing cytochrome P450 proteins. Predictions of the
      mitochondrion-related organelle (MRO) proteome reveal an expanded repertoire of
      functions, including lipid, cofactor, and vitamin biosynthesis, as well as
      proteins that may be involved in regulating mitochondrial morphology and
      MRO/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interactions. In sharp contrast, genes for
      peroxisome-associated functions are absent, suggesting Blastocystis STs lack this
      organelle. Overall, this study provides an important window into the biology of
      Blastocystis, showcasing significant differences between STs that can guide
      future experimental investigations into differences in their virulence and
      clarifying the roles of these organisms in gut health and disease.

AB  - The cell-cycle field has identified the core regulators that drive the cell
      cycle, but we do not have a clear map of the dynamics of these regulators during 
      cell-cycle progression versus cell-cycle exit. Here we use single-cell time-lapse
      microscopy of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) activity followed by endpoint
      immunofluorescence and computational cell synchronization to determine the
      temporal dynamics of key cell-cycle proteins in asynchronously cycling human
      cells. We identify several unexpected patterns for core cell-cycle proteins in
      actively proliferating (CDK2-increasing) versus spontaneously quiescent
      (CDK2-low) cells, including Cyclin D1, the levels of which we find to be higher
      in spontaneously quiescent versus proliferating cells. We also identify proteins 
      with concentrations that steadily increase or decrease the longer cells are in
      quiescence, suggesting the existence of a continuum of quiescence depths. Our
      single-cell measurements thus provide a rich resource for the field by
      characterizing protein dynamics during proliferation versus quiescence.

TI  - 'Spin' in published biomedical literature: A methodological systematic review.
PG  - e2002173
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002173 [doi]
AB  - In the scientific literature, spin refers to reporting practices that distort the
      interpretation of results and mislead readers so that results are viewed in a
      more favourable light. The presence of spin in biomedical research can negatively
      impact the development of further studies, clinical practice, and health
      policies. This systematic review aims to explore the nature and prevalence of
      spin in the biomedical literature. We searched MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, Embase,
      Scopus, and hand searched reference lists for all reports that included the
      measurement of spin in the biomedical literature for at least 1 outcome. Two
      independent coders extracted data on the characteristics of reports and their
      included studies and all spin-related outcomes. Results were grouped inductively 
      into themes by spin-related outcome and are presented as a narrative synthesis.
      We used meta-analyses to analyse the association of spin with industry
      sponsorship of research. We included 35 reports, which investigated spin in
      clinical trials, observational studies, diagnostic accuracy studies, systematic
      reviews, and meta-analyses. The nature of spin varied according to study design. 
      The highest (but also greatest) variability in the prevalence of spin was present
      in trials. Some of the common practices used to spin results included detracting 
      from statistically nonsignificant results and inappropriately using causal
      language. Source of funding was hypothesised by a few authors to be a factor
      associated with spin; however, results were inconclusive, possibly due to the
      heterogeneity of the included papers. Further research is needed to assess the
      impact of spin on readers' decision-making. Editors and peer reviewers should be 
      familiar with the prevalence and manifestations of spin in their area of research
      in order to ensure accurate interpretation and dissemination of research.

AB  - Coastal marine ecosystems can be managed by actions undertaken both on the land
      and in the ocean. Quantifying and comparing the costs and benefits of actions in 
      both realms is therefore necessary for efficient management. Here, we quantify
      the link between terrestrial sediment runoff and a downstream coastal marine
      ecosystem and contrast the cost-effectiveness of marine- and land-based
      conservation actions. We use a dynamic land- and sea-scape model to determine
      whether limited funds should be directed to 1 of 4 alternative conservation
      actions-protection on land, protection in the ocean, restoration on land, or
      restoration in the ocean-to maximise the extent of light-dependent marine benthic
      habitats across decadal timescales. We apply the model to a case study for a
      seagrass meadow in Australia. We find that marine restoration is the most
      cost-effective action over decadal timescales in this system, based on a
      conservative estimate of the rate at which seagrass can expand into a new
      habitat. The optimal decision will vary in different social-ecological contexts, 
      but some basic information can guide optimal investments to counteract land- and 
      ocean-based stressors: (1) marine restoration should be prioritised if the rates 
      of marine ecosystem decline and expansion are similar and low; (2) marine
      protection should take precedence if the rate of marine ecosystem decline is high
      or if the adjacent catchment is relatively intact and has a low rate of
      vegetation decline; (3) land-based actions are optimal when the ratio of marine
      ecosystem expansion to decline is greater than 1:1.4, with terrestrial
      restoration typically the most cost-effective action; and (4) land protection
      should be prioritised if the catchment is relatively intact but the rate of
      vegetation decline is high. These rules of thumb illustrate how cost-effective
      conservation outcomes for connected land-ocean systems can proceed without
      complex modelling.

TI  - Systematic analysis of transcription start sites in avian development.

AB  - Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) in combination with single-molecule
      sequencing technology allows precision mapping of transcription start sites
      (TSSs) and genome-wide capture of promoter activities in differentiated and
      steady state cell populations. Much less is known about whether TSS profiling can
      characterize diverse and non-steady state cell populations, such as the
      approximately 400 transitory and heterogeneous cell types that arise during
      ontogeny of vertebrate animals. To gain such insight, we used the chick model and
      performed CAGE-based TSS analysis on embryonic samples covering the full 3-week
      developmental period. In total, 31,863 robust TSS peaks (>1 tag per million
      [TPM]) were mapped to the latest chicken genome assembly, of which 34% to 46%
      were active in any given developmental stage. ZENBU, a web-based, open-source
      platform, was used for interactive data exploration. TSSs of genes critical for
      lineage differentiation could be precisely mapped and their activities tracked
      throughout development, suggesting that non-steady state and heterogeneous cell
      populations are amenable to CAGE-based transcriptional analysis. Our study also
      uncovered a large set of extremely stable housekeeping TSSs and many novel
      stage-specific ones. We furthermore demonstrated that TSS mapping could expedite 
      motif-based promoter analysis for regulatory modules associated with
      stage-specific and housekeeping genes. Finally, using Brachyury as an example, we
      provide evidence that precise TSS mapping in combination with Clustered Regularly
      Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-on technology enables us, for the
      first time, to efficiently target endogenous avian genes for transcriptional
      activation. Taken together, our results represent the first report of genome-wide
      TSS mapping in birds and the first systematic developmental TSS analysis in any
      amniote species (birds and mammals). By facilitating promoter-based molecular
      analysis and genetic manipulation, our work also underscores the value of avian
      models in unravelling the complex regulatory mechanism of cell lineage
      specification during amniote development.

AB  - A number of open questions in human evolutionary genetics would become tractable 
      if we were able to directly measure evolutionary fitness. As a step towards this 
      goal, we developed a method to examine whether individual genetic variants, or
      sets of genetic variants, currently influence viability. The approach consists in
      testing whether the frequency of an allele varies across ages, accounting for
      variation in ancestry. We applied it to the Genetic Epidemiology Research on
      Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort and to the parents of participants in the UK
      Biobank. Across the genome, we found only a few common variants with large
      effects on age-specific mortality: tagging the APOE epsilon4 allele and near
      CHRNA3. These results suggest that when large, even late-onset effects are kept
      at low frequency by purifying selection. Testing viability effects of sets of
      genetic variants that jointly influence 1 of 42 traits, we detected a number of
      strong signals. In participants of the UK Biobank of British ancestry, we found
      that variants that delay puberty timing are associated with a longer parental
      life span (P~6.2 x 10-6 for fathers and P~2.0 x 10-3 for mothers), consistent
      with epidemiological studies. Similarly, variants associated with later age at
      first birth are associated with a longer maternal life span (P~1.4 x 10-3).
      Signals are also observed for variants influencing cholesterol levels, risk of
      coronary artery disease (CAD), body mass index, as well as risk of asthma. These 
      signals exhibit consistent effects in the GERA cohort and among participants of
      the UK Biobank of non-British ancestry. We also found marked differences between 
      males and females, most notably at the CHRNA3 locus, and variants associated with
      risk of CAD and cholesterol levels. Beyond our findings, the analysis serves as a
      proof of principle for how upcoming biomedical data sets can be used to learn
      about selection effects in contemporary humans.

TI  - Genomic dissection of conserved transcriptional regulation in intestinal
      epithelial cells.
PG  - e2002054
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002054 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal epithelium serves critical physiologic functions that are shared
      among all vertebrates. However, it is unknown how the transcriptional regulatory 
      mechanisms underlying these functions have changed over the course of vertebrate 
      evolution. We generated genome-wide mRNA and accessible chromatin data from adult
      intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in zebrafish, stickleback, mouse, and human
      species to determine if conserved IEC functions are achieved through common
      transcriptional regulation. We found evidence for substantial common regulation
      and conservation of gene expression regionally along the length of the intestine 
      from fish to mammals and identified a core set of genes comprising a vertebrate
      IEC signature. We also identified transcriptional start sites and other putative 
      regulatory regions that are differentially accessible in IECs in all 4 species.
      Although these sites rarely showed sequence conservation from fish to mammals,
      surprisingly, they drove highly conserved IEC expression in a zebrafish reporter 
      assay. Common putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) found at these
      sites in multiple species indicate that sequence conservation alone is
      insufficient to identify much of the functionally conserved IEC regulatory
      information. Among the rare, highly sequence-conserved, IEC-specific regulatory
      regions, we discovered an ancient enhancer upstream from her6/HES1 that is active
      in a distinct population of Notch-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium.
      Together, these results show how combining accessible chromatin and mRNA datasets
      with TFBS prediction and in vivo reporter assays can reveal tissue-specific
      regulatory information conserved across 420 million years of vertebrate
      evolution. We define an IEC transcriptional regulatory network that is shared
      between fish and mammals and establish an experimental platform for studying how 
      evolutionarily distilled regulatory information commonly controls IEC development
      and physiology.

PG  - e2002257
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002257 [doi]
AB  - While innate behaviors are conserved throughout the animal kingdom, it is unknown
      whether common signaling pathways regulate the development of neuronal
      populations mediating these behaviors in diverse organisms. Here, we demonstrate 
      that the Wnt/ss-catenin effector Lef1 is required for the differentiation of
      anxiolytic hypothalamic neurons in zebrafish and mice, although the identity of
      Lef1-dependent genes and neurons differ between these 2 species. We further show 
      that zebrafish and Drosophila have common Lef1-dependent gene expression in their
      respective neuroendocrine organs, consistent with a conserved pathway that has
      diverged in the mouse. Finally, orthologs of Lef1-dependent genes from both
      zebrafish and mouse show highly correlated hypothalamic expression in marmosets
      and humans, suggesting co-regulation of 2 parallel anxiolytic pathways in
      primates. These findings demonstrate that during evolution, a transcription
      factor can act through multiple mechanisms to generate a common behavioral
      output, and that Lef1 regulates circuit development that is fundamentally
      important for mediating anxiety in a wide variety of animal species.

TI  - Spontaneous mutation rate is a plastic trait associated with population density
      across domains of life.
PG  - e2002731
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002731 [doi]
AB  - Rates of random, spontaneous mutation can vary plastically, dependent upon the
      environment. Such plasticity affects evolutionary trajectories and may be
      adaptive. We recently identified an inverse plastic association between mutation 
      rate and population density at 1 locus in 1 species of bacterium. It is unknown
      how widespread this association is, whether it varies among organisms, and what
      molecular mechanisms of mutagenesis or repair are required for this mutation-rate
      plasticity. Here, we address all 3 questions. We identify a strong negative
      association between mutation rate and population density across 70 years of
      published literature, comprising hundreds of mutation rates estimated using
      phenotypic markers of mutation (fluctuation tests) from all domains of life and
      viruses. We test this relationship experimentally, determining that there is
      indeed density-associated mutation-rate plasticity (DAMP) at multiple loci in
      both eukaryotes and bacteria, with up to 23-fold lower mutation rates at higher
      population densities. We find that the degree of plasticity varies, even among
      closely related organisms. Nonetheless, in each domain tested, DAMP requires
      proteins scavenging the mutagenic oxidised nucleotide 8-oxo-dGTP. This implies
      that phenotypic markers give a more precise view of mutation rate than previously
      believed: having accounted for other known factors affecting mutation rate,
      controlling for population density can reduce variation in mutation-rate
      estimates by 93%. Widespread DAMP, which we manipulate genetically in disparate
      organisms, also provides a novel trait to use in the fight against the evolution 
      of antimicrobial resistance. Such a prevalent environmental association and
      conserved mechanism suggest that mutation has varied plastically with population 
      density since the early origins of life.

TI  - Different patterns of neuronal activity trigger distinct responses of
      oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the corpus callosum.
PG  - e2001993
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001993 [doi]
AB  - In the developing and adult brain, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are
      influenced by neuronal activity: they are involved in synaptic signaling with
      neurons, and their proliferation and differentiation into myelinating glia can be
      altered by transient changes in neuronal firing. An important question that has
      been unanswered is whether OPCs can discriminate different patterns of neuronal
      activity and respond to them in a distinct way. Here, we demonstrate in brain
      slices that the pattern of neuronal activity determines the functional changes
      triggered at synapses between axons and OPCs. Furthermore, we show that
      stimulation of the corpus callosum at different frequencies in vivo affects
      proliferation and differentiation of OPCs in a dissimilar way. Our findings
      suggest that neurons do not influence OPCs in "all-or-none" fashion but use their
      firing pattern to tune the response and behavior of these nonneuronal cells.

TI  - Object segmentation controls image reconstruction from natural scenes.
PG  - e1002611
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002611 [doi]
AB  - The structure of the physical world projects images onto our eyes. However, those
      images are often poorly representative of environmental structure: well-defined
      boundaries within the eye may correspond to irrelevant features of the physical
      world, while critical features of the physical world may be nearly invisible at
      the retinal projection. The challenge for the visual cortex is to sort these two 
      types of features according to their utility in ultimately reconstructing
      percepts and interpreting the constituents of the scene. We describe a novel
      paradigm that enabled us to selectively evaluate the relative role played by
      these two feature classes in signal reconstruction from corrupted images. Our
      measurements demonstrate that this process is quickly dominated by the inferred
      structure of the environment, and only minimally controlled by variations of raw 
      image content. The inferential mechanism is spatially global and its impact on
      early visual cortex is fast. Furthermore, it retunes local visual processing for 
      more efficient feature extraction without altering the intrinsic transduction
      noise. The basic properties of this process can be partially captured by a
      combination of small-scale circuit models and large-scale network architectures. 
      Taken together, our results challenge compartmentalized notions of
      bottom-up/top-down perception and suggest instead that these two modes are best
      viewed as an integrated perceptual mechanism.

TI  - Rictor positively regulates B cell receptor signaling by modulating actin
      reorganization via ezrin.
PG  - e2001750
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001750 [doi]
AB  - As the central hub of the metabolism machinery, the mammalian target of rapamycin
      complex 2 (mTORC2) has been well studied in lymphocytes. As an obligatory
      component of mTORC2, the role of Rictor in T cells is well established. However, 
      the role of Rictor in B cells still remains elusive. Rictor is involved in B cell
      development, especially the peripheral development. However, the role of Rictor
      on B cell receptor (BCR) signaling as well as the underlying cellular and
      molecular mechanism is still unknown. This study used B cell-specfic Rictor
      knockout (KO) mice to investigate how Rictor regulates BCR signaling. We found
      that the key positive and negative BCR signaling molecules, phosphorylated
      Brutons tyrosine kinase (pBtk) and phosphorylated SH2-containing inositol
      phosphatase (pSHIP), are reduced and enhanced, respectively, in Rictor KO B
      cells. This suggests that Rictor positively regulates the early events of BCR
      signaling. We found that the cellular filamentous actin (F-actin) is drastically 
      increased in Rictor KO B cells after BCR stimulation through dysregulating the
      dephosphorylation of ezrin. The high actin-ezrin intensity area restricts the
      lateral movement of BCRs upon stimulation, consequently reducing BCR clustering
      and BCR signaling. The reduction in the initiation of BCR signaling caused by
      actin alteration is associated with a decreased humoral immune response in Rictor
      KO mice. The inhibition of actin polymerization with latrunculin in Rictor KO B
      cells rescues the defects of BCR signaling and B cell differentiation. Overall,
      our study provides a new pathway linking cell metablism to BCR activation, in
      which Rictor regulates BCR signaling via actin reorganization.

AB  - How effort is internally quantified and how it influences both movement
      generation and decisions between potential movements are 2 difficult questions to
      answer. Physical costs are known to influence motor control and decision-making, 
      yet we lack a general, principled characterization of how the perception of
      effort operates across tasks and conditions. Morel and colleagues introduce an
      insightful approach to that end, assessing effort indifference points and
      presenting a quadratic law between perceived effort and force production.

PG  - e2002231

AB  - What do you think of when you think of taxonomy? An 18th century gentlemen in
      breeches? Or perhaps botany drawings hung on the walls of a boutique hotel? Such 
      old-fashioned conceptions to the contrary, taxonomy is alive today although
      constantly struggling for survival and recognition. The scientific community is
      losing valuable resources as taxonomy experts age and retire, and funding for
      morphological studies and species descriptions remains stagnant. At the same
      time, organismal knowledge (morphology, ecology, physiology) has never been more 
      important: genomic studies are becoming more taxon focused, the scientific
      community is recognizing the limitations of traditional "model" organisms, and
      taxonomic expertise is desperately needed to fight against global biodiversity
      declines resulting from human impacts. There has never been a better time for a
      taxonomic renaissance.

TI  - The ESCRT-III pathway facilitates cardiomyocyte release of cBIN1-containing
      microparticles.
PG  - e2002354
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002354 [doi]
AB  - Microparticles (MPs) are cell-cell communication vesicles derived from the cell
      surface plasma membrane, although they are not known to originate from cardiac
      ventricular muscle. In ventricular cardiomyocytes, the membrane deformation
      protein cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1 or BIN1+13+17) creates
      transverse-tubule (t-tubule) membrane microfolds, which facilitate ion channel
      trafficking and modulate local ionic concentrations. The microfold-generated
      microdomains continuously reorganize, adapting in response to stress to modulate 
      the calcium signaling apparatus. We explored the possibility that
      cBIN1-microfolds are externally released from cardiomyocytes. Using electron
      microscopy imaging with immunogold labeling, we found in mouse plasma that cBIN1 
      exists in membrane vesicles about 200 nm in size, which is consistent with the
      size of MPs. In mice with cardiac-specific heterozygous Bin1 deletion, flow
      cytometry identified 47% less cBIN1-MPs in plasma, supporting cardiac origin.
      Cardiac release was also evidenced by the detection of cBIN1-MPs in medium
      bathing a pure population of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. In human
      plasma, osmotic shock increased cBIN1 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA), and cBIN1 level decreased in humans with heart failure, a
      condition with reduced cardiac muscle cBIN1, both of which support cBIN1 release 
      in MPs from human hearts. Exploring putative mechanisms of MP release, we found
      that the membrane fission complex endosomal sorting complexes required for
      transport (ESCRT)-III subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B)
      colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with cBIN1, an interaction enhanced by actin
      stabilization. In HeLa cells with cBIN1 overexpression, knockdown of CHMP4B
      reduced the release of cBIN1-MPs. Using truncation mutants, we identified that
      the N-terminal BAR (N-BAR) domain in cBIN1 is required for CHMP4B binding and MP 
      release. This study links the BAR protein superfamily to the ESCRT pathway for MP
      biogenesis in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells, identifying elements of a
      pathway by which cytoplasmic cBIN1 is released into blood.

AB  - Species within the human pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex are major
      threats to public health, causing approximately 1 million annual infections
      globally. Cryptococcus amylolentus is the most closely known related species of
      the pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex, and it is non-pathogenic.
      Additionally, while pathogenic Cryptococcus species have bipolar mating systems
      with a single large mating type (MAT) locus that represents a derived state in
      Basidiomycetes, C. amylolentus has a tetrapolar mating system with 2 MAT loci
      (P/R and HD) located on different chromosomes. Thus, studying C. amylolentus will
      shed light on the transition from tetrapolar to bipolar mating systems in the
      pathogenic Cryptococcus species, as well as its possible link with the origin and
      evolution of pathogenesis. In this study, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated 
      the genomes of 2 C. amylolentus isolates, CBS6039 and CBS6273, which are sexual
      and interfertile. Genome comparison between the 2 C. amylolentus isolates
      identified the boundaries and the complete gene contents of the P/R and HD MAT
      loci. Bioinformatic and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)
      analyses revealed that, similar to those of the pathogenic Cryptococcus species, 
      C. amylolentus has regional centromeres (CENs) that are enriched with
      species-specific transposable and repetitive DNA elements. Additionally, we found
      that while neither the P/R nor the HD locus is physically closely linked to its
      centromere in C. amylolentus, and the regions between the MAT loci and their
      respective centromeres show overall synteny between the 2 genomes, both MAT loci 
      exhibit genetic linkage to their respective centromere during meiosis, suggesting
      the presence of recombinational suppressors and/or epistatic gene interactions in
      the MAT-CEN intervening regions. Furthermore, genomic comparisons between C.
      amylolentus and related pathogenic Cryptococcus species provide evidence that
      multiple chromosomal rearrangements mediated by intercentromeric recombination
      have occurred during descent of the 2 lineages from their common ancestor. Taken 
      together, our findings support a model in which the evolution of the bipolar
      mating system was initiated by an ectopic recombination event mediated by similar
      repetitive centromeric DNA elements shared between chromosomes. This
      translocation brought the P/R and HD loci onto the same chromosome, and further
      chromosomal rearrangements then resulted in the 2 MAT loci becoming physically
      linked and eventually fusing to form the single contiguous MAT locus that is now 
      extant in the pathogenic Cryptococcus species.

AB  - Antibiotic regimens often include the sequential changing of drugs to limit the
      development and evolution of resistance of bacterial pathogens. It remains
      unclear how history of adaptation to one antibiotic can influence the resistance 
      profiles when bacteria subsequently adapt to a different antibiotic. Here, we
      experimentally evolved Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six 2-drug sequences. We
      observed drug order-specific effects, whereby adaptation to the first drug can
      limit the rate of subsequent adaptation to the second drug, adaptation to the
      second drug can restore susceptibility to the first drug, or final resistance
      levels depend on the order of the 2-drug sequence. These findings demonstrate how
      resistance not only depends on the current drug regimen but also the history of
      past regimens. These order-specific effects may allow for rational forecasting of
      the evolutionary dynamics of bacteria given knowledge of past adaptations and
      provide support for the need to consider the history of past drug exposure when
      designing strategies to mitigate resistance and combat bacterial infections.

TI  - Regulation of Gli ciliary localization and Hedgehog signaling by the
      PY-NLS/karyopherin-beta2 nuclear import system.
PG  - e2002063
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002063 [doi]
AB  - Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in vertebrates depends on primary cilia. Upon
      stimulation, Hh pathway components, including Gli transcription factors,
      accumulate at primary cilia to transduce the Hh signal, but the mechanisms
      underlying their ciliary targeting remains largely unknown. Here, we show that
      the PY-type nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS)/karyopherinbeta2 (Kapbeta2)
      nuclear import system regulates Gli ciliary localization and Hh pathway
      activation. Mutating the PY-NLS in Gli or knockdown of Kapbeta2 diminished Gli
      ciliary localization. Kapbeta2 is required for the formation of Gli activator
      (GliA) in wild-type but not in Sufu mutant cells. Knockdown of Kapbeta2 affected 
      Hh signaling in zebrafish embryos, as well as in vitro cultured cerebellum
      granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) and SmoM2-driven medulloblastoma cells.
      Furthermore, Kapbeta2 depletion impaired the growth of cultured medulloblastoma
      cells, which was rescued by Gli overexpression. Interestingly, Kapbeta2 is a
      transcriptional target of the Hh pathway, thus forming a positive feedback loop
      for Gli activation. Our study unravels the molecular mechanism and cellular
      machinery regulating Gli ciliary localization and identifies Kapbeta2 as a
      critical regulator of the Hh pathway and a potential drug target for Hh-driven
      cancers.

TI  - A flagellum-specific chaperone facilitates assembly of the core type III export
      apparatus of the bacterial flagellum.
PG  - e2002267
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002267 [doi]
AB  - Many bacteria move using a complex, self-assembling nanomachine, the bacterial
      flagellum. Biosynthesis of the flagellum depends on a flagellar-specific type III
      secretion system (T3SS), a protein export machine homologous to the export
      machinery of the virulence-associated injectisome. Six cytoplasmic
      (FliH/I/J/G/M/N) and seven integral-membrane proteins (FlhA/B FliF/O/P/Q/R) form 
      the flagellar basal body and are involved in the transport of flagellar building 
      blocks across the inner membrane in a proton motive force-dependent manner.
      However, how the large, multi-component transmembrane export gate complex
      assembles in a coordinated manner remains enigmatic. Specific for most flagellar 
      T3SSs is the presence of FliO, a small bitopic membrane protein with a large
      cytoplasmic domain. The function of FliO is unknown, but homologs of FliO are
      found in >80% of all flagellated bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that FliO
      protects FliP from proteolytic degradation and promotes the formation of a stable
      FliP-FliR complex required for the assembly of a functional core export
      apparatus. We further reveal the subcellular localization of FliO by
      super-resolution microscopy and show that FliO is not part of the assembled
      flagellar basal body. In summary, our results suggest that FliO functions as a
      novel, flagellar T3SS-specific chaperone, which facilitates quality control and
      productive assembly of the core T3SS export machinery.

AB  - The Genomic Observatories Metadatabase (GeOMe, http://www.geome-db.org/) is an
      open access repository for geographic and ecological metadata associated with
      biosamples and genetic data. Whereas public databases have served as vital
      repositories for nucleotide sequences, they do not accession all the metadata
      required for ecological or evolutionary analyses. GeOMe fills this need,
      providing a user-friendly, web-based interface for both data contributors and
      data recipients. The interface allows data contributors to create a customized
      yet standard-compliant spreadsheet that captures the temporal and geospatial
      context of each biosample. These metadata are then validated and permanently
      linked to archived genetic data stored in the National Center for Biotechnology
      Information's (NCBI's) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) via unique persistent
      identifiers. By linking ecologically and evolutionarily relevant metadata with
      publicly archived sequence data in a structured manner, GeOMe sets a gold
      standard for data management in biodiversity science.

AB  - The bacterial flagellar type III export apparatus, which is required for
      flagellar assembly beyond the cell membranes, consists of a transmembrane export 
      gate complex and a cytoplasmic ATPase complex. FlhA, FlhB, FliP, FliQ, and FliR
      form the gate complex inside the basal body MS ring, although FliO is required
      for efficient export gate formation in Salmonella enterica. However, it remains
      unknown how they form the gate complex. Here we report that FliP forms a
      homohexameric ring with a diameter of 10 nm. Alanine substitutions of conserved
      Phe-137, Phe-150, and Glu-178 residues in the periplasmic domain of FliP (FliPP) 
      inhibited FliP6 ring formation, suppressing flagellar protein export. FliO formed
      a 5-nm ring structure with 3 clamp-like structures that bind to the FliP6 ring.
      The crystal structure of FliPP derived from Thermotoga maritia, and
      structure-based photo-crosslinking experiments revealed that Phe-150 and Ser-156 
      of FliPP are involved in the FliP-FliP interactions and that Phe-150, Arg-152,
      Ser-156, and Pro-158 are responsible for the FliP-FliO interactions.
      Overexpression of FliP restored motility of a fliO mutant to the wild-type level,
      suggesting that the FliP6 ring is a functional unit in the export gate complex
      and that FliO is not part of the final gate structure. Copurification assays
      revealed that FlhA, FlhB, FliQ, and FliR are associated with the FliO/FliP
      complex. We propose that the assembly of the export gate complex begins with
      FliP6 ring formation with the help of the FliO scaffold, followed by FliQ, FliR, 
      and FlhB and finally FlhA during MS ring formation.

      while establishing long-term latency.

AB  - Mature human B cells infected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) become activated, grow,
      and proliferate. If the cells are infected ex vivo, they are transformed into
      continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that carry EBV DNA as
      extra-chromosomal episomes, express 9 latency-associated EBV proteins, and
      phenotypically resemble antigen-activated B-blasts. In vivo similar B-blasts can 
      differentiate to become memory B cells (MBC), in which EBV persistence is
      established. Three related latency-associated viral proteins EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and 
      EBNA3C are transcription factors that regulate a multitude of cellular genes.
      EBNA3B is not necessary to establish LCLs, but EBNA3A and EBNA3C are required to 
      sustain proliferation, in part, by repressing the expression of tumour suppressor
      genes. Here we show, using EBV-recombinants in which both EBNA3A and EBNA3C can
      be conditionally inactivated or using virus completely lacking the EBNA3 gene
      locus, that-after a phase of rapid proliferation-infected primary B cells express
      elevated levels of factors associated with plasma cell (PC) differentiation.
      These include the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p18INK4c, the master
      transcriptional regulator of PC differentiation B lymphocyte-induced maturation
      protein-1 (BLIMP-1), and the cell surface antigens CD38 and CD138/Syndecan-1.
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) indicate that in LCLs inhibition
      of CDKN2C (p18INK4c) and PRDM1 (BLIMP-1) transcription results from direct
      binding of EBNA3A and EBNA3C to regulatory elements at these loci, producing
      stable reprogramming. Consistent with the binding of EBNA3A and/or EBNA3C leading
      to irreversible epigenetic changes, cells become committed to a B-blast fate <12 
      days post-infection and are unable to de-repress p18INK4c or BLIMP-1-in either
      newly infected cells or conditional LCLs-by inactivating EBNA3A and EBNA3C. In
      vitro, about 20 days after infection with EBV lacking functional EBNA3A and
      EBNA3C, cells develop a PC-like phenotype. Together, these data suggest that
      EBNA3A and EBNA3C have evolved to prevent differentiation to PCs after infection 
      by EBV, thus favouring long-term latency in MBC and asymptomatic persistence.

AB  - Enhancing brown fat activity and promoting white fat browning are attractive
      therapeutic strategies for treating obesity and associated metabolic disorders.
      To provide a comprehensive picture of the gene regulatory network in these
      processes, we conducted a series of transcriptome studies by RNA sequencing
      (RNA-seq) and quantified the mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) changes during 
      white fat browning (chronic cold exposure, beta-adrenergic agonist treatment, and
      intense exercise) and brown fat activation or inactivation (acute cold exposure
      or thermoneutrality, respectively). mRNA-lncRNA coexpression networks revealed
      dynamically regulated lncRNAs to be largely embedded in nutrient and energy
      metabolism pathways. We identified a brown adipose tissue-enriched lncRNA,
      lncBATE10, that was governed by the cAMP-cAMP response element-binding protein
      (Creb) axis and required for a full brown fat differentiation and white fat
      browning program. Mechanistically, lncBATE10 can decoy Celf1 from Pgc1alpha,
      thereby protecting Pgc1alpha mRNA from repression by Celf1. Together, these
      studies provide a comprehensive data framework to interrogate the transcriptomic 
      changes accompanying energy homeostasis transition in adipose tissue.

TI  - The beneficial effects of dietary restriction on learning are distinct from its
      effects on longevity and mediated by depletion of a neuroinhibitory metabolite.
PG  - e2002032
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002032 [doi]
AB  - In species ranging from humans to Caenorhabditis elegans, dietary restriction
      (DR) grants numerous benefits, including enhanced learning. The precise
      mechanisms by which DR engenders benefits on processes related to learning remain
      poorly understood. As a result, it is unclear whether the learning benefits of DR
      are due to myriad improvements in mechanisms that collectively confer improved
      cellular health and extension of organismal lifespan or due to specific neural
      mechanisms. Using an associative learning paradigm in C. elegans, we investigated
      the effects of DR as well as manipulations of insulin, mechanistic target of
      rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and autophagy
      pathways-processes implicated in longevity-on learning. Despite their effects on 
      a vast number of molecular effectors, we found that the beneficial effects on
      learning elicited by each of these manipulations are fully dependent on depletion
      of kynurenic acid (KYNA), a neuroinhibitory metabolite. KYNA depletion then
      leads, in an N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent manner, to
      activation of a specific pair of interneurons with a critical role in learning.
      Thus, fluctuations in KYNA levels emerge as a previously unidentified molecular
      mechanism linking longevity and metabolic pathways to neural mechanisms of
      learning. Importantly, KYNA levels did not alter lifespan in any of the
      conditions tested. As such, the beneficial effects of DR on learning can be
      attributed to changes in a nutritionally sensitive metabolite with
      neuromodulatory activity rather than indirect or secondary consequences of
      improved health and extended longevity.

AB  - Clearing wild forests to grow food, fibre, and fuel products can deliver large
      financial gains. However, the benefits that people obtain from forests-known as
      ecosystem services-are rarely considered in economic calculations, partly because
      there are few markets onto which they can be traded. In some regions, the
      benefits delivered by nature might be more economically valuable. A new study
      maps where it is profitable to replace tropical forests with cropland and how
      this might change under future agricultural production and carbon prices. The
      findings address a major applied challenge by helping to identify sites where
      forest conservation can be economically viable.

TI  - Comparative genomics of the tardigrades Hypsibius dujardini and Ramazzottius

AB  - Tardigrada, a phylum of meiofaunal organisms, have been at the center of
      discussions of the evolution of Metazoa, the biology of survival in extreme
      environments, and the role of horizontal gene transfer in animal evolution.
      Tardigrada are placed as sisters to Arthropoda and Onychophora (velvet worms) in 
      the superphylum Panarthropoda by morphological analyses, but many molecular
      phylogenies fail to recover this relationship. This tension between molecular and
      morphological understanding may be very revealing of the mode and patterns of
      evolution of major groups. Limnoterrestrial tardigrades display extreme
      cryptobiotic abilities, including anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis, as do bdelloid
      rotifers, nematodes, and other animals of the water film. These extremophile
      behaviors challenge understanding of normal, aqueous physiology: how does a
      multicellular organism avoid lethal cellular collapse in the absence of liquid
      water? Meiofaunal species have been reported to have elevated levels of
      horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events, but how important this is in evolution,
      and particularly in the evolution of extremophile physiology, is unclear. To
      address these questions, we resequenced and reassembled the genome of H.
      dujardini, a limnoterrestrial tardigrade that can undergo anhydrobiosis only
      after extensive pre-exposure to drying conditions, and compared it to the genome 
      of R. varieornatus, a related species with tolerance to rapid desiccation. The 2 
      species had contrasting gene expression responses to anhydrobiosis, with major
      transcriptional change in H. dujardini but limited regulation in R. varieornatus.
      We identified few horizontally transferred genes, but some of these were shown to
      be involved in entry into anhydrobiosis. Whole-genome molecular phylogenies
      supported a Tardigrada+Nematoda relationship over Tardigrada+Arthropoda, but rare
      genomic changes tended to support Tardigrada+Arthropoda.

AB  - Individual cells take lineage commitment decisions in a way that is not
      necessarily uniform. We address this issue by characterising transcriptional
      changes in cord blood-derived CD34+ cells at the single-cell level and
      integrating data with cell division history and morphological changes determined 
      by time-lapse microscopy. We show that major transcriptional changes leading to a
      multilineage-primed gene expression state occur very rapidly during the first
      cell cycle. One of the 2 stable lineage-primed patterns emerges gradually in each
      cell with variable timing. Some cells reach a stable morphology and molecular
      phenotype by the end of the first cell cycle and transmit it clonally. Others
      fluctuate between the 2 phenotypes over several cell cycles. Our analysis
      highlights the dynamic nature and variable timing of cell fate commitment in
      hematopoietic cells, links the gene expression pattern to cell morphology, and
      identifies a new category of cells with fluctuating phenotypic characteristics,
      demonstrating the complexity of the fate decision process (which is different
      from a simple binary switch between 2 options, as it is usually envisioned).

AB  - From a research perspective, the interest in biobanking continues to intensify.
      Governments and industry have invested heavily in biobanks, as exemplified by
      initiatives like the United Kingdom Biobank and United States' Precision Medicine
      Initiative. But despite this enthusiasm, many profound legal and ethical
      challenges remain unresolved. Indeed, there continues to be disagreements about
      how best to obtain consent and the degree and nature of control that research
      participants retain over donated samples and health information. Emerging social 
      trends-including concerns about commercialization and perceived rights of
      continuing control ("biorights")-seem likely to intensify these issues.

      response and the local field potential.
PG  - e2001461
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001461 [doi]
AB  - The most widespread measures of human brain activity are the blood-oxygen-level
      dependent (BOLD) signal and surface field potential. Prior studies report a
      variety of relationships between these signals. To develop an understanding of
      how to interpret these signals and the relationship between them, we developed a 
      model of (a) neuronal population responses and (b) transformations from neuronal 
      responses into the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD signal and
      electrocorticographic (ECoG) field potential. Rather than seeking a
      transformation between the two measures directly, this approach interprets each
      measure with respect to the underlying neuronal population responses. This model 
      accounts for the relationship between BOLD and ECoG data from human visual cortex
      in V1, V2, and V3, with the model predictions and data matching in three ways:
      across stimuli, the BOLD amplitude and ECoG broadband power were positively
      correlated, the BOLD amplitude and alpha power (8-13 Hz) were negatively
      correlated, and the BOLD amplitude and narrowband gamma power (30-80 Hz) were
      uncorrelated. The two measures provide complementary information about human
      brain activity, and we infer that features of the field potential that are
      uncorrelated with BOLD arise largely from changes in synchrony, rather than
      level, of neuronal activity.

AB  - When acting in a complex visual environment, it is essential to be able to
      flexibly allocate attention to parts of the visual scene that may contain
      goal-relevant information. The paper by Jia et al. provides novel evidence that
      our brains sequentially sample different objects in a visual scene. The results
      were obtained using "temporal response functions," in which unique
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signals corresponding to the processing of 2
      continuously presented objects were isolated in an object-specific way. These
      response functions were dominated by 10-Hz alpha-band activity. Crucially, the
      different objects were sequentially sampled at a rate of about 2 Hz. These
      findings provide important neurophysiological insights into how our visual system
      operates in complex environments.

TI  - Bacterial deception of MAIT cells in a cloud of superantigen and cytokines.
PG  - e2003167
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003167 [doi]
AB  - The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of the life-threatening
      condition toxic shock syndrome in humans. Bacterial toxins known as superantigens
      (SAgs) generate this illness by acting as broad activators of a substantial
      fraction of all T lymphocytes, bypassing the normally highly stringent T-cell
      receptor antigen specificity to cause a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm in
      the host. In a new study, Shaler et al. found that immune cells called
      mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells make an unexpectedly large
      contribution to the SAg response in a largely T-cell receptor-independent,
      cytokine-driven manner. Subsequent to such activation, the MAIT cells remain
      unresponsive to stimulation with bacterial antigen. Thus, S. aureus hijacks MAIT 
      cells in the cytokine storm and leaves them functionally impaired. This work
      provides new insight into the role of MAIT cells in antibacterial immunity and
      opens new avenues of investigation to understand and possibly treat bacterial
      toxic shock and sepsis.

TI  - Global economic trade-offs between wild nature and tropical agriculture.
PG  - e2001657
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001657 [doi]
AB  - Global demands for agricultural and forestry products provide economic incentives
      for deforestation across the tropics. Much of this deforestation occurs with a
      lack of information on the spatial distribution of benefits and costs of
      deforestation. To inform global sustainable land-use policies, we combine
      geographic information systems (GIS) with a meta-analysis of ecosystem services
      (ES) studies to perform a spatially explicit analysis of the trade-offs between
      agricultural benefits, carbon emissions, and losses of multiple ecosystem
      services because of tropical deforestation from 2000 to 2012. Even though the
      value of ecosystem services presents large inherent uncertainties, we find a
      pattern supporting the argument that the externalities of destroying tropical
      forests are greater than the current direct economic benefits derived from
      agriculture in all cases bar one: when yield and rent potentials of high-value
      crops could be realized in the future. Our analysis identifies the Atlantic
      Forest, areas around the Gulf of Guinea, and Thailand as areas where agricultural
      conversion appears economically efficient, indicating a major impediment to the
      long-term financial sustainability of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
      forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes in those countries. By contrast, Latin
      America, insular Southeast Asia, and Madagascar present areas with low
      agricultural rents (ARs) and high values in carbon stocks and ES, suggesting that
      they are economically viable conservation targets. Our study helps identify
      optimal areas for conservation and agriculture together with their associated
      uncertainties, which could enhance the efficiency and sustainability of
      pantropical land-use policies and help direct future research efforts.

      angiosperms.
PG  - e2002792
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002792 [doi]
AB  - Species diversity varies greatly across the different taxonomic groups that
      comprise the Tree of Life (ToL). This imbalance is particularly conspicuous
      within angiosperms, but is largely unexplained. Seed mass is one trait that may
      help clarify why some lineages diversify more than others because it confers
      adaptation to different environments, which can subsequently influence speciation
      and extinction. The rate at which seed mass changes across the angiosperm
      phylogeny may also be linked to diversification by increasing reproductive
      isolation and allowing access to novel ecological niches. However, the magnitude 
      and direction of the association between seed mass and diversification has not
      been assessed across the angiosperm phylogeny. Here, we show that absolute seed
      size and the rate of change in seed size are both associated with variation in
      diversification rates. Based on the largest available angiosperm phylogenetic
      tree, we found that smaller-seeded plants had higher rates of diversification,
      possibly due to improved colonisation potential. The rate of phenotypic change in
      seed size was also strongly positively correlated with speciation rates,
      providing rare, large-scale evidence that rapid morphological change is
      associated with species divergence. Our study now reveals that variation in
      morphological traits and, importantly, the rate at which they evolve can
      contribute to explaining the extremely uneven distribution of diversity across
      the ToL.

TI  - Extracellular phosphorylation of a receptor tyrosine kinase controls synaptic
      localization of NMDA receptors and regulates pathological pain.
PG  - e2002457
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002457 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular phosphorylation of proteins was suggested in the late 1800s when it
      was demonstrated that casein contains phosphate. More recently, extracellular
      kinases that phosphorylate extracellular serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues
      of numerous proteins have been identified. However, the functional significance
      of extracellular phosphorylation of specific residues in the nervous system is
      poorly understood. Here we show that synaptic accumulation of GluN2B-containing
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and pathological pain are controlled by
      ephrin-B-induced extracellular phosphorylation of a single tyrosine (p*Y504) in a
      highly conserved region of the fibronectin type III (FN3) domain of the receptor 
      tyrosine kinase EphB2. Ligand-dependent Y504 phosphorylation modulates the
      EphB-NMDAR interaction in cortical and spinal cord neurons. Furthermore, Y504
      phosphorylation enhances NMDAR localization and injury-induced pain behavior. By 
      mediating inducible extracellular interactions that are capable of modulating
      animal behavior, extracellular tyrosine phosphorylation of EphBs may represent a 
      previously unknown class of mechanism mediating protein interaction and function.

AB  - Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila, or
      Caenorhabditis elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In
      addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, 
      one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a
      behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using
      optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial
      solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system
      as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a
      low-cost and modular open-source alternative called 'FlyPi'. Our design is based 
      on a 3D-printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera
      system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending
      on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under euro100 and features 
      optional modules for light-emitting diode (LED)-based fluorescence microscopy and
      optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for
      thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately euro200
      or substantially less if the user is prepared to 'shop around'. All functions of 
      FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To
      demonstrate FlyPi's capabilities, we present its use in a series of
      state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPi's
      utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics
      courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and
      modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile
      tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and
      research labs.

AB  - This article describes efforts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from
      2013 to 2016 to train a national workforce in biomedical data science. We provide
      an analysis of the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) training program strengths and
      weaknesses with an eye toward future directions aimed at any funder and potential
      funding recipient worldwide. The focus is on extramurally funded programs that
      have a national or international impact rather than the training of NIH staff,
      which was addressed by the NIH's internal Data Science Workforce Development
      Center. From its inception, the major goal of BD2K was to narrow the gap between 
      needed and existing biomedical data science skills. As biomedical research

TI  - Dramatic and concerted conformational changes enable rhodocetin to block
      alpha2beta1 integrin selectively.
PG  - e2001492
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001492 [doi]
AB  - The collagen binding integrin alpha2beta1 plays a crucial role in hemostasis,
      fibrosis, and cancer progression amongst others. It is specifically inhibited by 
      rhodocetin (RC), a C-type lectin-related protein (CLRP) found in Malayan pit
      viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) venom. The structure of RC alone reveals a
      heterotetramer arranged as an alphabeta and gammadelta subunit in a cruciform
      shape. RC specifically binds to the collagen binding A-domain of the integrin
      alpha2 subunit, thereby blocking collagen-induced platelet aggregation. However, 
      until now, the molecular basis for this interaction has remained unclear. Here,
      we present the molecular structure of the RCgammadelta-alpha2A complex solved to 
      3.0 A resolution. Our findings show that RC undergoes a dramatic structural
      reorganization upon binding to alpha2beta1 integrin. Besides the release of the
      nonbinding RCalphabeta tandem, the RCgamma subunit interacts with loop 2 of the
      alpha2A domain as result of a dramatic conformational change. The RCdelta subunit
      contacts the integrin alpha2A domain in the "closed" conformation through its
      helix C. Combined with epitope-mapped antibodies, conformationally locked alpha2A
      domain mutants, point mutations within the alpha2A loop 2, and chemical
      modifications of the purified toxin protein, this molecular structure of
      RCgammadelta-alpha2A complex explains the inhibitory mechanism and specificity of
      RC for alpha2beta1 integrin.

TI  - Four simple rules that are sufficient to generate the mammalian blastocyst.
PG  - e2000737
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000737 [doi]
AB  - Early mammalian development is both highly regulative and self-organizing. It
      involves the interplay of cell position, predetermined gene regulatory networks, 
      and environmental interactions to generate the physical arrangement of the
      blastocyst with precise timing. However, this process occurs in the absence of
      maternal information and in the presence of transcriptional stochasticity. How
      does the preimplantation embryo ensure robust, reproducible development in this
      context? It utilizes a versatile toolbox that includes complex intracellular
      networks coupled to cell-cell communication, segregation by differential
      adhesion, and apoptosis. Here, we ask whether a minimal set of developmental
      rules based on this toolbox is sufficient for successful blastocyst development, 
      and to what extent these rules can explain mutant and experimental phenotypes. We
      implemented experimentally reported mechanisms for polarity, cell-cell signaling,
      adhesion, and apoptosis as a set of developmental rules in an agent-based in
      silico model of physically interacting cells. We find that this model
      quantitatively reproduces specific mutant phenotypes and provides an explanation 
      for the emergence of heterogeneity without requiring any initial transcriptional 
      variation. It also suggests that a fixed time point for the cells' competence of 
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) sets
      an embryonic clock that enables certain scaling phenomena, a concept that we
      evaluate quantitatively by manipulating embryos in vitro. Based on these
      observations, we conclude that the minimal set of rules enables the embryo to
      experiment with stochastic gene expression and could provide the robustness
      necessary for the evolutionary diversification of the preimplantation gene
      regulatory network.

TI  - Hierarchical patterning modes orchestrate hair follicle morphogenesis.
PG  - e2002117
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002117 [doi]
AB  - Two theories address the origin of repeating patterns, such as hair follicles,
      limb digits, and intestinal villi, during development. The Turing
      reaction-diffusion system posits that interacting diffusible signals produced by 
      static cells first define a prepattern that then induces cell rearrangements to
      produce an anatomical structure. The second theory, that of mesenchymal
      self-organisation, proposes that mobile cells can form periodic patterns of cell 
      aggregates directly, without reference to any prepattern. Early hair follicle
      development is characterised by the rapid appearance of periodic arrangements of 
      altered gene expression in the epidermis and prominent clustering of the adjacent
      dermal mesenchymal cells. We assess the contributions and interplay between
      reaction-diffusion and mesenchymal self-organisation processes in hair follicle
      patterning, identifying a network of fibroblast growth factor (FGF),
      wingless-related integration site (WNT), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
      signalling interactions capable of spontaneously producing a periodic pattern.
      Using time-lapse imaging, we find that mesenchymal cell condensation at hair
      follicles is locally directed by an epidermal prepattern. However, imposing this 
      prepattern's condition of high FGF and low BMP activity across the entire skin
      reveals a latent dermal capacity to undergo spatially patterned self-organisation
      in the absence of epithelial direction. This mesenchymal self-organisation relies
      on restricted transforming growth factor (TGF) beta signalling, which serves to
      drive chemotactic mesenchymal patterning when reaction-diffusion patterning is
      suppressed, but, in normal conditions, facilitates cell movement to locally
      prepatterned sources of FGF. This work illustrates a hierarchy of periodic
      patterning modes operating in organogenesis.

PG  - e2002183
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002183 [doi]
AB  - Nonmembrane-bound organelles that behave like liquid droplets are widespread
      among eukaryotic cells. Their dysregulation appears to be a critical step in
      several neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we report that tau protein, the
      primary constituent of Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles, can form liquid
      droplets and therefore has the necessary biophysical properties to undergo
      liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cells. Consonant with the factors that
      induce LLPS, tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that complexes with RNA
      to form droplets. Uniquely, the pool of RNAs to which tau binds in living cells
      are tRNAs. This phase state of tau is held in an approximately 1:1 charge balance
      across the protein and the nucleic acid constituents, and can thus be maximal at 
      different RNA:tau mass ratios, depending on the biopolymer constituents involved.
      This feature is characteristic of complex coacervation. We furthermore show that 
      the LLPS process is directly and sensitively tuned by salt concentration and
      temperature, implying it is modulated by both electrostatic interactions between 
      the involved protein and nucleic acid constituents, as well as net changes in
      entropy. Despite the high protein concentration within the complex coacervate
      phase, tau is locally freely tumbling and capable of diffusing through the
      droplet interior. In fact, tau in the condensed phase state does not reveal any
      immediate changes in local protein packing, local conformations and local protein
      dynamics from that of tau in the dilute solution state. In contrast, the
      population of aggregation-prone tau as induced by the complexation with heparin
      is accompanied by large changes in local tau conformations and irreversible
      aggregation. However, prolonged residency within the droplet state eventually
      results in the emergence of detectable beta-sheet structures according to
      thioflavin-T assay. These findings suggest that the droplet state can incubate
      tau and predispose the protein toward the formation of insoluble fibrils.

TI  - Early postnatal exposure to isoflurane causes cognitive deficits and disrupts
      development of newborn hippocampal neurons via activation of the mTOR pathway.
PG  - e2001246
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001246 [doi]
AB  - Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that early postnatal exposure to
      anesthetics can lead to lasting deficits in learning and other cognitive
      processes. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been clarified and
      there is no treatment currently available. Recent evidence suggests that
      anesthetics might cause persistent deficits in cognitive function by disrupting
      key events in brain development. The hippocampus, a brain region that is critical
      for learning and memory, contains a large number of neurons that develop in the
      early postnatal period, which are thus vulnerable to perturbation by anesthetic
      exposure. Using an in vivo mouse model we demonstrate abnormal development of
      dendrite arbors and dendritic spines in newly generated dentate gyrus granule
      cell neurons of the hippocampus after a clinically relevant isoflurane anesthesia
      exposure conducted at an early postnatal age. Furthermore, we find that
      isoflurane causes a sustained increase in activity in the mechanistic target of
      rapamycin pathway, and that inhibition of this pathway with rapamycin not only
      reverses the observed changes in neuronal development, but also substantially
      improves performance on behavioral tasks of spatial learning and memory that are 
      impaired by isoflurane exposure. We conclude that isoflurane disrupts the
      development of hippocampal neurons generated in the early postnatal period by
      activating a well-defined neurodevelopmental disease pathway and that this
      phenotype can be reversed by pharmacologic inhibition.

PG  - e2002612
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002612 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the rat neurochemical connectome is fundamental for exploring
      neuronal information processing. By using advanced data mining, supervised
      machine learning, and network analysis, this study integrates over 5 decades of
      neuroanatomical investigations into a multiscale, multilayer neurochemical
      connectome of the rat brain. This neurochemical connectivity database (ChemNetDB)
      is supported by comprehensive systematically-determined receptor distribution
      maps. The rat connectome has an onion-type structural organization and shares a
      number of structural features with mesoscale connectomes of mouse and macaque.
      Furthermore, we demonstrate that extremal values of graph theoretical measures
      (e.g., degree and betweenness) are associated with evolutionary-conserved deep
      brain structures such as amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal
      raphe, and lateral hypothalamus, which regulate primitive, yet fundamental
      functions, such as circadian rhythms, reward, aggression, anxiety, and fear. The 
      ChemNetDB is a freely available resource for systems analysis of motor, sensory, 
      emotional, and cognitive information processing.

PG  - e2001414
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001414 [doi]
AB  - In many disciplines, data are highly decentralized across thousands of online
      databases (repositories, registries, and knowledgebases). Wringing value from
      such databases depends on the discipline of data science and on the humble bricks
      and mortar that make integration possible; identifiers are a core component of
      this integration infrastructure. Drawing on our experience and on work by other
      groups, we outline 10 lessons we have learned about the identifier qualities and 
      best practices that facilitate large-scale data integration. Specifically, we
      propose actions that identifier practitioners (database providers) should take in
      the design, provision and reuse of identifiers. We also outline the important
      considerations for those referencing identifiers in various circumstances,
      including by authors and data generators. While the importance and relevance of
      each lesson will vary by context, there is a need for increased awareness about
      how to avoid and manage common identifier problems, especially those related to
      persistence and web-accessibility/resolvability. We focus strongly on web-based
      identifiers in the life sciences; however, the principles are broadly relevant to
      other disciplines.

AB  - There is vigorous debate about the reproducibility of research findings in cancer
      biology. Whether scientists can accurately assess which experiments will
      reproduce original findings is important to determining the pace at which science
      self-corrects. We collected forecasts from basic and preclinical cancer
      researchers on the first 6 replication studies conducted by the Reproducibility
      Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CB) to assess the accuracy of expert judgments on
      specific replication outcomes. On average, researchers forecasted a 75%
      probability of replicating the statistical significance and a 50% probability of 
      replicating the effect size, yet none of these studies successfully replicated on
      either criterion (for the 5 studies with results reported). Accuracy was related 
      to expertise: experts with higher h-indices were more accurate, whereas experts
      with more topic-specific expertise were less accurate. Our findings suggest that 
      experts, especially those with specialized knowledge, were overconfident about
      the RP:CB replicating individual experiments within published reports; researcher
      optimism likely reflects a combination of overestimating the validity of original
      studies and underestimating the difficulties of repeating their methodologies.

TI  - Chemosensory and hyperoxia circuits in C. elegans males influence sperm
      navigational capacity.
PG  - e2002047
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002047 [doi]
AB  - The sperm's crucial function is to locate and fuse with a mature oocyte. Under
      laboratory conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans sperm are very efficient at
      navigating the hermaphrodite reproductive tract and locating oocytes. Here, we
      identify chemosensory and oxygen-sensing circuits that affect the sperm's
      navigational capacity. Multiple Serpentine Receptor B (SRB) chemosensory
      receptors regulate Galpha pathways in gustatory sensory neurons that extend cilia
      through the male nose. SRB signaling is necessary and sufficient in these sensory
      neurons to influence sperm motility parameters. The neuropeptide Y pathway acts
      together with SRB-13 to antagonize negative effects of the GCY-35 hyperoxia
      sensor on spermatogenesis. SRB chemoreceptors are not essential for sperm
      navigation under low oxygen conditions that C. elegans prefers. In ambient oxygen
      environments, SRB-13 signaling impacts gene expression during spermatogenesis and
      the sperm's mitochondria, thereby increasing migration velocity and inhibiting
      reversals within the hermaphrodite uterus. The SRB-13 transcriptome is highly
      enriched in genes implicated in pathogen defense, many of which are expressed in 
      diverse tissues. We show that the critical time period for SRB-13 signaling is
      prior to spermatocyte differentiation. Our results support the model that young
      C. elegans males sense external environment and oxygen tension, triggering
      long-lasting downstream signaling events with effects on the sperm's mitochondria
      and navigational capacity. Environmental exposures early in male life may alter
      sperm function and fertility.

TI  - Sequential sampling of visual objects during sustained attention.
PG  - e2001903
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001903 [doi]
AB  - In a crowded visual scene, attention must be distributed efficiently and flexibly
      over time and space to accommodate different contexts. It is well established
      that selective attention enhances the corresponding neural responses, presumably 
      implying that attention would persistently dwell on the task-relevant item.
      Meanwhile, recent studies, mostly in divided attentional contexts, suggest that
      attention does not remain stationary but samples objects alternately over time,
      suggesting a rhythmic view of attention. However, it remains unknown whether the 
      dynamic mechanism essentially mediates attentional processes at a general level. 
      Importantly, there is also a complete lack of direct neural evidence reflecting
      whether and how the brain rhythmically samples multiple visual objects during
      stimulus processing. To address these issues, in this study, we employed
      electroencephalography (EEG) and a temporal response function (TRF) approach,
      which can dissociate responses that exclusively represent a single object from
      the overall neuronal activity, to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of
      attention in various attentional contexts. First, attention, which is
      characterized by inhibitory alpha-band (approximately 10 Hz) activity in TRFs,
      switches between attended and unattended objects every approximately 200 ms,
      suggesting a sequential sampling even when attention is required to mostly stay
      on the attended object. Second, the attentional spatiotemporal pattern is
      modulated by the task context, such that alpha-mediated switching becomes
      increasingly prominent as the task requires a more uniform distribution of
      attention. Finally, the switching pattern correlates with attentional behavioral 
      performance. Our work provides direct neural evidence supporting a generally
      central role of temporal organization mechanism in attention, such that multiple 
      objects are sequentially sorted according to their priority in attentional
      contexts. The results suggest that selective attention, in addition to the
      classically posited attentional "focus," involves a dynamic mechanism for
      monitoring all objects outside of the focus. Our findings also suggest that
      attention implements a space (object)-to-time transformation by acting as a
      series of concatenating attentional chunks that operate on 1 object at a time.

TI  - Integration of individual and social information for decision-making in groups of
      different sizes.
PG  - e2001958
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001958 [doi]
AB  - When making judgments in a group, individuals often revise their initial beliefs 
      about the best judgment to make given what others believe. Despite the ubiquity
      of this phenomenon, we know little about how the brain updates beliefs when
      integrating personal judgments (individual information) with those of others
      (social information). Here, we investigated the neurocomputational mechanisms of 
      how we adapt our judgments to those made by groups of different sizes, in the
      context of jury decisions for a criminal. By testing different theoretical
      models, we showed that a social Bayesian inference model captured changes in
      judgments better than 2 other models. Our results showed that participants
      updated their beliefs by appropriately weighting individual and social sources of
      information according to their respective credibility. When investigating 2
      fundamental computations of Bayesian inference, belief updates and credibility
      estimates of social information, we found that the dorsal anterior cingulate
      cortex (dACC) computed the level of belief updates, while the bilateral
      frontopolar cortex (FPC) was more engaged in individuals who assigned a greater
      credibility to the judgments of a larger group. Moreover, increased functional
      connectivity between these 2 brain regions reflected a greater influence of group
      size on the relative credibility of social information. These results provide a
      mechanistic understanding of the computational roles of the FPC-dACC network in
      steering judgment adaptation to a group's opinion. Taken together, these findings
      provide a computational account of how the human brain integrates individual and 
      social information for decision-making in groups.

TI  - Practices and promises of Facebook for science outreach: Becoming a "Nerd of
      Trust".
PG  - e2002020
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002020 [doi]
AB  - Arguably, the dissemination of science communication has recently entered a new
      age in which science must compete for public attention with fake news, alternate 
      facts, and pseudoscience. This clash is particularly evident on social media.
      Facebook has taken a prime role in disseminating fake news, alternate facts, and 
      pseudoscience, but is often ignored in the context of science outreach,
      especially among individual scientists. Based on new survey data, scientists
      appear in large Facebook networks but seldom post information about general
      science, their own scientific research, or culturally controversial topics in
      science. The typical individual scientist's audience is large and personally
      connected, potentially leading to both a broad and deep engagement in science.
      Moreover, this media values individual expertise, allowing scientists to serve as
      a "Nerd of Trust" for their online friend and family networks. Science outreach
      via social media demands a renewed interest, and Facebook may be an overlooked
      high-return, low-risk science outreach tool in which scientists can play a
      valuable role to combat disinformation.

TI  - Environmental change drives accelerated adaptation through stimulated copy number
      variation.

AB  - Copy number variation (CNV) is rife in eukaryotic genomes and has been implicated
      in many human disorders, particularly cancer, in which CNV promotes both
      tumorigenesis and chemotherapy resistance. CNVs are considered random mutations
      but often arise through replication defects; transcription can interfere with
      replication fork progression and stability, leading to increased mutation rates
      at highly transcribed loci. Here we investigate whether inducible promoters can
      stimulate CNV to yield reproducible, environment-specific genetic changes. We
      propose a general mechanism for environmentally-stimulated CNV and validate this 
      mechanism for the emergence of copper resistance in budding yeast. By analysing a
      large cohort of individual cells, we directly demonstrate that CNV of the
      copper-resistance gene CUP1 is stimulated by environmental copper. CNV
      stimulation accelerates the formation of novel alleles conferring enhanced copper
      resistance, such that copper exposure actively drives adaptation to copper-rich
      environments. Furthermore, quantification of CNV in individual cells reveals
      remarkable allele selectivity in the rate at which specific environments
      stimulate CNV. We define the key mechanistic elements underlying this
      selectivity, demonstrating that CNV is regulated by both promoter activity and
      acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56ac) and that H3K56ac is required for
      CUP1 CNV and efficient copper adaptation. Stimulated CNV is not limited to
      high-copy CUP1 repeat arrays, as we find that H3K56ac also regulates CNV in 3
      copy arrays of CUP1 or SFA1 genes. The impact of transcription on DNA damage is
      well understood, but our research reveals that this apparently problematic
      association forms a pathway by which mutations can be directed to particular loci
      in particular environments and furthermore that this mutagenic process can be
      regulated through histone acetylation. Stimulated CNV therefore represents an
      unanticipated and remarkably controllable pathway facilitating organismal
      adaptation to new environments.

TI  - Human cyclophilin 40 unravels neurotoxic amyloids.
PG  - e2001336
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001336 [doi]
AB  - The accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins is a pathological hallmark of
      neurodegenerative disorders. The aberrant accumulation of the microtubule
      associating protein tau (MAPT, tau) into toxic oligomers and amyloid deposits is 
      a primary pathology in tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Intrinsically disordered proteins, like tau, are enriched with
      proline residues that regulate both secondary structure and aggregation
      propensity. The orientation of proline residues is regulated by cis/trans
      peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases). Here we show that cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), a
      PPIase, dissolves tau amyloids in vitro. Additionally, CyP40 ameliorated
      silver-positive and oligomeric tau species in a mouse model of tau accumulation, 
      preserving neuronal health and cognition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
      revealed that CyP40 interacts with tau at sites rich in proline residues. CyP40
      was also able to interact with and disaggregate other aggregating proteins that
      contain prolines. Moreover, CyP40 lacking PPIase activity prevented its capacity 
      for disaggregation in vitro. Finally, we describe a unique structural property of
      CyP40 that may permit disaggregation to occur in an energy-independent manner.
      This study identifies a novel human protein disaggregase and, for the first time,
      demonstrates its capacity to dissolve intracellular amyloids.

TI  - Two different mechanisms support selective attention at different phases of
      training.
PG  - e2001724
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001724 [doi]
AB  - Selective attention supports the prioritized processing of relevant sensory
      information to facilitate goal-directed behavior. Studies in human subjects
      demonstrate that attentional gain of cortical responses can sufficiently account 
      for attention-related improvements in behavior. On the other hand, studies using 
      highly trained nonhuman primates suggest that reductions in neural noise can
      better explain attentional facilitation of behavior. Given the importance of
      selective information processing in nearly all domains of cognition, we sought to
      reconcile these competing accounts by testing the hypothesis that extensive
      behavioral training alters the neural mechanisms that support selective
      attention. We tested this hypothesis using electroencephalography (EEG) to
      measure stimulus-evoked visual responses from human subjects while they performed
      a selective spatial attention task over the course of ~1 month. Early in
      training, spatial attention led to an increase in the gain of stimulus-evoked
      visual responses. Gain was apparent within ~100 ms of stimulus onset, and a
      quantitative model based on signal detection theory (SDT) successfully linked the
      magnitude of this gain modulation to attention-related improvements in behavior. 
      However, after extensive training, this early attentional gain was eliminated
      even though there were still substantial attention-related improvements in
      behavior. Accordingly, the SDT-based model required noise reduction to account
      for the link between the stimulus-evoked visual responses and attentional
      modulations of behavior. These findings suggest that training can lead to
      fundamental changes in the way attention alters the early cortical responses that
      support selective information processing. Moreover, these data facilitate the
      translation of results across different species and across experimental
      procedures that employ different behavioral training regimes.

      phagocytosis during necroptosis.
PG  - e2002711
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002711 [doi]
AB  - Necroptosis is a regulated, nonapoptotic form of cell death initiated by
      receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase
      domain-like (MLKL) proteins. It is considered to be a form of regulated necrosis,
      and, by lacking the "find me" and "eat me" signals that are a feature of
      apoptosis, necroptosis is considered to be inflammatory. One such "eat me" signal
      observed during apoptosis is the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer
      plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that necroptotic cells also expose PS after
      phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase-like (pMLKL) translocation to the membrane.
      Necroptotic cells that expose PS release extracellular vesicles containing
      proteins and pMLKL to their surroundings. Furthermore, inhibition of pMLKL after 
      PS exposure can reverse the process of necroptosis and restore cell viability.
      Finally, externalization of PS by necroptotic cells drives recognition and
      phagocytosis, and this may limit the inflammatory response to this nonapoptotic
      form of cell death. The exposure of PS to the outer membrane and to extracellular
      vesicles is therefore a feature of necroptotic cell death and may serve to
      provide an immunologically-silent window by generating specific "find me" and
      "eat me" signals.

TI  - What drives cooperative breeding?
PG  - e2002965
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002965 [doi]
AB  - Cooperative breeding, in which more than a pair of conspecifics cooperate to
      raise young at a single nest or brood, is widespread among vertebrates but highly
      variable in its geographic distribution. Particularly vexing has been identifying
      the ecological correlates of this phenomenon, which has been suggested to be
      favored in populations inhabiting both relatively stable, productive environments
      and in populations living under highly variable and unpredictable conditions.
      Griesser et al. provide a novel approach to this problem, performing a
      phylogenetic analysis indicating that family living is an intermediate step
      between nonsocial and cooperative breeding birds. They then examine the
      ecological and climatic conditions associated with these different social
      systems, concluding that cooperative breeding emerges when family living is
      favored in highly productive environments, followed secondarily by selection for 
      cooperative breeding when environmental conditions deteriorate and within-year
      variability increases. Combined with recent work addressing the fitness
      consequences of cooperative breeding, Griesser et al.'s contribution stands to
      move the field forward by demonstrating that the evolution of complex adaptations
      such as cooperative breeding may only be understood when each of the steps
      leading to it are identified and carefully integrated.

TI  - Family living sets the stage for cooperative breeding and ecological resilience
      in birds.
PG  - e2000483
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000483 [doi]
AB  - Cooperative breeding is an extreme form of cooperation that evolved in a range of
      lineages, including arthropods, fish, birds, and mammals. Although cooperative
      breeding in birds is widespread and well-studied, the conditions that favored its
      evolution are still unclear. Based on phylogenetic comparative analyses on 3,005 
      bird species, we demonstrate here that family living acted as an essential
      stepping stone in the evolution of cooperative breeding in the vast majority of
      species. First, families formed by prolonging parent-offspring associations
      beyond nutritional independency, and second, retained offspring began helping at 
      the nest. These findings suggest that assessment of the conditions that favor the
      evolution of cooperative breeding can be confounded if this process is not
      considered to include 2 steps. Specifically, phylogenetic linear mixed models
      show that the formation of families was associated with more productive and
      seasonal environments, where prolonged parent-offspring associations are likely
      to be less costly. However, our data show that the subsequent evolution of
      cooperative breeding was instead linked to environments with variable
      productivity, where helpers at the nest can buffer reproductive failure in harsh 
      years. The proposed 2-step framework helps resolve current disagreements about
      the role of environmental forces in the evolution of cooperative breeding and
      better explains the geographic distribution of this trait. Many geographic
      hotspots of cooperative breeding have experienced a historical decline in
      productivity, suggesting that a higher proportion of family-living species could 
      have been able to avoid extinction under harshening conditions through the
      evolution of cooperative breeding. These findings underscore the importance of
      considering the potentially different factors that drive different steps in the
      evolution of complex adaptations.

TI  - Laminin 211 inhibits protein kinase A in Schwann cells to modulate neuregulin 1
      type III-driven myelination.
PG  - e2001408
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001408 [doi]
AB  - Myelin is required for proper nervous system function. Schwann cells in
      developing nerves depend on extrinsic signals from the axon and from the
      extracellular matrix to first sort and ensheathe a single axon and then myelinate
      it. Neuregulin 1 type III (Nrg1III) and laminin alpha2beta1gamma1 (Lm211) are the
      key axonal and matrix signals, respectively, but how their signaling is
      integrated and if each molecule controls both axonal sorting and myelination is
      unclear. Here, we use a series of epistasis experiments to show that Lm211
      modulates neuregulin signaling to ensure the correct timing and amount of
      myelination. Lm211 can inhibit Nrg1III by limiting protein kinase A (PKA)
      activation, which is required to initiate myelination. We provide evidence that
      excessive PKA activation amplifies promyelinating signals downstream of
      neuregulin, including direct activation of the neuregulin receptor ErbB2 and its 
      effector Grb2-Associated Binder-1 (Gab1), thereby elevating the expression of the
      key transcription factors Oct6 and early growth response protein 2 (Egr2). The
      inhibitory effect of Lm211 is seen only in fibers of small caliber. These data
      may explain why hereditary neuropathies associated with decreased laminin
      function are characterized by focally thick and redundant myelin.

TI  - High-throughput identification and rational design of synergistic small-molecule 
      pairs for combating and bypassing antibiotic resistance.
PG  - e2001644
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001644 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant infections kill approximately 23,000 people and cost
      $20,000,000,000 each year in the United States alone despite the widespread use
      of small-molecule antimicrobial combination therapy. Antibiotic combinations
      typically have an additive effect: the efficacy of the combination matches the
      sum of the efficacies of each antibiotic when used alone. Small molecules can
      also act synergistically when the efficacy of the combination is greater than the
      additive efficacy. However, synergistic combinations are rare and have been
      historically difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic
      pairs is limited by the scale of potential combinations: a modest collection of
      1,000 small molecules involves 1 million pairwise combinations. Here, we describe
      a high-throughput method for rapid identification of synergistic small-molecule
      pairs, the overlap2 method (O2M). O2M extracts patterns from chemical-genetic
      datasets, which are created when a collection of mutants is grown in the presence
      of hundreds of different small molecules, producing a precise set of phenotypes
      induced by each small molecule across the mutant set. The identification of
      mutants that show the same phenotype when treated with known synergistic
      molecules allows us to pinpoint additional molecule combinations that also act
      synergistically. As a proof of concept, we focus on combinations with the
      antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfamethizole, which had been standard treatment
      against urinary tract infections until widespread resistance decreased efficacy. 
      Using O2M, we screened a library of 2,000 small molecules and identified several 
      that synergize with the antibiotic trimethoprim and/or sulfamethizole. The most
      potent of these synergistic interactions is with the antiviral drug
      azidothymidine (AZT). We then demonstrate that understanding the molecular
      mechanism underlying small-molecule synergistic interactions allows the rational 
      design of additional combinations that bypass drug resistance. Trimethoprim and
      sulfamethizole are both folate biosynthesis inhibitors. We find that this
      activity disrupts nucleotide homeostasis, which blocks DNA replication in the
      presence of AZT. Building on these data, we show that other small molecules that 
      disrupt nucleotide homeostasis through other mechanisms (hydroxyurea and
      floxuridine) also act synergistically with AZT. These novel combinations inhibit 
      the growth and virulence of trimethoprim-resistant clinical Escherichia coli and 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, suggesting that they may be able to be rapidly
      advanced into clinical use. In sum, we present a generalizable method to screen
      for novel synergistic combinations, to identify particular mechanisms resulting
      in synergy, and to use the mechanistic knowledge to rationally design new
      combinations that bypass drug resistance.

TI  - MAIT cells launch a rapid, robust and distinct hyperinflammatory response to
      bacterial superantigens and quickly acquire an anergic phenotype that impedes
      their cognate antimicrobial function: Defining a novel mechanism of
      superantigen-induced immunopathology and immunosuppression.
PG  - e2001930
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001930 [doi]
AB  - Superantigens (SAgs) are potent exotoxins secreted by Staphylococcus aureus and
      Streptococcus pyogenes. They target a large fraction of T cell pools to set in
      motion a "cytokine storm" with severe and sometimes life-threatening consequences
      typically encountered in toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Given the rapidity with
      which TSS develops, designing timely and truly targeted therapies for this
      syndrome requires identification of key mediators of the cytokine storm's initial
      wave. Equally important, early host responses to SAgs can be accompanied or
      followed by a state of immunosuppression, which in turn jeopardizes the host's
      ability to combat and clear infections. Unlike in mouse models, the mechanisms
      underlying SAg-associated immunosuppression in humans are ill-defined. In this
      work, we have identified a population of innate-like T cells, called
      mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, as the most powerful source of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines after exposure to SAgs. We have utilized primary human
      peripheral blood and hepatic mononuclear cells, mouse MAIT hybridoma lines,
      HLA-DR4-transgenic mice, MAIThighHLA-DR4+ bone marrow chimeras, and humanized
      NOD-scid IL-2Rgammanull mice to demonstrate for the first time that: i) mouse and
      human MAIT cells are hyperresponsive to SAgs, typified by staphylococcal
      enterotoxin B (SEB); ii) the human MAIT cell response to SEB is rapid and far
      greater in magnitude than that launched by unfractionated conventional T,
      invariant natural killer T (iNKT) or gammadelta T cells, and is characterized by 
      production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and
      interleukin (IL)-2, but not IL-17A; iii) high-affinity MHC class II interaction
      with SAgs, but not MHC-related protein 1 (MR1) participation, is required for
      MAIT cell activation; iv) MAIT cell responses to SEB can occur in a T cell
      receptor (TCR) Vbeta-specific manner but are largely contributed by IL-12 and
      IL-18; v) as MAIT cells are primed by SAgs, they also begin to develop a
      molecular signature consistent with exhaustion and failure to participate in
      antimicrobial defense. Accordingly, they upregulate lymphocyte-activation gene 3 
      (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-3 (TIM-3), and/or programmed cell
      death-1 (PD-1), and acquire an anergic phenotype that interferes with their
      cognate function against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli; vi) MAIT
      cell hyperactivation and anergy co-utilize a signaling pathway that is governed
      by p38 and MEK1/2. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a pathogenic, rather
      than protective, role for MAIT cells during infection. Furthermore, we propose a 
      novel mechanism of SAg-associated immunosuppression in humans. MAIT cells may
      therefore provide an attractive therapeutic target for the management of both
      early and late phases of severe SAg-mediated illnesses.

TI  - Aging, mortality, and the fast growth trade-off of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
PG  - e2001109
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001109 [doi]
AB  - Replicative aging has been demonstrated in asymmetrically dividing unicellular
      organisms, seemingly caused by unequal damage partitioning. Although asymmetric
      segregation and inheritance of potential aging factors also occur in
      symmetrically dividing species, it nevertheless remains controversial whether
      this results in aging. Based on large-scale single-cell lineage data obtained by 
      time-lapse microscopy with a microfluidic device, in this report, we demonstrate 
      the absence of replicative aging in old-pole cell lineages of Schizosaccharomyces
      pombe cultured under constant favorable conditions. By monitoring more than 1,500
      cell lineages in 7 different culture conditions, we showed that both cell
      division and death rates are remarkably constant for at least 50-80 generations. 
      Our measurements revealed that the death rate per cellular generation increases
      with the division rate, pointing to a physiological trade-off with fast growth
      under balanced growth conditions. We also observed the formation and inheritance 
      of Hsp104-associated protein aggregates, which are a potential aging factor in
      old-pole cell lineages, and found that these aggregates exhibited a tendency to
      preferentially remain at the old poles for several generations. However, the
      aggregates were eventually segregated from old-pole cells upon cell division and 
      probabilistically allocated to new-pole cells. We found that cell deaths were
      typically preceded by sudden acceleration of protein aggregation; thus, a
      relatively large amount of protein aggregates existed at the very ends of the
      dead cell lineages. Our lineage tracking analyses, however, revealed that the
      quantity and inheritance of protein aggregates increased neither cellular
      generation time nor cell death initiation rates. Furthermore, our results
      demonstrated that unusually large amounts of protein aggregates induced by
      oxidative stress exposure did not result in aging; old-pole cells resumed normal 
      growth upon stress removal, despite the fact that most of them inherited
      significant quantities of aggregates. These results collectively indicate that
      protein aggregates are not a major determinant of triggering cell death in S.
      pombe and thus cannot be an appropriate molecular marker or index for replicative
      aging under both favorable and stressful environmental conditions.

TI  - Egocentric and allocentric representations in auditory cortex.
PG  - e2001878
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001878 [doi]
AB  - A key function of the brain is to provide a stable representation of an object's 
      location in the world. In hearing, sound azimuth and elevation are encoded by
      neurons throughout the auditory system, and auditory cortex is necessary for
      sound localization. However, the coordinate frame in which neurons represent
      sound space remains undefined: classical spatial receptive fields in head-fixed
      subjects can be explained either by sensitivity to sound source location relative
      to the head (egocentric) or relative to the world (allocentric encoding). This
      coordinate frame ambiguity can be resolved by studying freely moving subjects;
      here we recorded spatial receptive fields in the auditory cortex of freely moving
      ferrets. We found that most spatially tuned neurons represented sound source
      location relative to the head across changes in head position and direction. In
      addition, we also recorded a small number of neurons in which sound location was 
      represented in a world-centered coordinate frame. We used measurements of spatial
      tuning across changes in head position and direction to explore the influence of 
      sound source distance and speed of head movement on auditory cortical activity
      and spatial tuning. Modulation depth of spatial tuning increased with distance
      for egocentric but not allocentric units, whereas, for both populations,
      modulation was stronger at faster movement speeds. Our findings suggest that
      early auditory cortex primarily represents sound source location relative to
      ourselves but that a minority of cells can represent sound location in the world 
      independent of our own position.

TI  - CACNA1C gene regulates behavioral strategies in operant rule learning.
PG  - e2000936
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000936 [doi]
AB  - Behavioral experiments are usually designed to tap into a specific cognitive
      function, but animals may solve a given task through a variety of different and
      individual behavioral strategies, some of them not foreseen by the experimenter. 
      Animal learning may therefore be seen more as the process of selecting among, and
      adapting, potential behavioral policies, rather than mere strengthening of
      associative links. Calcium influx through high-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is
      central to synaptic plasticity, and altered expression of Cav1.2 channels and the
      CACNA1C gene have been associated with severe learning deficits and psychiatric
      disorders. Given this, we were interested in how specifically a selective
      functional ablation of the Cacna1c gene would modulate the learning process.
      Using a detailed, individual-level analysis of learning on an operant cue
      discrimination task in terms of behavioral strategies, combined with Bayesian
      selection among computational models estimated from the empirical data, we show
      that a Cacna1c knockout does not impair learning in general but has a much more
      specific effect: the majority of Cacna1c knockout mice still managed to increase 
      reward feedback across trials but did so by adapting an outcome-based strategy,
      while the majority of matched controls adopted the experimentally intended
      cue-association rule. Our results thus point to a quite specific role of a single
      gene in learning and highlight that much more mechanistic insight could be gained
      by examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential
      behavioral strategies. The results may also have clinical implications for
      treating psychiatric disorders.

      viral load in Europe.
PG  - e2001855
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001855 [doi]
AB  - HIV-1 set-point viral load-the approximately stable value of viraemia in the
      first years of chronic infection-is a strong predictor of clinical outcome and is
      highly variable across infected individuals. To better understand HIV-1
      pathogenesis and the evolution of the viral population, we must quantify the
      heritability of set-point viral load, which is the fraction of variation in this 
      phenotype attributable to viral genetic variation. However, current estimates of 
      heritability vary widely, from 6% to 59%. Here we used a dataset of 2,028
      seroconverters infected between 1985 and 2013 from 5 European countries (Belgium,
      Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and estimated the
      heritability of set-point viral load at 31% (CI 15%-43%). Specifically,
      heritability was measured using models of character evolution describing how
      viral load evolves on the phylogeny of whole-genome viral sequences. In contrast 
      to previous studies, (i) we measured viral loads using standardized assays on a
      sample collected in a strict time window of 6 to 24 months after infection, from 
      which the viral genome was also sequenced; (ii) we compared 2 models of character
      evolution, the classical "Brownian motion" model and another model
      ("Ornstein-Uhlenbeck") that includes stabilising selection on viral load; (iii)
      we controlled for covariates, including age and sex, which may inflate estimates 
      of heritability; and (iv) we developed a goodness of fit test based on the
      correlation of viral loads in cherries of the phylogenetic tree, showing that
      both models of character evolution fit the data well. An overall heritability of 
      31% (CI 15%-43%) is consistent with other studies based on regression of viral
      load in donor-recipient pairs. Thus, about a third of variation in HIV-1
      virulence is attributable to viral genetic variation.

AB  - Organisms often encounter stressful conditions, some of which damage their DNA.
      In response, some organisms show a high expression of error-prone DNA repair
      machinery, causing a temporary increase in the genome-wide mutation rate.
      Although we now have a detailed map of the molecular mechanisms underlying such
      stress-induced mutagenesis (SIM), it has been hotly debated whether SIM alters
      evolutionary dynamics. Key to this controversy is our poor understanding about
      which stresses increase mutagenesis and their long-term consequences for
      adaptation. In a new study with Escherichia coli, Maharjan and Ferenci show that 
      while only some nutritional stresses (phosphorous and carbon limitation) increase
      total mutation rates, each stress generates a unique spectrum of mutations. Their
      results suggest the potential for specific stresses to shape evolutionary
      dynamics and highlight the necessity for explicit tests of the long-term
      evolutionary impacts of SIM.

      datasets.
PG  - e2002477
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002477 [doi]
AB  - Open data is a vital pillar of open science and a key enabler for
      reproducibility, data reuse, and novel discoveries. Enforcement of open-data
      policies, however, largely relies on manual efforts, which invariably lag behind 
      the increasingly automated generation of biological data. To address this
      problem, we developed a general approach to automatically identify datasets
      overdue for public release by applying text mining to identify dataset references
      in published articles and parse query results from repositories to determine if
      the datasets remain private. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on
      2 popular National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repositories: Gene
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Our Wide-Open system
      identified a large number of overdue datasets, which spurred administrators to
      respond directly by releasing 400 datasets in one week.

TI  - A shifting mutational landscape in 6 nutritional states: Stress-induced
      mutagenesis as a series of distinct stress input-mutation output relationships.
PG  - e2001477
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001477 [doi]
AB  - Environmental stresses increase genetic variation in bacteria, plants, and human 
      cancer cells. The linkage between various environments and mutational outcomes
      has not been systematically investigated, however. Here, we established the
      influence of nutritional stresses commonly found in the biosphere (carbon,
      phosphate, nitrogen, oxygen, or iron limitation) on both the rate and spectrum of
      mutations in Escherichia coli. We found that each limitation was associated with 
      a remarkably distinct mutational profile. Overall mutation rates were not always 
      elevated, and nitrogen, iron, and oxygen limitation resulted in major spectral
      changes but no net increase in rate. Our results thus suggest that stress-induced
      mutagenesis is a diverse series of stress input-mutation output linkages that is 
      distinct in every condition. Environment-specific spectra resulted in the
      differential emergence of traits needing particular mutations in these settings. 
      Mutations requiring transpositions were highest under iron and oxygen limitation,
      whereas base-pair substitutions and indels were highest under phosphate
      limitation. The unexpected diversity of input-output effects explains some
      important phenomena in the mutational biases of evolving genomes. The prevalence 
      of bacterial insertion sequence transpositions in the mammalian gut or in
      anaerobically stored cultures is due to environmentally determined mutation
      availability. Likewise, the much-discussed genomic bias towards transition base
      substitutions in evolving genomes can now be explained as an environment-specific
      output. Altogether, our conclusion is that environments influence genetic
      variation as well as selection.

TI  - What makes a reach movement effortful? Physical effort discounting supports
      common minimization principles in decision making and motor control.
PG  - e2001323
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001323 [doi]
AB  - When deciding between alternative options, a rational agent chooses on the basis 
      of the desirability of each outcome, including associated costs. As different
      options typically result in different actions, the effort associated with each
      action is an essential cost parameter. How do humans discount physical effort
      when deciding between movements? We used an action-selection task to characterize
      how subjective effort depends on the parameters of arm transport movements and
      controlled for potential confounding factors such as delay discounting and
      performance. First, by repeatedly asking subjects to choose between 2 arm
      movements of different amplitudes or durations, performed against different
      levels of force, we identified parameter combinations that subjects experienced
      as identical in effort (isoeffort curves). Movements with a long duration were
      judged more effortful than short-duration movements against the same force, while
      movement amplitudes did not influence effort. Biomechanics of the movements also 
      affected effort, as movements towards the body midline were preferred to
      movements away from it. Second, by introducing movement repetitions, we further
      determined that the cost function for choosing between effortful movements had a 
      quadratic relationship with force, while choices were made on the basis of the
      logarithm of these costs. Our results show that effort-based action selection
      during reaching cannot easily be explained by metabolic costs. Instead,
      force-loaded reaches, a widely occurring natural behavior, imposed an effort cost
      for decision making similar to cost functions in motor control. Our results
      thereby support the idea that motor control and economic choice are governed by
      partly overlapping optimization principles.

PG  - e2002780
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002780 [doi]
AB  - In many regions of the world, mosquito-borne viruses pose a growing threat to
      human health. As an alternative to traditional control measures, the bacterial
      symbiont Wolbachia has been transferred from Drosophila into the mosquito Aedes
      aegypti, where it can block the transmission of dengue and Zika viruses. A recent
      paper has reported large-scale releases of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti in the 
      city of Cairns, Australia. Wolbachia, which is maternally transmitted, invaded
      and spread through the populations due to a sperm-egg incompatibility called
      cytoplasmic incompatibility. Over a period of 2 years, a wave of Wolbachia
      infection slowly spread out from 2 release sites, demonstrating that it will be
      possible to deploy this strategy in large urban areas. In line with theoretical
      predictions, Wolbachia infection at a third, smaller release site collapsed due
      to the immigration of Wolbachia-free mosquitoes from surrounding areas. This
      remarkable field experiment has both validated theoretical models of Wolbachia
      population dynamics and demonstrated that this is a viable strategy to modify
      mosquito populations.

TI  - Statin and rottlerin small-molecule inhibitors restrict colon cancer progression 
      and metastasis via MACC1.
PG  - e2000784
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000784 [doi]
AB  - MACC1 (Metastasis Associated in Colon Cancer 1) is a key driver and prognostic
      biomarker for cancer progression and metastasis in a large variety of solid tumor
      types, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). However, no MACC1 inhibitors have
      been identified yet. Therefore, we aimed to target MACC1 expression using a
      luciferase reporter-based high-throughput screening with the ChemBioNet library
      of more than 30,000 compounds. The small molecules lovastatin and rottlerin
      emerged as the most potent MACC1 transcriptional inhibitors. They remarkably
      inhibited MACC1 promoter activity and expression, resulting in reduced cell
      motility. Lovastatin impaired the binding of the transcription factors c-Jun and 
      Sp1 to the MACC1 promoter, thereby inhibiting MACC1 transcription. Most
      importantly, in CRC-xenografted mice, lovastatin and rottlerin restricted MACC1
      expression and liver metastasis. This is-to the best of our knowledge-the first
      identification of inhibitors restricting cancer progression and metastasis via
      the novel target MACC1. This drug repositioning might be of therapeutic value for
      CRC patients.

TI  - Local introduction and heterogeneous spatial spread of dengue-suppressing
      Wolbachia through an urban population of Aedes aegypti.
PG  - e2001894
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001894 [doi]
AB  - Dengue-suppressing Wolbachia strains are promising tools for arbovirus control,
      particularly as they have the potential to self-spread following local
      introductions. To test this, we followed the frequency of the transinfected
      Wolbachia strain wMel through Ae. aegypti in Cairns, Australia, following
      releases at 3 nonisolated locations within the city in early 2013. Spatial spread
      was analysed graphically using interpolation and by fitting a statistical model
      describing the position and width of the wave. For the larger 2 of the 3 releases
      (covering 0.97 km2 and 0.52 km2), we observed slow but steady spatial spread, at 
      about 100-200 m per year, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. In
      contrast, the smallest release (0.11 km2) produced erratic temporal and spatial
      dynamics, with little evidence of spread after 2 years. This is consistent with
      the prediction concerning fitness-decreasing Wolbachia transinfections that a
      minimum release area is needed to achieve stable local establishment and spread
      in continuous habitats. Our graphical and likelihood analyses produced broadly
      consistent estimates of wave speed and wave width. Spread at all sites was
      spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity will affect 
      large-scale Wolbachia transformations of urban mosquito populations. The
      persistence and spread of Wolbachia in release areas meeting minimum area
      requirements indicates the promise of successful large-scale population
      transformation.

TI  - AEDT: A new concept for ecological dynamics in the ever-changing world.
PG  - e2002634
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002634 [doi]
AB  - The important concept of equilibrium has always been controversial in ecology,
      but a new, more general concept, an asymptotic environmentally determined
      trajectory (AEDT), overcomes many concerns with equilibrium by realistically
      incorporating long-term climate change while retaining much of the predictive
      power of a stable equilibrium. A population or ecological community is predicted 
      to approach its AEDT, which is a function of time reflecting environmental
      history and biology. The AEDT invokes familiar questions and predictions but in a
      more realistic context in which consideration of past environments and a future
      changing profoundly due to human influence becomes possible. Strong applications 
      are also predicted in population genetics, evolution, earth sciences, and
      economics.

TI  - Oligodendroglial myelination requires astrocyte-derived lipids.
PG  - e1002605
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002605 [doi]
AB  - In the vertebrate nervous system, myelination of axons for rapid impulse
      propagation requires the synthesis of large amounts of lipids and proteins by
      oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Myelin membranes are thought to be
      cell-autonomously assembled by these axon-associated glial cells. Here, we report
      the surprising finding that in normal brain development, a substantial fraction
      of the lipids incorporated into central nervous system (CNS) myelin are
      contributed by astrocytes. The oligodendrocyte-specific inactivation of sterol
      regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), an
      essential coactivator of the transcription factor SREBP and thus of lipid
      biosynthesis, resulted in significantly retarded CNS myelination; however, myelin
      appeared normal at 3 months of age. Importantly, embryonic deletion of the same
      gene in astrocytes, or in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, caused a persistent
      hypomyelination, as did deletion from astrocytes during postnatal development.
      Moreover, when astroglial lipid synthesis was inhibited, oligodendrocytes began
      incorporating circulating lipids into myelin membranes. Indeed, a lipid-enriched 
      diet was sufficient to rescue hypomyelination in these conditional mouse mutants.
      We conclude that lipid synthesis by oligodendrocytes is heavily supplemented by
      astrocytes in vivo and that horizontal lipid flux is a major feature of normal
      brain development and myelination.

AB  - Information processing in neural networks depends on the connectivity among
      excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The presence of parallel, distinctly
      controlled local circuits within a cortical network may ensure an effective and
      dynamic regulation of microcircuit function. By applying a combination of
      optogenetics, electrophysiological recordings, and high resolution microscopic
      techniques, we uncovered the organizing principles of synaptic communication
      between principal neurons and basket cells in the basal nucleus of the amygdala. 
      In this cortical structure, known to be critical for emotional memory formation, 
      we revealed the presence of 2 parallel basket cell networks expressing either
      parvalbumin or cholecystokinin. While the 2 basket cell types are mutually
      interconnected within their own category via synapses and gap junctions, they
      avoid innervating each other, but form synaptic contacts with axo-axonic cells.
      Importantly, both basket cell types have the similar potency to control principal
      neuron spiking, but they receive excitatory input from principal neurons with
      entirely diverse features. This distinct feedback synaptic excitation enables a
      markedly different recruitment of the 2 basket cell types upon the activation of 
      local principal neurons. Our data suggest fundamentally different functions for
      the 2 parallel basket cell networks in circuit operations in the amygdala.

TI  - The in vivo structure of biological membranes and evidence for lipid domains.
PG  - e2002214
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002214 [doi]
AB  - Examining the fundamental structure and processes of living cells at the
      nanoscale poses a unique analytical challenge, as cells are dynamic, chemically
      diverse, and fragile. A case in point is the cell membrane, which is too small to
      be seen directly with optical microscopy and provides little observational
      contrast for other methods. As a consequence, nanoscale characterization of the
      membrane has been performed ex vivo or in the presence of exogenous labels used
      to enhance contrast and impart specificity. Here, we introduce an isotopic
      labeling strategy in the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to investigate
      the nanoscale structure and organization of its plasma membrane in vivo. Through 
      genetic and chemical manipulation of the organism, we labeled the cell and its
      membrane independently with specific amounts of hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D).
      These isotopes have different neutron scattering properties without altering the 
      chemical composition of the cells. From neutron scattering spectra, we confirmed 
      that the B. subtilis cell membrane is lamellar and determined that its average
      hydrophobic thickness is 24.3 +/- 0.9 Angstroms (A). Furthermore, by creating
      neutron contrast within the plane of the membrane using a mixture of H- and
      D-fatty acids, we detected lateral features smaller than 40 nm that are
      consistent with the notion of lipid rafts. These experiments-performed under
      biologically relevant conditions-answer long-standing questions in membrane
      biology and illustrate a fundamentally new approach for systematic in vivo
      investigations of cell membrane structure.

TI  - Teaching genetics prior to teaching evolution improves evolution understanding
      but not acceptance.
PG  - e2002255
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002255 [doi]
AB  - What is the best way to teach evolution? As microevolution may be configured as a
      branch of genetics, it being a short conceptual leap from understanding the
      concepts of mutation and alleles (i.e., genetics) to allele frequency change
      (i.e., evolution), we hypothesised that learning genetics prior to evolution
      might improve student understanding of evolution. In the UK, genetics and
      evolution are typically taught to 14- to 16-y-old secondary school students as
      separate topics with few links, in no particular order and sometimes with a large
      time span between. Here, then, we report the results of a large trial into
      teaching order of evolution and genetics. We modified extant questionnaires to
      ascertain students' understanding of evolution and genetics along with acceptance
      of evolution. Students were assessed prior to teaching, immediately post teaching
      and again after several months. Teachers were not instructed what to teach, just 
      to teach in a given order. Regardless of order, teaching increased understanding 
      and acceptance, with robust signs of longer-term retention. Importantly, teaching
      genetics before teaching evolution has a significant (p < 0.001) impact on
      improving evolution understanding by 7% in questionnaire scores beyond the
      increase seen for those taught in the inverse order. For lower ability students, 
      an improvement in evolution understanding was seen only if genetics was taught
      first. Teaching genetics first additionally had positive effects on genetics
      understanding, by increasing knowledge. These results suggest a simple, minimally
      disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve evolution understanding: teach
      genetics first. This same alteration does not, however, result in a significantly
      increased acceptance of evolution, which reflects a weak correlation between
      knowledge and acceptance of evolution. Qualitative focus group data highlights
      the role of authority figures in determination of acceptance.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001390 [doi]
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading infectious causes of food-borne
      illness around the world. Its ability to persistently colonize the intestinal
      tract of a broad range of hosts, including food-producing animals, is central to 
      its epidemiology since most infections are due to the consumption of contaminated
      food products. Using a highly saturated transposon insertion library combined
      with next-generation sequencing and a mouse model of infection, we have carried
      out a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the fitness determinants for growth
      in vitro and in vivo of a highly pathogenic strain of C. jejuni. A comparison of 
      the C. jejuni requirements to colonize the mouse intestine with those necessary
      to grow in different culture media in vitro, combined with isotopologue profiling
      and metabolic flow analysis, allowed us to identify its metabolic requirements to
      establish infection, including the ability to acquire certain nutrients,
      metabolize specific substrates, or maintain intracellular ion homeostasis. This
      comprehensive analysis has identified metabolic pathways that could provide the
      basis for the development of novel strategies to prevent C. jejuni colonization
      of food-producing animals or to treat human infections.

PG  - e2000779
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000779 [doi]
AB  - Synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (sSNPs) are considered neutral for
      protein function, as by definition they exchange only codons, not amino acids. We
      identified an sSNP that modifies the local translation speed of the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), leading to detrimental
      changes to protein stability and function. This sSNP introduces a codon pairing
      to a low-abundance tRNA that is particularly rare in human bronchial epithelia,
      but not in other human tissues, suggesting tissue-specific effects of this sSNP. 
      Up-regulation of the tRNA cognate to the mutated codon counteracts the effects of
      the sSNP and rescues protein conformation and function. Our results highlight the
      wide-ranging impact of sSNPs, which invert the programmed local speed of mRNA
      translation and provide direct evidence for the central role of cellular tRNA
      levels in mediating the actions of sSNPs in a tissue-specific manner.

TI  - Evolutionary restoration of fertility in an interspecies hybrid yeast, by
      whole-genome duplication after a failed mating-type switch.
PG  - e2002128
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002128 [doi]
AB  - Many interspecies hybrids have been discovered in yeasts, but most of these
      hybrids are asexual and can replicate only mitotically. Whole-genome duplication 
      has been proposed as a mechanism by which interspecies hybrids can regain
      fertility, restoring their ability to perform meiosis and sporulate. Here, we
      show that this process occurred naturally during the evolution of
      Zygosaccharomyces parabailii, an interspecies hybrid that was formed by mating
      between 2 parents that differed by 7% in genome sequence and by many
      interchromosomal rearrangements. Surprisingly, Z. parabailii has a full sexual
      cycle and is genetically haploid. It goes through mating-type switching and
      autodiploidization, followed by immediate sporulation. We identified the key
      evolutionary event that enabled Z. parabailii to regain fertility, which was
      breakage of 1 of the 2 homeologous copies of the mating-type (MAT) locus in the
      hybrid, resulting in a chromosomal rearrangement and irreparable damage to 1 MAT 
      locus. This rearrangement was caused by HO endonuclease, which normally functions
      in mating-type switching. With 1 copy of MAT inactivated, the interspecies hybrid
      now behaves as a haploid. Our results provide the first demonstration that MAT
      locus damage is a naturally occurring evolutionary mechanism for whole-genome
      duplication and restoration of fertility to interspecies hybrids. The events that
      occurred in Z. parabailii strongly resemble those postulated to have caused
      ancient whole-genome duplication in an ancestor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

AB  - In today's increasingly technological society, a workforce proficient in science,
      technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills is essential. Research has
      shown that active engagement by K-12 students in hands-on science activities that
      use authentic science tools promotes student learning and retention. Mobile
      laboratory programs provide this type of learning in schools and communities
      across the United States and internationally. Many programs are members of the
      Mobile Lab Coalition (MLC), a nonprofit organization of mobile and other
      laboratory-based education programs built on scientist and educator
      collaborations. A recent survey of the member programs revealed that they provide
      an impressive variety of programming and have collectively served over 1.2
      million students across the US.

AB  - Ever since the discovery of neural stem cells in the mammalian brain, the
      possibility of brain tissue regeneration has captured the minds of scientists,
      clinicians, and the public. Neural stem cells have been envisioned as a source of
      donor cells for transplantation and vectors for the delivery of gene therapy.
      Over the past decade, many researchers have contributed to characterizing these
      cells and their lineages, providing the foundation for their utilization as
      therapeutic devices. In a new study, Azim and colleagues took a different
      approach: using pharmacogenomics to focus on neural stem cell lineage, they
      identified specific compounds that can direct neural stem cell fate toward a
      specific lineage in vivo, both in physiological and pathological conditions.
      Their work opens new avenues for treatment of neurodegenerative and demyelinating
      disorders.

TI  - A coordinated DNA damage response promotes adult quiescent neural stem cell
      activation.
PG  - e2001264
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001264 [doi]
AB  - Stem and differentiated cells frequently differ in their response to DNA damage, 
      which can determine tissue sensitivity. By exploiting insight into the spatial
      arrangement of subdomains within the adult neural subventricular zone (SVZ) in
      vivo, we show distinct responses to ionising radiation (IR) between neural stem
      and progenitor cells. Further, we reveal different DNA damage responses between
      neonatal and adult neural stem cells (NSCs). Neural progenitors (transit
      amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not NSCs (quiescent and activated) undergo 
      apoptosis after 2 Gy IR. This response is cell type- rather than
      proliferation-dependent and does not appear to be driven by distinctions in DNA
      damage induction or repair capacity. Moreover, exposure to 2 Gy IR promotes
      proliferation arrest and differentiation in the adult SVZ. These 3 responses are 
      ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent and promote quiescent NSC (qNSC)
      activation, which does not occur in the subdomains that lack progenitors.
      Neuroblasts arising post-IR derive from activated qNSCs rather than irradiated
      progenitors, minimising damage compounded by replication or mitosis. We propose
      that rather than conferring sensitive cell death, apoptosis is a form of rapid
      cell death that serves to remove damaged progenitors and promote qNSC activation.
      Significantly, analysis of the neonatal (P5) SVZ reveals that although
      progenitors remain sensitive to apoptosis, they fail to efficiently arrest
      proliferation. Consequently, their repopulation occurs rapidly from irradiated
      progenitors rather than via qNSC activation.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000644 [doi]
AB  - Genetically identical cells frequently display substantial heterogeneity in gene 
      expression, cellular morphology and physiology. It has been suggested that by
      rapidly generating a subpopulation with novel phenotypic traits, phenotypic
      heterogeneity (or plasticity) accelerates the rate of adaptive evolution in
      populations facing extreme environmental challenges. This issue is important as
      cell-to-cell phenotypic heterogeneity may initiate key steps in microbial
      evolution of drug resistance and cancer progression. Here, we study how
      stochastic transitions between cellular states influence evolutionary adaptation 
      to a stressful environment in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed
      inducible synthetic gene circuits that generate varying degrees of expression
      stochasticity of an antifungal resistance gene. We initiated laboratory
      evolutionary experiments with genotypes carrying different versions of the
      genetic circuit by exposing the corresponding populations to gradually increasing
      antifungal stress. Phenotypic heterogeneity altered the evolutionary dynamics by 
      transforming the adaptive landscape that relates genotype to fitness.
      Specifically, it enhanced the adaptive value of beneficial mutations through
      synergism between cell-to-cell variability and genetic variation. Our work
      demonstrates that phenotypic heterogeneity is an evolving trait when populations 
      face a chronic selection pressure. It shapes evolutionary trajectories at the
      genomic level and facilitates evolutionary rescue from a deteriorating
      environmental stress.

AB  - This work examined the mechanisms underlying auditory motion processing in the
      auditory cortex of awake monkeys using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI). We tested to what extent auditory motion analysis can be explained by the
      linear combination of static spatial mechanisms, spectrotemporal processes, and
      their interaction. We found that the posterior auditory cortex, including A1 and 
      the surrounding caudal belt and parabelt, is involved in auditory motion
      analysis. Static spatial and spectrotemporal processes were able to fully explain
      motion-induced activation in most parts of the auditory cortex, including A1, but
      not in circumscribed regions of the posterior belt and parabelt cortex. We show
      that in these regions motion-specific processes contribute to the activation,
      providing the first demonstration that auditory motion is not simply deduced from
      changes in static spatial location. These results demonstrate that parallel
      mechanisms for motion and static spatial analysis coexist within the auditory
      dorsal stream.

TI  - The co-production of what? Knowledge, values, and social relations in health
      care.
PG  - e2001403
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001403 [doi]
AB  - "Co-production" is becoming an increasingly popular term in policymaking,
      governance, and research. While the shift from engagement and involvement to
      co-production in health care holds the promise of revolutionising health services
      and research, it is not always evident what counts as co-production: what is
      being produced, under what circumstances, and with what implications for
      participants. We discuss these questions and propose that co-production can be
      understood as an exploratory space and a generative process that leads to
      different, and sometimes unexpected, forms of knowledge, values, and social
      relations. By opening up this discussion, we hope to stimulate future debates on 
      co-production as well as draw out ways of thinking differently about
      collaboration and participation in health care and research. Part of the title of
      this article is inspired by the book "The Social Construction of What?" by Ian
      Hacking (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; 2000).

TI  - Smek promotes corticogenesis through regulating Mbd3's stability and Mbd3/NuRD
      complex recruitment to genes associated with neurogenesis.
PG  - e2001220
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001220 [doi]
AB  - The fate of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during corticogenesis is determined by
      a complex interplay of genetic or epigenetic components, but the underlying
      mechanism is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that Suppressor of Mek
      null (Smek) interact with methyl-CpG-binding domain 3 (Mbd3) and the complex
      plays a critical role in self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of NPCs. We
      found that Smek promotes Mbd3 polyubiquitylation and degradation, blocking
      recruitment of the repressive Mbd3/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD)
      complex at the neurogenesis-associated gene loci, and, as a consequence,
      increasing acetyl histone H3 activity and cortical neurogenesis. Furthermore,
      overexpression of Mbd3 significantly blocked neuronal differentiation of NPCs,
      and Mbd3 depletion rescued neurogenesis defects seen in Smek1/2 knockout mice.
      These results reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying Smek/Mbd3/NuRD
      axis-mediated control of NPCs' self-renewal and neuronal differentiation during
      mammalian corticogenesis.

AB  - Long before bacteria infected humans, they infected amoebas, which remain a
      potentially important reservoir for human disease. Diverse soil amoebas including
      Dictyostelium and Acanthamoeba can host intracellular bacteria. Though the
      internal environment of free-living amoebas is similar in many ways to that of
      mammalian macrophages, they differ in a number of important ways, including
      temperature. A new study in PLOS Biology by Taylor-Mulneix et al. demonstrates
      that Bordetella bronchiseptica has two different gene suites that are activated
      depending on whether the bacterium finds itself in a hot mammalian or cool amoeba
      host environment. This study specifically shows that B. bronchiseptica not only
      inhabits amoebas but can persist and multiply through the social stage of an
      amoeba host, Dictyostelium discoideum.

TI  - Effects of stochasticity and division of labor in toxin production on two-strain 
      bacterial competition in Escherichia coli.
PG  - e2001457
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001457 [doi]
AB  - In phenotypically heterogeneous microbial populations, the decision to adopt one 
      or another phenotype is often stochastically regulated. However, how this
      stochasticity affects interactions between competing microbes in mixed
      communities is difficult to assess. One example of such an interaction system is 
      the competition of an Escherichia coli strain C, which performs division of labor
      between reproducers and self-sacrificing toxin producers, with a toxin-sensitive 
      strain S. The decision between reproduction or toxin production within a single C
      cell is inherently stochastic. Here, combining experimental and theoretical
      approaches, we demonstrate that this stochasticity in the initial phase of colony
      formation is the crucial determinant for the competition outcome. In the initial 
      phase (t < 12h), stochasticity influences the formation of viable C clusters at
      the colony edge. In the subsequent phase, the effective fitness differences (set 
      primarily by the degree of division of labor in the C strain population) dictate 
      the deterministic population dynamics and consequently competition outcome. In
      particular, we observe that competitive success of the C strain is only found if 
      (i) a C edge cluster has formed at the end of the initial competition phase and
      (ii) the beneficial and detrimental effects of toxin production are balanced,
      which is the case at intermediate toxin producer fractions. Our findings
      highlight the importance of stochastic processes during the initial phase of
      colony formation, which might be highly relevant for other microbial community
      interactions in which the random choice between phenotypes can have long-lasting 
      consequences for community fate.

TI  - The mismatch repair and meiotic recombination endonuclease Mlh1-Mlh3 is activated
      by polymer formation and can cleave DNA substrates in trans.
PG  - e2001164
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001164 [doi]
AB  - Crossing over between homologs is initiated in meiotic prophase by the formation 
      of DNA double-strand breaks that occur throughout the genome. In the major
      interference-responsive crossover pathway in baker's yeast, these breaks are
      resected to form 3' single-strand tails that participate in a homology search,
      ultimately forming double Holliday junctions (dHJs) that primarily include both
      homologs. These dHJs are resolved by endonuclease activity to form exclusively
      crossovers, which are critical for proper homolog segregation in Meiosis I.
      Recent genetic, biochemical, and molecular studies in yeast are consistent with
      the hypothesis of Mlh1-Mlh3 DNA mismatch repair complex acting as the major
      endonuclease activity that resolves dHJs into crossovers. However, the mechanism 
      by which the Mlh1-Mlh3 endonuclease is activated is unknown. Here, we provide
      evidence that Mlh1-Mlh3 does not behave like a structure-specific endonuclease
      but forms polymers required to generate nicks in DNA. This conclusion is
      supported by DNA binding studies performed with different-sized substrates that
      contain or lack polymerization barriers and endonuclease assays performed with
      varying ratios of endonuclease-deficient and endonuclease-proficient Mlh1-Mlh3.
      In addition, Mlh1-Mlh3 can generate religatable double-strand breaks and form an 
      active nucleoprotein complex that can nick DNA substrates in trans. Together
      these observations argue that Mlh1-Mlh3 may not act like a canonical, RuvC-like
      Holliday junction resolvase and support a novel model in which Mlh1-Mlh3 is
      loaded onto DNA to form an activated polymer that cleaves DNA.

AB  - The "gamification" of science has gained a lot of traction in recent years, and
      games that convey scientific concepts or themes are increasingly popular. While a
      number of existing games touch on microbiology, very few consider the beneficial 
      (as opposed to the detrimental) aspects of microbes. We designed a board game
      called "Gut Check: The Microbiome Game" to fill this gap. The game is meant to be
      both educational as well as challenging and fun. Here we discuss the development 
      of the game, some of the logistics of game development in this context, and offer
      suggestions for others thinking of similar projects.

PG  - e2001846
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001846 [doi]
AB  - The issue of nonreplicable evidence has attracted considerable attention across
      biomedical and other sciences. This concern is accompanied by an increasing
      interest in reforming research incentives and practices. How to optimally perform
      these reforms is a scientific problem in itself, and economics has several
      scientific methods that can help evaluate research reforms. Here, we review these
      methods and show their potential. Prominent among them are mathematical modeling 
      and laboratory experiments that constitute affordable ways to approximate the
      effects of policies with wide-ranging implications.

TI  - Commensal bacteria and essential amino acids control food choice behavior and
      reproduction.
PG  - e2000862
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000862 [doi]
AB  - Choosing the right nutrients to consume is essential to health and wellbeing
      across species. However, the factors that influence these decisions are poorly
      understood. This is particularly true for dietary proteins, which are important
      determinants of lifespan and reproduction. We show that in Drosophila
      melanogaster, essential amino acids (eAAs) and the concerted action of the
      commensal bacteria Acetobacter pomorum and Lactobacilli are critical modulators
      of food choice. Using a chemically defined diet, we show that the absence of any 
      single eAA from the diet is sufficient to elicit specific appetites for amino
      acid (AA)-rich food. Furthermore, commensal bacteria buffer the animal from the
      lack of dietary eAAs: both increased yeast appetite and decreased reproduction
      induced by eAA deprivation are rescued by the presence of commensals.
      Surprisingly, these effects do not seem to be due to changes in AA titers,
      suggesting that gut bacteria act through a different mechanism to change behavior
      and reproduction. Thus, eAAs and commensal bacteria are potent modulators of
      feeding decisions and reproductive output. This demonstrates how the interaction 
      of specific nutrients with the microbiome can shape behavioral decisions and life
      history traits.

TI  - Sequence learning modulates neural responses and oscillatory coupling in human
      and monkey auditory cortex.
PG  - e2000219
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000219 [doi]
AB  - Learning complex ordering relationships between sensory events in a sequence is
      fundamental for animal perception and human communication. While it is known that
      rhythmic sensory events can entrain brain oscillations at different frequencies, 
      how learning and prior experience with sequencing relationships affect
      neocortical oscillations and neuronal responses is poorly understood. We used an 
      implicit sequence learning paradigm (an "artificial grammar") in which humans and
      monkeys were exposed to sequences of nonsense words with regularities in the
      ordering relationships between the words. We then recorded neural responses
      directly from the auditory cortex in both species in response to novel legal
      sequences or ones violating specific ordering relationships. Neural oscillations 
      in both monkeys and humans in response to the nonsense word sequences show
      strikingly similar hierarchically nested low-frequency phase and high-gamma
      amplitude coupling, establishing this form of oscillatory coupling-previously
      associated with speech processing in the human auditory cortex-as an
      evolutionarily conserved biological process. Moreover, learned ordering
      relationships modulate the observed form of neural oscillatory coupling in both
      species, with temporally distinct neural oscillatory effects that appear to
      coordinate neuronal responses in the monkeys. This study identifies the conserved
      auditory cortical neural signatures involved in monitoring learned sequencing
      operations, evident as modulations of transient coupling and neuronal responses
      to temporally structured sensory input.

AB  - The School Malaise Trap Program (SMTP) provides a technologically sophisticated
      and scientifically relevant educational experience that exposes students to the
      diversity of life, enhancing their understanding of biodiversity while promoting 
      environmental stewardship. Since 2013, the SMTP has allowed 15,000 students at
      350 primary and secondary schools to explore insect diversity in Canadian
      schoolyards. Students at each school collected hundreds of insects for an
      analysis of DNA sequence variation that enabled their rapid identification to a
      species. Through this hands-on approach, they participated in a learning exercise
      that conveys a real sense of scientific discovery. As well, the students
      contributed valuable data to the largest biodiversity genomics initiative ever
      undertaken: the International Barcode of Life project. To date, the SMTP has
      sequenced over 80,000 insect specimens, which includes representatives of 7,990
      different species, nearly a tenth of the Canadian fauna. Both surprisingly and
      importantly, the collections generated the first DNA barcode records for 1,288
      Canadian species.

      (cAMP). However, how exactly do transient, short-range chemical gradients lead to
      coherent collective movement at a macroscopic scale? Here, we developed a
      multiscale model verified by quantitative microscopy to describe behaviors
      ranging widely from chemotaxis and excitability of individual cells to
      aggregation of thousands of cells. To better understand the mechanism of
      long-range cell-cell communication and hence aggregation, we analyzed cell-cell
      correlations, showing evidence of self-organization at the onset of aggregation
      (as opposed to following a leader cell). Surprisingly, cell collectives, despite 
      their finite size, show features of criticality known from phase transitions in
      physical systems. By comparing wild-type and mutant cells with impaired
      aggregation, we found the longest cell-cell communication distance in wild-type
      cells, suggesting that criticality provides an adaptive advantage and optimally
      sized aggregates for the dispersal of spores.

      major partitions of the vertebrate brain.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001573 [doi]
AB  - All vertebrate brains develop following a common Bauplan defined by
      anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) subdivisions, characterized by largely
      conserved differential expression of gene markers. However, it is still unclear
      how this Bauplan originated during evolution. We studied the relative expression 
      of 48 genes with key roles in vertebrate neural patterning in a representative
      amphioxus embryonic stage. Unlike nonchordates, amphioxus develops its central
      nervous system (CNS) from a neural plate that is homologous to that of
      vertebrates, allowing direct topological comparisons. The resulting
      genoarchitectonic model revealed that the amphioxus incipient neural tube is
      unexpectedly complex, consisting of several AP and DV molecular partitions.
      Strikingly, comparison with vertebrates indicates that the vertebrate thalamus,
      pretectum, and midbrain domains jointly correspond to a single amphioxus region, 
      which we termed Di-Mesencephalic primordium (DiMes). This suggests that these
      domains have a common developmental and evolutionary origin, as supported by
      functional experiments manipulating secondary organizers in zebrafish and mice.

TI  - Multidrug-resistant bacteria compensate for the epistasis between resistances.
PG  - e2001741
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001741 [doi]
AB  - Mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics are typically costly in the
      absence of the drug, but bacteria can reduce this cost by acquiring compensatory 
      mutations. Thus, the rate of acquisition of compensatory mutations and their
      effects are key for the maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistances. 
      While compensation for single resistances has been extensively studied,
      compensatory evolution of multiresistant bacteria remains unexplored.
      Importantly, since resistance mutations often interact epistatically,
      compensation of multiresistant bacteria may significantly differ from that of
      single-resistant strains. We used experimental evolution, next-generation
      sequencing, in silico simulations, and genome editing to compare the compensatory
      process of a streptomycin and rifampicin double-resistant Escherichia coli with
      those of single-resistant clones. We demonstrate that low-fitness
      double-resistant bacteria compensate faster than single-resistant strains due to 
      the acquisition of compensatory mutations with larger effects. Strikingly, we
      identified mutations that only compensate for double resistance, being neutral or
      deleterious in sensitive or single-resistant backgrounds. Moreover, we show that 
      their beneficial effects strongly decrease or disappear in conditions where the
      epistatic interaction between resistance alleles is absent, demonstrating that
      these mutations compensate for the epistasis. In summary, our data indicate that 
      epistatic interactions between antibiotic resistances, leading to large fitness
      costs, possibly open alternative paths for rapid compensatory evolution, thereby 
      potentially stabilizing costly multiple resistances in bacterial populations.

TI  - A Ca2+ channel differentially regulates Clathrin-mediated and activity-dependent 
      bulk endocytosis.
PG  - e2000931
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000931 [doi]
AB  - Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis
      (ADBE) are two predominant forms of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis, elicited
      by moderate and strong stimuli, respectively. They are tightly coupled with
      exocytosis for sustained neurotransmission. However, the underlying mechanisms
      are ill defined. We previously reported that the Flower (Fwe) Ca2+ channel
      present in SVs is incorporated into the periactive zone upon SV fusion, where it 
      triggers CME, thus coupling exocytosis to CME. Here, we show that Fwe also
      promotes ADBE. Intriguingly, the effects of Fwe on CME and ADBE depend on the
      strength of the stimulus. Upon mild stimulation, Fwe controls CME independently
      of Ca2+ channeling. However, upon strong stimulation, Fwe triggers a Ca2+ influx 
      that initiates ADBE. Moreover, knockout of rodent fwe in cultured rat hippocampal
      neurons impairs but does not completely abolish CME, similar to the loss of
      Drosophila fwe at the neuromuscular junction, suggesting that Fwe plays a
      regulatory role in regulating CME across species. In addition, the function of
      Fwe in ADBE is conserved at mammalian central synapses. Hence, Fwe exerts
      different effects in response to different stimulus strengths to control two
      major modes of endocytosis.

TI  - Transcriptional regulatory logic of the diurnal cycle in the mouse liver.
PG  - e2001069
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001069 [doi]
AB  - Many organisms exhibit temporal rhythms in gene expression that propel diurnal
      cycles in physiology. In the liver of mammals, these rhythms are controlled by
      transcription-translation feedback loops of the core circadian clock and by
      feeding-fasting cycles. To better understand the regulatory interplay between the
      circadian clock and feeding rhythms, we mapped DNase I hypersensitive sites
      (DHSs) in the mouse liver during a diurnal cycle. The intensity of DNase I
      cleavages cycled at a substantial fraction of all DHSs, suggesting that DHSs
      harbor regulatory elements that control rhythmic transcription. Using chromatin
      immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that
      hypersensitivity cycled in phase with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) loading and
      H3K27ac histone marks. We then combined the DHSs with temporal Pol II profiles in
      wild-type (WT) and Bmal1-/- livers to computationally identify transcription
      factors through which the core clock and feeding-fasting cycles control diurnal
      rhythms in transcription. While a similar number of mRNAs accumulated
      rhythmically in Bmal1-/- compared to WT livers, the amplitudes in Bmal1-/- were
      generally lower. The residual rhythms in Bmal1-/- reflected transcriptional
      regulators mediating feeding-fasting responses as well as responses to rhythmic
      systemic signals. Finally, the analysis of DNase I cuts at nucleotide resolution 
      showed dynamically changing footprints consistent with dynamic binding of
      CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes. Structural modeling suggested that these footprints are
      driven by a transient heterotetramer binding configuration at peak activity.
      Together, our temporal DNase I mappings allowed us to decipher the global
      regulation of diurnal transcription rhythms in the mouse liver.

AB  - Fear is an instinctual response that's adaptive and critical for survival when it
      is short-lived but can lead to anxiety disorders when chronic. Studying how the
      brain controls our fears helps us understand the mechanisms required to recover
      from traumatic experiences and what goes wrong when we don't. Research in rodents
      has identified neural circuits and molecular mechanisms regulating fear
      expression. Rodent work has been amenable to translation to humans and has led to
      improvements in clinical therapies for anxiety disorders. The societal benefit of
      this type of research is magnified when performed in minority-serving
      institutions, offering high-caliber training opportunities to increase ethnic
      diversity in science.

PG  - e2001438
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001438 [doi]
AB  - Cell lines are used in life science research worldwide as biological surrogates. 
      All cell lines are subject to major limitations when used as research tools,
      including (i) cross-contamination with other cells cultured in the same
      laboratory environment and (ii) evolution in vitro that renders a given cell line
      inappropriate as a surrogate for a specific biological hypothesis. There is ample
      evidence that cross-contamination or phenotypic drift of cells in culture can
      generate irreproducible or misleading data. A small number of scientific
      journals-the International Journal of Cancer being at the forefront-and funding
      agencies have recently moved forward to ask for obligatory cell line
      authentication data. The history of implementing such rules by the International 
      Journal of Cancer exemplifies the difficulties encountered when installing
      mandatory quality measures in life sciences.

AB  - Nearly all cell types in mammals contain cilia, small rod-like or more elaborate 
      structures that extend from the cell surface. Cilia house signaling proteins that
      allow the cell to sample their environment and respond appropriately. Mutations
      in ciliary genes alter the functions of a broad range of cell and tissue types,
      including sensory and central neurons, and underlie a collection of heterogeneous
      human disorders called ciliopathies. Here, I highlight the critical contributions
      of nearly three centuries of research in diverse organisms to our current
      knowledge of cilia function in sensory signaling and human disease.

      by anesthesia.
PG  - e2001494
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001494 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion functional MRI (DfMRI) reveals neuronal activation even when
      neurovascular coupling is abolished, contrary to blood oxygenation
      level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we show that the water
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from DfMRI increased in specific rat
      brain regions under anesthetic conditions, reflecting the decreased neuronal
      activity observed with local field potentials (LFPs), especially in regions
      involved in wakefulness. In contrast, BOLD signals showed nonspecific changes,
      reflecting systemic effects of the anesthesia on overall brain hemodynamics
      status. Electrical stimulation of the central medial thalamus nucleus (CM)
      exhibiting this anesthesia-induced ADC increase led the animals to transiently
      wake up. Infusion in the CM of furosemide, a specific neuronal swelling blocker, 
      led the ADC to increase further locally, although LFP activity remained
      unchanged, and increased the current threshold awakening the animals under CM
      electrical stimulation. Oppositely, induction of cell swelling in the CM through 
      infusion of a hypotonic solution (-80 milliosmole [mOsm] artificial cerebrospinal
      fluid [aCSF]) led to a local ADC decrease and a lower current threshold to wake
      up the animals. Strikingly, the local ADC changes produced by blocking or
      enhancing cell swelling in the CM were also mirrored remotely in areas
      functionally connected to the CM, such as the cingulate and somatosensory cortex.
      Together, those results strongly suggest that neuronal swelling is a significant 
      mechanism underlying DfMRI.

TI  - A latitudinal phylogeographic diversity gradient in birds.
PG  - e2001073
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001073 [doi]
AB  - High tropical species diversity is often attributed to evolutionary dynamics over
      long timescales. It is possible, however, that latitudinal variation in
      diversification begins when divergence occurs within species. Phylogeographic
      data capture this initial stage of diversification in which populations become
      geographically isolated and begin to differentiate genetically. There is limited 
      understanding of the broader implications of intraspecific diversification
      because comparative analyses have focused on species inhabiting and evolving in
      restricted regions and environments. Here, we scale comparative phylogeography up
      to the hemisphere level and examine whether the processes driving latitudinal
      differences in species diversity are also evident within species. We collected
      genetic data for 210 New World bird species distributed across a broad
      latitudinal gradient and estimated a suite of metrics characterizing
      phylogeographic history. We found that lower latitude species had, on average,
      greater phylogeographic diversity than higher latitude species and that
      intraspecific diversity showed evidence of greater persistence in the tropics.
      Factors associated with species ecologies, life histories, and habitats explained
      little of the variation in phylogeographic structure across the latitudinal
      gradient. Our results suggest that the latitudinal gradient in species richness
      originates, at least partly, from population-level processes within species and
      are consistent with hypotheses implicating age and environmental stability in the
      formation of diversity gradients. Comparative phylogeographic analyses scaled up 
      to large geographic regions and hundreds of species can show connections between 
      population-level processes and broad-scale species-richness patterns.

TI  - A novel mechanism of cone photoreceptor adaptation.
PG  - e2001210
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001210 [doi]
AB  - An animal's ability to survive depends on its sensory systems being able to adapt
      to a wide range of environmental conditions, by maximizing the information
      extracted and reducing the noise transmitted. The visual system does this by
      adapting to luminance and contrast. While luminance adaptation can begin at the
      retinal photoreceptors, contrast adaptation has been shown to start at later
      stages in the retina. Photoreceptors adapt to changes in luminance over multiple 
      time scales ranging from tens of milliseconds to minutes, with the adaptive
      changes arising from processes within the phototransduction cascade. Here we show
      a new form of adaptation in cones that is independent of the phototransduction
      process. Rather, it is mediated by voltage-gated ion channels in the cone
      membrane and acts by changing the frequency response of cones such that their
      responses speed up as the membrane potential modulation depth increases and slow 
      down as the membrane potential modulation depth decreases. This mechanism is
      effectively activated by high-contrast stimuli dominated by low frequencies such 
      as natural stimuli. However, the more generally used Gaussian white noise stimuli
      were not effective since they did not modulate the cone membrane potential to the
      same extent. This new adaptive process had a time constant of less than a second.
      A critical component of the underlying mechanism is the
      hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, as pharmacologically blocking it
      prevented the long- and mid- wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptors (L- and
      M-cones) from adapting. Consistent with this, short- wavelength sensitive cone
      photoreceptors (S-cones) did not show the adaptive response, and we found they
      also lacked a prominent Ih. The adaptive filtering mechanism identified here
      improves the information flow by removing higher-frequency noise during lower
      signal-to-noise ratio conditions, as occurs when contrast levels are low.
      Although this new adaptive mechanism can be driven by contrast, it is not a
      contrast adaptation mechanism in its strictest sense, as will be argued in the
      Discussion.

TI  - Bordetella bronchiseptica exploits the complex life cycle of Dictyostelium
      discoideum as an amplifying transmission vector.
PG  - e2000420
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000420 [doi]
AB  - Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Bordetella species have a significant
      life stage outside of the mammalian respiratory tract that has yet to be defined.
      The Bordetella virulence gene (BvgAS) two-component system, a paradigm for a
      global virulence regulon, controls the expression of many "virulence factors"
      expressed in the Bvg positive (Bvg+) phase that are necessary for successful
      respiratory tract infection. A similarly large set of highly conserved genes are 
      expressed under Bvg negative (Bvg-) phase growth conditions; however, these
      appear to be primarily expressed outside of the host and are thus hypothesized to
      be important in an undefined extrahost reservoir. Here, we show that Bvg- phase
      genes are involved in the ability of Bordetella bronchiseptica to grow and
      disseminate via the complex life cycle of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.
      Unlike bacteria that serve as an amoeba food source, B. bronchiseptica evades
      amoeba predation, survives within the amoeba for extended periods of time,
      incorporates itself into the amoeba sori, and disseminates along with the amoeba.
      Remarkably, B. bronchiseptica continues to be transferred with the amoeba for
      months, through multiple life cycles of amoebae grown on the lawns of other
      bacteria, thus demonstrating a stable relationship that allows B. bronchiseptica 
      to expand and disperse geographically via the D. discoideum life cycle.
      Furthermore, B. bronchiseptica within the sori can efficiently infect mice,
      indicating that amoebae may represent an environmental vector within which
      pathogenic bordetellae expand and disseminate to encounter new mammalian hosts.
      These data identify amoebae as potential environmental reservoirs as well as
      amplifying and disseminating vectors for B. bronchiseptica and reveal an
      important role for the Bvg- phase in these interactions.

TI  - Convergent evolution of SWS2 opsin facilitates adaptive radiation of threespine
      stickleback into different light environments.
PG  - e2001627
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001627 [doi]
AB  - Repeated adaptation to a new environment often leads to convergent phenotypic
      changes whose underlying genetic mechanisms are rarely known. Here, we study
      adaptation of color vision in threespine stickleback during the repeated
      postglacial colonization of clearwater and blackwater lakes in the Haida Gwaii
      archipelago. We use whole genomes from 16 clearwater and 12 blackwater
      populations, and a selection experiment, in which stickleback were transplanted
      from a blackwater lake into an uninhabited clearwater pond and resampled after 19
      y to test for selection on cone opsin genes. Patterns of haplotype homozygosity, 
      genetic diversity, site frequency spectra, and allele-frequency change support a 
      selective sweep centered on the adjacent blue- and red-light sensitive opsins
      SWS2 and LWS. The haplotype under selection carries seven amino acid changes in
      SWS2, including two changes known to cause a red-shift in light absorption, and
      is favored in blackwater lakes but disfavored in the clearwater habitat of the
      transplant population. Remarkably, the same red-shifting amino acid changes
      occurred after the duplication of SWS2 198 million years ago, in the ancestor of 
      most spiny-rayed fish. Two distantly related fish species, bluefin killifish and 
      black bream, express these old paralogs divergently in black- and clearwater
      habitats, while sticklebacks lost one paralog. Our study thus shows that
      convergent adaptation to the same environment can involve the same genetic
      changes on very different evolutionary time scales by reevolving lost mutations
      and reusing them repeatedly from standing genetic variation.

TI  - eNOS S-nitrosylates beta-actin on Cys374 and regulates PKC-theta at the immune
      synapse by impairing actin binding to profilin-1.
PG  - e2000653
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000653 [doi]
AB  - The actin cytoskeleton coordinates the organization of signaling microclusters at
      the immune synapse (IS); however, the mechanisms involved remain poorly
      understood. We show here that nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial nitric
      oxide synthase (eNOS) controls the coalescence of protein kinase C-theta
      (PKC-theta) at the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS. 
      eNOS translocated with the Golgi to the IS and partially colocalized with F-actin
      around the c-SMAC. This resulted in reduced actin polymerization and centripetal 
      retrograde flow of beta-actin and PKC-theta from the lamellipodium-like distal
      (d)-SMAC, promoting PKC-theta activation. Furthermore, eNOS-derived NO
      S-nitrosylated beta-actin on Cys374 and impaired actin binding to profilin-1
      (PFN1), as confirmed with the transnitrosylating agent S-nitroso-L-cysteine
      (Cys-NO). The importance of NO and the formation of PFN1-actin complexes on the
      regulation of PKC-theta was corroborated by overexpression of PFN1- and
      actin-binding defective mutants of beta-actin (C374S) and PFN1 (H119E),
      respectively, which reduced the coalescence of PKC-theta at the c-SMAC. These
      findings unveil a novel NO-dependent mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton
      controls the organization and activation of signaling microclusters at the IS.

TI  - Ongoing neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus mediates behavioral responses to 
      ambiguous threat cues.
PG  - e2001154
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001154 [doi]
AB  - Fear learning is highly adaptive if utilized in appropriate situations but can
      lead to generalized anxiety if applied too widely. A role of predictive cues in
      inhibiting fear generalization has been suggested by stress and fear learning
      studies, but the effects of partially predictive cues (ambiguous cues) and the
      neuronal populations responsible for linking the predictive ability of cues and
      generalization of fear responses are unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of
      adult neurogenesis in the mouse dentate gyrus decreases hippocampal network
      activation and reduces defensive behavior to ambiguous threat cues but has
      neither of these effects if the same negative experience is reliably predicted.
      Additionally, we find that this ambiguity related to negative events determines
      their effect on fear generalization, that is, how the events affect future
      behavior under novel conditions. Both new neurons and glucocorticoid hormones are
      required for the enhancement of fear generalization following an unpredictably
      cued threat. Thus, adult neurogenesis plays a central role in the adaptive
      changes resulting from experience involving unpredictable or ambiguous threat
      cues, optimizing behavior in novel and uncertain situations.

AB  - The thesis presented here is that biomedical research is based on the trusted
      exchange of services. That exchange would be conducted more efficiently if the
      trusted software platforms to exchange those services, if they exist, were more
      integrated. While simpler and narrower in scope than the services governing
      biomedical research, comparison to existing internet-based platforms, like
      Airbnb, can be informative. We illustrate how the analogy to internet-based
      platforms works and does not work and introduce The Commons, under active
      development at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and elsewhere, as an
      example of the move towards platforms for research.

TI  - Accurate predictions of population-level changes in sequence and structural
      properties of HIV-1 Env using a volatility-controlled diffusion model.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001549 [doi]
AB  - The envelope glycoproteins (Envs) of HIV-1 continuously evolve in the host by
      random mutations and recombination events. The resulting diversity of Env
      variants circulating in the population and their continuing diversification
      process limit the efficacy of AIDS vaccines. We examined the historic changes in 
      Env sequence and structural features (measured by integrity of epitopes on the
      Env trimer) in a geographically defined population in the United States. As
      expected, many Env features were relatively conserved during the 1980s. From this
      state, some features diversified whereas others remained conserved across the
      years. We sought to identify "clues" to predict the observed historic
      diversification patterns. Comparison of viruses that cocirculate in patients at
      any given time revealed that each feature of Env (sequence or structural) exists 
      at a defined level of variance. The in-host variance of each feature is highly
      conserved among individuals but can vary between different HIV-1 clades. We
      designate this property "volatility" and apply it to model evolution of features 
      as a linear diffusion process that progresses with increasing genetic distance.
      Volatilities of different features are highly correlated with their divergence in
      longitudinally monitored patients. Volatilities of features also correlate highly
      with their population-level diversification. Using volatility indices measured
      from a small number of patient samples, we accurately predict the population
      diversity that developed for each feature over the course of 30 years. Amino acid
      variants that evolved at key antigenic sites are also predicted well. Therefore, 
      small "fluctuations" in feature values measured in isolated patient samples
      accurately describe their potential for population-level diversification. These
      tools will likely contribute to the design of population-targeted AIDS vaccines
      by effectively capturing the diversity of currently circulating strains and
      addressing properties of variants expected to appear in the future.

TI  - Fasting regulates EGR1 and protects from glucose- and dexamethasone-dependent
      sensitization to chemotherapy.
PG  - e2001951
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001951 [doi]
AB  - Fasting reduces glucose levels and protects mice against chemotoxicity, yet drugs
      that promote hyperglycemia are widely used in cancer treatment. Here, we show
      that dexamethasone (Dexa) and rapamycin (Rapa), commonly administered to cancer
      patients, elevate glucose and sensitize cardiomyocytes and mice to the cancer
      drug doxorubicin (DXR). Such toxicity can be reversed by reducing circulating
      glucose levels by fasting or insulin. Furthermore, glucose injections alone
      reversed the fasting-dependent protection against DXR in mice, indicating that
      elevated glucose mediates, at least in part, the sensitizing effects of rapamycin
      and dexamethasone. In yeast, glucose activates protein kinase A (PKA) to
      accelerate aging by inhibiting transcription factors Msn2/4. Here, we show that
      fasting or glucose restriction (GR) regulate PKA and AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK) to protect against DXR in part by activating the mammalian Msn2/4 ortholog
      early growth response protein 1 (EGR1). Increased expression of the
      EGR1-regulated cardioprotective peptides atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in heart tissue may also contribute to DXR
      resistance. Our findings suggest the existence of a glucose-PKA pathway that
      inactivates conserved zinc finger stress-resistance transcription factors to
      sensitize cells to toxins conserved from yeast to mammals. Our findings also
      describe a toxic role for drugs widely used in cancer treatment that promote
      hyperglycemia and identify dietary interventions that reverse these effects.

TI  - A fat-derived metabolite regulates a peptidergic feeding circuit in Drosophila.
PG  - e2000532
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000532 [doi]
AB  - Here, we show that the enzymatic cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) inhibits
      feeding in Drosophila. BH4 biosynthesis requires the sequential action of the
      conserved enzymes Punch, Purple, and Sepiapterin Reductase (Sptr). Although we
      observe increased feeding upon loss of Punch and Purple in the adult fat body,
      loss of Sptr must occur in the brain. We found Sptr expression is required in
      four adult neurons that express neuropeptide F (NPF), the fly homologue of the
      vertebrate appetite regulator neuropeptide Y (NPY). As expected, feeding flies
      BH4 rescues the loss of Punch and Purple in the fat body and the loss of Sptr in 
      NPF neurons. Mechanistically, we found BH4 deficiency reduces NPF staining,
      likely by promoting its release, while excess BH4 increases NPF accumulation
      without altering its expression. We thus show that, because of its physically
      distributed biosynthesis, BH4 acts as a fat-derived signal that induces satiety
      by inhibiting the activity of the NPF neurons.

AB  - The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, adopted under the auspices of the Convention
      on Biological Diversity, provides the basis for taking effective action to curb
      biodiversity loss across the planet by 2020-an urgent imperative. Yet, Antarctica
      and the Southern Ocean, which encompass 10% of the planet's surface, are excluded
      from assessments of progress against the Strategic Plan. The situation is a lost 
      opportunity for biodiversity conservation globally. We provide such an
      assessment. Our evidence suggests, surprisingly, that for a region so remote and 
      apparently pristine as the Antarctic, the biodiversity outlook is similar to that
      for the rest of the planet. Promisingly, however, much scope for remedial action 
      exists.

AB  - Strategies for promoting neural regeneration are hindered by the difficulty of
      manipulating desired neural fates in the brain without complex genetic methods.
      The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest germinal zone of the forebrain and
      is responsible for the lifelong generation of interneuron subtypes and
      oligodendrocytes. Here, we have performed a bioinformatics analysis of the
      transcriptome of dorsal and lateral SVZ in early postnatal mice, including neural
      stem cells (NSCs) and their immediate progenies, which generate distinct neural
      lineages. We identified multiple signaling pathways that trigger distinct
      downstream transcriptional networks to regulate the diversity of neural cells
      originating from the SVZ. Next, we used a novel in silico genomic analysis,
      searchable platform-independent expression database/connectivity map
      (SPIED/CMAP), to generate a catalogue of small molecules that can be used to
      manipulate SVZ microdomain-specific lineages. Finally, we demonstrate that
      compounds identified in this analysis promote the generation of specific cell
      lineages from NSCs in vivo, during postnatal life and adulthood, as well as in
      regenerative contexts. This study unravels new strategies for using small
      bioactive molecules to direct germinal activity in the SVZ, which has therapeutic
      potential in neurodegenerative diseases.

PG  - e2001793
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001793 [doi]
AB  - Feeding a growing world population amidst climate change requires optimizing the 
      reliability, resource use, and environmental impacts of food production. One way 
      to assist in achieving these goals is to integrate beneficial plant
      microbiomes-i.e., those enhancing plant growth, nutrient use efficiency, abiotic 
      stress tolerance, and disease resistance-into agricultural production. This
      integration will require a large-scale effort among academic researchers,
      industry researchers, and farmers to understand and manage plant-microbiome
      interactions in the context of modern agricultural systems. Here, we identify
      priorities for research in this area: (1) develop model host-microbiome systems
      for crop plants and non-crop plants with associated microbial culture collections
      and reference genomes, (2) define core microbiomes and metagenomes in these model
      systems, (3) elucidate the rules of synthetic, functionally programmable
      microbiome assembly, (4) determine functional mechanisms of plant-microbiome
      interactions, and (5) characterize and refine plant
      genotype-by-environment-by-microbiome-by-management interactions. Meeting these
      goals should accelerate our ability to design and implement effective
      agricultural microbiome manipulations and management strategies, which, in turn, 
      will pay dividends for both the consumers and producers of the world food supply.

      tigris) as a case study.
PG  - e2001001
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001001 [doi]
AB  - With around 3,200 tigers (Panthera tigris) left in the wild, the governments of
      13 tiger range countries recently declared that there is a need for innovation to
      aid tiger research and conservation. In response to this call, we created the
      "Think for Tigers" study to explore whether crowdsourcing has the potential to
      innovate the way researchers and practitioners monitor tigers in the wild. The
      study demonstrated that the benefits of crowdsourcing are not restricted only to 
      harnessing the time, labor, and funds from the public but can also be used as a
      tool to harness creative thinking that can contribute to development of new
      research tools and approaches. Based on our experience, we make practical
      recommendations for designing a crowdsourcing initiative as a tool for generating
      ideas.

PG  - e2001413
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001413 [doi]
AB  - Liquid-handling robots have many applications for biotechnology and the life
      sciences, with increasing impact on everyday life. While playful robotics such as
      Lego Mindstorms significantly support education initiatives in mechatronics and
      programming, equivalent connections to the life sciences do not currently exist. 
      To close this gap, we developed Lego-based pipetting robots that reliably handle 
      liquid volumes from 1 ml down to the sub-mul range and that operate on standard
      laboratory plasticware, such as cuvettes and multiwell plates. These robots can
      support a range of science and chemistry experiments for education and even
      research. Using standard, low-cost household consumables, programming pipetting
      routines, and modifying robot designs, we enabled a rich activity space. We
      successfully tested these activities in afterschool settings with elementary,
      middle, and high school students. The simplest robot can be directly built from
      the widely used Lego Education EV3 core set alone, and this publication includes 
      building and experiment instructions to set the stage for dissemination and
      further development in education and research.

PG  - e2001882
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001882 [doi]
AB  - Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a key role in
      regulating the levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
      Here, we demonstrate that the compound PF-06446846 inhibits translation of PCSK9 
      by inducing the ribosome to stall around codon 34, mediated by the sequence of
      the nascent chain within the exit tunnel. We further show that PF-06446846
      reduces plasma PCSK9 and total cholesterol levels in rats following oral dosing. 
      Using ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that PF-06446846 is highly selective for
      the inhibition of PCSK9 translation. The mechanism of action employed by
      PF-06446846 reveals a previously unexpected tunability of the human ribosome that
      allows small molecules to specifically block translation of individual
      transcripts.

AB  - Science plays an important role in most aspects of society, and scientists face
      ethical decisions as a routine part of their work, but science education
      frequently omits or segregates content related to ethics and broader impacts of
      science. Undergraduate research experiences have the potential to bridge
      traditional divides in education and provide a holistic view of science. In
      practice, these experiences can be inconsistent and may not provide the optimal
      learning environment. We developed a course that combines seminar and independent
      research elements to support student learning during undergraduate research,
      makes ethical and societal impacts of science clear by relating them to the
      students' own research projects, and develops students' ethical decision-making
      skills. Here, we describe the course and provide resources for developing a
      similar course.

TI  - Walking and talking the tree of life: Why and how to teach about biodiversity.
PG  - e2001630
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001630 [doi]
AB  - Taxonomic details of diversity are an essential scaffolding for biology
      education, yet outdated methods for teaching the tree of life (TOL), as implied
      by textbook content and usage, are still commonly employed. Here, we show that
      the traditional approach only vaguely represents evolutionary relationships,
      fails to denote major events in the history of life, and relies heavily on
      memorizing near-meaningless taxonomic ranks. Conversely, a clade-based
      strategy-focused on common ancestry, monophyletic groups, and derived functional 
      traits-is explicitly based on Darwin's "descent with modification," provides
      students with a rational system for organizing the details of biodiversity, and
      readily lends itself to active learning techniques. We advocate for a
      phylogenetic classification that mirrors the TOL, a pedagogical format of
      increasingly complex but always hierarchical presentations, and the adoption of
      active learning technologies and tactics.

      pass through his laboratory. Each contributed to that understanding. What follows
      is a small fraction of their story, with an emphasis on basic research outcomes
      of importance to society at large.

TI  - Genome editing: Bioethics shows the way.
PG  - e2001934
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001934 [doi]
AB  - When some scientists hear the word "bioethics," they break out in intellectual
      hives. They shouldn't. Good bioethics is about enabling science to move forward. 
      Bioethics pushes scientists to acknowledge that they operate not within a vacuum 
      but within a society in which diverse perspectives and values must be engaged.
      Bioethicists give voice to those divergent perspectives and provide a framework
      to facilitate informed and inclusive discussions that spur progress, rather than 
      stall it. The field is needed to advance cutting-edge biomedical research in
      domains in which the benefits to be had are enormous, such as genome editing, but
      ethical concerns persist.

      honeybees.
PG  - e2001861
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001861 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiomes play crucial roles in animal health, and shifts in the gut
      microbial community structure can have detrimental impacts on hosts. Studies with
      vertebrate models and human subjects suggest that antibiotic treatments greatly
      perturb the native gut community, thereby facilitating proliferation of
      pathogens. In fact, persistent infections following antibiotic treatment are a
      major medical issue. In apiculture, antibiotics are frequently used to prevent
      bacterial infections of larval bees, but the impact of antibiotic-induced
      dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) on bee health and susceptibility to disease has
      not been fully elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effects of antibiotic exposure 
      on the size and composition of honeybee gut communities. We monitored the
      survivorship of bees following antibiotic treatment in order to determine if
      dysbiosis of the gut microbiome impacts honeybee health, and we performed
      experiments to determine whether antibiotic exposure increases susceptibility to 
      infection by opportunistic pathogens. Our results show that antibiotic treatment 
      can have persistent effects on both the size and composition of the honeybee gut 
      microbiome. Antibiotic exposure resulted in decreased survivorship, both in the
      hive and in laboratory experiments in which bees were exposed to opportunistic
      bacterial pathogens. Together, these results suggest that dysbiosis resulting
      from antibiotic exposure affects bee health, in part due to increased
      susceptibility to ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens. Not only do our results
      highlight the importance of the gut microbiome in honeybee health, but they also 
      provide insights into how antibiotic treatment affects microbial communities and 
      host health.

PG  - e2000735
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000735 [doi]
AB  - The ~1.6 Ga Tirohan Dolomite of the Lower Vindhyan in central India contains
      phosphatized stromatolitic microbialites. We report from there uniquely
      well-preserved fossils interpreted as probable crown-group rhodophytes (red
      algae). The filamentous form Rafatazmia chitrakootensis n. gen, n. sp. has
      uniserial rows of large cells and grows through diffusely distributed septation. 
      Each cell has a centrally suspended, conspicuous rhomboidal disk interpreted as a
      pyrenoid. The septa between the cells have central structures that may represent 
      pit connections and pit plugs. Another filamentous form, Denaricion mendax n.
      gen., n. sp., has coin-like cells reminiscent of those in large sulfur-oxidizing 
      bacteria but much more recalcitrant than the liquid-vacuole-filled cells of the
      latter. There are also resemblances with oscillatoriacean cyanobacteria, although
      cell volumes in the latter are much smaller. The wider affinities of Denaricion
      are uncertain. Ramathallus lobatus n. gen., n. sp. is a lobate sessile alga with 
      pseudoparenchymatous thallus, "cell fountains," and apical growth, suggesting
      florideophycean affinity. If these inferences are correct, Rafatazmia and
      Ramathallus represent crown-group multicellular rhodophytes, antedating the
      oldest previously accepted red alga in the fossil record by about 400 million
      years.

      bring the existing methodology of group sequential designs to the attention of
      researchers in the preclinical field and to clearly illustrate its potential
      utility. Group sequential designs can offer higher efficiency than traditional
      methods and are increasingly used in clinical trials. Using simulation of data,
      we demonstrate that group sequential designs have the potential to improve the
      efficiency of experimental studies, even when sample sizes are very small, as is 
      currently prevalent in preclinical experimental biomedicine. When simulating data
      with a large effect size of d = 1 and a sample size of n = 18 per group,
      sequential frequentist analysis consumes in the long run only around 80% of the
      planned number of experimental units. In larger trials (n = 36 per group),
      additional stopping rules for futility lead to the saving of resources of up to
      30% compared to block designs. We argue that these savings should be invested to 
      increase sample sizes and hence power, since the currently underpowered
      experiments in preclinical biomedicine are a major threat to the value and
      predictiveness in this research domain.

AB  - Ribosome biogenesis is a major energy-consuming process in the cell that has to
      be rapidly down-regulated in response to stress or nutrient depletion. The target
      of rapamycin 1 (Tor1) pathway regulates synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at the 
      level of transcription initiation. It remains unclear whether ribosome biogenesis
      is also controlled directly at the posttranscriptional level. We show that Tor1
      and casein kinase 2 (CK2) kinases regulate a rapid switch between a productive
      and a non-productive pre-rRNA processing pathways in yeast. Under stress, the
      pre-rRNA continues to be synthesized; however, it is processed differently, and
      no new ribosomes are produced. Strikingly, the control of the switch does not
      require the Sch9 kinase, indicating that an unrecognized Tor Complex 1 (TORC1)
      signaling branch involving CK2 kinase directly regulates ribosome biogenesis at
      the posttranscriptional level.

      Computational biology brings order into our understanding of life, it makes
      biological concepts rigorous and testable, and it provides a reference map that
      holds together individual insights. The next modern synthesis in biology will be 
      driven by mathematical, statistical, and computational methods being absorbed
      into mainstream biological training, turning biology into a quantitative science.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001192 [doi]
AB  - Student creation of educational materials has the capacity both to enhance
      learning and to decrease costs. Three successive honors-style classes of
      undergraduate students in a cancer genetics class worked with a new software
      system, CuboCube, to create an e-textbook. CuboCube is an open-source learning
      materials creation system designed to facilitate e-textbook development, with an 
      ultimate goal of improving the social learning experience for students. Equipped 
      with crowdsourcing capabilities, CuboCube provides intuitive tools for
      nontechnical and technical authors alike to create content together in a
      structured manner. The process of e-textbook development revealed both strengths 
      and challenges of the approach, which can inform future efforts. Both the
      CuboCube platform and the Cancer Genetics E-textbook are freely available to the 
      community.

      elegans intestine.
PG  - e2000633
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000633 [doi]
AB  - Host-associated bacterial communities vary extensively between individuals, but
      it can be very difficult to determine the sources of this heterogeneity. Here, we
      demonstrate that stochastic bacterial community assembly in the Caenorhabditis
      elegans intestine is sufficient to produce strong interworm heterogeneity in
      community composition. When worms are fed with two neutrally competing,
      fluorescently labeled bacterial strains, we observe stochastically driven
      bimodality in community composition, in which approximately half of the worms are
      dominated by each bacterial strain. A simple model incorporating stochastic
      colonization suggests that heterogeneity between worms is driven by the low rate 
      at which bacteria successfully establish new intestinal colonies. We can increase
      this rate experimentally by feeding worms at high bacterial density; in these
      conditions, the bimodality disappears. These results demonstrate that demographic
      noise is a potentially important driver of diversity in bacterial community
      formation and suggest a role for C. elegans as a model system for ecology of
      host-associated communities.

TI  - The mechanism of sirtuin 2-mediated exacerbation of alpha-synuclein toxicity in
      models of Parkinson disease.
PG  - e2000374
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000374 [doi]
AB  - Sirtuin genes have been associated with aging and are known to affect multiple
      cellular pathways. Sirtuin 2 was previously shown to modulate proteotoxicity
      associated with age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and 
      Parkinson disease (PD). However, the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain
      unclear. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the interplay between sirtuin 
      2 and alpha-synuclein, the major component of the pathognomonic protein
      inclusions in PD and other synucleinopathies. We found that alpha-synuclein is
      acetylated on lysines 6 and 10 and that these residues are deacetylated by
      sirtuin 2. Genetic manipulation of sirtuin 2 levels in vitro and in vivo
      modulates the levels of alpha-synuclein acetylation, its aggregation, and
      autophagy. Strikingly, mutants blocking acetylation exacerbate alpha-synuclein
      toxicity in vivo, in the substantia nigra of rats. Our study identifies
      alpha-synuclein acetylation as a key regulatory mechanism governing
      alpha-synuclein aggregation and toxicity, demonstrating the potential therapeutic
      value of sirtuin 2 inhibition in synucleinopathies.

AB  - We have empirically assessed the distribution of published effect sizes and
      estimated power by analyzing 26,841 statistical records from 3,801 cognitive
      neuroscience and psychology papers published recently. The reported median effect
      size was D = 0.93 (interquartile range: 0.64-1.46) for nominally statistically
      significant results and D = 0.24 (0.11-0.42) for nonsignificant results. Median
      power to detect small, medium, and large effects was 0.12, 0.44, and 0.73,
      reflecting no improvement through the past half-century. This is so because
      sample sizes have remained small. Assuming similar true effect sizes in both
      disciplines, power was lower in cognitive neuroscience than in psychology.
      Journal impact factors negatively correlated with power. Assuming a realistic
      range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, false report probability is
      likely to exceed 50% for the whole literature. In light of our findings, the
      recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic, and worse
      performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.

TI  - A mechanism for the cortical computation of hierarchical linguistic structure.
PG  - e2000663
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000663 [doi]
AB  - Biological systems often detect species-specific signals in the environment. In
      humans, speech and language are species-specific signals of fundamental
      biological importance. To detect the linguistic signal, human brains must form
      hierarchical representations from a sequence of perceptual inputs distributed in 
      time. What mechanism underlies this ability? One hypothesis is that the brain
      repurposed an available neurobiological mechanism when hierarchical linguistic
      representation became an efficient solution to a computational problem posed to
      the organism. Under such an account, a single mechanism must have the capacity to
      perform multiple, functionally related computations, e.g., detect the linguistic 
      signal and perform other cognitive functions, while, ideally, oscillating like
      the human brain. We show that a computational model of analogy, built for an
      entirely different purpose-learning relational reasoning-processes sentences,
      represents their meaning, and, crucially, exhibits oscillatory activation
      patterns resembling cortical signals elicited by the same stimuli. Such
      redundancy in the cortical and machine signals is indicative of formal and
      mechanistic alignment between representational structure building and "cortical" 
      oscillations. By inductive inference, this synergy suggests that the cortical
      signal reflects structure generation, just as the machine signal does. A single
      mechanism-using time to encode information across a layered network-generates the
      kind of (de)compositional representational hierarchy that is crucial for human
      language and offers a mechanistic linking hypothesis between linguistic
      representation and cortical computation.

TI  - Health disparities and clinical trial recruitment: Is there a duty to tweet?
PG  - e2002040
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2002040 [doi]
AB  - While it is well known that the homogeneity of clinical trial participants often 
      threatens the goal of attaining generalizable knowledge, researchers often cite
      issues with recruitment, including a lack of interest from participants,
      shortages of resources, or difficulty accessing particular populations, to
      explain the lack of diversity within sampling. It is proposed that social media
      might provide an opportunity to overcome these obstacles through affordable,
      targeted recruitment advertisements or messages. Recruiters are warned, however, 
      to be cautious using these means, since risks related to privacy and transparency
      can take on a new hue.

TI  - Pancreas lineage allocation and specification are regulated by
      sphingosine-1-phosphate signalling.
PG  - e2000949
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000949 [doi]
AB  - During development, progenitor expansion, lineage allocation, and implementation 
      of differentiation programs need to be tightly coordinated so that different cell
      types are generated in the correct numbers for appropriate tissue size and
      function. Pancreatic dysfunction results in some of the most debilitating and
      fatal diseases, including pancreatic cancer and diabetes. Several transcription
      factors regulating pancreas lineage specification have been identified, and Notch
      signalling has been implicated in lineage allocation, but it remains unclear how 
      these processes are coordinated. Using a combination of genetic approaches,
      organotypic cultures of embryonic pancreata, and genomics, we found that
      sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p), signalling through the G protein coupled receptor 
      (GPCR) S1pr2, plays a key role in pancreas development linking lineage allocation
      and specification. S1pr2 signalling promotes progenitor survival as well as
      acinar and endocrine specification. S1pr2-mediated stabilisation of the
      yes-associated protein (YAP) is essential for endocrine specification, thus
      linking a regulator of progenitor growth with specification. YAP stabilisation
      and endocrine cell specification rely on Galphai subunits, revealing an
      unexpected specificity of selected GPCR intracellular signalling components.
      Finally, we found that S1pr2 signalling posttranscriptionally attenuates Notch
      signalling levels, thus regulating lineage allocation. Both S1pr2-mediated YAP
      stabilisation and Notch attenuation are necessary for the specification of the
      endocrine lineage. These findings identify S1p signalling as a novel key pathway 
      coordinating cell survival, lineage allocation, and specification and linking
      these processes by regulating YAP levels and Notch signalling. Understanding
      lineage allocation and specification in the pancreas will shed light in the
      origins of pancreatic diseases and may suggest novel therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Unique 5'-P recognition and basis for dG:dGTP misincorporation of ASFV DNA
      polymerase X.
PG  - e1002599
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002599 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) can cause highly lethal disease in pigs and is
      becoming a global threat. ASFV DNA Polymerase X (AsfvPolX) is the most
      distinctive DNA polymerase identified to date; it lacks two DNA-binding domains
      (the thumb domain and 8-KD domain) conserved in the homologous proteins. AsfvPolX
      catalyzes the gap-filling reaction during the DNA repair process of the ASFV
      virus genome; it is highly error prone and plays an important role during the
      strategic mutagenesis of the viral genome. The structural basis underlying the
      natural substrate binding and the most frequent dG:dGTP misincorporation of
      AsfvPolX remain poorly understood. Here, we report eight AsfvPolX complex
      structures; our structures demonstrate that AsfvPolX has one unique 5'-phosphate 
      (5'-P) binding pocket, which can favor the productive catalytic complex assembly 
      and enhance the dGTP misincorporation efficiency. In combination with mutagenesis
      and in vitro catalytic assays, our study also reveals the functional roles of the
      platform His115-Arg127 and the hydrophobic residues Val120 and Leu123 in dG:dGTP 
      misincorporation and can provide information for rational drug design to help
      combat ASFV in the future.

AB  - To elucidate how gaze informs the construction of mental space during wayfinding 
      in visual species like primates, we jointly examined navigation behavior, visual 
      exploration, and hippocampal activity as macaque monkeys searched a virtual
      reality maze for a reward. Cells sensitive to place also responded to one or more
      variables like head direction, point of gaze, or task context. Many cells fired
      at the sight (and in anticipation) of a single landmark in a viewpoint- or
      task-dependent manner, simultaneously encoding the animal's logical situation
      within a set of actions leading to the goal. Overall, hippocampal activity was
      best fit by a fine-grained state space comprising current position, view, and
      action contexts. Our findings indicate that counterparts of rodent place cells in
      primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the
      target of gaze, therein supporting self-awareness in the construction of space.

TI  - Neurocomputational mechanisms underlying subjective valuation of effort costs.
PG  - e1002598
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002598 [doi]
AB  - In everyday life, we have to decide whether it is worth exerting effort to obtain
      rewards. Effort can be experienced in different domains, with some tasks
      requiring significant cognitive demand and others being more physically
      effortful. The motivation to exert effort for reward is highly subjective and
      varies considerably across the different domains of behaviour. However, very
      little is known about the computational or neural basis of how different effort
      costs are subjectively weighed against rewards. Is there a common, domain-general
      system of brain areas that evaluates all costs and benefits? Here, we used
      computational modelling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
      examine the mechanisms underlying value processing in both the cognitive and
      physical domains. Participants were trained on two novel tasks that
      parametrically varied either cognitive or physical effort. During fMRI,
      participants indicated their preferences between a fixed low-effort/low-reward
      option and a variable higher-effort/higher-reward offer for each effort domain.
      Critically, reward devaluation by both cognitive and physical effort was
      subserved by a common network of areas, including the dorsomedial and
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the intraparietal sulcus, and the anterior
      insula. Activity within these domain-general areas also covaried negatively with 
      reward and positively with effort, suggesting an integration of these parameters 
      within these areas. Additionally, the amygdala appeared to play a unique,
      domain-specific role in processing the value of rewards associated with cognitive
      effort. These results are the first to reveal the neurocomputational mechanisms
      underlying subjective cost-benefit valuation across different domains of effort
      and provide insight into the multidimensional nature of motivation.

TI  - ARGONAUTE10 promotes the degradation of miR165/6 through the SDN1 and SDN2
      exonucleases in Arabidopsis.
PG  - e2001272
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001272 [doi]
AB  - The degradation of small RNAs in plants and animals is associated with small RNA 
      3' truncation and 3' uridylation and thus relies on exonucleases and nucleotidyl 
      transferases. ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins associate with small RNAs in vivo and are 
      essential for not only the activities but also the stability of small RNAs. AGO1 
      is the microRNA (miRNA) effector in Arabidopsis, and its closest homolog, AGO10, 
      maintains stem cell homeostasis in meristems by sequestration of miR165/6, a
      conserved miRNA acting through AGO1. Here, we show that SMALL RNA DEGRADING
      NUCLEASES (SDNs) initiate miRNA degradation by acting on AGO1-bound miRNAs to
      cause their 3' truncation, and the truncated species are uridylated and degraded.
      We report that AGO10 reduces miR165/6 accumulation by enhancing its degradation
      by SDN1 and SDN2 in vivo. In vitro, AGO10-bound miR165/6 is more susceptible to
      SDN1-mediated 3' truncation than AGO1-bound miR165/6. Thus, AGO10 promotes the
      degradation of miR165/6, which is contrary to the stabilizing effect of AGO1. Our
      work identifies a class of exonucleases responsible for miRNA 3' truncation in
      vivo and uncovers a mechanism of specificity determination in miRNA turnover.
      This work, together with previous studies on AGO10, suggests that spatially
      regulated miRNA degradation underlies stem cell maintenance in plants.

TI  - A new explanation for unexpected evolution in body size.
PG  - e2001832
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001832 [doi]
AB  - Bigger is apparently frequently fitter, and body size is typically heritable, so 
      why don't animals in wild populations evolve towards larger sizes? Different
      explanations have been proposed for this apparent "paradox of stasis." A new
      study of snow voles in the Swiss Alps finds higher survival in animals with
      larger body mass and heritability of body mass, but, surprisingly, a genetic
      decline in body mass is also indicated. The authors suggest a novel explanation
      for this observation: the appearance of positive phenotypic selection is driven
      by a confounding variable of the age at which a juvenile is measured, whereas the
      evolutionarily relevant selection actually acts negatively on mass via its
      association with development time. Thus, genes for larger mass are not actually
      "fitter" because they are associated with longer development times, and juvenile 
      snow voles with longer development times run the risk of not completing
      development before the first winter snow. However, the genetic decline in body
      size is not apparent at the phenotypic level, presumably because of
      countervailing trends in environmental effects on the phenotype.

      skeletal muscle.

AB  - Obesity develops when caloric intake exceeds metabolic needs. Promoting energy
      expenditure represents an attractive approach in the prevention of this
      fast-spreading epidemic. Here, we report a novel pharmacological strategy in
      which a natural compound, narciclasine (ncls), attenuates diet-induced obesity
      (DIO) in mice by promoting energy expenditure. Moreover, ncls promotes fat
      clearance from peripheral metabolic tissues, improves blood metabolic parameters 
      in DIO mice, and protects these mice from the loss of voluntary physical
      activity. Further investigation suggested that ncls achieves these beneficial
      effects by promoting a shift from glycolytic to oxidative muscle fibers in the
      DIO mice thereby enhancing mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation
      (FAO) in the skeletal muscle. Moreover, ncls strongly activates AMPK signaling
      specifically in the skeletal muscle. The beneficial effects of ncls treatment in 
      fat clearance and AMPK activation were faithfully reproduced in vitro in cultured
      murine and human primary myotubes. Mechanistically, ncls increases cellular cAMP 
      concentration and ADP/ATP ratio, which further lead to the activation of AMPK
      signaling. Blocking AMPK signaling through a specific inhibitor significantly
      reduces FAO in myotubes. Finally, ncls also enhances mitochondrial membrane
      potential and reduces the formation of reactive oxygen species in cultured
      myotubes.

AB  - Sustaining a balanced intestinal microbial community is critical for maintaining 
      intestinal health and preventing chronic inflammation. The gut is a highly
      dynamic environment, subject to periodic waves of peristaltic activity. We
      hypothesized that this dynamic environment is a prerequisite for a balanced
      microbial community and that the enteric nervous system (ENS), a chief regulator 
      of physiological processes within the gut, profoundly influences gut microbiota
      composition. We found that zebrafish lacking an ENS due to a mutation in the
      Hirschsprung disease gene, sox10, develop microbiota-dependent inflammation that 
      is transmissible between hosts. Profiling microbial communities across a spectrum
      of inflammatory phenotypes revealed that increased levels of inflammation were
      linked to an overabundance of pro-inflammatory bacterial lineages and a lack of
      anti-inflammatory bacterial lineages. Moreover, either administering a
      representative anti-inflammatory strain or restoring ENS function corrected the
      pathology. Thus, we demonstrate that the ENS modulates gut microbiota community
      membership to maintain intestinal health.

TI  - Beyond negative valence: 2-week administration of a serotonergic antidepressant
      enhances both reward and effort learning signals.
PG  - e2000756
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000756 [doi]
AB  - To make good decisions, humans need to learn about and integrate different
      sources of appetitive and aversive information. While serotonin has been linked
      to value-based decision-making, its role in learning is less clear, with acute
      manipulations often producing inconsistent results. Here, we show that when the
      effects of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, citalopram) are
      studied over longer timescales, learning is robustly improved. We measured brain 
      activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in volunteers as they 
      performed a concurrent appetitive (money) and aversive (effort) learning task. We
      found that 2 weeks of citalopram enhanced reward and effort learning signals in a
      widespread network of brain regions, including ventromedial prefrontal and
      anterior cingulate cortex. At a behavioral level, this was accompanied by more
      robust reward learning. This suggests that serotonin can modulate the ability to 
      learn via a mechanism that is independent of stimulus valence. Such effects may
      partly underlie SSRIs' impact in treating psychological illnesses. Our results
      highlight both a specific function in learning for serotonin and the importance
      of studying its role across longer timescales.

AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) represent the single largest component of numerous
      eukaryotic genomes, and their activity and dispersal constitute an important
      force fostering evolutionary innovation. The horizontal transfer of TEs (HTT)
      between eukaryotic species is a common and widespread phenomenon that has had a
      profound impact on TE dynamics and, consequently, on the evolutionary trajectory 
      of many species' lineages. However, the mechanisms promoting HTT remain largely
      unknown. In this article, we argue that network theory combined with functional
      ecology provides a robust conceptual framework and tools to delineate how complex
      interactions between diverse organisms may act in synergy to promote HTTs.

      pharmaceutical industry has responded to this challenge by embracing open
      innovation to access external ideas. Historically, partnerships were usually
      bilateral, and the drug discovery process was shrouded in secrecy. This model is 
      rapidly changing. With the advent of the Internet, drug discovery has become more
      decentralised, bottom-up, and scalable than ever before. The term open innovation
      is now accepted as just one of many terms that capture different but overlapping 
      levels of openness in the drug discovery process. Many pharmaceutical companies
      recognise the advantages of revealing some proprietary information in the form of
      results, chemical tools, or unsolved problems in return for valuable insights and
      ideas. For example, such selective revealing can take the form of openly shared
      chemical tools to explore new biological mechanisms or by publicly admitting what
      is not known in the form of an open call. The essential ingredient for addressing
      these problems is access to the wider scientific crowd. The business of
      crowdsourcing, a form of outsourcing in which individuals or organisations
      solicit contributions from Internet users to obtain ideas or desired services,
      has grown significantly to fill this need and takes many forms today. Here, we
      posit that open-innovation approaches are more successful when they establish a
      reliable framework for converting creative ideas of the scientific crowd into
      practice with actionable plans.

      reflects temporal predictability but not rhythmic entrainment.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001665 [doi]
AB  - Predicting the timing of upcoming events enables efficient resource allocation
      and action preparation. Rhythmic streams, such as music, speech, and biological
      motion, constitute a pervasive source for temporal predictions. Widely accepted
      entrainment theories postulate that rhythm-based predictions are mediated by
      synchronizing low-frequency neural oscillations to the rhythm, as indicated by
      increased phase concentration (PC) of low-frequency neural activity for rhythmic 
      compared to random streams. However, we show here that PC enhancement in scalp
      recordings is not specific to rhythms but is observed to the same extent in less 
      periodic streams if they enable memory-based prediction. This is inconsistent
      with the predictions of a computational entrainment model of stronger PC for
      rhythmic streams. Anticipatory change in alpha activity and facilitation of
      electroencephalogram (EEG) manifestations of response selection are also
      comparable between rhythm- and memory-based predictions. However, rhythmic
      sequences uniquely result in obligatory depression of preparation-related
      premotor brain activity when an on-beat event is omitted, even when it is
      strategically beneficial to maintain preparation, leading to larger behavioral
      costs for violation of prediction. Thus, while our findings undermine the
      validity of PC as a sign of rhythmic entrainment, they constitute the first
      electrophysiological dissociation, to our knowledge, between mechanisms of
      rhythmic predictions and of memory-based predictions: the former obligatorily
      lead to resonance-like preparation patterns (that are in line with entrainment), 
      while the latter allow flexible resource allocation in time regardless of
      periodicity in the input. Taken together, they delineate the neural mechanisms of
      three distinct modes of preparation: continuous vigilance, interval-timing-based 
      prediction and rhythm-based prediction.

      Excitation.
PG  - e2001392
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001392 [doi]
AB  - Martinotti cells are the most prominent distal dendrite-targeting interneurons in
      the cortex, but their role in controlling pyramidal cell (PC) activity is largely
      unknown. Here, we show that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha2 subunit
      (Chrna2) specifically marks layer 5 (L5) Martinotti cells projecting to layer 1. 
      Furthermore, we confirm that Chrna2-expressing Martinotti cells selectively
      target L5 thick-tufted type A PCs but not thin-tufted type B PCs. Using
      optogenetic activation and inhibition, we demonstrate how Chrna2-Martinotti cells
      robustly reset and synchronize type A PCs via slow rhythmic burst activity and
      rebound excitation. Moreover, using optical feedback inhibition, in which PC
      spikes controlled the firing of surrounding Chrna2-Martinotti cells, we found
      that neighboring PC spike trains became synchronized by Martinotti cell
      inhibition. Together, our results show that L5 Martinotti cells participate in
      defined cortical circuits and can synchronize PCs in a frequency-dependent
      manner. These findings suggest that Martinotti cells are pivotal for coordinated 
      PC activity, which is involved in cortical information processing and cognitive
      control.

TI  - How to Use a Chemotherapeutic Agent When Resistance to It Threatens the Patient.
PG  - e2001110
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001110 [doi]
AB  - When resistance to anticancer or antimicrobial drugs evolves in a patient, highly
      effective chemotherapy can fail, threatening patient health and lifespan.
      Standard practice is to treat aggressively, effectively eliminating
      drug-sensitive target cells as quickly as possible. This prevents sensitive cells
      from acquiring resistance de novo but also eliminates populations that can
      competitively suppress resistant populations. Here we analyse that evolutionary
      trade-off and consider recent suggestions that treatment regimens aimed at
      containing rather than eliminating tumours or infections might more effectively
      delay the emergence of resistance. Our general mathematical analysis shows that
      there are situations in which regimens aimed at containment will outperform
      standard practice even if there is no fitness cost of resistance, and, in those
      cases, the time to treatment failure can be more than doubled. But, there are
      also situations in which containment will make a bad prognosis worse. Our
      analysis identifies thresholds that define these situations and thus can guide
      treatment decisions. The analysis also suggests a variety of interventions that
      could be used in conjunction with cytotoxic drugs to inhibit the emergence of
      resistance. Fundamental principles determine, across a wide range of disease
      settings, the circumstances under which standard practice best delays resistance 
      emergence-and when it can be bettered.

      Sorafenib: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e2000487
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000487 [doi]
AB  - Failure in cancer drug development exacts heavy burdens on patients and research 
      systems. To investigate inefficiencies and burdens in targeted drug development
      in cancer, we conducted a systematic review of all prelicensure trials for the
      anticancer drug, sorafenib (Bayer/Onyx Pharmaceuticals). We searched Embase and
      MEDLINE databases on October 14, 2014, for prelicensure clinical trials testing
      sorafenib against cancers. We measured risk by serious adverse event rates,
      benefit by objective response rates and survival, and trial success by
      prespecified primary endpoint attainment with acceptable toxicity. The first two 
      clinically useful applications of sorafenib were discovered in the first 2
      efficacy trials, after five drug-related deaths (4.6% of 108 total) and 93 total 
      patient-years of involvement (2.4% of 3,928 total). Thereafter, sorafenib was
      tested in 26 indications and 67 drug combinations, leading to one additional
      licensure. Drug developers tested 5 indications in over 5 trials each, comprising
      56 drug-related deaths (51.8% of 108 total) and 1,155 patient-years (29.4% of
      3,928 total) of burden in unsuccessful attempts to discover utility against these
      malignancies. Overall, 32 Phase II trials (26% of Phase II activity) were
      duplicative, lacked appropriate follow-up, or were uninformative because of
      accrual failure, constituting 1,773 patients (15.6% of 11,355 total)
      participating in prelicensure sorafenib trials. The clinical utility of sorafenib
      was established early in development, with low burden on patients and resources. 
      However, these early successes were followed by rapid and exhaustive testing
      against various malignancies and combination regimens, leading to excess patient 
      burden. Our evaluation of sorafenib development suggests many opportunities for
      reducing costs and unnecessary patient burden in cancer drug development.

AB  - Speciation can occur when a population is split and the resulting subpopulations 
      evolve independently, accumulating mutations over time that make them
      incompatible with one another. It is thought that such incompatible mutations,
      known as Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities, may arise when the
      two populations face different environments, which impose different selective
      pressures. However, a new study in PLOS Biology by Ono et al. finds that the
      first-step mutations selected in yeast populations evolving in parallel in the
      presence of the antifungal drug nystatin are frequently incompatible with one
      another. This incompatibility is environment dependent, such that the combination
      of two incompatible alleles can become advantageous under increasing drug
      concentrations. This suggests that the activity for the affected pathway must
      have an optimum level, the value of which varies according to the drug
      concentration. It is likely that many biological processes similarly have an
      optimum under a given environment and many single-step adaptive ways to reach it;
      thus, not only should BDM incompatibilities commonly arise during parallel
      evolution, they might be virtually inevitable, as the combination of two such
      steps is likely to overshoot the optimum.

TI  - Brain-Computer Interface-Based Communication in the Completely Locked-In State.
PG  - e1002593
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593 [doi]
AB  - Despite partial success, communication has remained impossible for persons
      suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional
      processing, a state called complete locked-in state (CLIS). Based on a motor
      learning theoretical context and on the failure of neuroelectric brain-computer
      interface (BCI) communication attempts in CLIS, we here report BCI communication 
      using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an implicit attentional
      processing procedure. Four patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS)-two of them in permanent CLIS and two entering the CLIS without
      reliable means of communication-learned to answer personal questions with known
      answers and open questions all requiring a "yes" or "no" thought using
      frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fNIRS. Three patients completed
      more than 46 sessions spread over several weeks, and one patient (patient W)
      completed 20 sessions. Online fNIRS classification of personal questions with
      known answers and open questions using linear support vector machine (SVM)
      resulted in an above-chance-level correct response rate over 70%.
      Electroencephalographic oscillations and electrooculographic signals did not
      exceed the chance-level threshold for correct communication despite occasional
      differences between the physiological signals representing a "yes" or "no"
      response. However, electroencephalogram (EEG) changes in the theta-frequency band
      correlated with inferior communication performance, probably because of decreased
      vigilance and attention. If replicated with ALS patients in CLIS, these positive 
      results could indicate the first step towards abolition of complete locked-in
      states, at least for ALS.

TI  - Lung Basal Stem Cells Rapidly Repair DNA Damage Using the Error-Prone
      Nonhomologous End-Joining Pathway.
PG  - e2000731
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000731 [doi]
AB  - Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), the second most common subtype of lung
      cancer, is strongly associated with tobacco smoking and exhibits genomic
      instability. The cellular origins and molecular processes that contribute to SqCC
      formation are largely unexplored. Here we show that human basal stem cells (BSCs)
      isolated from heavy smokers proliferate extensively, whereas their alveolar
      progenitor cell counterparts have limited colony-forming capacity. We demonstrate
      that this difference arises in part because of the ability of BSCs to repair
      their DNA more efficiently than alveolar cells following ionizing radiation or
      chemical-induced DNA damage. Analysis of mice harbouring a mutation in the
      DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a key enzyme in DNA
      damage repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), indicated that BSCs
      preferentially repair their DNA by this error-prone process. Interestingly,
      polyploidy, a phenomenon associated with genetically unstable cells, was only
      observed in the human BSC subset. Expression signature analysis indicated that
      BSCs are the likely cells of origin of human SqCC and that high levels of NHEJ
      genes in SqCC are correlated with increasing genomic instability. Hence, our
      results favour a model in which heavy smoking promotes proliferation of BSCs, and
      their predilection for error-prone NHEJ could lead to the high mutagenic burden
      that culminates in SqCC. Targeting DNA repair processes may therefore have a role
      in the prevention and therapy of SqCC.

TI  - Bigger Is Fitter? Quantitative Genetic Decomposition of Selection Reveals an
      Adaptive Evolutionary Decline of Body Mass in a Wild Rodent Population.
PG  - e1002592
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002592 [doi]
AB  - In natural populations, quantitative trait dynamics often do not appear to follow
      evolutionary predictions. Despite abundant examples of natural selection acting
      on heritable traits, conclusive evidence for contemporary adaptive evolution
      remains rare for wild vertebrate populations, and phenotypic stasis seems to be
      the norm. This so-called "stasis paradox" highlights our inability to predict
      evolutionary change, which is especially concerning within the context of rapid
      anthropogenic environmental change. While the causes underlying the stasis
      paradox are hotly debated, comprehensive attempts aiming at a resolution are
      lacking. Here, we apply a quantitative genetic framework to individual-based
      long-term data for a wild rodent population and show that despite a positive
      association between body mass and fitness, there has been a genetic change
      towards lower body mass. The latter represents an adaptive response to viability 
      selection favouring juveniles growing up to become relatively small adults, i.e.,
      with a low potential adult mass, which presumably complete their development
      earlier. This selection is particularly strong towards the end of the snow-free
      season, and it has intensified in recent years, coinciding which a change in
      snowfall patterns. Importantly, neither the negative evolutionary change, nor the
      selective pressures that drive it, are apparent on the phenotypic level, where
      they are masked by phenotypic plasticity and a non causal (i.e., non genetic)
      positive association between body mass and fitness, respectively. Estimating
      selection at the genetic level enabled us to uncover adaptive evolution in action
      and to identify the corresponding phenotypic selective pressure. We thereby
      demonstrate that natural populations can show a rapid and adaptive evolutionary
      response to a novel selective pressure, and that explicitly (quantitative)
      genetic models are able to provide us with an understanding of the causes and
      consequences of selection that is superior to purely phenotypic estimates of
      selection and evolutionary change.

AB  - Independently evolving populations may adapt to similar selection pressures via
      different genetic changes. The interactions between such changes, such as in a
      hybrid individual, can inform us about what course adaptation may follow and
      allow us to determine whether gene flow would be facilitated or hampered
      following secondary contact. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to measure the
      genetic interactions between first-step mutations that independently evolved in
      the same biosynthetic pathway following exposure to the fungicide nystatin. We
      found that genetic interactions are prevalent and predominantly negative, with
      the majority of mutations causing lower growth when combined in a double mutant
      than when alone as a single mutant (sign epistasis). The prevalence of sign
      epistasis is surprising given the small number of mutations tested and runs
      counter to expectations for mutations arising in a single biosynthetic pathway in
      the face of a simple selective pressure. Furthermore, in one third of pairwise
      interactions, the double mutant grew less well than either single mutant
      (reciprocal sign epistasis). The observation of reciprocal sign epistasis among
      these first adaptive mutations arising in the same genetic background indicates
      that partial postzygotic reproductive isolation could evolve rapidly between
      populations under similar selective pressures, even with only a single genetic
      change in each. The nature of the epistatic relationships was sensitive, however,
      to the level of drug stress in the assay conditions, as many double mutants
      became fitter than the single mutants at higher concentrations of nystatin. We
      discuss the implications of these results both for our understanding of epistatic
      interactions among beneficial mutations in the same biochemical pathway and for
      speciation.

AB  - One outstanding difference between Homo sapiens and other mammals is the ability 
      to perform highly complex cognitive tasks and behaviors, such as language,
      abstract thinking, and cultural diversity. How is this accomplished? According to
      one prominent theory, cognitive complexity is proportional to the repetition of
      specific computational modules over a large surface expansion of the cerebral
      cortex (neocortex). However, the human neocortex was shown to also possess unique
      features at the cellular and synaptic levels, raising the possibility that
      expanding the computational module is not the only mechanism underlying complex
      thinking. In a study published in PLOS Biology, Szegedi and colleagues analyzed a
      specific cortical circuit from live postoperative human tissue, showing that
      human-specific, very powerful excitatory connections between principal pyramidal 
      neurons and inhibitory neurons are highly plastic. This suggests that exclusive
      plasticity of specific microcircuits might be considered among the mechanisms
      endowing the human neocortex with the ability to perform highly complex cognitive
      tasks.

TI  - The Nuclear Receptor HIZR-1 Uses Zinc as a Ligand to Mediate Homeostasis in
      Response to High Zinc.
PG  - e2000094
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000094 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear receptors were originally defined as endocrine sensors in humans, leading
      to the identification of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Despite intensive
      efforts, most nuclear receptors have no known ligand, suggesting new ligand
      classes remain to be discovered. Furthermore, nuclear receptors are encoded in
      the genomes of primitive organisms that lack endocrine signaling, suggesting the 
      primordial function may have been environmental sensing. Here we describe a novel
      Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear receptor, HIZR-1, that is a high zinc sensor in an
      animal and the master regulator of high zinc homeostasis. The essential
      micronutrient zinc acts as a HIZR-1 ligand, and activated HIZR-1 increases
      transcription of genes that promote zinc efflux and storage. The results identify
      zinc as the first inorganic molecule to function as a physiological ligand for a 
      nuclear receptor and direct environmental sensing as a novel function of nuclear 
      receptors.

TI  - The Yin and Yang of Memory Consolidation: Hippocampal and Neocortical.
PG  - e2000531
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000531 [doi]
AB  - While hippocampal and cortical mechanisms of memory consolidation have long been 
      studied, their interaction is poorly understood. We sought to investigate
      potential interactions with respect to trace dominance, strengthening, and
      interference associated with postencoding novelty or sleep. A learning procedure 
      was scheduled in a watermaze that placed the impact of novelty and sleep in
      opposition. Distinct behavioural manipulations-context preexposure or
      interference during memory retrieval-differentially affected trace dominance and 
      trace survival, respectively. Analysis of immediate early gene expression
      revealed parallel up-regulation in the hippocampus and cortex, sustained in the
      hippocampus in association with novelty but in the cortex in association with
      sleep. These findings shed light on dynamically interacting mechanisms mediating 
      the stabilization of hippocampal and neocortical memory traces. Hippocampal
      memory traces followed by novelty were more dominant by default but liable to
      interference, whereas sleep engaged a lasting stabilization of cortical traces
      and consequent trace dominance after preexposure.

      Useful Health-Related Information.
PG  - e2001402
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402 [doi]
AB  - A new wave of portable biosensors allows frequent measurement of health-related
      physiology. We investigated the use of these devices to monitor human
      physiological changes during various activities and their role in managing health
      and diagnosing and analyzing disease. By recording over 250,000 daily
      measurements for up to 43 individuals, we found personalized circadian
      differences in physiological parameters, replicating previous physiological
      findings. Interestingly, we found striking changes in particular environments,
      such as airline flights (decreased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [SpO2] 
      and increased radiation exposure). These events are associated with physiological
      macro-phenotypes such as fatigue, providing a strong association between reduced 
      pressure/oxygen and fatigue on high-altitude flights. Importantly, we combined
      biosensor information with frequent medical measurements and made two important
      observations: First, wearable devices were useful in identification of early
      signs of Lyme disease and inflammatory responses; we used this information to
      develop a personalized, activity-based normalization framework to identify
      abnormal physiological signals from longitudinal data for facile disease
      detection. Second, wearables distinguish physiological differences between
      insulin-sensitive and -resistant individuals. Overall, these results indicate
      that portable biosensors provide useful information for monitoring personal
      activities and physiology and are likely to play an important role in managing
      health and enabling affordable health care access to groups traditionally limited
      by socioeconomic class or remote geography.

TI  - The Global Distribution and Drivers of Alien Bird Species Richness.
PG  - e2000942
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000942 [doi]
AB  - Alien species are a major component of human-induced environmental change.
      Variation in the numbers of alien species found in different areas is likely to
      depend on a combination of anthropogenic and environmental factors, with
      anthropogenic factors affecting the number of species introduced to new
      locations, and when, and environmental factors influencing how many species are
      able to persist there. However, global spatial and temporal variation in the
      drivers of alien introduction and species richness remain poorly understood.
      Here, we analyse an extensive new database of alien birds to explore what
      determines the global distribution of alien species richness for an entire
      taxonomic class. We demonstrate that the locations of origin and introduction of 
      alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven largely by European
      (mainly British) colonialism. However, recent introductions are a wider
      phenomenon, involving more species and countries, and driven in part by
      increasing economic activity. We find that, globally, alien bird species richness
      is currently highest at midlatitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic 
      effects, most notably the number of species introduced (i.e., "colonisation
      pressure"). Nevertheless, environmental drivers are also important, with native
      and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated.
      Our results demonstrate that colonisation pressure is key to understanding alien 
      species richness, show that areas of high native species richness are not
      resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale, and emphasise the
      likely ongoing threats to global environments from introductions of species.

AB  - We are remarkably adept at inferring the consequences of our actions, yet the
      neuronal mechanisms that allow us to plan a sequence of novel choices remain
      unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how 
      the human brain plans the shortest path to a goal in novel mazes with one
      (shallow maze) or two (deep maze) choice points. We observed two distinct
      anterior prefrontal responses to demanding choices at the second choice point:
      one in rostrodorsal medial prefrontal cortex (rd-mPFC)/superior frontal gyrus
      (SFG) that was also sensitive to (deactivated by) demanding initial choices and
      another in lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), which was only engaged by demanding
      choices at the second choice point. Furthermore, we identified hippocampal
      responses during planning that correlated with subsequent choice accuracy and
      response time, particularly in mazes affording sequential choices.
      Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses showed that coupling between the
      hippocampus and rd-mPFC increases during sequential (deep versus shallow)
      planning and is higher before correct versus incorrect choices. In short, using a
      naturalistic spatial planning paradigm, we reveal how the human brain represents 
      sequential choices during planning without extensive training. Our data highlight
      a network centred on the cortical midline and hippocampus that allows us to make 
      prospective choices while maintaining initial choices during planning in novel
      environments.

      Framework: Encouraging Reduction, Replacement, and Refinement in Animal Research.
PG  - e2000719
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000719 [doi]
AB  - While significant medical breakthroughs have been achieved through using animal
      models, our experience shows that often there is surplus material remaining that 
      is frequently never revisited but could be put to good use by other scientists.
      Recognising that most scientists are willing to share this material on a
      collaborative basis, it makes economic, ethical, and academic sense to explore
      the option to utilise this precious resource before generating new/additional
      animal models and associated samples. To bring together those requiring animal
      tissue and those holding this type of archival material, we have devised a
      framework called Sharing Experimental Animal Resources, Coordinating Holdings
      (SEARCH) with the aim of making remaining material derived from animal studies in
      biomedical research more visible and accessible to the scientific community. We
      encourage journals, funding bodies, and scientists to unite in promoting a new
      way of approaching animal research by adopting the SEARCH framework.

TI  - Where Have All the Giants Gone? How Animals Deal with the Problem of Size.
PG  - e2000473
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000473 [doi]
AB  - The survival of both the hunter and the hunted often comes down to speed. Yet how
      fast an animal can run is intricately linked to its size, such that the fastest
      animals are not the biggest nor the smallest. The ability to maintain high speeds
      is dependent on the body's capacity to withstand the high stresses involved with 
      locomotion. Yet even when standing still, scaling principles would suggest that
      the mechanical stress an animal feels will increase in greater demand than its
      body can support. So if big animals want to be fast, they must find solutions to 
      overcome these high stresses. This article explores the ways in which extant
      animals mitigate size-related increases in musculoskeletal stress in an effort to
      help understand where all the giants have gone.

TI  - Proteolytic Origin of the Soluble Human IL-6R In Vivo and a Decisive Role of
      N-Glycosylation.
PG  - e2000080
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000080 [doi]
AB  - Signaling of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) via its soluble IL-6 receptor
      (sIL-6R) is responsible for the proinflammatory properties of IL-6 and
      constitutes an attractive therapeutic target, but how the sIL-6R is generated in 
      vivo remains largely unclear. Here, we use liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry to identify an sIL-6R form in human serum that originates from
      proteolytic cleavage, map its cleavage site between Pro-355 and Val-356, and
      determine the occupancy of all O- and N-glycosylation sites of the human sIL-6R. 
      The metalloprotease a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) uses this
      cleavage site in vitro, and mutation of Val-356 is sufficient to completely
      abrogate IL-6R proteolysis. N- and O-glycosylation were dispensable for signaling
      of the IL-6R, but proteolysis was orchestrated by an N- and O-glycosylated sequon
      near the cleavage site and an N-glycan exosite in domain D1. Proteolysis of an
      IL-6R completely devoid of glycans is significantly impaired. Thus, glycosylation
      is an important regulator for sIL-6R generation.

AB  - The quality of people's knowledge of nature has always had a significant
      influence on their approach to wildlife and nature conservation. However, direct 
      interactions of people with nature are greatly limited nowadays, especially
      because of urbanization and modern lifestyles. As a result, our isolation from
      the natural world has been growing. Here, we present an example of a
      state-of-the-art Citizen Science project with its educational, scientific, and
      popularizing benefits. We conclude that modern media and new forms of education
      offer an effective opportunity for inspiring children and others to have fun
      learning to act like scientists. This approach provides broad opportunities for
      developing the hitherto neglected educational potential of Citizen Science.

TI  - Marine Reserve Targets to Sustain and Rebuild Unregulated Fisheries.
PG  - e2000537
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000537 [doi]
AB  - Overfishing threatens the sustainability of coastal marine biodiversity,
      especially in tropical developing countries. To counter this problem, about 200
      governments worldwide have committed to protecting 10%-20% of national coastal
      marine areas. However, associated impacts on fisheries productivity are unclear
      and could weaken the food security of hundreds of millions of people who depend
      on diverse and largely unregulated fishing activities. Here, we present a
      systematic theoretic analysis of the ability of reserves to rebuild fisheries
      under such complex conditions, and we identify maximum reserve coverages for
      biodiversity conservation that do not impair long-term fisheries productivity.
      Our analysis assumes that fishers have no viable alternative to fishing, such
      that total fishing effort remains constant (at best). We find that realistic
      reserve networks, which protect 10%-30% of fished habitats in 1-20 km wide
      reserves, should benefit the long-term productivity of almost any complex
      fishery. We discover a "rule of thumb" to safeguard against the long-term catch
      depletion of particular species: individual reserves should export 30% or more of
      locally produced larvae to adjacent fishing grounds. Specifically on coral reefs,
      where fishers tend to overexploit species whose dispersal distances as larvae
      exceed the home ranges of adults, decisions on the size of reserves needed to
      meet the 30% larval export rule are unlikely to compromise the protection of
      resident adults. Even achieving the modest Aichi Target 11 of 10% "effective
      protection" can then help rebuild depleted catch. However, strictly protecting
      20%-30% of fished habitats is unlikely to diminish catch even if overfishing is
      not yet a problem while providing greater potential for biodiversity conservation
      and fishery rebuilding if overfishing is substantial. These findings are
      important because they suggest that doubling or tripling the only globally
      enforced marine reserve target will benefit biodiversity conservation and higher 
      fisheries productivity where both are most urgently needed.

TI  - Languages Are Still a Major Barrier to Global Science.
PG  - e2000933
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000933 [doi]
AB  - While it is recognized that language can pose a barrier to the transfer of
      scientific knowledge, the convergence on English as the global language of
      science may suggest that this problem has been resolved. However, our survey
      searching Google Scholar in 16 languages revealed that 35.6% of 75,513 scientific
      documents on biodiversity conservation published in 2014 were not in English.
      Ignoring such non-English knowledge can cause biases in our understanding of
      study systems. Furthermore, as publication in English has become prevalent,
      scientific knowledge is often unavailable in local languages. This hinders its
      use by field practitioners and policy makers for local environmental issues; 54% 
      of protected area directors in Spain identified languages as a barrier. We urge
      scientific communities to make a more concerted effort to tackle this problem and
      propose potential approaches both for compiling non-English scientific knowledge 
      effectively and for enhancing the multilingualization of new and existing
      knowledge available only in English for the users of such knowledge.

TI  - Transient Duplication-Dependent Divergence and Horizontal Transfer Underlie the
      Evolutionary Dynamics of Bacterial Cell-Cell Signaling.
PG  - e2000330
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000330 [doi]
AB  - Evolutionary expansion of signaling pathway families often underlies the
      evolution of regulatory complexity. Expansion requires the acquisition of a novel
      homologous pathway and the diversification of pathway specificity. Acquisition
      can occur either vertically, by duplication, or through horizontal transfer,
      while divergence of specificity is thought to occur through a promiscuous protein
      intermediate. The way by which these mechanisms shape the evolution of rapidly
      diverging signaling families is unclear. Here, we examine this question using the
      highly diversified Rap-Phr cell-cell signaling system, which has undergone
      massive expansion in the genus Bacillus. To this end, genomic sequence analysis
      of >300 Bacilli genomes was combined with experimental analysis of the
      interaction of Rap receptors with Phr autoinducers and downstream targets.
      Rap-Phr expansion is shown to have occurred independently in multiple Bacillus
      lineages, with >80 different putative rap-phr alleles evolving in the Bacillius
      subtilis group alone. The specificity of many rap-phr alleles and the rapid gain 
      and loss of Rap targets are experimentally demonstrated. Strikingly, both
      horizontal and vertical processes were shown to participate in this expansion,
      each with a distinct role. Horizontal gene transfer governs the acquisition of
      already diverged rap-phr alleles, while intralocus duplication and divergence of 
      the phr gene create the promiscuous intermediate required for the divergence of
      Rap-Phr specificity. Our results suggest a novel role for transient gene
      duplication and divergence during evolutionary shifts in specificity.

TI  - Cell Fate Decision as High-Dimensional Critical State Transition.
PG  - e2000640
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000640 [doi]
AB  - Cell fate choice and commitment of multipotent progenitor cells to a
      differentiated lineage requires broad changes of their gene expression profile.
      But how progenitor cells overcome the stability of their gene expression
      configuration (attractor) to exit the attractor in one direction remains elusive.
      Here we show that commitment of blood progenitor cells to the erythroid or
      myeloid lineage is preceded by the destabilization of their high-dimensional
      attractor state, such that differentiating cells undergo a critical state
      transition. Single-cell resolution analysis of gene expression in populations of 
      differentiating cells affords a new quantitative index for predicting critical
      transitions in a high-dimensional state space based on decrease of correlation
      between cells and concomitant increase of correlation between genes as cells
      approach a tipping point. The detection of "rebellious cells" that enter the fate
      opposite to the one intended corroborates the model of preceding destabilization 
      of a progenitor attractor. Thus, early warning signals associated with critical
      transitions can be detected in statistical ensembles of high-dimensional systems,
      offering a formal theory-based approach for analyzing single-cell molecular
      profiles that goes beyond current computational pattern recognition, does not
      require knowledge of specific pathways, and could be used to predict impending
      major shifts in development and disease.

AB  - The structure and composition of bacterial communities can compromise antibiotic 
      efficacy. For example, the secretion of beta-lactamase by individual bacteria
      provides passive resistance for all residents within a polymicrobial environment.
      Here, we uncover that collective resistance can also develop via intracellular
      antibiotic deactivation. Real-time luminescence measurements and single-cell
      analysis demonstrate that the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus
      pneumoniae grows in medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (Cm) when resistant 
      bacteria expressing Cm acetyltransferase (CAT) are present. We show that CAT
      processes Cm intracellularly but not extracellularly. In a mouse pneumonia model,
      more susceptible pneumococci survive Cm treatment when coinfected with a
      CAT-expressing strain. Mathematical modeling predicts that stable coexistence is 
      only possible when antibiotic resistance comes at a fitness cost. Strikingly,
      CAT-expressing pneumococci in mouse lungs were outcompeted by susceptible cells
      even during Cm treatment. Our results highlight the importance of the microbial
      context during infectious disease as a potential complicating factor to
      antibiotic therapy.

TI  - Shedding Light on the Grey Zone of Speciation along a Continuum of Genomic
      Divergence.
PG  - e2000234
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000234 [doi]
AB  - Speciation results from the progressive accumulation of mutations that decrease
      the probability of mating between parental populations or reduce the fitness of
      hybrids-the so-called species barriers. The speciation genomic literature,
      however, is mainly a collection of case studies, each with its own approach and
      specificities, such that a global view of the gradual process of evolution from
      one to two species is currently lacking. Of primary importance is the prevalence 
      of gene flow between diverging entities, which is central in most species
      concepts and has been widely discussed in recent years. Here, we explore the
      continuum of speciation thanks to a comparative analysis of genomic data from 61 
      pairs of populations/species of animals with variable levels of divergence. Gene 
      flow between diverging gene pools is assessed under an approximate Bayesian
      computation (ABC) framework. We show that the intermediate "grey zone" of
      speciation, in which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from 0.5% to 2% of
      net synonymous divergence, irrespective of species life history traits or
      ecology. Thanks to appropriate modeling of among-locus variation in genetic drift
      and introgression rate, we clarify the status of the majority of ambiguous cases 
      and uncover a number of cryptic species. Our analysis also reveals the high
      incidence in animals of semi-isolated species (when some but not all loci are
      affected by barriers to gene flow) and highlights the intrinsic difficulty, both 
      statistical and conceptual, of delineating species in the grey zone of
      speciation.

TI  - Single-Cell-Based Analysis Highlights a Surge in Cell-to-Cell Molecular
      Variability Preceding Irreversible Commitment in a Differentiation Process.
PG  - e1002585
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002585 [doi]
AB  - In some recent studies, a view emerged that stochastic dynamics governing the
      switching of cells from one differentiation state to another could be
      characterized by a peak in gene expression variability at the point of fate
      commitment. We have tested this hypothesis at the single-cell level by analyzing 
      primary chicken erythroid progenitors through their differentiation process and
      measuring the expression of selected genes at six sequential time-points after
      induction of differentiation. In contrast to population-based expression data,
      single-cell gene expression data revealed a high cell-to-cell variability, which 
      was masked by averaging. We were able to show that the correlation network was a 
      very dynamical entity and that a subgroup of genes tend to follow the predictions
      from the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory. In addition, we also
      identified a small group of functionally related genes encoding proteins involved
      in sterol synthesis that could act as the initial drivers of the differentiation.
      In order to assess quantitatively the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression
      and its evolution in time, we used Shannon entropy as a measure of the
      heterogeneity. Entropy values showed a significant increase in the first 8 h of
      the differentiation process, reaching a peak between 8 and 24 h, before
      decreasing to significantly lower values. Moreover, we observed that the previous
      point of maximum entropy precedes two paramount key points: an irreversible
      commitment to differentiation between 24 and 48 h followed by a significant
      increase in cell size variability at 48 h. In conclusion, when analyzed at the
      single cell level, the differentiation process looks very different from its
      classical population average view. New observables (like entropy) can be
      computed, the behavior of which is fully compatible with the idea that
      differentiation is not a "simple" program that all cells execute identically but 
      results from the dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.

PG  - e2001624
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001624 [doi]
AB  - The Tree of Life (ToL) is meant to be a unique representation of the evolutionary
      relationships between all species on earth. Huge efforts are made to assemble
      such a large tree, helped by the decrease of sequencing costs and improved
      methods to reconstruct and combine phylogenies, but no tool exists today to
      explore the ToL in its entirety in a satisfying manner. By combining methods used
      in modern cartography, such as OpenStreetMap, with a new way of representing
      tree-like structures, I created Lifemap, a tool allowing the exploration of a
      complete representation of the ToL (between 800,000 and 2.2 million species
      depending on the data source) in a zoomable interface. A server version of
      Lifemap also allows users to visualize their own trees. This should help
      researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology in their everyday work, but may
      also permit the diffusion to a broader audience of our current knowledge of the
      evolutionary relationships linking all organisms.

TI  - Why Having a (Nonfinancial) Interest Is Not a Conflict of Interest.
PG  - e2001221
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001221 [doi]
AB  - A current debate about conflicts of interest related to biomedical research is to
      question whether the focus on financial conflicts of interest overshadows
      "nonfinancial" interests that could put scientific judgment at equal or greater
      risk of bias. There is substantial evidence that financial conflicts of interest 
      such as commercial sponsorship of research and investigators lead to systematic
      biases in scientific research at all stages of the research process. Conflation
      of "conflicts of interest" with "interests" in general serves to muddy the waters
      about how to manage conflicts of interest. We call for heightened disclosure of
      conflicts of interest and policy action beyond disclosure as the sole management 
      strategy. We propose a different strategy to manage interests more broadly to
      ensure fair representation and accountability.

TI  - Suppression of Dopamine Neurons Mediates Reward.
PG  - e1002586
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002586 [doi]
AB  - Massive activation of dopamine neurons is critical for natural reward and drug
      abuse. In contrast, the significance of their spontaneous activity remains
      elusive. In Drosophila melanogaster, depolarization of the protocerebral anterior
      medial (PAM) cluster dopamine neurons en masse signals reward to the mushroom
      body (MB) and drives appetitive memory. Focusing on the functional heterogeneity 
      of PAM cluster neurons, we identified that a single class of PAM neurons,
      PAM-gamma3, mediates sugar reward by suppressing their own activity. PAM-gamma3
      is selectively required for appetitive olfactory learning, while activation of
      these neurons in turn induces aversive memory. Ongoing activity of PAM-gamma3
      gets suppressed upon sugar ingestion. Strikingly, transient inactivation of basal
      PAM-gamma3 activity can substitute for reward and induces appetitive memory.
      Furthermore, we identified the satiety-signaling neuropeptide Allatostatin A
      (AstA) as a key mediator that conveys inhibitory input onto PAM-gamma3. Our
      results suggest the significance of basal dopamine release in reward signaling
      and reveal a circuit mechanism for negative regulation.

TI  - Selection for Mitochondrial Quality Drives Evolution of the Germline.
PG  - e2000410
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000410 [doi]
AB  - The origin of the germline-soma distinction is a fundamental unsolved question.
      Plants and basal metazoans do not have a germline but generate gametes from
      pluripotent stem cells in somatic tissues (somatic gametogenesis). In contrast,
      most bilaterians sequester a dedicated germline early in development. We develop 
      an evolutionary model which shows that selection for mitochondrial quality drives
      germline evolution. In organisms with low mitochondrial replication error rates, 
      segregation of mutations over multiple cell divisions generates variation,
      allowing selection to optimize gamete quality through somatic gametogenesis.
      Higher mutation rates promote early germline sequestration. We also consider how 
      oogamy (a large female gamete packed with mitochondria) alters selection on the
      germline. Oogamy is beneficial as it reduces mitochondrial segregation in early
      development, improving adult fitness by restricting variation between tissues.
      But it also limits variation between early-sequestered oocytes, undermining
      gamete quality. Oocyte variation is restored through proliferation of germline
      cells, producing more germ cells than strictly needed, explaining the random
      culling (atresia) of precursor cells in bilaterians. Unlike other models of
      germline evolution, selection for mitochondrial quality can explain the stability
      of somatic gametogenesis in plants and basal metazoans, the evolution of oogamy
      in all plants and animals with tissue differentiation, and the mutational forces 
      driving early germline sequestration in active bilaterians. The origins of
      predation in motile bilaterians in the Cambrian explosion is likely to have
      increased rates of tissue turnover and mitochondrial replication errors, in turn 
      driving germline evolution and the emergence of complex developmental processes.

TI  - Regulation of the Human Telomerase Gene TERT by Telomere Position Effect-Over
      Long Distances (TPE-OLD): Implications for Aging and Cancer.
PG  - e2000016
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000016 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase is expressed in early human development and then becomes silenced in
      most normal tissues. Because ~90% of primary human tumors express telomerase and 
      generally maintain very short telomeres, telomerase is carefully regulated,
      particularly in large, long-lived mammals. In the current report, we provide
      substantial evidence for a new regulatory control mechanism of the rate limiting 
      catalytic protein component of telomerase (hTERT) that is determined by the
      length of telomeres. We document that normal, young human cells with long
      telomeres have a repressed hTERT epigenetic status (chromatin and DNA
      methylation), but the epigenetic status is altered when telomeres become short.
      The change in epigenetic status correlates with altered expression of TERT and
      genes near to TERT, indicating a change in chromatin. Furthermore, we identified 
      a chromosome 5p telomere loop to a region near TERT in human cells with long
      telomeres that is disengaged with increased cell divisions as telomeres
      progressively shorten. Finally, we provide support for a role of the TRF2
      protein, and possibly TERRA, in the telomere looping maintenance mechanism
      through interactions with interstitial TTAGGG repeats. This provides new insights
      into how the changes in genome structure during replicative aging result in an
      increased susceptibility to age-related diseases and cancer prior to the
      initiation of a DNA damage signal.

PG  - e1002583
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002583 [doi]
AB  - Neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are severe and untreatable, 
      and mechanisms underlying cellular dysfunction are poorly understood. We found
      that toxic lipids relevant to three different LSDs disrupt multiple lysosomal and
      other cellular functions. Unbiased drug discovery revealed several structurally
      distinct protective compounds, approved for other uses, that prevent lysosomal
      and cellular toxicities of these lipids. Toxic lipids and protective agents show 
      unexpected convergence on control of lysosomal pH and re-acidification as a
      critical component of toxicity and protection. In twitcher mice (a model of
      Krabbe disease [KD]), a central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant protective agent
      rescued myelin and oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitors, improved motor behavior, and
      extended lifespan. Our studies reveal shared principles relevant to several LSDs,
      in which diverse cellular and biochemical disruptions appear to be secondary to
      disruption of lysosomal pH regulation by specific lipids. These studies also
      provide novel protective strategies that confer therapeutic benefits in a mouse
      model of a severe LSD.

TI  - Getting Road Expansion on the Right Track: A Framework for Smart Infrastructure
      Planning in the Mekong.
PG  - e2000266
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000266 [doi]
AB  - The current unprecedented expansion of infrastructure promises to enhance human
      wellbeing but risks causing substantial harm to natural ecosystems and the
      benefits they provide for people. A framework for systematically and proactively 
      identifying the likely benefits and costs of such developments is badly needed.
      Here, we develop and test at the subregional scale a recently proposed global
      scheme for comparing the potential gains from new roads for food production with 
      their likely impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Working in the
      Greater Mekong-an exceptionally biodiverse subregion undergoing rapid
      development-we combined maps of isolation from urban centres, yield gaps, and the
      current area under 17 crops to estimate where and how far road development could 
      in principle help to increase food production without the need for cropland
      expansion. We overlaid this information with maps summarising the importance of
      remaining habitats to terrestrial vertebrates and (as examples of major ecosystem
      services) to global and local climate regulation. This intersection revealed
      several largely converted yet relatively low-yielding areas (such as central,
      eastern, and northeastern Thailand and the Ayeyarwady Delta), where narrowing
      yield gaps by improving transport links has the potential to substantially
      increase food production at relatively limited environmental cost. Concentrating 
      new roads and road improvements here while taking strong measures to prevent
      their spread into areas which are still extensively forested (such as northern
      Laos, western Yunnan, and southwestern Cambodia) could thus enhance rural
      livelihoods and regional food production while helping safeguard vital ecosystem 
      services and globally significant biological diversity.

TI  - Structural Basis for Inhibitor-Induced Aggregation of HIV Integrase.
PG  - e1002584
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002584 [doi]
AB  - The allosteric inhibitors of integrase (termed ALLINIs) interfere with HIV
      replication by binding to the viral-encoded integrase (IN) protein. Surprisingly,
      ALLINIs interfere not with DNA integration but with viral particle assembly late 
      during HIV replication. To investigate the ALLINI inhibitory mechanism, we
      crystallized full-length HIV-1 IN bound to the ALLINI GSK1264 and determined the 
      structure of the complex at 4.4 A resolution. The structure shows GSK1264 buried 
      between the IN C-terminal domain (CTD) and the catalytic core domain. In the
      crystal lattice, the interacting domains are contributed by two different dimers 
      so that IN forms an open polymer mediated by inhibitor-bridged contacts; the
      N-terminal domains do not participate and are structurally disordered. Engineered
      amino acid substitutions at the inhibitor interface blocked ALLINI-induced
      multimerization. HIV escape mutants with reduced sensitivity to ALLINIs commonly 
      altered amino acids at or near the inhibitor-bound interface, and these
      substitutions also diminished IN multimerization. We propose that ALLINIs inhibit
      particle assembly by stimulating inappropriate polymerization of IN via
      interactions between the catalytic core domain and the CTD and that understanding
      the interface involved offers new routes to inhibitor optimization.

TI  - Climate-Related Local Extinctions Are Already Widespread among Plant and Animal
      Species.
PG  - e2001104
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001104 [doi]
AB  - Current climate change may be a major threat to global biodiversity, but the
      extent of species loss will depend on the details of how species respond to
      changing climates. For example, if most species can undergo rapid change in their
      climatic niches, then extinctions may be limited. Numerous studies have now
      documented shifts in the geographic ranges of species that were inferred to be
      related to climate change, especially shifts towards higher mean elevations and
      latitudes. Many of these studies contain valuable data on extinctions of local
      populations that have not yet been thoroughly explored. Specifically, overall
      range shifts can include range contractions at the "warm edges" of species'
      ranges (i.e., lower latitudes and elevations), contractions which occur through
      local extinctions. Here, data on climate-related range shifts were used to test
      the frequency of local extinctions related to recent climate change. The results 
      show that climate-related local extinctions have already occurred in hundreds of 
      species, including 47% of the 976 species surveyed. This frequency of local
      extinctions was broadly similar across climatic zones, clades, and habitats but
      was significantly higher in tropical species than in temperate species (55%
      versus 39%), in animals than in plants (50% versus 39%), and in freshwater
      habitats relative to terrestrial and marine habitats (74% versus 46% versus 51%).
      Overall, these results suggest that local extinctions related to climate change
      are already widespread, even though levels of climate change so far are modest
      relative to those predicted in the next 100 years. These extinctions will
      presumably become much more prevalent as global warming increases further by
      roughly 2-fold to 5-fold over the coming decades.

PG  - e2001259

AB  - Translational research is often afflicted by a fundamental problem: a limited
      understanding of disease mechanisms prevents effective targeting of new
      treatments. Seeking to accelerate research advances and reimagine its role in the
      community, the Montreal Neurological Institute (Neuro) announced in the spring of
      2016 that it is launching a five-year experiment during which it will adopt Open 
      Science-open data, open materials, and no patenting-across the institution. The
      experiment seeks to examine two hypotheses. The first is whether the Neuro's Open
      Science initiative will attract new private partners. The second hypothesis is
      that the Neuro's institution-based approach will draw companies to the Montreal
      region, where the Neuro is based, leading to the creation of a local knowledge
      hub. This article explores why these hypotheses are likely to be true and
      describes the Neuro's approach to exploring them.

TI  - A Low-Correlation Resting State of the Striatum during Cortical Avalanches and
      Its Role in Movement Suppression.
PG  - e1002582
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002582 [doi]
AB  - During quiet resting behavior, involuntary movements are suppressed. Such
      movement control is attributed to cortico-basal ganglia loops, yet population
      dynamics within these loops during resting and their relation to involuntary
      movements are not well characterized. Here, we show by recording cortical and
      striatal ongoing population activity in awake rats during quiet resting that
      intrastriatal inhibition maintains a low-correlation striatal resting state in
      the presence of cortical neuronal avalanches. Involuntary movements arise from
      disturbed striatal resting activity through two different population dynamics.
      Nonselectively reducing intrastriatal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-A
      inhibition synchronizes striatal dynamics, leading to involuntary movements at
      low rate. In contrast, reducing striatal interneuron (IN)-mediated inhibition
      maintains decorrelation and induces intermittent involuntary movements at high
      rate. This latter scenario was highly effective in modulating cortical dynamics
      at a subsecond timescale. To distinguish intrastriatal processing from loop
      dynamics, cortex-striatum-midbrain cultures, which lack feedback to cortex, were 
      used. Cortical avalanches in vitro were accompanied by low-correlated resting
      activity in the striatum and nonselective reduction in striatal inhibition
      synchronized striatal neurons similar to in vivo. Importantly, reduction of
      inhibition from striatal INs maintained low correlations in the striatum while
      reorganizing functional connectivities among striatal neurons. Our results
      demonstrate the importance of two major striatal microcircuits in distinctly
      regulating striatal and cortical resting state dynamics. These findings suggest
      that specific functional connectivities of the striatum that are maintained by
      local inhibition are important in movement control.

TI  - Natural Variation in Arabidopsis Cvi-0 Accession Reveals an Important Role of
      MPK12 in Guard Cell CO2 Signaling.
PG  - e2000322
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000322 [doi]
AB  - Plant gas exchange is regulated by guard cells that form stomatal pores. Stomatal
      adjustments are crucial for plant survival; they regulate uptake of CO2 for
      photosynthesis, loss of water, and entrance of air pollutants such as ozone. We
      mapped ozone hypersensitivity, more open stomata, and stomatal CO2-insensitivity 
      phenotypes of the Arabidopsis thaliana accession Cvi-0 to a single amino acid
      substitution in MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN (MAP) KINASE 12 (MPK12). In parallel,
      we showed that stomatal CO2-insensitivity phenotypes of a mutant cis
      (CO2-insensitive) were caused by a deletion of MPK12. Lack of MPK12 impaired
      bicarbonate-induced activation of S-type anion channels. We demonstrated that
      MPK12 interacted with the protein kinase HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1 (HT1)-a central 
      node in guard cell CO2 signaling-and that MPK12 functions as an inhibitor of HT1.
      These data provide a new function for plant MPKs as protein kinase inhibitors and
      suggest a mechanism through which guard cell CO2 signaling controls plant water
      management.

TI  - The ace-1 Locus Is Amplified in All Resistant Anopheles gambiae Mosquitoes:
      Fitness Consequences of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Duplications.
PG  - e2000618
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000618 [doi]
AB  - Gene copy-number variations are widespread in natural populations, but
      investigating their phenotypic consequences requires contemporary duplications
      under selection. Such duplications have been found at the ace-1 locus (encoding
      the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides' target) in the mosquito Anopheles
      gambiae (the major malaria vector); recent studies have revealed their intriguing
      complexity, consistent with the involvement of various numbers and types
      (susceptible or resistant to insecticide) of copies. We used an integrative
      approach, from genome to phenotype level, to investigate the influence of
      duplication architecture and gene-dosage on mosquito fitness. We found that both 
      heterogeneous (i.e., one susceptible and one resistant ace-1 copy) and
      homogeneous (i.e., identical resistant copies) duplications segregated in field
      populations. The number of copies in homogeneous duplications was variable and
      positively correlated with acetylcholinesterase activity and resistance level.
      Determining the genomic structure of the duplicated region revealed that, in both
      types of duplication, ace-1 and 11 other genes formed tandem 203kb amplicons. We 
      developed a diagnostic test for duplications, which showed that ace-1 was
      amplified in all 173 resistant mosquitoes analyzed (field-collected in several
      African countries), in heterogeneous or homogeneous duplications. Each type was
      associated with different fitness trade-offs: heterogeneous duplications
      conferred an intermediate phenotype (lower resistance and fitness costs), whereas
      homogeneous duplications tended to increase both resistance and fitness cost, in 
      a complex manner. The type of duplication selected seemed thus to depend on the
      intensity and distribution of selection pressures. This versatility of trade-offs
      available through gene duplication highlights the importance of large mutation
      events in adaptation to environmental variation. This impressive adaptability
      could have a major impact on vector control in Africa.

TI  - Authorization of Animal Experiments Is Based on Confidence Rather than Evidence
      of Scientific Rigor.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates high risk of bias in preclinical animal research,
      questioning the scientific validity and reproducibility of published research
      findings. Systematic reviews found low rates of reporting of measures against
      risks of bias in the published literature (e.g., randomization, blinding, sample 
      size calculation) and a correlation between low reporting rates and inflated
      treatment effects. That most animal research undergoes peer review or ethical
      review would offer the possibility to detect risks of bias at an earlier stage,
      before the research has been conducted. For example, in Switzerland, animal
      experiments are licensed based on a detailed description of the study protocol
      and a harm-benefit analysis. We therefore screened applications for animal
      experiments submitted to Swiss authorities (n = 1,277) for the rates at which the
      use of seven basic measures against bias (allocation concealment, blinding,
      randomization, sample size calculation, inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary
      outcome variable, and statistical analysis plan) were described and compared them
      with the reporting rates of the same measures in a representative sub-sample of
      publications (n = 50) resulting from studies described in these applications.
      Measures against bias were described at very low rates, ranging on average from
      2.4% for statistical analysis plan to 19% for primary outcome variable in
      applications for animal experiments, and from 0.0% for sample size calculation to
      34% for statistical analysis plan in publications from these experiments.
      Calculating an internal validity score (IVS) based on the proportion of the seven
      measures against bias, we found a weak positive correlation between the IVS of
      applications and that of publications (Spearman's rho = 0.34, p = 0.014),
      indicating that the rates of description of these measures in applications partly
      predict their rates of reporting in publications. These results indicate that the
      authorities licensing animal experiments are lacking important information about 
      experimental conduct that determines the scientific validity of the findings,
      which may be critical for the weight attributed to the benefit of the research in
      the harm-benefit analysis. Similar to manuscripts getting accepted for
      publication despite poor reporting of measures against bias, applications for
      animal experiments may often be approved based on implicit confidence rather than
      explicit evidence of scientific rigor. Our findings shed serious doubt on the
      current authorization procedure for animal experiments, as well as the
      peer-review process for scientific publications, which in the long run may
      undermine the credibility of research. Developing existing authorization
      procedures that are already in place in many countries towards a preregistration 
      system for animal research is one promising way to reform the system. This would 
      not only benefit the scientific validity of findings from animal experiments but 
      also help to avoid unnecessary harm to animals for inconclusive research.

AB  - We here propose the implementation of a simple and effective method to enhance
      the quality of basic and preclinical academic research: critical incident
      reporting (CIR). CIR has become a standard in clinical medicine but to our
      knowledge has never been implemented in the context of academic basic research.
      We provide a simple, free, open-source software tool for implementing a CIR
      system in research groups, laboratories, or large institutions (LabCIRS). LabCIRS
      was developed, tested, and implemented in our multidisciplinary and
      multiprofessional neuroscience research department. It is accepted by all members
      of the department, has led to the emergence of a mature error culture, and has
      made the laboratory a safer and more communicative environment. Initial concerns 
      that implementation of such a measure might lead to a "surveillance culture" that
      would stifle scientific creativity turned out to be unfounded.

TI  - Decoding the Interactions Regulating the Active State Mechanics of Eukaryotic
      Protein Kinases.
PG  - e2000127
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000127 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic protein kinases regulate most cellular functions by phosphorylating
      targeted protein substrates through a highly conserved catalytic core. In the
      active state, the catalytic core oscillates between open, intermediate, and
      closed conformations. Currently, the intramolecular interactions that regulate
      the active state mechanics are not well understood. Here, using cAMP-dependent
      protein kinase as a representative model coupled with biochemical, biophysical,
      and computational techniques, we define a set of highly conserved electrostatic
      and hydrophobic interactions working harmoniously to regulate these mechanics.
      These include the previously identified salt bridge between a lysine from the
      beta3-strand and a glutamate from the alphaC-helix as well as an electrostatic
      interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and alphaC-helix and an
      ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. Moreover, for
      over three decades it was thought that the highly conserved beta3-lysine was
      essential for phosphoryl transfer, but our findings show that the beta3-lysine is
      not required for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for the active state
      mechanics.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000998 [doi]
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the causative agent of Kaposi's
      sarcoma, encodes 25 mature viral miRNAs. MCP-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1), a
      critical regulator of immune homeostasis, has been shown to suppress miRNA
      biosynthesis via cleavage of precursor miRNAs through its RNase domain. We
      demonstrate that MCPIP1 can directly cleave KSHV and EBV precursor miRNAs and
      that MCPIP1 expression is repressed following de novo KSHV infection. In
      addition, repression with siRNAs to MCPIP1 in KSHV-infected cells increased IL-6 
      and KSHV miRNA expression, supporting a role for MCPIP1 in IL-6 and KSHV miRNA
      regulation. We also provide evidence that KSHV miRNAs repress MCPIP1 expression
      by targeting the 3'UTR of MCPIP1. Conversely, expression of essential miRNA
      biogenesis components Dicer and TRBP is increased following latent KSHV
      infection. We propose that KSHV infection inhibits a negative regulator of miRNA 
      biogenesis (MCPIP1) and up-regulates critical miRNA processing components to
      evade host mechanisms that inhibit expression of viral miRNAs. KSHV-mediated
      alterations in miRNA biogenesis represent a novel mechanism by which KSHV
      interacts with its host and a new mechanism for the regulation of viral miRNA
      expression.

PG  - e2000504
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000504 [doi]
AB  - Although retinoic acid (RA) teratogenicity has been investigated for decades, the
      mechanisms underlying RA-induced outflow tract (OFT) malformations are not
      understood. Here, we show zebrafish embryos deficient for Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1
      enzymes, which promote RA degradation, have OFT defects resulting from two
      mechanisms: first, a failure of second heart field (SHF) progenitors to join the 
      OFT, instead contributing to the pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs), and second, a
      loss of first heart field (FHF) ventricular cardiomyocytes due to disrupted cell 
      polarity and extrusion from the heart tube. Molecularly, excess RA signaling
      negatively regulates fibroblast growth factor 8a (fgf8a) expression and
      positively regulates matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9) expression. Although
      restoring Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling can partially rescue SHF
      addition in Cyp26 deficient embryos, attenuating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
      function can rescue both ventricular SHF addition and FHF integrity. These novel 
      findings indicate a primary effect of RA-induced OFT defects is disruption of the
      extracellular environment, which compromises both SHF recruitment and FHF
      ventricular integrity.

      Regions of Neurodegeneration.
PG  - e1002579
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002579 [doi]
AB  - Protein misfolding is common across many neurodegenerative diseases, with
      misfolded proteins acting as seeds for "prion-like" conversion of normally folded
      protein to abnormal conformations. A central hypothesis is that misfolded protein
      accumulation, spread, and distribution are restricted to specific neuronal
      populations of the central nervous system and thus predict regions of
      neurodegeneration. We examined this hypothesis using a highly sensitive assay
      system for detection of misfolded protein seeds in a murine model of prion
      disease. Misfolded prion protein (PrP) seeds were observed widespread throughout 
      the brain, accumulating in all brain regions examined irrespective of
      neurodegeneration. Importantly, neither time of exposure nor amount of misfolded 
      protein seeds present determined regions of neurodegeneration. We further
      demonstrate two distinct microglia responses in prion-infected brains: a novel
      homeostatic response in all regions and an innate immune response restricted to
      sites of neurodegeneration. Therefore, accumulation of misfolded prion protein
      alone does not define targeting of neurodegeneration, which instead results only 
      when misfolded prion protein accompanies a specific innate immune response.

TI  - SOX2 and PI3K Cooperate to Induce and Stabilize a Squamous-Committed Stem Cell
      Injury State during Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Pathogenesis.
PG  - e1002581
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002581 [doi]
AB  - Although cancers are considered stem cell diseases, mechanisms involving stem
      cell alterations are poorly understood. Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) is the
      second most common lung cancer, and its pathogenesis appears to hinge on changes 
      in the stem cell behavior of basal cells in the bronchial airways. Basal cells
      are normally quiescent and differentiate into mucociliary epithelia. Smoking
      triggers a hyperproliferative response resulting in progressive premalignant
      epithelial changes ranging from squamous metaplasia to dysplasia. These changes
      can regress naturally, even with chronic smoking. However, for unknown reasons,
      dysplasias have higher progression rates than earlier stages. We used primary
      human tracheobronchial basal cells to investigate how copy number gains in SOX2
      and PIK3CA at 3q26-28, which co-occur in dysplasia and are observed in 94% of
      SQCCs, may promote progression. We find that SOX2 cooperates with PI3K signaling,
      which is activated by smoking, to initiate the squamous injury response in basal 
      cells. This response involves SOX9 repression, and, accordingly, SOX2 and PI3K
      signaling levels are high during dysplasia, while SOX9 is not expressed. By
      contrast, during regeneration of mucociliary epithelia, PI3K signaling is low and
      basal cells transiently enter a SOX2LoSOX9Hi state, with SOX9 promoting
      proliferation and preventing squamous differentiation. Transient reduction in
      SOX2 is necessary for ciliogenesis, although SOX2 expression later rises and
      drives mucinous differentiation, as SOX9 levels decline. Frequent coamplification
      of SOX2 and PIK3CA in dysplasia may, thus, promote progression by locking basal
      cells in a SOX2HiSOX9Lo state with active PI3K signaling, which sustains the
      squamous injury response while precluding normal mucociliary differentiation.
      Surprisingly, we find that, although later in invasive carcinoma SOX9 is
      generally expressed at low levels, its expression is higher in a subset of SQCCs 
      with less squamous identity and worse clinical outcome. We propose that early
      pathogenesis of most SQCCs involves stabilization of the squamous injury state in
      stem cells through copy number gains at 3q, with the pro-proliferative activity
      of SOX9 possibly being exploited in a subset of SQCCs in later stages.

TI  - A Normalization Framework for Emotional Attention.
PG  - e1002578
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002578 [doi]
AB  - The normalization model of attention proposes that attention can affect
      performance by response- or contrast-gain changes, depending on the size of the
      stimulus and attention field. Here, we manipulated the attention field by
      emotional valence, negative faces versus positive faces, while holding stimulus
      size constant in a spatial cueing task. We observed changes in the cueing effect 
      consonant with changes in response gain for negative faces and contrast gain for 
      positive faces. Neuroimaging experiments confirmed that subjects' attention
      fields were narrowed for negative faces and broadened for positive faces.
      Importantly, across subjects, the self-reported emotional strength of negative
      faces and positive faces correlated, respectively, both with response- and
      contrast-gain changes and with primary visual cortex (V1) narrowed and broadened 
      attention fields. Effective connectivity analysis showed that the emotional
      valence-dependent attention field was closely associated with feedback from the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to V1. These findings indicate a crucial
      involvement of DLPFC in the normalization processes of emotional attention.

TI  - Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities
      across Host Evolutionary History.
PG  - e2000225
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000225 [doi]
AB  - Phylosymbiosis was recently proposed to describe the eco-evolutionary pattern,
      whereby the ecological relatedness of host-associated microbial communities
      parallels the phylogeny of related host species. Here, we test the prevalence of 
      phylosymbiosis and its functional significance under highly controlled conditions
      by characterizing the microbiota of 24 animal species from four different groups 
      (Peromyscus deer mice, Drosophila flies, mosquitoes, and Nasonia wasps), and we
      reevaluate the phylosymbiotic relationships of seven species of wild hominids. We
      demonstrate three key findings. First, intraspecific microbiota variation is
      consistently less than interspecific microbiota variation, and microbiota-based
      models predict host species origin with high accuracy across the dataset.
      Interestingly, the age of host clade divergence positively associates with the
      degree of microbial community distinguishability between species within the host 
      clades, spanning recent host speciation events (~1 million y ago) to more
      distantly related host genera (~108 million y ago). Second, topological
      congruence analyses of each group's complete phylogeny and microbiota dendrogram 
      reveal significant degrees of phylosymbiosis, irrespective of host clade age or
      taxonomy. Third, consistent with selection on host-microbiota interactions
      driving phylosymbiosis, there are survival and performance reductions when
      interspecific microbiota transplants are conducted between closely related and
      divergent host species pairs. Overall, these findings indicate that the
      composition and functional effects of an animal's microbial community can be
      closely allied with host evolution, even across wide-ranging timescales and
      diverse animal systems reared under controlled conditions.

TI  - ADAMTS5 Is a Critical Regulator of Virus-Specific T Cell Immunity.
PG  - e1002580
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002580 [doi]
AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides physical scaffolding for cellular
      constituents and initiates biochemical and biomechanical cues that are required
      for physiological activity of living tissues. The ECM enzyme ADAMTS5, a member of
      the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin-like and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin-1
      motifs) protein family, cleaves large proteoglycans such as aggrecan, leading to 
      the destruction of cartilage and osteoarthritis. However, its contribution to
      viral pathogenesis and immunity is currently undefined. Here, we use a
      combination of in vitro and in vivo models to show that ADAMTS5 enzymatic
      activity plays a key role in the development of influenza-specific immunity.
      Influenza virus infection of Adamts5-/- mice resulted in delayed virus clearance,
      compromised T cell migration and immunity and accumulation of versican, an
      ADAMTS5 proteoglycan substrate. Our research emphasises the importance of ADAMTS5
      expression in the control of influenza virus infection and highlights the
      potential for development of ADAMTS5-based therapeutic strategies to reduce
      morbidity and mortality.

TI  - The Machado-Joseph Disease Deubiquitinase Ataxin-3 Regulates the Stability and
      Apoptotic Function of p53.
PG  - e2000733
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000733 [doi]
AB  - As a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), the physiological substrates of ataxin-3
      (ATX-3) remain elusive, which limits our understanding of its normal cellular
      function and that of pathogenic mechanism of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3
      (SCA3). Here, we identify p53 to be a novel substrate of ATX-3. ATX-3 binds to
      native and polyubiquitinated p53 and deubiquitinates and stabilizes p53 by
      repressing its degradation through the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway. ATX-3
      deletion destabilizes p53, resulting in deficiency of p53 activity and functions,
      whereas ectopic expression of ATX-3 induces selective transcription/expression of
      p53 target genes and promotes p53-dependent apoptosis in both mammalian cells and
      the central nervous system of zebrafish. Furthermore, the polyglutamine
      (polyQ)-expanded ATX-3 retains enhanced interaction and deubiquitination
      catalytic activity to p53 and causes more severe p53-dependent neurodegeneration 
      in zebrafish brains and in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum 
      of a transgenic SCA3 mouse model. Our findings identify a novel molecular link
      between ATX-3 and p53-mediated cell death and provide an explanation for the
      direct involvement of p53 in SCA3 disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Successful interaction with the environment requires flexible updating of our
      beliefs about the world. By estimating the likelihood of future events, it is
      possible to prepare appropriate actions in advance and execute fast, accurate
      motor responses. According to theoretical proposals, agents track the variability
      arising from changing environments by computing various forms of uncertainty.
      Several neuromodulators have been linked to uncertainty signalling, but
      comprehensive empirical characterisation of their relative contributions to
      perceptual belief updating, and to the selection of motor responses, is lacking. 
      Here we assess the roles of noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine within a
      single, unified computational framework of uncertainty. Using pharmacological
      interventions in a sample of 128 healthy human volunteers and a hierarchical
      Bayesian learning model, we characterise the influences of noradrenergic,
      cholinergic, and dopaminergic receptor antagonism on individual computations of
      uncertainty during a probabilistic serial reaction time task. We propose that
      noradrenaline influences learning of uncertain events arising from unexpected
      changes in the environment. In contrast, acetylcholine balances attribution of
      uncertainty to chance fluctuations within an environmental context, defined by a 
      stable set of probabilistic associations, or to gross environmental violations
      following a contextual switch. Dopamine supports the use of uncertainty
      representations to engender fast, adaptive responses.

      during Speech Perception.
PG  - e1002577
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002577 [doi]
AB  - Successful perception depends on combining sensory input with prior knowledge.
      However, the underlying mechanism by which these two sources of information are
      combined is unknown. In speech perception, as in other domains, two functionally 
      distinct coding schemes have been proposed for how expectations influence
      representation of sensory evidence. Traditional models suggest that expected
      features of the speech input are enhanced or sharpened via interactive activation
      (Sharpened Signals). Conversely, Predictive Coding suggests that expected
      features are suppressed so that unexpected features of the speech input
      (Prediction Errors) are processed further. The present work is aimed at
      distinguishing between these two accounts of how prior knowledge influences
      speech perception. By combining behavioural, univariate, and multivariate fMRI
      measures of how sensory detail and prior expectations influence speech perception
      with computational modelling, we provide evidence in favour of Prediction Error
      computations. Increased sensory detail and informative expectations have additive
      behavioural and univariate neural effects because they both improve the accuracy 
      of word report and reduce the BOLD signal in lateral temporal lobe regions.
      However, sensory detail and informative expectations have interacting effects on 
      speech representations shown by multivariate fMRI in the posterior superior
      temporal sulcus. When prior knowledge was absent, increased sensory detail
      enhanced the amount of speech information measured in superior temporal
      multivoxel patterns, but with informative expectations, increased sensory detail 
      reduced the amount of measured information. Computational simulations of
      Sharpened Signals and Prediction Errors during speech perception could both
      explain these behavioural and univariate fMRI observations. However, the
      multivariate fMRI observations were uniquely simulated by a Prediction Error and 
      not a Sharpened Signal model. The interaction between prior expectation and
      sensory detail provides evidence for a Predictive Coding account of speech
      perception. Our work establishes methods that can be used to distinguish
      representations of Prediction Error and Sharpened Signals in other perceptual
      domains.

TI  - Animal Study Registries: Results from a Stakeholder Analysis on Potential
      Strengths, Weaknesses, Facilitators, and Barriers.
PG  - e2000391
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000391 [doi]
AB  - Publication bias in animal research, its extent, its predictors, and its
      potential countermeasures are increasingly discussed. Recent reports and
      conferences highlight the potential strengths of animal study registries (ASRs)
      in this regard. Others have warned that prospective registration of animal
      studies could diminish creativity, add administrative burdens, and complicate
      intellectual property issues in translational research. A literature review and
      21 international key-informant interviews were conducted and thematically
      analyzed to develop a comprehensive matrix of main- and subcategories for
      potential ASR-related strengths, weaknesses, facilitators, and barriers (SWFBs). 
      We identified 130 potential SWFBs. All stakeholder groups agreed that ASRs could 
      in various ways improve the quality and refinement of animal studies while
      allowing their number to be reduced, as well as supporting meta-research on
      animal studies. However, all stakeholder groups also highlighted the potential
      for theft of ideas, higher administrative burdens, and reduced creativity and
      serendipity in animal studies. Much more detailed reasoning was captured in the
      interviews than is currently found in the literature, providing a comprehensive
      account of the issues and arguments around ASRs. All stakeholder groups
      highlighted compelling potential strengths of ASRs. Although substantial
      weaknesses and implementation barriers were highlighted as well, different
      governance measures might help to minimize or even eliminate their impact. Such
      measures might include confidentiality time frames for accessing prospectively
      registered protocols, harmonized reporting requirements across ASRs, ethics
      reviews, lab notebooks, and journal submissions. The comprehensive information
      gathered in this study could help to guide a more evidence-based debate and to
      design pilot tests for ASRs.

      Conclusions.
PG  - e2000995
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000995 [doi]
AB  - We can regard the wider incentive structures that operate across science, such as
      the priority given to novel findings, as an ecosystem within which scientists
      strive to maximise their fitness (i.e., publication record and career success).
      Here, we develop an optimality model that predicts the most rational research
      strategy, in terms of the proportion of research effort spent on seeking novel
      results rather than on confirmatory studies, and the amount of research effort
      per exploratory study. We show that, for parameter values derived from the
      scientific literature, researchers acting to maximise their fitness should spend 
      most of their effort seeking novel results and conduct small studies that have
      only 10%-40% statistical power. As a result, half of the studies they publish
      will report erroneous conclusions. Current incentive structures are in conflict
      with maximising the scientific value of research; we suggest ways that the
      scientific ecosystem could be improved.

TI  - Approach-Induced Biases in Human Information Sampling.
PG  - e2000638
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000638 [doi]
AB  - Information sampling is often biased towards seeking evidence that confirms one's
      prior beliefs. Despite such biases being a pervasive feature of human behavior,
      their underlying causes remain unclear. Many accounts of these biases appeal to
      limitations of human hypothesis testing and cognition, de facto evoking notions
      of bounded rationality, but neglect more basic aspects of behavioral control.
      Here, we investigated a potential role for Pavlovian approach in biasing which
      information humans will choose to sample. We collected a large novel dataset from
      32,445 human subjects, making over 3 million decisions, who played a gambling
      task designed to measure the latent causes and extent of information-sampling
      biases. We identified three novel approach-related biases, formalized by
      comparing subject behavior to a dynamic programming model of optimal information 
      gathering. These biases reflected the amount of information sampled ("positive
      evidence approach"), the selection of which information to sample ("sampling the 
      favorite"), and the interaction between information sampling and subsequent
      choices ("rejecting unsampled options"). The prevalence of all three biases was
      related to a Pavlovian approach-avoid parameter quantified within an entirely
      independent economic decision task. Our large dataset also revealed that
      individual differences in the amount of information gathered are a stable trait
      across multiple gameplays and can be related to demographic measures, including
      age and educational attainment. As well as revealing limitations in cognitive
      processing, our findings suggest information sampling biases reflect the
      expression of primitive, yet potentially ecologically adaptive, behavioral
      repertoires. One such behavior is sampling from options that will eventually be
      chosen, even when other sources of information are more pertinent for guiding
      future action.

TI  - Modifiers of the Genotype-Phenotype Map: Hsp90 and Beyond.
PG  - e2001015
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2001015 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of certain genes alters the heritable phenotypic variation among
      individuals. Research on the chaperone Hsp90 has played a central role in
      determining the genetic basis of this phenomenon, which may be important to
      evolution and disease. Key studies have shown that Hsp90 perturbation modifies
      the effects of many genetic variants throughout the genome. These modifications
      collectively transform the genotype-phenotype map, often resulting in a net
      increase or decrease in heritable phenotypic variation. Here, we summarize some
      of the foundational work on Hsp90 that led to these insights, discuss a framework
      for interpreting this research that is centered upon the standard genetics
      concept of epistasis, and propose major questions that future studies in this
      area should address.

AB  - BioEYES, a nonprofit outreach program using zebrafish to excite and educate K-12 
      students about science and how to think and act like scientists, has been
      integrated into hundreds of under-resourced schools since 2002. During the
      week-long experiments, students raise zebrafish embryos to learn principles of
      development and genetics. We have analyzed 19,463 participating students' pre-
      and post-tests within the program to examine their learning growth and attitude
      changes towards science. We found that at all grade levels, BioEYES effectively
      increased students' content knowledge and produced favorable shifts in students' 
      attitudes about science. These outcomes were especially pronounced in younger
      students. Having served over 100,000 students, we find that our method for
      providing student-centered experiences and developing long-term partnerships with
      teachers is essential for the growth and sustainability of outreach and school
      collaborations.

TI  - Plasticity in Single Axon Glutamatergic Connection to GABAergic Interneurons
      Regulates Complex Events in the Human Neocortex.
PG  - e2000237
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000237 [doi]
AB  - In the human neocortex, single excitatory pyramidal cells can elicit very large
      glutamatergic EPSPs (VLEs) in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons capable of
      triggering their firing with short (3-5 ms) delay. Similar strong excitatory
      connections between two individual neurons have not been found in nonhuman
      cortices, suggesting that these synapses are specific to human interneurons. The 
      VLEs are crucial for generating neocortical complex events, observed as single
      pyramidal cell spike-evoked discharge of cell assemblies in the frontal and
      temporal cortices. However, long-term plasticity of the VLE connections and how
      the plasticity modulates neocortical complex events has not been studied. Using
      triple and dual whole-cell recordings from synaptically connected human
      neocortical layers 2-3 neurons, we show that VLEs in fast-spiking GABAergic
      interneurons exhibit robust activity-induced long-term depression (LTD). The LTD 
      by single pyramidal cell 40 Hz spike bursts is specific to connections with VLEs,
      requires group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, and has a presynaptic
      mechanism. The LTD of VLE connections alters suprathreshold activation of
      interneurons in the complex events suppressing the discharge of fast-spiking
      GABAergic cells. The VLEs triggering the complex events may contribute to
      cognitive processes in the human neocortex, and their long-term plasticity can
      alter the discharging cortical cell assemblies by learning.

TI  - Prefrontal Markers and Cognitive Performance Are Dissociated during Progressive
      Dopamine Lesion.
PG  - e1002576
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002576 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine is thought to directly influence the neurophysiological mechanisms of
      both performance monitoring and cognitive control-two processes that are
      critically linked in the production of adapted behaviour. Changing dopamine
      levels are also thought to induce cognitive changes in several neurological and
      psychiatric conditions. But the working model of this system as a whole remains
      untested. Specifically, although many researchers assume that changing dopamine
      levels modify neurophysiological mechanisms and their markers in frontal cortex, 
      and that this in turn leads to cognitive changes, this causal chain needs to be
      verified. Using longitudinal recordings of frontal neurophysiological markers
      over many months during progressive dopaminergic lesion in non-human primates, we
      provide data that fail to support a simple interaction between dopamine, frontal 
      function, and cognition. Feedback potentials, which are performance-monitoring
      signals sometimes thought to drive successful control, ceased to differentiate
      feedback valence at the end of the lesion, just before clinical motor threshold. 
      In contrast, cognitive control performance and beta oscillatory markers of
      cognitive control were unimpaired by the lesion. The differing dynamics of these 
      measures throughout a dopamine lesion suggests they are not all driven by
      dopamine in the same way. These dynamics also demonstrate that a complex
      non-linear set of mechanisms is engaged in the brain in response to a progressive
      dopamine lesion. These results question the direct causal chain from dopamine to 
      frontal physiology and on to cognition. They imply that biomarkers of cognitive
      functions are not directly predictive of dopamine loss.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002573 [doi]
AB  - Collaboration plays an increasingly important role in promoting research
      productivity and impact. What remains unclear is whether female and male
      researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM)
      disciplines differ in their collaboration propensity. Here, we report on an
      empirical analysis of the complete publication records of 3,980 faculty members
      in six STEM disciplines at select U.S. research universities. We find that female
      faculty have significantly fewer distinct co-authors over their careers than
      males, but that this difference can be fully accounted for by females' lower
      publication rate and shorter career lengths. Next, we find that female scientists
      have a lower probability of repeating previous co-authors than males, an
      intriguing result because prior research shows that teams involving new
      collaborations produce work with higher impact. Finally, we find evidence for
      gender segregation in some sub-disciplines in molecular biology, in particular in
      genomics where we find female faculty to be clearly under-represented.

TI  - Beyond Our Borders? Public Resistance to Global Genomic Data Sharing.
PG  - e2000206
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000206 [doi]
AB  - Prospects have never seemed better for a truly global approach to science to
      improve human health, with leaders of national initiatives laying out their
      vision of a worldwide network of related projects. An extensive literature
      addresses obstacles to global genomic data sharing, yet a series of public polls 
      suggests that the scientific community may be overlooking a significant barrier: 
      potential public resistance to data sharing across national borders. In several
      large United States surveys, university researchers in other countries were
      deemed the least acceptable group of data users, and a just-completed US survey
      found a marked increase in privacy and security concerns related to data access
      by non-US researchers. Furthermore, diminished support for sharing beyond
      national borders is not unique to the US, although the limited data from outside

AB  - Biodiversity today is huge, and it has a long history. Identifying rules for the 
      heterogeneity of modern biodiversity-the high to low species richness of
      different clades-has been hard. There are measurable biodiversity differences
      between land and sea and between the tropics and temperate-polar regions. Some
      analyses suggest that the net age of a clade can determine its extinction risk,
      but this is equivocal. New work shows that, through geological time, clades pass 
      through different diversification regimes, and those regimes constrain the
      balance of tree size and the nature of branching events.

TI  - Brain Connectivity Predicts Placebo Response across Chronic Pain Clinical Trials.
PG  - e1002570
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002570 [doi]
AB  - Placebo response in the clinical trial setting is poorly understood and alleged
      to be driven by statistical confounds, and its biological underpinnings are
      questioned. Here we identified and validated that clinical placebo response is
      predictable from resting-state functional magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) brain
      connectivity. This also led to discovering a brain region predicting active drug 
      response and demonstrating the adverse effect of active drug interfering with
      placebo analgesia. Chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain patients (n = 56)
      underwent pretreatment brain scans in two clinical trials. Study 1 (n = 17) was a
      2-wk single-blinded placebo pill trial. Study 2 (n = 39) was a 3-mo
      double-blinded randomized trial comparing placebo pill to duloxetine. Study 3,
      which was conducted in additional knee OA pain patients (n = 42), was
      observational. fMRI-derived brain connectivity maps in study 1 were contrasted
      between placebo responders and nonresponders and compared to healthy controls (n 
      = 20). Study 2 validated the primary biomarker and identified a brain region
      predicting drug response. In both studies, approximately half of the participants
      exhibited analgesia with placebo treatment. In study 1, right midfrontal gyrus
      connectivity best identified placebo responders. In study 2, the same measure
      identified placebo responders (95% correct) and predicted the magnitude of
      placebo's effectiveness. By subtracting away linearly modeled placebo analgesia
      from duloxetine response, we uncovered in 6/19 participants a tendency of
      duloxetine enhancing predicted placebo response, while in another 6/19, we
      uncovered a tendency for duloxetine to diminish it. Moreover, the approach led to
      discovering that right parahippocampus gyrus connectivity predicts drug analgesia
      after correcting for modeled placebo-related analgesia. Our evidence is
      consistent with clinical placebo response having biological underpinnings and
      shows that the method can also reveal that active treatment in some patients
      diminishes modeled placebo-related analgesia. Trial Registration

AB  - Retinal prosthesis technologies require that the visual system downstream of the 
      retinal circuitry be capable of transmitting and elaborating visual signals. We
      studied the capability of plastic remodeling in late blind subjects implanted
      with the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis with psychophysics and functional MRI
      (fMRI). After surgery, six out of seven retinitis pigmentosa (RP) blind subjects 
      were able to detect high-contrast stimuli using the prosthetic implant. However, 
      direction discrimination to contrast modulated stimuli remained at chance level
      in all of them. No subject showed any improvement of contrast sensitivity in
      either eye when not using the Argus II. Before the implant, the Blood Oxygenation
      Level Dependent (BOLD) activity in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
      was very weak or absent. Surprisingly, after prolonged use of Argus II, BOLD
      responses to visual input were enhanced. This is, to our knowledge, the first
      study tracking the neural changes of visual areas in patients after retinal
      implant, revealing a capacity to respond to restored visual input even after
      years of deprivation.

TI  - STAT2 Is a Pervasive Cytokine Regulator due to Its Inhibition of STAT1 in
      Multiple Signaling Pathways.
PG  - e2000117
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000117 [doi]
AB  - STAT2 is the quintessential transcription factor for type 1 interferons (IFNs),
      where it functions as a heterodimer with STAT1. However, the human and murine
      STAT2-deficient phenotypes suggest important additional and currently
      unidentified type 1 IFN-independent activities. Here, we show that STAT2
      constitutively bound to STAT1, but not STAT3, via a conserved interface. While
      this interaction was irrelevant for type 1 interferon signaling and STAT1
      activation, it precluded the nuclear translocation specifically of STAT1 in
      response to IFN-gamma, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-27. This is explained by the 
      dimerization between activated STAT1 and unphosphorylated STAT2, whereby the
      semiphosphorylated dimers adopted a conformation incapable of importin-alpha
      binding. This, in turn, substantially attenuated cardinal IFN-gamma responses,
      including MHC expression, senescence, and antiparasitic immunity, and shifted the
      transcriptional output of IL-27 from STAT1 to STAT3. Our results uncover STAT2 as
      a pervasive cytokine regulator due to its inhibition of STAT1 in multiple
      signaling pathways and provide an understanding of the type 1
      interferon-independent activities of this protein.

TI  - snRNA 3' End Processing by a CPSF73-Containing Complex Essential for Development 
      in Arabidopsis.
PG  - e1002571
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002571 [doi]
AB  - Uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are the basal components of the
      spliceosome and play essential roles in splicing. The biogenesis of the majority 
      of snRNAs involves 3' end endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent transcript from
      the elongating DNA-dependent RNA ploymerase II. However, the protein factors
      responsible for this process remain elusive in plants. Here, we show that
      DEFECTIVE in snRNA PROCESSING 1 (DSP1) is an essential protein for snRNA 3' end
      maturation in Arabidopsis. A hypomorphic dsp1-1 mutation causes pleiotropic
      developmental defects, impairs the 3' end processing of snRNAs, increases the
      levels of snRNA primary transcripts (pre-snRNAs), and alters the occupancy of Pol
      II at snRNA loci. In addition, DSP1 binds snRNA loci and interacts with Pol-II in
      a DNA/RNA-dependent manner. We further show that DSP1 forms a conserved complex, 
      which contains at least four additional proteins, to catalyze snRNA 3' end
      maturation in Arabidopsis. The catalytic component of this complex is likely the 
      cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73 kDa-I (CSPF73-I), which is the
      nuclease cleaving the pre-mRNA 3' end. However, the DSP1 complex does not affect 
      pre-mRNA 3' end cleavage, suggesting that plants may use different
      CPSF73-I-containing complexes to process snRNAs and pre-mRNAs. This study
      identifies a complex responsible for the snRNA 3' end maturation in plants and
      uncovers a previously unknown function of CPSF73 in snRNA maturation.

TI  - Relative Contributions of Specific Activity Histories and Spontaneous Processes
      to Size Remodeling of Glutamatergic Synapses.
PG  - e1002572
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002572 [doi]
AB  - The idea that synaptic properties are defined by specific pre- and postsynaptic
      activity histories is one of the oldest and most influential tenets of
      contemporary neuroscience. Recent studies also indicate, however, that synaptic
      properties often change spontaneously, even in the absence of specific activity
      patterns or any activity whatsoever. What, then, are the relative contributions
      of activity history-dependent and activity history-independent processes to
      changes synapses undergo? To compare the relative contributions of these
      processes, we imaged, in spontaneously active networks of cortical neurons,
      glutamatergic synapses formed between the same axons and neurons or dendrites
      under the assumption that their similar activity histories should result in
      similar size changes over timescales of days. The size covariance of such
      commonly innervated (CI) synapses was then compared to that of synapses formed by
      different axons (non-CI synapses) that differed in their activity histories. We
      found that the size covariance of CI synapses was greater than that of non-CI
      synapses; yet overall size covariance of CI synapses was rather modest. Moreover,
      momentary and time-averaged sizes of CI synapses correlated rather poorly, in
      perfect agreement with published electron microscopy-based measurements of mouse 
      cortex synapses. A conservative estimate suggested that ~40% of the observed size
      remodeling was attributable to specific activity histories, whereas ~10% and ~50%
      were attributable to cell-wide and spontaneous, synapse-autonomous processes,
      respectively. These findings demonstrate that histories of naturally occurring
      activity patterns can direct glutamatergic synapse remodeling but also suggest
      that the contributions of spontaneous, possibly stochastic, processes are at
      least as great.

TI  - Selection Transforms the Landscape of Genetic Variation Interacting with Hsp90.
PG  - e2000465
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000465 [doi]
AB  - The protein-folding chaperone Hsp90 has been proposed to buffer the phenotypic
      effects of mutations. The potential for Hsp90 and other putative buffers to
      increase robustness to mutation has had major impact on disease models,
      quantitative genetics, and evolutionary theory. But Hsp90 sometimes contradicts
      expectations for a buffer by potentiating rapid phenotypic changes that would
      otherwise not occur. Here, we quantify Hsp90's ability to buffer or potentiate
      (i.e., diminish or enhance) the effects of genetic variation on single-cell
      morphological features in budding yeast. We corroborate reports that Hsp90 tends 
      to buffer the effects of standing genetic variation in natural populations.
      However, we demonstrate that Hsp90 tends to have the opposite effect on genetic
      variation that has experienced reduced selection pressure. Specifically, Hsp90
      tends to enhance, rather than diminish, the effects of spontaneous mutations and 
      recombinations. This result implies that Hsp90 does not make phenotypes more
      robust to the effects of genetic perturbation. Instead, natural selection
      preferentially allows buffered alleles to persist and thereby creates the false
      impression that Hsp90 confers greater robustness.

TI  - Enrichment of Phosphatidylethanolamine in Viral Replication Compartments via
      Co-opting the Endosomal Rab5 Small GTPase by a Positive-Strand RNA Virus.
PG  - e2000128
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000128 [doi]
AB  - Positive-strand RNA viruses build extensive membranous replication compartments
      to support replication and protect the virus from antiviral responses by the
      host. These viruses require host factors and various lipids to form viral
      replication complexes (VRCs). The VRCs built by Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV)
      are enriched with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a previously unknown
      pathway. To unravel the mechanism of PE enrichment within the TBSV replication
      compartment, in this paper, the authors demonstrate that TBSV co-opts the
      guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound active form of the endosomal Rab5 small GTPase
      via direct interaction with the viral replication protein. Deletion of Rab5
      orthologs in a yeast model host or expression of dominant negative mutants of
      plant Rab5 greatly decreases TBSV replication and prevents the redistribution of 
      PE to the sites of viral replication. We also show that enrichment of PE in the
      viral replication compartment is assisted by actin filaments. Interestingly, the 
      closely related Carnation Italian ringspot virus, which replicates on the
      boundary membrane of mitochondria, uses a similar strategy to the peroxisomal
      TBSV to hijack the Rab5-positive endosomes into the viral replication
      compartments. Altogether, usurping the GTP-Rab5-positive endosomes allows TBSV to
      build a PE-enriched viral replication compartment, which is needed to support
      peak-level replication. Thus, the Rab family of small GTPases includes critical
      host factors assisting VRC assembly and genesis of the viral replication
      compartment.

TI  - Human Germline Mutation and the Erratic Evolutionary Clock.
PG  - e2000744
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000744 [doi]
AB  - Our understanding of the chronology of human evolution relies on the "molecular
      clock" provided by the steady accumulation of substitutions on an evolutionary
      lineage. Recent analyses of human pedigrees have called this understanding into
      question by revealing unexpectedly low germline mutation rates, which imply that 
      substitutions accrue more slowly than previously believed. Translating mutation
      rates estimated from pedigrees into substitution rates is not as straightforward 
      as it may seem, however. We dissect the steps involved, emphasizing that dating
      evolutionary events requires not "a mutation rate" but a precise characterization
      of how mutations accumulate in development in males and females-knowledge that
      remains elusive.

      Context Dependence.
PG  - e2000891
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000891 [doi]
AB  - Life on earth is enormously diverse, in part because each individual engages in
      countless interactions with its biotic and abiotic environment during its
      lifetime. Not only are there many such interactions, but any given interaction of
      each individual with, say, its neighbor or a nutrient could lead to a different
      effect on its fitness and on the dynamics of the population of which it is a
      member. Predicting those effects is an enduring challenge to the field of
      ecology. Using a simple laboratory system, Hoek and colleagues present evidence
      that resource availability can be a primary driver of variation between
      interactions. Their results suggest that a complex continuum of interaction
      outcomes can result from the simple combined effects of nutrient availability and
      density-dependent population dynamics. The future is rich with potential to
      integrate tractable experimental systems like theirs with hypotheses derived from
      studies of interactions in natural communities.

PG  - e2000827
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000827 [doi]
AB  - Lymph nodes are meeting points for circulating immune cells. A network of
      reticular cells that ensheathe a mesh of collagen fibers crisscrosses the tissue 
      in each lymph node. This reticular cell network distributes key molecules and
      provides a structure for immune cells to move around on. During infections, the
      network can suffer damage. A new study has now investigated the network's
      structure in detail, using methods from graph theory. The study showed that the
      network is remarkably robust to damage: it can still support immune responses
      even when half of the reticular cells are destroyed. This is a further important 
      example of how network connectivity achieves tolerance to failure, a property
      shared with other important biological and nonbiological networks.

AB  - What cortical inputs are provided to motor control areas while they drive complex
      learned behaviors? We study this question in the nucleus interface of the
      nidopallium (NIf), which is required for normal birdsong production and provides 
      the main source of auditory input to HVC, the driver of adult song. In juvenile
      and adult zebra finches, we find that spikes in NIf projection neurons precede
      vocalizations by several tens of milliseconds and are insensitive to distortions 
      of auditory feedback. We identify a local isometry between NIf output and
      vocalizations: quasi-identical notes produced in different syllables are preceded
      by highly similar NIf spike patterns. NIf multiunit firing during song precedes
      responses in auditory cortical neurons by about 50 ms, revealing delayed
      congruence between NIf spiking and a neural representation of auditory feedback. 
      Our findings suggest that NIf codes for imminent acoustic events within vocal

TI  - Large Variations in HIV-1 Viral Load Explained by Shifting-Mosaic Metapopulation 
      Dynamics.
PG  - e1002567
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002567 [doi]
AB  - The viral population of HIV-1, like many pathogens that cause systemic infection,
      is structured and differentiated within the body. The dynamics of cellular immune
      trafficking through the blood and within compartments of the body has also
      received wide attention. Despite these advances, mathematical models, which are
      widely used to interpret and predict viral and immune dynamics in infection,
      typically treat the infected host as a well-mixed homogeneous environment. Here, 
      we present mathematical, analytical, and computational results that demonstrate
      that consideration of the spatial structure of the viral population within the
      host radically alters predictions of previous models. We study the dynamics of
      virus replication and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) within a metapopulation of
      spatially segregated patches, representing T cell areas connected by circulating 
      blood and lymph. The dynamics of the system depend critically on the interaction 
      between CTLs and infected cells at the within-patch level. We show that for a
      wide range of parameters, the system admits an unexpected outcome called the
      shifting-mosaic steady state. In this state, the whole body's viral population is
      stable over time, but the equilibrium results from an underlying, highly dynamic 
      process of local infection and clearance within T-cell centers. Notably, and in
      contrast to previous models, this new model can explain the large differences in 
      set-point viral load (SPVL) observed between patients and their distribution, as 
      well as the relatively low proportion of cells infected at any one time, and
      alters the predicted determinants of viral load variation.

TI  - Associative Mechanisms Allow for Social Learning and Cultural Transmission of
      String Pulling in an Insect.
PG  - e1002564
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002564 [doi]
AB  - Social insects make elaborate use of simple mechanisms to achieve seemingly
      complex behavior and may thus provide a unique resource to discover the basic
      cognitive elements required for culture, i.e., group-specific behaviors that
      spread from "innovators" to others in the group via social learning. We first
      explored whether bumblebees can learn a nonnatural object manipulation task by
      using string pulling to access a reward that was presented out of reach. Only a
      small minority "innovated" and solved the task spontaneously, but most bees were 
      able to learn to pull a string when trained in a stepwise manner. In addition,
      naive bees learnt the task by observing a trained demonstrator from a distance.
      Learning the behavior relied on a combination of simple associative mechanisms
      and trial-and-error learning and did not require "insight": naive bees failed a
      "coiled-string experiment," in which they did not receive instant visual feedback
      of the target moving closer when tugging on the string. In cultural diffusion
      experiments, the skill spread rapidly from a single knowledgeable individual to
      the majority of a colony's foragers. We observed that there were several
      sequential sets ("generations") of learners, so that previously naive observers
      could first acquire the technique by interacting with skilled individuals and,
      subsequently, themselves become demonstrators for the next "generation" of
      learners, so that the longevity of the skill in the population could outlast the 
      lives of informed foragers. This suggests that, so long as animals have a basic
      toolkit of associative and motor learning processes, the key ingredients for the 
      cultural spread of unusual skills are already in place and do not require
      sophisticated cognition.

AB  - The modern age of metagenomics has delivered unprecedented volumes of data
      describing the genetic and metabolic diversity of bacterial communities, but it
      has failed to provide information about coincident cellular morphologies. Much
      like metabolic and biosynthetic capabilities, morphology comprises a critical
      component of bacterial fitness, molded by natural selection into the many
      elaborate shapes observed across the bacterial domain. In this essay, we discuss 
      the diversity of bacterial morphology and its implications for understanding both
      the mechanistic and the adaptive basis of morphogenesis. We consider how best to 
      leverage genomic data and recent experimental developments in order to advance
      our understanding of bacterial shape and its functional importance.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002558 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive defects in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include socialization and
      communication: key behavioral capacities that separate humans from other species.
      Here, we analyze gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of 63 autism patients
      and control individuals, as well as 62 chimpanzees and macaques, from natal to
      adult age. We show that among all aberrant expression changes seen in ASD brains,
      a single aberrant expression pattern overrepresented in genes involved
      synaptic-related pathways is enriched in nucleotide variants linked to autism.
      Furthermore, only this pattern contains an excess of developmental expression
      features unique to humans, thus resulting in the disruption of human-specific
      developmental programs in autism. Several members of the early growth response
      (EGR) transcription factor family can be implicated in regulation of this
      aberrant developmental change. Our study draws a connection between the genetic
      risk architecture of autism and molecular features of cortical development unique
      to humans.

      Oncology.
PG  - e2000314

AB  - Cancer research has become a global enterprise, and the number of researchers, as
      well as the cost for their activities, has skyrocketed. The budget for the
      National Cancer Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health
      alone was US$5.2 billion in 2015. Since most of the research is funded by public 
      money, it is perfectly legitimate to ask if these large expenses are worth it. In
      this brief commentary, we recapitulate some of the breakthroughs that mark the
      history of breast cancer research over the past decades and emphasize the
      resulting benefits for afflicted women. In 1971, only 40% of women diagnosed with
      breast cancer would live another 10 years. Today, nearly 80% of women reach that 
      significant milestone in most developed countries. This dramatic change has
      afforded breast cancer patients many productive years and a better quality of
      life. Progress resulted largely from advances in the understanding of the
      molecular details of the disease and their translation into innovative,
      rationally designed therapies. These developments are founded on the revolution
      in molecular and cellular biology, an entirely new array of methods and
      technologies, the enthusiasm, optimism, and diligence of scientists and
      clinicians, and the considerable funding efforts from public and private sources.
      We were lucky to be able to spend our productive years in a period of scientific 
      upheaval in which methods and concepts were revolutionized and that allowed us to
      contribute, within the global scientific community, to the progress in basic
      science and clinical practice.

TI  - Spermidine Suppresses Age-Associated Memory Impairment by Preventing Adverse
      Increase of Presynaptic Active Zone Size and Release.
PG  - e1002563
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002563 [doi]
AB  - Memories are assumed to be formed by sets of synapses changing their structural
      or functional performance. The efficacy of forming new memories declines with
      advancing age, but the synaptic changes underlying age-induced memory impairment 
      remain poorly understood. Recently, we found spermidine feeding to specifically
      suppress age-dependent impairments in forming olfactory memories, providing a
      mean to search for synaptic changes involved in age-dependent memory impairment. 
      Here, we show that a specific synaptic compartment, the presynaptic active zone
      (AZ), increases the size of its ultrastructural elaboration and releases
      significantly more synaptic vesicles with advancing age. These age-induced AZ
      changes, however, were fully suppressed by spermidine feeding. A genetically
      enforced enlargement of AZ scaffolds (four gene-copies of BRP) impaired memory
      formation in young animals. Thus, in the Drosophila nervous system, aging AZs
      seem to steer towards the upper limit of their operational range, limiting
      synaptic plasticity and contributing to impairment of memory formation.
      Spermidine feeding suppresses age-dependent memory impairment by counteracting
      these age-dependent changes directly at the synapse.

TI  - Phosphorylation of Def Regulates Nucleolar p53 Turnover and Cell Cycle
      Progression through Def Recruitment of Calpain3.
PG  - e1002555
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002555 [doi]
AB  - Digestive organ expansion factor (Def) is a nucleolar protein that plays dual
      functions: it serves as a component of the ribosomal small subunit processome for
      the biogenesis of ribosomes and also mediates p53 degradation through the
      cysteine proteinase calpain-3 (CAPN3). However, nothing is known about the exact 
      relationship between Def and CAPN3 or the regulation of the Def function. In this
      report, we show that CAPN3 degrades p53 and its mutant proteins p53A138V,
      p53M237I, p53R248W, and p53R273P but not the p53R175H mutant protein.
      Importantly, we show that Def directly interacts with CAPN3 in the nucleoli and
      determines the nucleolar localisation of CAPN3, which is a prerequisite for the
      degradation of p53 in the nucleolus. Furthermore, we find that Def is modified by
      phosphorylation at five serine residues: S50, S58, S62, S87, and S92. We further 
      show that simultaneous phosphorylations at S87 and S92 facilitate the nucleolar
      localisation of Capn3 that is not only essential for the degradation of p53 but
      is also important for regulating cell cycle progression. Hence, we propose that
      the Def-CAPN3 pathway serves as a nucleolar checkpoint for cell proliferation by 
      selective inactivation of cell cycle-related substrates during organogenesis.

TI  - Dscam1 Forms a Complex with Robo1 and the N-Terminal Fragment of Slit to Promote 
      the Growth of Longitudinal Axons.
PG  - e1002560
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002560 [doi]
AB  - The Slit protein is a major midline repellent for central nervous system (CNS)
      axons. In vivo, Slit is proteolytically cleaved into N- and C-terminal fragments,
      but the biological significance of this is unknown. Analysis in the Drosophila
      ventral nerve cord of a slit allele (slit-UC) that cannot be cleaved revealed
      that midline repulsion is still present but longitudinal axon guidance is
      disrupted, particularly across segment boundaries. Double mutants for the Slit
      receptors Dscam1 and robo1 strongly resemble the slit-UC phenotype, suggesting
      they cooperate in longitudinal axon guidance, and through biochemical approaches,
      we found that Dscam1 and Robo1 form a complex dependent on Slit-N. In contrast,
      Robo1 binding alone shows a preference for full-length Slit, whereas Dscam1 only 
      binds Slit-N. Using a variety of transgenes, we demonstrated that Dscam1 appears 
      to modify the output of Robo/Slit complexes so that signaling is no longer
      repulsive. Our data suggest that the complex is promoting longitudinal axon
      growth across the segment boundary. The ability of Dscam1 to modify the output of
      other receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion may be a general principle for
      Dscam proteins.

TI  - EDA-Fibronectin Originating from Osteoblasts Inhibits the Immune Response against
      Cancer.
PG  - e1002562
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002562 [doi]
AB  - Osteoblasts lining the inner surface of bone support hematopoietic stem cell
      differentiation by virtue of proximity to the bone marrow. The osteoblasts also
      modify their own differentiation by producing various isoforms of fibronectin
      (FN). Despite evidence for immune regulation by osteoblasts, there is limited
      knowledge of how osteoblasts modulate cells of the immune system. Here, we show
      that extra domain A (EDA)-FN produced by osteoblasts increases arginase
      production in myeloid-derived cells, and we identify alpha5beta1 as the mediating
      receptor. In different mouse models of cancer, osteoblasts or EDA-FN was found to
      up-regulate arginase-1 expression in myeloid-derived cells, resulting in
      increased cancer growth. This harmful effect can be reduced by interfering with
      the integrin alpha5beta1 receptor or inhibiting arginase. Conversely, in tissue
      injury, the expression of arginase-1 is normally beneficial as it dampens the
      immune response to allow wound healing. We show that EDA-FN protects against
      excessive fibrotic tissue formation in a liver fibrosis model. Our results
      establish an immune regulatory function for EDA-FN originating from the
      osteoblasts and identify new avenues for enhancing the immune reaction against
      cancer.

      and gain-of-function mutations of this channel have been shown to cause inherited
      erythromelalgia (IEM) with neuropathic pain. In this study, we report a case of a
      severe phenotype of IEM caused by p.V1316A mutation in the Nav1.7 channel.
      Mechanistically, we first demonstrate that the Navbeta4 peptide acts as a gating 
      modifier rather than an open channel blocker competing with the inactivating
      peptide to give rise to resurgent currents in the Nav1.7 channel. Moreover, there
      are two distinct open and two corresponding fast inactivated states in the
      genesis of resurgent Na+ currents. One is responsible for the resurgent route and
      practically existent only in the presence of Navbeta4 peptide, whereas the other 
      is responsible for the "silent" route of recovery from inactivation. In this
      regard, the p.V1316A mutation makes hyperpolarization shift in the activation
      curve, and depolarization shift in the inactivation curve, vividly uncoupling
      inactivation from activation. In terms of molecular gating operation, the most
      important changes caused by the p.V1316A mutation are both acceleration of the
      transition from the inactivated states to the activated states and deceleration
      of the reverse transition, resulting in much larger sustained as well as
      resurgent Na+ currents. In summary, the genesis of the resurgent currents in the 
      Nav1.7 channel is ascribable to the transient existence of a distinct and novel
      open state promoted by the Navbeta4 peptide. In addition, S4-5 linker in domain
      III where V1316 is located seems to play a critical role in
      activation-inactivation coupling, chiefly via direct modulation of the
      transitional kinetics between the open and the inactivated states. The sustained 
      and resurgent Na+ currents may therefore be correlatively enhanced by specific
      mutations involving this linker and relevant regions, and thus marked
      hyperexcitability in corresponding neural tissues as well as IEM symptomatology.

TI  - Sam68 Is Required for DNA Damage Responses via Regulating Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
PG  - e1002543
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002543 [doi]
AB  - The rapid and robust synthesis of polymers of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose 
      (PAR) chains, primarily catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), is
      crucial for cellular responses to DNA damage. However, the precise mechanisms
      through which PARP1 is activated and PAR is robustly synthesized are not fully
      understood. Here, we identified Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa
      (Sam68) as a novel signaling molecule in DNA damage responses (DDRs). In the
      absence of Sam68, DNA damage-triggered PAR production and PAR-dependent DNA
      repair signaling were dramatically diminished. With serial cellular and
      biochemical assays, we demonstrated that Sam68 is recruited to and significantly 
      overlaps with PARP1 at DNA lesions and that the interaction between Sam68 and
      PARP1 is crucial for DNA damage-initiated and PARP1-conferred PAR production.
      Utilizing cell lines and knockout mice, we illustrated that Sam68-deleted cells
      and animals are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA-damaging agents.
      Together, our findings suggest that Sam68 plays a crucial role in DDR via
      regulating DNA damage-initiated PAR production.

AB  - Basic research on biodiversity has concentrated on individual species-naming new 
      species, studying distribution patterns, and analyzing their evolutionary
      relationships. Yet biodiversity is more than a collection of individual species; 
      it is the combination of biological entities and processes that support life on
      Earth. To understand biodiversity we must catalog it, but we must also assess the
      ways species interact with other species to provide functional support for the
      Tree of Life. Ecological interactions may be lost well before the species
      involved in those interactions go extinct; their ecological functions disappear
      even though they remain. Here, I address the challenges in studying the
      functional aspects of species interactions and how basic research is helping us
      address the fast-paced extinction of species due to human activities.

AB  - The mitochondrial ribosome, which translates all mitochondrial DNA
      (mtDNA)-encoded proteins, should be tightly regulated pre- and
      post-transcriptionally. Recently, we found RNA-DNA differences (RDDs) at human
      mitochondrial 16S (large) rRNA position 947 that were indicative of
      post-transcriptional modification. Here, we show that these 16S rRNA RDDs result 
      from a 1-methyladenosine (m1A) modification introduced by TRMT61B, thus being the
      first vertebrate methyltransferase that modifies both tRNA and rRNAs. m1A947 is
      conserved in humans and all vertebrates having adenine at the corresponding mtDNA
      position (90% of vertebrates). However, this mtDNA base is a thymine in 10% of
      the vertebrates and a guanine in the 23S rRNA of 95% of bacteria, suggesting
      alternative evolutionary solutions. m1A, uridine, or guanine may stabilize the
      local structure of mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Experimental assessment
      of genome-edited Escherichia coli showed that unmodified adenine caused impaired 
      protein synthesis and growth. Our findings revealed a conserved mechanism of rRNA
      modification that has been selected instead of DNA mutations to enable proper
      mitochondrial ribosome function.

AB  - The cerebral cortex retains its fundamental organization, layering, and
      input-output relations as it scales in volume over many orders of magnitude in
      mammals. How is its network architecture affected by size scaling? By comparing
      network organization of the mouse and rhesus macaque cortical connectome derived 
      from complete neuroanatomical tracing studies, a recent study in PLOS Biology
      shows that an exponential distance rule emerges that reveals the falloff in
      connection probability with distance in the two brains that in turn determines
      common organizational features.

AB  - The lack of effective and well-tolerated therapies against antibiotic-resistant
      bacteria is a global public health problem leading to prolonged treatment and
      increased mortality. To improve the efficacy of existing antibiotic compounds, we
      introduce a new method for strategically inducing antibiotic hypersensitivity in 
      pathogenic bacteria. Following the systematic verification that the AcrAB-TolC
      efflux system is one of the major determinants of the intrinsic antibiotic
      resistance levels in Escherichia coli, we have developed a short antisense
      oligomer designed to inhibit the expression of acrA and increase antibiotic
      susceptibility in E. coli. By employing this strategy, we can inhibit E. coli
      growth using 2- to 40-fold lower antibiotic doses, depending on the antibiotic
      compound utilized. The sensitizing effect of the antisense oligomer is highly
      specific to the targeted gene's sequence, which is conserved in several bacterial
      genera, and the oligomer does not have any detectable toxicity against human
      cells. Finally, we demonstrate that antisense oligomers improve the efficacy of
      antibiotic combinations, allowing the combined use of even antagonistic
      antibiotic pairs that are typically not favored due to their reduced activities.

AB  - Pattern classification of human brain activity provides unique insight into the
      neural underpinnings of diverse mental states. These multivariate tools have
      recently been used within the field of affective neuroscience to classify
      distributed patterns of brain activation evoked during emotion induction
      procedures. Here we assess whether neural models developed to discriminate among 
      distinct emotion categories exhibit predictive validity in the absence of
      exteroceptive emotional stimulation. In two experiments, we show that spontaneous
      fluctuations in human resting-state brain activity can be decoded into categories
      of experience delineating unique emotional states that exhibit spatiotemporal
      coherence, covary with individual differences in mood and personality traits, and
      predict on-line, self-reported feelings. These findings validate objective,
      brain-based models of emotion and show how emotional states dynamically emerge
      from the activity of separable neural systems.

TI  - Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Cascade MKK7-MPK6 Plays Important Roles in Plant
      Development and Regulates Shoot Branching by Phosphorylating PIN1 in Arabidopsis.
PG  - e1002550
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002550 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidences exhibit that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/MPK)
      signaling pathways are connected with many aspects of plant development. The
      complexity of MAPK cascades raises challenges not only to identify the MAPK
      module in planta but also to define the specific role of an individual module. So
      far, our knowledge of MAPK signaling has been largely restricted to a small
      subset of MAPK cascades. Our previous study has characterized an Arabidopsis
      bushy and dwarf1 (bud1) mutant, in which the MAP Kinase Kinase 7 (MKK7) was
      constitutively activated, resulting in multiple phenotypic alterations. In this
      study, we found that MPK3 and MPK6 are the substrates for phosphorylation by MKK7
      in planta. Genetic analysis showed that MKK7-MPK6 cascade is specifically
      responsible for the regulation of shoot branching, hypocotyl gravitropism,
      filament elongation, and lateral root formation, while MKK7-MPK3 cascade is
      mainly involved in leaf morphology. We further demonstrated that the MKK7-MPK6
      cascade controls shoot branching by phosphorylating Ser 337 on PIN1, which
      affects the basal localization of PIN1 in xylem parenchyma cells and polar auxin 
      transport in the primary stem. Our results not only specify the functions of the 
      MKK7-MPK6 cascade but also reveal a novel mechanism for PIN1 phosphorylation,
      establishing a molecular link between the MAPK cascade and auxin-regulated plant 
      development.

      Emotional States.
PG  - e1002546
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002546 [doi]
AB  - In human studies, how averaged activation in a brain region relates to human
      behavior has been extensively investigated. This approach has led to the finding 
      that positive and negative facial preferences are represented by different brain 
      regions. However, using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) decoded
      neurofeedback (DecNef) method, we found that different patterns of neural
      activations within the cingulate cortex (CC) play roles in representing opposite 
      directions of facial preference. In the present study, while neutrally preferred 
      faces were presented, multi-voxel activation patterns in the CC that corresponded
      to higher (or lower) preference were repeatedly induced by fMRI DecNef. As a
      result, previously neutrally preferred faces became more (or less) preferred. We 
      conclude that a different activation pattern in the CC, rather than averaged
      activation in a different area, represents and suffices to determine positive or 
      negative facial preference. This new approach may reveal the importance of an
      activation pattern within a brain region in many cognitive functions.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002544 [doi]
AB  - Under natural conditions, animals encounter a barrage of sensory information from
      which they must select and interpret biologically relevant signals. Active
      sensing can facilitate this process by engaging motor systems in the sampling of 
      sensory information. The echolocating bat serves as an excellent model to
      investigate the coupling between action and sensing because it adaptively
      controls both the acoustic signals used to probe the environment and movements to
      receive echoes at the auditory periphery. We report here that the echolocating
      bat controls the features of its sonar vocalizations in tandem with the
      positioning of the outer ears to maximize acoustic cues for target detection and 
      localization. The bat's adaptive control of sonar vocalizations and ear
      positioning occurs on a millisecond timescale to capture spatial information from
      arriving echoes, as well as on a longer timescale to track target movement. Our
      results demonstrate that purposeful control over sonar sound production and
      reception can serve to improve acoustic cues for localization tasks. This finding
      also highlights the general importance of movement to sensory processing across
      animal species. Finally, our discoveries point to important parallels between
      spatial perception by echolocation and vision.

AB  - Congenital heart defects (CHDs) affect 2%-3% of newborns and remain challenging
      clinically. There is an ongoing project to elucidate the causes of CHDs, focusing
      primarily on genetics as dictated by the epidemiology. In a paper published in
      this issue, Santos and colleagues describe studies of Cornelia de Lange
      syndrome-associated secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs) caused by NIPBL
      mutations, undertaken with a targeted trapping allele in mice. They show that
      Nipbl haploinsufficiency in either of two cell populations was sufficient to
      engender ASDs but that expression solely in either one of those populations was
      sufficient to rescue them. This work provides novel insights into incomplete
      penetrance and oligogenic effects underlying CHDs.

TI  - Conditional Creation and Rescue of Nipbl-Deficiency in Mice Reveals Multiple
      Determinants of Risk for Congenital Heart Defects.
PG  - e2000197
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000197 [doi]
AB  - Elucidating the causes of congenital heart defects is made difficult by the
      complex morphogenesis of the mammalian heart, which takes place early in
      development, involves contributions from multiple germ layers, and is controlled 
      by many genes. Here, we use a conditional/invertible genetic strategy to identify
      the cell lineage(s) responsible for the development of heart defects in a
      Nipbl-deficient mouse model of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, in which global yet
      subtle transcriptional dysregulation leads to development of atrial septal
      defects (ASDs) at high frequency. Using an approach that allows for
      recombinase-mediated creation or rescue of Nipbl deficiency in different
      lineages, we uncover complex interactions between the cardiac mesoderm, endoderm,
      and the rest of the embryo, whereby the risk conferred by genetic abnormality in 
      any one lineage is modified, in a surprisingly non-additive way, by the status of
      others. We argue that these results are best understood in the context of a model
      in which the risk of heart defects is associated with the adequacy of early
      progenitor cell populations relative to the sizes of the structures they must
      eventually form.

TI  - Sexual Fate Change of XX Germ Cells Caused by the Deletion of SMAD4 and STRA8
      Independent of Somatic Sex Reprogramming.
PG  - e1002553
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002553 [doi]
AB  - The differential programming of sperm and eggs in gonads is a fundamental topic
      in reproductive biology. Although the sexual fate of germ cells is believed to be
      determined by signaling factors from sexually differentiated somatic cells in
      fetal gonads, the molecular mechanism that determines germ cell fate is poorly
      understood. Herein, we show that mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4
      (SMAD4) in germ cells is required for female-type differentiation. Germ cells in 
      Smad4-deficient ovaries respond to retinoic acid signaling but fail to undergo
      meiotic prophase I, which coincides with the weaker expression of genes required 
      for follicular formation, indicating that SMAD4 signaling is essential for oocyte
      differentiation and meiotic progression. Intriguingly, germline-specific deletion
      of Smad4 in Stra8-null female germ cells resulted in the up-regulation of genes
      required for male gonocyte differentiation, including Nanos2 and PLZF, suggesting
      the initiation of male-type differentiation in ovaries. Moreover, our
      transcriptome analyses of mutant ovaries revealed that the sex change phenotype
      is achieved without global gene expression changes in somatic cells. Our results 
      demonstrate that SMAD4 and STRA8 are essential factors that regulate the female
      fate of germ cells.

PG  - e1002542
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002542 [doi]
AB  - Citation metrics are increasingly used to appraise published research. One
      challenge is whether and how to normalize these metrics to account for
      differences across scientific fields, age (year of publication), type of
      document, database coverage, and other factors. We discuss the pros and cons for 
      normalizations using different approaches. Additional challenges emerge when
      citation metrics need to be combined across multiple papers to appraise the
      corpus of scientists, institutions, journals, or countries, as well as when
      trying to attribute credit in multiauthored papers. Different citation metrics
      may offer complementary insights, but one should carefully consider the
      assumptions that underlie their calculation.

TI  - Relative Citation Ratio (RCR): A New Metric That Uses Citation Rates to Measure
      Influence at the Article Level.
PG  - e1002541
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541 [doi]
AB  - Despite their recognized limitations, bibliometric assessments of scientific
      productivity have been widely adopted. We describe here an improved method to
      quantify the influence of a research article by making novel use of its
      co-citation network to field-normalize the number of citations it has received.
      Article citation rates are divided by an expected citation rate that is derived
      from performance of articles in the same field and benchmarked to a peer
      comparison group. The resulting Relative Citation Ratio is article level and
      field independent and provides an alternative to the invalid practice of using
      journal impact factors to identify influential papers. To illustrate one
      application of our method, we analyzed 88,835 articles published between 2003 and
      2010 and found that the National Institutes of Health awardees who authored those
      papers occupy relatively stable positions of influence across all disciplines. We
      demonstrate that the values generated by this method strongly correlate with the 
      opinions of subject matter experts in biomedical research and suggest that the
      same approach should be generally applicable to articles published in all areas
      of science. A beta version of iCite, our web tool for calculating Relative
      Citation Ratios of articles listed in PubMed, is available at
      https://icite.od.nih.gov.

TI  - Epithelial Tumors Originate in Tumor Hotspots, a Tissue-Intrinsic
      Microenvironment.
PG  - e1002537
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002537 [doi]
AB  - Malignant tumors are caused by uncontrolled proliferation of transformed mutant
      cells that have lost the ability to maintain tissue integrity. Although a number 
      of causative genetic backgrounds for tumor development have been discovered, the 
      initial steps mutant cells take to escape tissue integrity and trigger
      tumorigenesis remain elusive. Here, we show through analysis of conserved
      neoplastic tumor-suppressor genes (nTSGs) in Drosophila wing imaginal disc
      epithelia that tumor initiation depends on tissue-intrinsic local
      cytoarchitectures, causing tumors to consistently originate in a specific region 
      of the tissue. In this "tumor hotspot" where cells constitute a network of robust
      structures on their basal side, nTSG-deficient cells delaminate from the apical
      side of the epithelium and begin tumorigenic overgrowth by exploiting endogenous 
      Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
      signaling activity. Conversely, in other regions, the "tumor coldspot"
      nTSG-deficient cells are extruded toward the basal side and undergo apoptosis.
      When the direction of delamination is reversed through suppression of RhoGEF2, an
      activator of the Rho family small GTPases, and JAK/STAT is activated ectopically 
      in these coldspot nTSG-deficient cells, tumorigenesis is induced. These data
      indicate that two independent processes, apical delamination and JAK/STAT
      activation, are concurrently required for the initiation of
      nTSG-deficient-induced tumorigenesis. Given the conservation of the epithelial
      cytoarchitecture, tumorigenesis may be generally initiated from tumor hotspots by
      a similar mechanism.

TI  - Drosophila Wnt and STAT Define Apoptosis-Resistant Epithelial Cells for Tissue
      Regeneration after Irradiation.
PG  - e1002536
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002536 [doi]
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster larvae irradiated with doses of ionizing radiation (IR)
      that kill about half of the cells in larval imaginal discs still develop into
      viable adults. How surviving cells compensate for IR-induced cell death to
      produce organs of normal size and appearance remains an active area of
      investigation. We have identified a subpopulation of cells within the continuous 
      epithelium of Drosophila larval wing discs that shows intrinsic resistance to IR-
      and drug-induced apoptosis. These cells reside in domains of high Wingless (Wg,
      Drosophila Wnt-1) and STAT92E (sole Drosophila signal transducer and activator of
      transcription [STAT] homolog) activity and would normally form the hinge in the
      adult fly. Resistance to IR-induced apoptosis requires STAT and Wg and is
      mediated by transcriptional repression of the pro-apoptotic gene reaper. Lineage 
      tracing experiments show that, following irradiation, apoptosis-resistant cells
      lose their identity and translocate to areas of the wing disc that suffered
      abundant cell death. Our findings provide a new paradigm for regeneration in
      which it is unnecessary to invoke special damage-resistant cell types such as
      stem cells. Instead, differences in gene expression within a population of
      genetically identical epithelial cells can create a subpopulation with greater
      resistance, which, following damage, survive, alter their fate, and help
      regenerate the tissue.

      Vibrotactile Sequences.
PG  - e1002549
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002549 [doi]
AB  - Rodent whisker input consists of dense microvibration sequences that are often
      temporally integrated for perceptual discrimination. Whether primary
      somatosensory cortex (S1) participates in temporal integration is unknown. We
      trained rats to discriminate whisker impulse sequences that varied in
      single-impulse kinematics (5-20-ms time scale) and mean speed (150-ms time
      scale). Rats appeared to use the integrated feature, mean speed, to guide
      discrimination in this task, consistent with similar prior studies. Despite this,
      52% of S1 units, including 73% of units in L4 and L2/3, encoded sequences at fast
      time scales (</=20 ms, mostly 5-10 ms), accurately reflecting single impulse
      kinematics. 17% of units, mostly in L5, showed weaker impulse responses and a
      slow firing rate increase during sequences. However, these units did not
      effectively integrate whisker impulses, but instead combined weak impulse
      responses with a distinct, slow signal correlated to behavioral choice. A neural 
      decoder could identify sequences from fast unit spike trains and behavioral
      choice from slow units. Thus, S1 encoded fast time scale whisker input without
      substantial temporal integration across whisker impulses.

AB  - Scientists, public servants, and patient advocates alike increasingly question
      the validity of published scientific results, endangering the public's acceptance
      of science. Here, I argue that emerging flaws in the integrity of the peer review
      system are largely responsible. Distortions in peer review are driven by economic
      forces and enabled by a lack of accountability of journals, editors, and authors.
      One approach to restoring trust in the validity of published results may be to
      establish basic rules that render peer review more transparent, such as
      publishing the reviews (a practice already embraced by some journals) and
      monitoring not only the track records of authors but also of editors and
      journals.

TI  - Sugar Influx Sensing by the Phosphotransferase System of Escherichia coli.
PG  - e2000074
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.2000074 [doi]
AB  - The phosphotransferase system (PTS) plays a pivotal role in the uptake of
      multiple sugars in Escherichia coli and many other bacteria. In the cell,
      individual sugar-specific PTS branches are interconnected through a series of
      phosphotransfer reactions, thus creating a global network that not only
      phosphorylates incoming sugars but also regulates a number of cellular processes.
      Despite the apparent importance of the PTS network in bacterial physiology, the
      holistic function of the network in the cell remains unclear. Here we used
      Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to investigate the PTS network in E.
      coli, including the dynamics of protein interactions and the processing of
      different stimuli and their transmission to the chemotaxis pathway. Our results
      demonstrate that despite the seeming complexity of the cellular PTS network, its 
      core part operates in a strikingly simple way, sensing the overall influx of PTS 
      sugars irrespective of the sugar identity and distributing this information
      equally through all studied branches of the network. Moreover, it also integrates
      several other specific metabolic inputs. The integrated output of the PTS network
      is then transmitted linearly to the chemotaxis pathway, in stark contrast to the 
      amplification of conventional chemotactic stimuli. Finally, we observe that
      default uptake through the uninduced PTS network correlates well with the quality
      of the carbon source, apparently representing an optimal regulatory strategy.

      and consequences of this mutualistic-competitive transition in experimentally
      tractable systems. Here, we study a microbial cross-feeding mutualism in which
      each yeast strain supplies an essential amino acid for its partner strain. We
      find that, depending upon the amount of freely available amino acid in the
      environment, this pair of strains can exhibit an obligatory mutualism,
      facultative mutualism, competition, parasitism, competitive exclusion, or failed 
      mutualism leading to extinction of the population. A simple model capturing the
      essential features of this interaction explains how resource availability
      modulates the interaction and predicts that changes in the dynamics of the
      mutualism in deteriorating environments can provide advance warning that collapse
      of the mutualism is imminent. We confirm this prediction experimentally by
      showing that, in the high nutrient competitive regime, the strains rapidly reach 
      a common carrying capacity before slowly reaching the equilibrium ratio between
      the strains. However, in the low nutrient regime, before collapse of the obligate
      mutualism, we find that the ratio rapidly reaches its equilibrium and it is the
      total abundance that is slow to reach equilibrium. Our results provide a general 
      framework for how mutualisms may transition between qualitatively different
      regimes of interaction in response to changes in nutrient availability in the
      environment.

TI  - The Deubiquitinase USP47 Stabilizes MAPK by Counteracting the Function of the
      N-end Rule ligase POE/UBR4 in Drosophila.
PG  - e1002539
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002539 [doi]
AB  - RAS-induced MAPK signaling is a central driver of the cell proliferation
      apparatus. Disruption of this pathway is widely observed in cancer and other
      pathologies. Consequently, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding 
      the mechanistic aspects of RAS-MAPK signal transmission and regulation. While
      much information has been garnered on the steps leading up to the activation and 
      inactivation of core pathway components, comparatively little is known on the
      mechanisms controlling their expression and turnover. We recently identified
      several factors that dictate Drosophila MAPK levels. Here, we describe the
      function of one of these, the deubiquitinase (DUB) USP47. We found that USP47
      acts post-translationally to counteract a proteasome-mediated event that reduces 
      MAPK half-life and thereby dampens signaling output. Using an RNAi-based genetic 
      interaction screening strategy, we identified UBC6, POE/UBR4, and UFD4,
      respectively, as E2 and E3 enzymes that oppose USP47 activity. Further
      characterization of POE-associated factors uncovered KCMF1 as another key
      component modulating MAPK levels. Together, these results identify a novel
      protein degradation module that governs MAPK levels. Given the role of UBR4 as an
      N-recognin ubiquitin ligase, our findings suggest that RAS-MAPK signaling in
      Drosophila is controlled by the N-end rule pathway and that USP47 counteracts its
      activity.

AB  - The detailed know-how to implement research protocols frequently remains
      restricted to the research group that developed the method or technology. This
      knowledge often exists at a level that is too detailed for inclusion in the
      methods section of scientific articles. Consequently, methods are not easily
      reproduced, leading to a loss of time and effort by other researchers. The
      challenge is to develop a method-centered collaborative platform to connect with 
      fellow researchers and discover state-of-the-art knowledge. Protocols.io is an
      open-access platform for detailing, sharing, and discussing molecular and
      computational protocols that can be useful before, during, and after publication 
      of research results.

AB  - Reported values in the literature on the number of cells in the body differ by
      orders of magnitude and are very seldom supported by any measurements or
      calculations. Here, we integrate the most up-to-date information on the number of
      human and bacterial cells in the body. We estimate the total number of bacteria
      in the 70 kg "reference man" to be 3.8.1013. For human cells, we identify the
      dominant role of the hematopoietic lineage to the total count ( approximately
      90%) and revise past estimates to 3.0.1013 human cells. Our analysis also updates
      the widely-cited 10:1 ratio, showing that the number of bacteria in the body is
      actually of the same order as the number of human cells, and their total mass is 
      about 0.2 kg.

TI  - Polarized Exocytosis Induces Compensatory Endocytosis by Sec4p-Regulated Cortical
      Actin Polymerization.
PG  - e1002534
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002534 [doi]
AB  - Polarized growth is maintained by both polarized exocytosis, which transports
      membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, and endocytosis,
      which retrieves these components before they can diffuse away. Despite functional
      links between these two transport pathways, they are generally considered to be
      separate events. Using live cell imaging, in vivo and in vitro protein binding
      assays, and in vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assays, we show that the yeast
      Rab GTPase Sec4p couples polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization,
      which induces endocytosis. After polarized exocytosis to the plasma membrane,
      Sec4p binds Las17/Bee1p (yeast Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein [WASp]) in a
      complex with Sla1p and Sla2p during actin patch assembly. Mutations that
      inactivate Sec4p, or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p, inhibit 
      actin patch formation, whereas the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates
      patch assembly. In vitro assays of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization
      established that GTPgammaS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent
      actin nucleation. These results support a model in which Sec4p relocates along
      the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent
      sites of endocytosis. Activated Sec4p then promotes actin polymerization and
      triggers compensatory endocytosis, which controls surface expansion and
      kinetically refines cell polarization.

TI  - Alerting or Somnogenic Light: Pick Your Color.
PG  - e2000111

AB  - In mammals, light exerts pervasive effects on physiology and behavior in two
      ways: indirectly through clock synchronization and the phase adjustment of
      circadian rhythms, and directly through the promotion of alertness and sleep,
      respectively, in diurnal and nocturnal species. A recent report by Pilorz and
      colleagues describes an even more complex role for the acute effects of light. In
      mice, blue light acutely causes behavioral arousal, whereas green wavelengths
      promote sleep. These opposing effects are mediated by melanopsin-based
      phototransduction through different neural pathways. These findings reconcile
      nocturnal and diurnal species through a common alerting response to blue light.
      One can hypothesize that the opposite responses to natural polychromatic light in
      night- or day-active animals may reflect higher sensitivity of nocturnal species 
      to green, and diurnals to blue wavelengths, resulting in hypnogenic and alerting 
      effects, respectively. Additional questions remain to be clarified. How do
      different light wavelengths affect other behaviors such as mood and cognition?
      How do those results apply to humans? How does light pose either a risk or
      benefit, depending on whether one needs to be asleep or alert? Indeed, in
      addition to timing, luminance levels, and light exposure duration, these findings
      stress the need to understand how best to adapt the color spectrum of light to
      our needs and to take this into account for the design of daily lighting
      concepts-a key challenge for today's society, especially with the emergence of
      LED light technology.

TI  - Angiogenic Factor AGGF1 Activates Autophagy with an Essential Role in Therapeutic
      Angiogenesis for Heart Disease.
PG  - e1002529
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002529 [doi]
AB  - AGGF1 is an angiogenic factor with therapeutic potential to treat coronary artery
      disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). However, the underlying mechanism
      for AGGF1-mediated therapeutic angiogenesis is unknown. Here, we show for the
      first time that AGGF1 activates autophagy, a housekeeping catabolic cellular
      process, in endothelial cells (ECs), HL1, H9C2, and vascular smooth muscle cells.
      Studies with Atg5 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the autophagy inhibitors
      bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and chloroquine demonstrate that autophagy is required for
      AGGF1-mediated EC proliferation, migration, capillary tube formation, and aortic 
      ring-based angiogenesis. Aggf1+/- knockout (KO) mice show reduced autophagy,
      which was associated with inhibition of angiogenesis, larger infarct areas, and
      contractile dysfunction after MI. Protein therapy with AGGF1 leads to robust
      recovery of myocardial function and contraction with increased survival,
      increased ejection fraction, reduction of infarct areas, and inhibition of
      cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis by promoting therapeutic angiogenesis in mice with
      MI. Inhibition of autophagy in mice by bafilomycin A1 or in Becn1+/- and Atg5 KO 
      mice eliminates AGGF1-mediated angiogenesis and therapeutic actions, indicating
      that autophagy acts upstream of and is essential for angiogenesis.
      Mechanistically, AGGF1 initiates autophagy by activating JNK, which leads to
      activation of Vps34 lipid kinase and the assembly of Becn1-Vps34-Atg14 complex
      involved in the initiation of autophagy. Our data demonstrate that (1) autophagy 
      is essential for effective therapeutic angiogenesis to treat CAD and MI; (2)
      AGGF1 is critical to induction of autophagy; and (3) AGGF1 is a novel agent for
      treatment of CAD and MI. Our data suggest that maintaining or increasing
      autophagy is a highly innovative strategy to robustly boost the efficacy of
      therapeutic angiogenesis.

PG  - e1002531
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002531 [doi]
AB  - Microsaccades aid vision by helping to strategically sample visual scenes.
      Despite the importance of these small eye movements, no cortical area has ever
      been implicated in their generation. Here, we used unilateral and bilateral
      reversible inactivation of the frontal eye fields (FEF) to identify a cortical
      drive for microsaccades. Unexpectedly, FEF inactivation altered microsaccade
      metrics and kinematics. Such inactivation also impaired microsaccade deployment
      following peripheral cue onset, regardless of cue side or inactivation
      configuration. Our results demonstrate that the FEF provides critical top-down
      drive for microsaccade generation, particularly during the recovery of
      microsaccades after disruption by sensory transients. Our results constitute the 
      first direct evidence, to our knowledge, for the contribution of any cortical
      area to microsaccade generation, and they provide a possible substrate for how
      cognitive processes can influence the strategic deployment of microsaccades.

TI  - Natural Constraints to Species Diversification.
PG  - e1002532
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002532 [doi]
AB  - Identifying modes of species diversification is fundamental to our understanding 
      of how biodiversity changes over evolutionary time. Diversification modes are
      captured in species phylogenies, but characterizing the landscape of
      diversification has been limited by the analytical tools available for directly
      comparing phylogenetic trees of groups of organisms. Here, we use a novel,
      non-parametric approach and 214 family-level phylogenies of vertebrates
      representing over 500 million years of evolution to identify major
      diversification modes, to characterize phylogenetic space, and to evaluate the
      bounds and central tendencies of species diversification. We identify five
      principal patterns of diversification to which all vertebrate families hold.
      These patterns, mapped onto multidimensional space, constitute a phylogenetic
      space with distinct properties. Firstly, phylogenetic space occupies only a
      portion of all possible tree space, showing family-level phylogenies to be
      constrained to a limited range of diversification patterns. Secondly, the
      geometry of phylogenetic space is delimited by quantifiable trade-offs in tree
      size and the heterogeneity and stem-to-tip distribution of branching events.
      These trade-offs are indicative of the instability of certain diversification
      patterns and effectively bound speciation rates (for successful clades) within
      upper and lower limits. Finally, both the constrained range and geometry of
      phylogenetic space are established by the differential effects of
      macroevolutionary processes on patterns of diversification. Given these
      properties, we show that the average path through phylogenetic space over
      evolutionary time traverses several diversification stages, each of which is

AB  - It has recently been appreciated that NK cells exhibit many features reminiscent 
      of adaptive immune cells. Considerable heterogeneity exists with respect to the
      ligand specificity of individual NK cells and as such, a subset of NK cells can
      respond, expand, and differentiate into memory-like cells in a ligand-specific
      manner. MHC I-binding inhibitory receptors, including those belonging to the Ly49
      and KIR families, are expressed in a variegated manner, which creates
      ligand-specific diversity within the NK cell pool. However, how NK cells
      determine which inhibitory receptors to express on their cell surface during a
      narrow window of development is largely unknown. In this manuscript, we
      demonstrate that signals from activating receptors are critical for induction of 
      Ly49 and KIR receptors during NK cell development; activating receptor-derived
      signals increased the probability of the Ly49 bidirectional Pro1 promoter to
      transcribe in the forward versus the reverse direction, leading to stable
      expression of Ly49 receptors in mature NK cells. Our data support a model where
      the balance of activating and inhibitory receptor signaling in NK cells selects
      for the induction of appropriate inhibitory receptors during development, which
      NK cells use to create a diverse pool of ligand-specific NK cells.

      Dynamic Memory Replay in Humans.
PG  - e1002528
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002528 [doi]
AB  - Reinstatement of dynamic memories requires the replay of neural patterns that
      unfold over time in a similar manner as during perception. However, little is
      known about the mechanisms that guide such a temporally structured replay in
      humans, because previous studies used either unsuitable methods or paradigms to
      address this question. Here, we overcome these limitations by developing a new
      analysis method to detect the replay of temporal patterns in a paradigm that
      requires participants to mentally replay short sound or video clips. We show that
      memory reinstatement is accompanied by a decrease of low-frequency (8 Hz) power, 
      which carries a temporal phase signature of the replayed stimulus. These replay
      effects were evident in the visual as well as in the auditory domain and were
      localized to sensory-specific regions. These results suggest low-frequency phase 
      to be a domain-general mechanism that orchestrates dynamic memory replay in
      humans.

      Multiplex Ecological Networks Leads to Increased Persistence and Resilience.
PG  - e1002527
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002527 [doi]
AB  - Species are linked to each other by a myriad of positive and negative
      interactions. This complex spectrum of interactions constitutes a network of
      links that mediates ecological communities' response to perturbations, such as
      exploitation and climate change. In the last decades, there have been great
      advances in the study of intricate ecological networks. We have, nonetheless,
      lacked both the data and the tools to more rigorously understand the patterning
      of multiple interaction types between species (i.e., "multiplex networks"), as
      well as their consequences for community dynamics. Using network statistical
      modeling applied to a comprehensive ecological network, which includes trophic
      and diverse non-trophic links, we provide a first glimpse at what the full
      "entangled bank" of species looks like. The community exhibits clear
      multidimensional structure, which is taxonomically coherent and broadly
      predictable from species traits. Moreover, dynamic simulations suggest that this 
      non-random patterning of how diverse non-trophic interactions map onto the food
      web could allow for higher species persistence and higher total biomass than
      expected by chance and tends to promote a higher robustness to extinctions.

      Suggestions for Changes.
PG  - e1002521
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002521 [doi]
AB  - Modern approaches for research with human biospecimens employ a variety of
      substantially different types of ethics approval and informed consent. In most
      cases, standard ethics reporting such as "consent and approval was obtained" is
      no longer meaningful. A structured analysis of 120 biospecimen studies recently
      published in top journals revealed that more than 85% reported on consent and
      approval, but in more than 90% of cases, this reporting was insufficient and thus
      potentially misleading. Editorial policies, reporting guidelines, and material
      transfer agreements should include recommendations for meaningful ethics
      reporting in biospecimen research. Meaningful ethics reporting is possible
      without higher word counts and could support public trust as well as networked
      research.

TI  - Preventing Zika Virus Infection during Pregnancy Using a Seasonal Window of
      Opportunity for Conception.
PG  - e1002520
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002520 [doi]
AB  - It has come to light that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can result
      in trans-placental transmission to the fetus along with fetal death, congenital
      microcephaly, and/or Central Nervous System (CNS) malformations. There are
      projected to be >9,200,000 births annually in countries with ongoing ZIKV
      transmission. In response to the ZIKV threat, the World Health Organization (WHO)
      is strategically targeting prevention of infection in pregnant women and funding 
      contraception in epidemic regions. I propose that the damaging effects of ZIKV
      can be reduced using a seasonal window of opportunity for conception that may
      minimize maternal exposure. Like other acute viral infections-including the
      related flavivirus, dengue virus (DENV)-the transmission of ZIKV is anticipated
      to be seasonal. By seasonally planning pregnancy, this aspect of pathogen ecology
      can be leveraged to align sensitive periods of gestation with the
      low-transmission season.

AB  - It is important for biology to understand if observations made in highly
      reductionist laboratory settings generalise to harsh and noisy natural
      environments in which genetic variation is sorted to produce adaptation. But what
      do we learn by studying, in the laboratory, a genetically diverse population that
      mirrors the wild? What is the best design for studying genetic variation? When
      should we consider it at all? The right experimental approach depends on what you
      want to know.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002524 [doi]
AB  - Notch signaling is iteratively used throughout development to maintain stem cell 
      potential or in other instances allow differentiation. The central transcription 
      factor in Notch signaling is CBF-1/RBP-J, Su(H), Lag-1 (CSL)-Su(H) in
      Drosophila-which functions as a molecular switch between transcriptional
      activation and repression. Su(H) represses transcription by forming a complex
      with the corepressor Hairless (H). The Su(H)-repressor complex not only competes 
      with the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) but also configures the local
      chromatin landscape. In this issue, Yuan and colleagues determined the structure 
      of the Su(H)/H complex, showing that a major conformational change within Su(H)
      explains why the binding of NICD and H is mutually exclusive.

TI  - Host Gut Motility Promotes Competitive Exclusion within a Model Intestinal
      Microbiota.
PG  - e1002517
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002517 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota is a complex consortium of microorganisms with the ability to 
      influence important aspects of host health and development. Harnessing this
      "microbial organ" for biomedical applications requires clarifying the degree to
      which host and bacterial factors act alone or in combination to govern the
      stability of specific lineages. To address this issue, we combined
      bacteriological manipulation and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to monitor
      the dynamics of a defined two-species microbiota within a vertebrate gut. We
      observed that the interplay between each population and the gut environment
      produces distinct spatiotemporal patterns. As a consequence, one species
      dominates while the other experiences sudden drops in abundance that are well fit
      by a stochastic mathematical model. Modeling revealed that direct bacterial
      competition could only partially explain the observed phenomena, suggesting that 
      a host factor is also important in shaping the community. We hypothesized the
      host determinant to be gut motility, and tested this mechanism by measuring
      colonization in hosts with enteric nervous system dysfunction due to a mutation
      in the ret locus, which in humans is associated with the intestinal motility
      disorder known as Hirschsprung disease. In mutant hosts we found reduced gut
      motility and, confirming our hypothesis, robust coexistence of both bacterial
      species. This study provides evidence that host-mediated spatial structuring and 
      stochastic perturbation of communities can drive bacterial population dynamics
      within the gut, and it reveals a new facet of the intestinal host-microbe
      interface by demonstrating the capacity of the enteric nervous system to
      influence the microbiota. Ultimately, these findings suggest that therapeutic
      strategies targeting the intestinal ecosystem should consider the dynamic
      physical nature of the gut environment.

AB  - One of the most fascinating properties of the brain is the ability to function
      smoothly across decades of a lifespan. Neurons are nondividing mature cells
      specialized in fast electrical and chemical communication at synapses. Often,
      neurons and synapses operate at high levels of activity through sophisticated
      arborizations of long axons and dendrites that nevertheless stay healthy
      throughout years. On the other hand, aging and activity-dependent stress strike
      onto the protein machineries turning proteins unfolded and prone to form
      pathological aggregates associated with neurodegeneration. How do neurons protect
      from those insults and remain healthy for their whole life? Ali and colleagues
      now present a molecular mechanism by which the enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide
      adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) acts not only as a NAD synthase involved in axonal
      maintenance but as a molecular chaperone helping neurons to overcome protein
      unfolding and protein aggregation.

AB  - Mammals show a wide range of brain sizes, reflecting adaptation to diverse
      habitats. Comparing interareal cortical networks across brains of different sizes
      and mammalian orders provides robust information on evolutionarily preserved
      features and species-specific processing modalities. However, these networks are 
      spatially embedded, directed, and weighted, making comparisons challenging. Using
      tract tracing data from macaque and mouse, we show the existence of a general
      organizational principle based on an exponential distance rule (EDR) and cortical
      geometry, enabling network comparisons within the same model framework. These
      comparisons reveal the existence of network invariants between mouse and macaque,
      exemplified in graph motif profiles and connection similarity indices, but also
      significant differences, such as fractionally smaller and much weaker
      long-distance connections in the macaque than in mouse. The latter lends credence
      to the prediction that long-distance cortico-cortical connections could be very
      weak in the much-expanded human cortex, implying an increased susceptibility to
      disconnection syndromes such as Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia. Finally, our
      data from tracer experiments involving only gray matter connections in the
      primary visual areas of both species show that an EDR holds at local scales as
      well (within 1.5 mm), supporting the hypothesis that it is a universally valid
      property across all scales and, possibly, across the mammalian class.

      Syndrome.
PG  - e1002511
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002511 [doi]
AB  - Deficiency of the protein Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1) is associated with multiple
      neurological and psychiatric abnormalities similar to those observed in
      pathologies showing alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. The aim of this study 
      was to examine the hypothesis that WFS1 deficiency affects neuronal function via 
      mitochondrial abnormalities. We show that down-regulation of WFS1 in neurons
      leads to dramatic changes in mitochondrial dynamics (inhibited mitochondrial
      fusion, altered mitochondrial trafficking, and augmented mitophagy), delaying
      neuronal development. WFS1 deficiency induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, 
      leading to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) dysfunction and disturbed
      cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis, which, in turn, alters mitochondrial dynamics.
      Importantly, ER stress, impaired Ca2+ homeostasis, altered mitochondrial
      dynamics, and delayed neuronal development are causatively related events because
      interventions at all these levels improved the downstream processes. Our data
      shed light on the mechanisms of neuronal abnormalities in Wolfram syndrome and
      point out potential therapeutic targets. This work may have broader implications 
      for understanding the role of mitochondrial dynamics in neuropsychiatric
      diseases.

TI  - LKB1 Regulates Mitochondria-Dependent Presynaptic Calcium Clearance and
      Neurotransmitter Release Properties at Excitatory Synapses along Cortical Axons.
PG  - e1002516
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002516 [doi]
AB  - Individual synapses vary significantly in their neurotransmitter release
      properties, which underlie complex information processing in neural circuits.
      Presynaptic Ca2+ homeostasis plays a critical role in specifying neurotransmitter
      release properties, but the mechanisms regulating synapse-specific Ca2+
      homeostasis in the mammalian brain are still poorly understood. Using
      electrophysiology and genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors targeted to the
      mitochondrial matrix or to presynaptic boutons of cortical pyramidal neurons, we 
      demonstrate that the presence or absence of mitochondria at presynaptic boutons
      dictates neurotransmitter release properties through Mitochondrial Calcium
      Uniporter (MCU)-dependent Ca2+ clearance. We demonstrate that the
      serine/threonine kinase LKB1 regulates MCU expression, mitochondria-dependent
      Ca2+ clearance, and thereby, presynaptic release properties. Re-establishment of 
      MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake at glutamatergic synapses rescues the
      altered neurotransmitter release properties characterizing LKB1-null cortical
      axons. Our results provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular
      mechanisms whereby mitochondria control neurotransmitter release properties in a 
      bouton-specific way through presynaptic Ca2+ clearance.

TI  - Keeping Signals Straight: How Cells Process Information and Make Decisions.
PG  - e1002519
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002519 [doi]
AB  - As we become increasingly dependent on electronic information-processing systems 
      at home and work, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that our very survival
      depends on highly complex biological information-processing systems. Each of the 
      trillions of cells that form the human body has the ability to detect and respond
      to a wide range of stimuli and inputs, using an extraordinary set of signaling
      proteins to process this information and make decisions accordingly. Indeed,
      cells in all organisms rely on these signaling proteins to survive and
      proliferate in unpredictable and sometimes rapidly changing environments. But how
      exactly do these proteins relay information within cells, and how do they keep a 
      multitude of incoming signals straight? Here, I describe recent efforts to
      understand the fidelity of information flow inside cells. This work is providing 
      fundamental insight into how cells function. Additionally, it may lead to the
      design of novel antibiotics that disrupt the signaling of pathogenic bacteria or 
      it could help to guide the treatment of cancer, which often involves
      information-processing gone awry inside human cells.

TI  - Topological Small-World Organization of the Fibroblastic Reticular Cell Network
      Determines Lymph Node Functionality.
PG  - e1002515
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002515 [doi]
AB  - Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) form the cellular scaffold of lymph nodes
      (LNs) and establish distinct microenvironmental niches to provide key molecules
      that drive innate and adaptive immune responses and control immune regulatory
      processes. Here, we have used a graph theory-based systems biology approach to
      determine topological properties and robustness of the LN FRC network in mice. We
      found that the FRC network exhibits an imprinted small-world topology that is
      fully regenerated within 4 wk after complete FRC ablation. Moreover, in silico
      perturbation analysis and in vivo validation revealed that LNs can tolerate a
      loss of approximately 50% of their FRCs without substantial impairment of immune 
      cell recruitment, intranodal T cell migration, and dendritic cell-mediated
      activation of antiviral CD8+ T cells. Overall, our study reveals the high
      topological robustness of the FRC network and the critical role of the network
      integrity for the activation of adaptive immune responses.

TI  - Structure and Function of the Su(H)-Hairless Repressor Complex, the Major
      Antagonist of Notch Signaling in Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - e1002509
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002509 [doi]
AB  - Notch is a conserved signaling pathway that specifies cell fates in metazoans.
      Receptor-ligand interactions induce changes in gene expression, which is
      regulated by the transcription factor CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 (CSL). CSL interacts with 
      coregulators to repress and activate transcription from Notch target genes. While
      the molecular details of the activator complex are relatively well understood,
      the structure-function of CSL-mediated repressor complexes is poorly defined. In 
      Drosophila, the antagonist Hairless directly binds Su(H) (the fly CSL ortholog)
      to repress transcription from Notch targets. Here, we determine the X-ray
      structure of the Su(H)-Hairless complex bound to DNA. Hairless binding produces a
      large conformational change in Su(H) by interacting with residues in the
      hydrophobic core of Su(H), illustrating the structural plasticity of CSL
      molecules to interact with different binding partners. Based on the structure, we
      designed mutants in Hairless and Su(H) that affect binding, but do not affect
      formation of the activator complex. These mutants were validated in vitro by
      isothermal titration calorimetry and yeast two- and three-hybrid assays.
      Moreover, these mutants allowed us to solely characterize the repressor function 
      of Su(H) in vivo.

TI  - Fecal Transplants: What Is Being Transferred?
PG  - e1002503
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002503 [doi]
AB  - Fecal transplants are increasingly utilized for treatment of recurrent infections
      (i.e., Clostridium difficile) in the human gut and as a general research tool for
      gain-of-function experiments (i.e., gavage of fecal pellets) in animal models.
      Changes observed in the recipient's biology are routinely attributed to bacterial
      cells in the donor feces (~1011 per gram of human wet stool). Here, we examine
      the literature and summarize findings on the composition of fecal matter in order
      to raise cautiously the profile of its multipart nature. In addition to viable
      bacteria, which may make up a small fraction of total fecal matter, other
      components in unprocessed human feces include colonocytes (~107 per gram of wet
      stool), archaea (~108 per gram of wet stool), viruses (~108 per gram of wet
      stool), fungi (~106 per gram of wet stool), protists, and metabolites. Thus,
      while speculative at this point and contingent on the transplant procedure and

TI  - Sex Chromosome-wide Transcriptional Suppression and Compensatory Cis-Regulatory
      Evolution Mediate Gene Expression in the Drosophila Male Germline.
PG  - e1002499
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002499 [doi]
AB  - The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes has repeatedly resulted in the
      evolution of sex chromosome-specific forms of regulation, including sex
      chromosome dosage compensation in the soma and meiotic sex chromosome
      inactivation in the germline. In the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster, a 
      novel but poorly understood form of sex chromosome-specific transcriptional
      regulation occurs that is distinct from canonical sex chromosome dosage
      compensation or meiotic inactivation. Previous work shows that expression of
      reporter genes driven by testis-specific promoters is considerably
      lower-approximately 3-fold or more-for transgenes inserted into X chromosome
      versus autosome locations. Here we characterize this transcriptional suppression 
      of X-linked genes in the male germline and its evolutionary consequences. Using
      transgenes and transpositions, we show that most endogenous X-linked genes, not
      just testis-specific ones, are transcriptionally suppressed several-fold
      specifically in the Drosophila male germline. In wild-type testes, this sex
      chromosome-wide transcriptional suppression is generally undetectable, being
      effectively compensated by the gene-by-gene evolutionary recruitment of strong
      promoters on the X chromosome. We identify and experimentally validate a promoter
      element sequence motif that is enriched upstream of the transcription start sites
      of hundreds of testis-expressed genes; evolutionarily conserved across species;
      associated with strong gene expression levels in testes; and overrepresented on
      the X chromosome. These findings show that the expression of X-linked genes in
      the Drosophila testes reflects a balance between chromosome-wide epigenetic
      transcriptional suppression and long-term compensatory adaptation by sex-linked
      genes. Our results have broad implications for the evolution of gene expression
      in the Drosophila male germline and for genome evolution.

TI  - The Mitochondrial Unfoldase-Peptidase Complex ClpXP Controls Bioenergetics Stress
      and Metastasis.
PG  - e1002507
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002507 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria must buffer the risk of proteotoxic stress to preserve
      bioenergetics, but the role of these mechanisms in disease is poorly understood. 
      Using a proteomics screen, we now show that the mitochondrial unfoldase-peptidase
      complex ClpXP associates with the oncoprotein survivin and the respiratory chain 
      Complex II subunit succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) in mitochondria of tumor
      cells. Knockdown of ClpXP subunits ClpP or ClpX induces the accumulation of
      misfolded SDHB, impairing oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production while
      activating "stress" signals of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and autophagy. Deregulated mitochondrial
      respiration induced by ClpXP targeting causes oxidative stress, which in turn
      reduces tumor cell proliferation, suppresses cell motility, and abolishes
      metastatic dissemination in vivo. ClpP is universally overexpressed in primary
      and metastatic human cancer, correlating with shortened patient survival.
      Therefore, tumors exploit ClpXP-directed proteostasis to maintain mitochondrial
      bioenergetics, buffer oxidative stress, and enable metastatic competence. This
      pathway may provide a "drugable" therapeutic target in cancer.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals regarding the lack of
      replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. To avoid a
      widespread crisis in neuroimaging research and consequent loss of credibility in 
      the public eye, we need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a
      practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers that will help them
      make their research more reproducible and transparent while minimizing the
      additional effort that this might require. The guide covers three major topics in
      open science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical advice as well
      as highlighting advantages of adopting more open research practices that go
      beyond improved transparency and reproducibility.

TI  - Allele-Specific Transcriptome and Methylome Analysis Reveals Stable Inheritance
      and Cis-Regulation of DNA Methylation in Nasonia.
PG  - e1002500
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002500 [doi]
AB  - Gene expression divergence between closely related species could be attributed to
      both cis- and trans- DNA sequence changes during evolution, but it is unclear how
      the evolutionary dynamics of epigenetic marks are regulated. In eutherian
      mammals, biparental DNA methylation marks are erased and reset during
      gametogenesis, resulting in paternal or maternal imprints, which lead to genomic 
      imprinting. Whether DNA methylation reprogramming exists in insects is not known.
      Wasps of the genus Nasonia are non-social parasitoids that are emerging as a
      model for studies of epigenetic processes in insects. In this study, we
      quantified allele-specific expression and methylation genome-wide in Nasonia
      vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti and their reciprocal F1 hybrids. No
      parent-of-origin effect in allelic expression was found for >8,000 covered genes,
      suggesting a lack of genomic imprinting in adult Nasonia. As we expected, both
      significant cis- and trans- effects are responsible for the expression divergence
      between N. vitripennis and N. giraulti. Surprisingly, all 178 differentially
      methylated genes are also differentially methylated between the two alleles in F1
      hybrid offspring, recapitulating the parental methylation status with nearly 100%
      fidelity, indicating the presence of strong cis-elements driving the target of
      gene body methylation. In addition, we discovered that total and allele-specific 
      expression are positively correlated with allele-specific methylation in a subset
      of the differentially methylated genes. The 100% cis-regulation in F1 hybrids
      suggests the methylation machinery is conserved and DNA methylation is targeted
      by cis features in Nasonia. The lack of genomic imprinting and parent-of-origin
      differentially methylated regions in Nasonia, together with the stable
      inheritance of methylation status between generations, suggests either a
      cis-regulatory motif for methylation at the DNA level or highly stable
      inheritance of an epigenetic signal in Nasonia.

TI  - Multiple Citation Indicators and Their Composite across Scientific Disciplines.
PG  - e1002501
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002501 [doi]
AB  - Many fields face an increasing prevalence of multi-authorship, and this poses
      challenges in assessing citation metrics. Here, we explore multiple citation
      indicators that address total impact (number of citations, Hirsch H index [H]),
      co-authorship adjustment (Schreiber Hm index [Hm]), and author order (total
      citations to papers as single; single or first; or single, first, or last
      author). We demonstrate the correlation patterns between these indicators across 
      84,116 scientists (those among the top 30,000 for impact in a single year [2013] 
      in at least one of these indicators) and separately across 12 scientific fields. 
      Correlation patterns vary across these 12 fields. In physics, total citations are
      highly negatively correlated with indicators of co-authorship adjustment and of
      author order, while in other sciences the negative correlation is seen only for
      total citation impact and citations to papers as single author. We propose a
      composite score that sums standardized values of these six log-transformed
      indicators. Of the 1,000 top-ranked scientists with the composite score, only 322
      are in the top 1,000 based on total citations. Many Nobel laureates and other
      extremely influential scientists rank among the top-1,000 with the composite
      indicator, but would rank much lower based on total citations. Conversely, many
      of the top 1,000 authors on total citations have had no
      single/first/last-authored cited paper. More Nobel laureates of 2011-2015 are
      among the top authors when authors are ranked by the composite score than by
      total citations, H index, or Hm index; 40/47 of these laureates are among the top
      30,000 by at least one of the six indicators. We also explore the sensitivity of 
      indicators to self-citation and alphabetic ordering of authors in papers across
      different scientific fields. Multiple indicators and their composite may give a
      more comprehensive picture of impact, although no citation indicator, single or
      composite, can be expected to select all the best scientists.

TI  - Individual Human Brain Areas Can Be Identified from Their Characteristic Spectral
      Activation Fingerprints.
PG  - e1002498
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002498 [doi]
AB  - The human brain can be parcellated into diverse anatomical areas. We investigated
      whether rhythmic brain activity in these areas is characteristic and can be used 
      for automatic classification. To this end, resting-state MEG data of 22 healthy
      adults was analysed. Power spectra of 1-s long data segments for atlas-defined
      brain areas were clustered into spectral profiles ("fingerprints"), using k-means
      and Gaussian mixture (GM) modelling. We demonstrate that individual areas can be 
      identified from these spectral profiles with high accuracy. Our results suggest
      that each brain area engages in different spectral modes that are characteristic 
      for individual areas. Clustering of brain areas according to similarity of
      spectral profiles reveals well-known brain networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate 
      task-specific modulations of auditory spectral profiles during auditory
      processing. These findings have important implications for the classification of 
      regional spectral activity and allow for novel approaches in neuroimaging and
      neurostimulation in health and disease.

TI  - Paneth Cell-Rich Regions Separated by a Cluster of Lgr5+ Cells Initiate Crypt
      Fission in the Intestinal Stem Cell Niche.
PG  - e1002491
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002491 [doi]
AB  - The crypts of the intestinal epithelium house the stem cells that ensure the
      continual renewal of the epithelial cells that line the intestinal tract. Crypt
      number increases by a process called crypt fission, the division of a single
      crypt into two daughter crypts. Fission drives normal tissue growth and
      maintenance. Correspondingly, it becomes less frequent in adulthood. Importantly,
      fission is reactivated to drive adenoma growth. The mechanisms governing fission 
      are poorly understood. However, only by knowing how normal fission operates can
      cancer-associated changes be elucidated. We studied normal fission in tissue in
      three dimensions using high-resolution imaging and used intestinal organoids to
      identify underlying mechanisms. We discovered that both the number and relative
      position of Paneth cells and Lgr5+ cells are important for fission. Furthermore, 
      the higher stiffness and increased adhesion of Paneth cells are involved in
      determining the site of fission. Formation of a cluster of Lgr5+ cells between at
      least two Paneth-cell-rich domains establishes the site for the upward
      invagination that initiates fission.

PG  - e1002484
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002484 [doi]
AB  - Data presentation for scientific publications in small sample size studies has
      not changed substantially in decades. It relies on static figures and tables that
      may not provide sufficient information for critical evaluation, particularly of
      the results from small sample size studies. Interactive graphics have the
      potential to transform scientific publications from static reports of experiments
      into interactive datasets. We designed an interactive line graph that
      demonstrates how dynamic alternatives to static graphics for small sample size
      studies allow for additional exploration of empirical datasets. This simple,
      free, web-based tool (http://statistika.mfub.bg.ac.rs/interactive-graph/)
      demonstrates the overall concept and may promote widespread use of interactive
      graphics.

TI  - Border Security Fencing and Wildlife: The End of the Transboundary Paradigm in
      Eurasia?
PG  - e1002483
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002483 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing refugee crisis in Europe has seen many countries rush to construct
      border security fencing to divert or control the flow of people. This follows a
      trend of border fence construction across Eurasia during the post-9/11 era. This 
      development has gone largely unnoticed by conservation biologists during an era
      in which, ironically, transboundary cooperation has emerged as a conservation
      paradigm. These fences represent a major threat to wildlife because they can
      cause mortality, obstruct access to seasonally important resources, and reduce
      effective population size. We summarise the extent of the issue and propose
      concrete mitigation measures.

PG  - e1002477
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002477 [doi]
AB  - Reproducibility and transparency in biomedical sciences have been called into
      question, and scientists have been found wanting as a result. Putting aside
      deliberate fraud, there is evidence that a major contributor to lack of
      reproducibility is insufficient quality assurance of reagents used in preclinical
      research. Cell lines are widely used in biomedical research to understand
      fundamental biological processes and disease states, yet most researchers do not 
      perform a simple, affordable test to authenticate these key resources. Here, we
      provide a synopsis of the problems we face and how standards can contribute to an
      achievable solution.

AB  - Different genomic technologies have been applied to cell line authentication, but
      only one method (short tandem repeat [STR] profiling) has been the subject of a
      comprehensive and definitive standard (ASN-0002). Here we discuss the power of
      this document and why standards such as this are so critical for establishing the
      consensus technical criteria and practices that can enable progress in the fields
      of research that use cell lines. We also examine other methods that could be used
      for authentication and discuss how a combination of methods could be used in a
      holistic fashion to assess various critical aspects of the quality of cell lines.

TI  - Regulation of Smoothened Phosphorylation and High-Level Hedgehog Signaling
      Activity by a Plasma Membrane Associated Kinase.
PG  - e1002481
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002481 [doi]
AB  - Hedgehog (Hh) signaling controls embryonic development and adult tissue
      homeostasis through the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-family protein
      Smoothened (Smo). Upon stimulation, Smo accumulates on the cell surface in
      Drosophila or primary cilia in vertebrates, which is thought to be essential for 
      its activation and function, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
      understood. Here we show that Hh stimulates the binding of Smo to a plasma
      membrane-associated kinase Gilgamesh (Gish)/CK1gamma and that Gish fine-tunes Hh 
      pathway activity by phosphorylating a Ser/Thr cluster (CL-II) in the
      juxtamembrane region of Smo carboxyl-terminal intracellular tail (C-tail). We
      find that CL-II phosphorylation is promoted by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated
      phosphorylation of Smo C-tail and depends on cell surface localization of both
      Gish and Smo. Consistent with CL-II being critical for high-threshold Hh target
      gene expression, its phosphorylation appears to require higher levels of Hh or
      longer exposure to the same level of Hh than PKA-site phosphorylation on Smo.
      Furthermore, we find that vertebrate CK1gamma is localized at the primary cilium 
      to promote Smo phosphorylation and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway activation. Our
      study reveals a conserved mechanism whereby Hh induces a change in Smo
      subcellular localization to promote its association with and activation by a
      plasma membrane localized kinase, and provides new insight into how Hh morphogen 
      progressively activates Smo.

TI  - The DEAD-box Protein Rok1 Orchestrates 40S and 60S Ribosome Assembly by Promoting
      the Release of Rrp5 from Pre-40S Ribosomes to Allow for 60S Maturation.
PG  - e1002480
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002480 [doi]
AB  - DEAD-box proteins are ubiquitous regulators of RNA biology. While commonly dubbed
      "helicases," their activities also include duplex annealing, adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA binding, and RNA-protein complex remodeling.
      Rok1, an essential DEAD-box protein, and its cofactor Rrp5 are required for
      ribosome assembly. Here, we use in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses to
      demonstrate that ATP-bound Rok1, but not adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-bound Rok1, 
      stabilizes Rrp5 binding to 40S ribosomes. Interconversion between these two forms
      by ATP hydrolysis is required for release of Rrp5 from pre-40S ribosomes in vivo,
      thereby allowing Rrp5 to carry out its role in 60S subunit assembly. Furthermore,
      our data also strongly suggest that the previously described accumulation of
      snR30 upon Rok1 inactivation arises because Rrp5 release is blocked and implicate
      a previously undescribed interaction between Rrp5 and the DEAD-box protein Has1
      in mediating snR30 accumulation when Rrp5 release from pre-40S subunits is
      blocked.

TI  - Membrane Tension Acts Through PLD2 and mTORC2 to Limit Actin Network Assembly
      During Neutrophil Migration.
PG  - e1002474
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002474 [doi]
AB  - For efficient polarity and migration, cells need to regulate the magnitude and
      spatial distribution of actin assembly. This process is coordinated by reciprocal
      interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and mechanical forces. Actin
      polymerization-based protrusion increases tension in the plasma membrane, which
      in turn acts as a long-range inhibitor of actin assembly. These interactions form
      a negative feedback circuit that limits the magnitude of membrane tension in
      neutrophils and prevents expansion of the existing front and the formation of
      secondary fronts. It has been suggested that the plasma membrane directly
      inhibits actin assembly by serving as a physical barrier that opposes protrusion.
      Here we show that efficient control of actin polymerization-based protrusion
      requires an additional mechanosensory feedback cascade that indirectly links
      membrane tension with actin assembly. Specifically, elevated membrane tension
      acts through phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and the mammalian target of rapamycin
      complex 2 (mTORC2) to limit actin nucleation. In the absence of this pathway,
      neutrophils exhibit larger leading edges, higher membrane tension, and profoundly
      defective chemotaxis. Mathematical modeling suggests roles for both the direct
      (mechanical) and indirect (biochemical via PLD2 and mTORC2) feedback loops in
      organizing cell polarity and motility-the indirect loop is better suited to
      enable competition between fronts, whereas the direct loop helps spatially
      organize actin nucleation for efficient leading edge formation and cell movement.
      This circuit is essential for polarity, motility, and the control of membrane
      tension.

TI  - Dihydrostreptomycin Directly Binds to, Modulates, and Passes through the MscL
      Channel Pore.
PG  - e1002473
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002473 [doi]
AB  - The primary mechanism of action of the antibiotic dihydrostreptomycin is binding 
      to and modifying the function of the bacterial ribosome, thus leading to
      decreased and aberrant translation of proteins; however, the routes by which it
      enters the bacterial cell are largely unknown. The mechanosensitive channel of
      large conductance, MscL, is found in the vast majority of bacterial species,
      where it serves as an emergency release valve rescuing the cell from sudden
      decreases in external osmolarity. While it is known that MscL expression
      increases the potency of dihydrostreptomycin, it has remained unclear if this
      effect is due to a direct interaction. Here, we use a combination of genetic
      screening, MD simulations, and biochemical and mutational approaches to determine
      if dihydrostreptomycin directly interacts with MscL. Our data strongly suggest
      that dihydrostreptomycin binds to a specific site on MscL and modifies its
      conformation, thus allowing the passage of K+ and glutamate out of, and
      dihydrostreptomycin into, the cell.

TI  - Melanopsin Regulates Both Sleep-Promoting and Arousal-Promoting Responses to
      Light.
PG  - e1002482
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002482 [doi]
AB  - Light plays a critical role in the regulation of numerous aspects of physiology
      and behaviour, including the entrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation 
      of sleep. These responses involve melanopsin (OPN4)-expressing photosensitive
      retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) in addition to rods and cones. Nocturnal light
      exposure in rodents has been shown to result in rapid sleep induction, in which
      melanopsin plays a key role. However, studies have also shown that light exposure
      can result in elevated corticosterone, a response that is not compatible with
      sleep. To investigate these contradictory findings and to dissect the relative
      contribution of pRGCs and rods/cones, we assessed the effects of light of
      different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep. Here, we show that blue
      light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying 
      sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction.
      Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient
      mice (Opn4-/-), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed
      sleep induction in response to green or white light. We go on to show that blue
      light evokes higher Fos induction in the SCN compared to the sleep-promoting
      ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), whereas green light produced greater
      responses in the VLPO. Collectively, our data demonstrates that nocturnal light
      exposure can have either an arousal- or sleep-promoting effect, and that these
      responses are melanopsin-mediated via different neural pathways with different
      spectral sensitivities. These findings raise important questions relating to how 
      artificial light may alter behaviour in both the work and domestic setting.

TI  - Evolution of High Cellulolytic Activity in Symbiotic Streptomyces through
      Selection of Expanded Gene Content and Coordinated Gene Expression.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002475 [doi]
AB  - The evolution of cellulose degradation was a defining event in the history of
      life. Without efficient decomposition and recycling, dead plant biomass would
      quickly accumulate and become inaccessible to terrestrial food webs and the
      global carbon cycle. On land, the primary drivers of plant biomass deconstruction
      are fungi and bacteria in the soil or associated with herbivorous eukaryotes.
      While the ecological importance of plant-decomposing microbes is well
      established, little is known about the distribution or evolution of cellulolytic 
      activity in any bacterial genus. Here we show that in Streptomyces, a genus of
      Actinobacteria abundant in soil and symbiotic niches, the ability to rapidly
      degrade cellulose is largely restricted to two clades of host-associated strains 
      and is not a conserved characteristic of the Streptomyces genus or
      host-associated strains. Our comparative genomics identify that while plant
      biomass degrading genes (CAZy) are widespread in Streptomyces, key enzyme
      families are enriched in highly cellulolytic strains. Transcriptomic analyses
      demonstrate that cellulolytic strains express a suite of multi-domain CAZy
      enzymes that are coregulated by the CebR transcriptional regulator. Using
      targeted gene deletions, we verify the importance of a highly expressed cellulase
      (GH6 family cellobiohydrolase) and the CebR transcriptional repressor to the
      cellulolytic phenotype. Evolutionary analyses identify complex genomic
      modifications that drive plant biomass deconstruction in Streptomyces, including 
      acquisition and selective retention of CAZy genes and transcriptional regulators.
      Our results suggest that host-associated niches have selected some symbiotic
      Streptomyces for increased cellulose degrading activity and that symbiotic
      bacteria are a rich biochemical and enzymatic resource for biotechnology.

      Transfer of Beneficial Plasmids.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002478 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial genes that confer crucial phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance,
      can spread horizontally by residing on mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Although
      many mobile genes provide strong benefits to their hosts, the fitness
      consequences of the process of transfer itself are less clear. In previous
      studies, transfer has been interpreted as a parasitic trait of the MGEs because
      of its costs to the host but also as a trait benefiting host populations through 
      the sharing of a common gene pool. Here, we show that costly donation is an
      altruistic act when it spreads beneficial MGEs favoured when it increases the
      inclusive fitness of donor ability alleles. We show mathematically that donor
      ability can be selected when relatedness at the locus modulating transfer is
      sufficiently high between donor and recipients, ensuring high frequency of
      transfer between cells sharing donor alleles. We further experimentally
      demonstrate that either population structure or discrimination in transfer can
      increase relatedness to a level selecting for chromosomal transfer alleles. Both 
      mechanisms are likely to occur in natural environments. The simple process of
      strong dilution can create sufficient population structure to select for donor
      ability. Another mechanism observed in natural isolates, discrimination in
      transfer, can emerge through coselection of transfer and discrimination alleles. 
      Our work shows that horizontal gene transfer in bacteria can be promoted by
      bacterial hosts themselves and not only by MGEs. In the longer term, the success 
      of cells bearing beneficial MGEs combined with biased transfer leads to an
      association between high donor ability, discrimination, and mobile beneficial
      genes. However, in conditions that do not select for altruism, host bacteria
      promoting transfer are outcompeted by hosts with lower transfer rate, an aspect
      that could be relevant in the fight against the spread of antibiotic resistance.

TI  - Distinct Global Brain Dynamics and Spatiotemporal Organization of the Salience
      Network.
PG  - e1002469
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002469 [doi]
AB  - One of the most fundamental features of the human brain is its ability to detect 
      and attend to salient goal-relevant events in a flexible manner. The salience
      network (SN), anchored in the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate
      cortex, plays a crucial role in this process through rapid detection of
      goal-relevant events and facilitation of access to appropriate cognitive
      resources. Here, we leverage the subsecond resolution of large multisession fMRI 
      datasets from the Human Connectome Project and apply novel graph-theoretical
      techniques to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN. We
      show that the large-scale brain dynamics of the SN are characterized by several
      distinctive and robust properties. First, the SN demonstrated the highest levels 
      of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, including 
      the frontoparietal network (FPN), the cingulate-opercular network (CON), and the 
      ventral and dorsal attention networks (VAN and DAN). Second, dynamic functional
      interactions of the SN were among the most spatially varied in the brain. Third, 
      SN nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time,
      indicating that this network is a hub for facilitating flexible cross-network
      interactions. Fourth, time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct 
      from all other prefrontal control systems. Fifth, temporal flexibility of the SN 
      uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. Importantly, 
      each of these results was also observed in a second retest dataset, demonstrating
      the robustness of our findings. Our study provides fundamental new insights into 
      the distinct dynamic functional architecture of the SN and demonstrates how this 
      network is uniquely positioned to facilitate interactions with multiple
      functional systems and thereby support a wide range of cognitive processes in the
      human brain.

TI  - NMNAT2:HSP90 Complex Mediates Proteostasis in Proteinopathies.
PG  - e1002472
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002472 [doi]
AB  - Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 2 (NMNAT2) is neuroprotective in
      numerous preclinical models of neurodegeneration. Here, we show that brain nmnat2
      mRNA levels correlate positively with global cognitive function and negatively
      with AD pathology. In AD brains, NMNAT2 mRNA and protein levels are reduced.
      NMNAT2 shifts its solubility and colocalizes with aggregated Tau in AD brains,
      similar to chaperones, which aid in the clearance or refolding of misfolded
      proteins. Investigating the mechanism of this observation, we discover a novel
      chaperone function of NMNAT2, independent from its enzymatic activity. NMNAT2
      complexes with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to refold aggregated protein
      substrates. NMNAT2's refoldase activity requires a unique C-terminal ATP site,
      activated in the presence of HSP90. Furthermore, deleting NMNAT2 function
      increases the vulnerability of cortical neurons to proteotoxic stress and
      excitotoxicity. Interestingly, NMNAT2 acts as a chaperone to reduce proteotoxic
      stress, while its enzymatic activity protects neurons from excitotoxicity. Taken 
      together, our data indicate that NMNAT2 exerts its chaperone or enzymatic
      function in a context-dependent manner to maintain neuronal health.

TI  - Olfactory Ensheathing Cell Transplantation in Experimental Spinal Cord Injury:
      Effect size and Reporting Bias of 62 Experimental Treatments: A Systematic Review
      and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e1002468
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002468 [doi]
AB  - Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation is a candidate cellular
      treatment approach for human spinal cord injury (SCI) due to their unique
      regenerative potential and autologous origin. The objective of this study was,
      through a meta-epidemiologic approach, (i) to assess the efficacy of OEC
      transplantation on locomotor recovery after traumatic experimental SCI and (ii)
      to estimate the likelihood of reporting bias and/or missing data. A study
      protocol was finalized before data collection. Embedded into a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis, we conducted a literature research of databases including
      PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science from 1949/01 to 2014/10 with no language
      restrictions, screened by two independent investigators. Studies were included if
      they assessed neurobehavioral improvement after traumatic experimental SCI,
      administrated no combined interventions, and reported the number of animals in
      the treatment and control group. Individual effect sizes were pooled using a
      random effects model. Details regarding the study design were extracted and
      impact of these on locomotor outcome was assessed by meta-regression. Missing
      data (reporting bias) was determined by Egger regression and Funnel-plotting. The
      primary study outcome assessed was improvement in locomotor function at the final
      time point of measurement. We included 49 studies (62 experiments, 1,164 animals)
      in the final analysis. The overall improvement in locomotor function after OEC
      transplantation, measured using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score,
      was 20.3% (95% CI 17.8-29.5). One missing study was imputed by trim and fill
      analysis, suggesting only slight publication bias and reducing the overall effect
      to a 19.2% improvement of locomotor activity. Dose-response ratio supports
      neurobiological plausibility. Studies were assessed using a 9-point item quality 
      score, resulting in a median score of 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3-5). In
      conclusion, OEC transplantation exerts considerable beneficial effects on
      neurobehavioral recovery after traumatic experimental SCI. Publication bias was
      minimal and affirms the translational potential of efficacy, but safety cannot be
      adequately assessed. The data justify OECs as a cellular substrate to develop and
      optimize minimally invasive and safe cellular transplantation paradigms for the
      lesioned spinal cord embedded into state-of-the-art Phase I/II clinical trial
      design studies for human SCI.

TI  - Neuronal Hyperactivity Disturbs ATP Microgradients, Impairs Microglial Motility, 
      and Reduces Phagocytic Receptor Expression Triggering Apoptosis/Microglial
      Phagocytosis Uncoupling.
PG  - e1002466
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002466 [doi]
AB  - Phagocytosis is essential to maintain tissue homeostasis in a large number of
      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, but its role in the diseased brain is
      poorly explored. Recent findings suggest that in the adult hippocampal neurogenic
      niche, where the excess of newborn cells undergo apoptosis in physiological
      conditions, phagocytosis is efficiently executed by surveillant, ramified
      microglia. To test whether microglia are efficient phagocytes in the diseased
      brain as well, we confronted them with a series of apoptotic challenges and
      discovered a generalized response. When challenged with excitotoxicity in vitro
      (via the glutamate agonist NMDA) or inflammation in vivo (via systemic
      administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharides or by omega 3 fatty acid
      deficient diets), microglia resorted to different strategies to boost their
      phagocytic efficiency and compensate for the increased number of apoptotic cells,
      thus maintaining phagocytosis and apoptosis tightly coupled. Unexpectedly, this
      coupling was chronically lost in a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy
      (MTLE) as well as in hippocampal tissue resected from individuals with MTLE, a
      major neurological disorder characterized by seizures, excitotoxicity, and
      inflammation. Importantly, the loss of phagocytosis/apoptosis coupling correlated
      with the expression of microglial proinflammatory, epileptogenic cytokines,
      suggesting its contribution to the pathophysiology of epilepsy. The phagocytic
      blockade resulted from reduced microglial surveillance and apoptotic cell
      recognition receptor expression and was not directly mediated by signaling
      through microglial glutamate receptors. Instead, it was related to the disruption
      of local ATP microgradients caused by the hyperactivity of the hippocampal
      network, at least in the acute phase of epilepsy. Finally, the uncoupling led to 
      an accumulation of apoptotic newborn cells in the neurogenic niche that was due
      not to decreased survival but to delayed cell clearance after seizures. These
      results demonstrate that the efficiency of microglial phagocytosis critically
      affects the dynamics of apoptosis and urge to routinely assess the microglial
      phagocytic efficiency in neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Elongation Factor Tu Prevents Misediting of Gly-tRNA(Gly) Caused by the Design
      Behind the Chiral Proofreading Site of D-Aminoacyl-tRNA Deacylase.
PG  - e1002465
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002465 [doi]
AB  - D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) removes D-amino acids mischarged on tRNAs and is
      thus implicated in enforcing homochirality in proteins. Previously, we proposed
      that selective capture of D-aminoacyl-tRNA by DTD's invariant, cross-subunit
      Gly-cisPro motif forms the mechanistic basis for its enantioselectivity. We now
      show, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based binding studies
      followed by biochemical assays with both bacterial and eukaryotic systems, that
      DTD effectively misedits Gly-tRNAGly. High-resolution crystal structure reveals
      that the architecture of DTD's chiral proofreading site is completely porous to
      achiral glycine. Hence, L-chiral rejection is the only design principle on which 
      DTD functions, unlike other chiral-specific enzymes such as D-amino acid
      oxidases, which are specific for D-enantiomers. Competition assays with
      elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) and DTD demonstrate that EF-Tu
      precludes Gly-tRNAGly misediting at normal cellular concentrations. However, even
      slightly higher DTD levels overcome this protection conferred by EF-Tu, thus
      resulting in significant depletion of Gly-tRNAGly. Our in vitro observations are 
      substantiated by cell-based studies in Escherichia coli that show that
      overexpression of DTD causes cellular toxicity, which is largely rescued upon
      glycine supplementation. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that DTD is an
      RNA-based catalyst, since it uses only the terminal 2'-OH of tRNA for catalysis
      without the involvement of protein side chains. The study therefore provides a
      unique paradigm of enzyme action for substrate selection/specificity by DTD, and 
      thus explains the underlying cause of DTD's activity on Gly-tRNAGly. It also
      gives a molecular and functional basis for the necessity and the observed tight
      regulation of DTD levels, thereby preventing cellular toxicity due to misediting.

      LuxO.
PG  - e1002464
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002464 [doi]
AB  - In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria communicate with chemical signal
      molecules called autoinducers to control collective behaviors. In pathogenic
      vibrios, including Vibrio cholerae, the accumulation of autoinducers triggers
      repression of genes responsible for virulence factor production and biofilm
      formation. The vibrio autoinducer molecules bind to transmembrane receptors of
      the two-component histidine sensor kinase family. Autoinducer binding inactivates
      the receptors' kinase activities, leading to dephosphorylation and inhibition of 
      the downstream response regulator LuxO. Here, we report the X-ray structure of
      LuxO in its unphosphorylated, autoinhibited state. Our structure reveals that
      LuxO, a bacterial enhancer-binding protein of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, is
      inhibited by an unprecedented mechanism in which a linker that connects the
      catalytic and regulatory receiver domains occupies the ATPase active site. The
      conformational change that accompanies receiver domain phosphorylation likely
      disrupts this interaction, providing a mechanistic rationale for LuxO activation.
      We also determined the crystal structure of the LuxO catalytic domain bound to a 
      broad-spectrum inhibitor. The inhibitor binds in the ATPase active site and
      recapitulates elements of the natural regulatory mechanism. Remarkably, a single 
      inhibitor molecule may be capable of inhibiting an entire LuxO oligomer.

TI  - The Transcriptional Activator Kruppel-like Factor-6 Is Required for CNS
      Myelination.
PG  - e1002467
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002467 [doi]
AB  - Growth factors of the gp130 family promote oligodendrocyte differentiation, and
      viability, and myelination, but their mechanisms of action are incompletely
      understood. Here, we show that these effects are coordinated, in part, by the
      transcriptional activator Kruppel-like factor-6 (Klf6). Klf6 is rapidly induced
      in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLP) by gp130 factors, and promotes
      differentiation. Conversely, in mice with lineage-selective Klf6 inactivation,
      OLP undergo maturation arrest followed by apoptosis, and CNS myelination fails.
      Overlapping transcriptional and chromatin occupancy analyses place Klf6 at the
      nexus of a novel gp130-Klf-importin axis, which promotes differentiation and
      viability in part via control of nuclear trafficking. Klf6 acts as a
      gp130-sensitive transactivator of the nuclear import factor importin-alpha5
      (Impalpha5), and interfering with this mechanism interrupts step-wise
      differentiation. Underscoring the significance of this axis in vivo, mice with
      conditional inactivation of gp130 signaling display defective Klf6 and Impalpha5 
      expression, OLP maturation arrest and apoptosis, and failure of CNS myelination.

PG  - e1002463
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002463 [doi]
AB  - Cell migration in the "correct" direction is pivotal for many biological
      processes. Although most work is devoted to its molecular mechanisms, the cell's 
      preference for one direction over others, thus overcoming intrinsic random
      motility, epitomizes a profound principle that underlies all complex systems: the
      choice of one axis, in structure or motion, from a uniform or symmetric set of
      options. Explaining directional motility by an external chemo-attractant gradient
      does not solve but only shifts the problem of causation: whence the gradient? A
      new study in PLOS Biology shows cell migration in a self-generated gradient,
      offering an opportunity to take a broader look at the old dualism of extrinsic
      instruction versus intrinsic symmetry-breaking in cell biology.

TI  - Release of GTP Exchange Factor Mediated Down-Regulation of Abscisic Acid Signal
      Transduction through ABA-Induced Rapid Degradation of RopGEFs.
PG  - e1002461
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002461 [doi]
AB  - The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical to plant development and stress 
      responses. Abiotic stress triggers an ABA signal transduction cascade, which is
      comprised of the core components PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, PP2C-type protein
      phosphatases, and protein kinases. Small GTPases of the ROP/RAC family act as
      negative regulators of ABA signal transduction. However, the mechanisms by which 
      ABA controls the behavior of ROP/RACs have remained unclear. Here, we show that
      an Arabidopsis guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein RopGEF1 is rapidly
      sequestered to intracellular particles in response to ABA. GFP-RopGEF1 is
      sequestered via the endosome-prevacuolar compartment pathway and is degraded.
      RopGEF1 directly interacts with several clade A PP2C protein phosphatases,
      including ABI1. Interestingly, RopGEF1 undergoes constitutive degradation in pp2c
      quadruple abi1/abi2/hab1/pp2ca mutant plants, revealing that active PP2C protein 
      phosphatases protect and stabilize RopGEF1 from ABA-mediated degradation.
      Interestingly, ABA-mediated degradation of RopGEF1 also plays an important role
      in ABA-mediated inhibition of lateral root growth. The presented findings point
      to a PP2C-RopGEF-ROP/RAC control loop model that is proposed to aid in shutting
      off ABA signal transduction, to counteract leaky ABA signal transduction caused
      by "monomeric" PYL/RCAR ABA receptors in the absence of stress, and facilitate
      signaling in response to ABA.

TI  - Scientists' Reputations Are Based on Getting It Right, Not Being Right.
PG  - e1002460
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002460 [doi]
AB  - Replication is vital for increasing precision and accuracy of scientific claims. 
      However, when replications "succeed" or "fail," they could have reputational
      consequences for the claim's originators. Surveys of United States adults (N =
      4,786), undergraduates (N = 428), and researchers (N = 313) showed that
      reputational assessments of scientists were based more on how they pursue
      knowledge and respond to replication evidence, not whether the initial results
      were true. When comparing one scientist that produced boring but certain results 
      with another that produced exciting but uncertain results, opinion favored the
      former despite researchers' belief in more rewards for the latter. Considering
      idealized views of scientific practices offers an opportunity to address
      incentives to reward both innovation and verification.

TI  - Badges to Acknowledge Open Practices: A Simple, Low-Cost, Effective Method for
      Increasing Transparency.
PG  - e1002456
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456 [doi]
AB  - Beginning January 2014, Psychological Science gave authors the opportunity to
      signal open data and materials if they qualified for badges that accompanied
      published articles. Before badges, less than 3% of Psychological Science articles
      reported open data. After badges, 23% reported open data, with an accelerating
      trend; 39% reported open data in the first half of 2015, an increase of more than
      an order of magnitude from baseline. There was no change over time in the low
      rates of data sharing among comparison journals. Moreover, reporting openness
      does not guarantee openness. When badges were earned, reportedly available data
      were more likely to be actually available, correct, usable, and complete than
      when badges were not earned. Open materials also increased to a weaker degree,
      and there was more variability among comparison journals. Badges are simple,
      effective signals to promote open practices and improve preservation of data and 
      materials by using independent repositories.

TI  - Ribosomal Stalk Protein Silencing Partially Corrects the DeltaF508-CFTR
      Functional Expression Defect.
PG  - e1002462
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002462 [doi]
AB  - The most common cystic fibrosis (CF) causing mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 
      508 (DeltaF508 or Phe508del), results in functional expression defect of the CF
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of 
      secretory epithelia, which is attributed to the degradation of the misfolded
      channel at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Deletion of phenylalanine 670
      (DeltaF670) in the yeast oligomycin resistance 1 gene (YOR1, an ABC transporter) 
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenocopies the DeltaF508-CFTR folding and
      trafficking defects. Genome-wide phenotypic (phenomic) analysis of the
      Yor1-DeltaF670 biogenesis identified several modifier genes of mRNA processing
      and translation, which conferred oligomycin resistance to yeast. Silencing of
      orthologues of these candidate genes enhanced the DeltaF508-CFTR functional
      expression at the apical PM in human CF bronchial epithelia. Although knockdown
      of RPL12, a component of the ribosomal stalk, attenuated the translational
      elongation rate, it increased the folding efficiency as well as the
      conformational stability of the DeltaF508-CFTR, manifesting in 3-fold augmented
      PM density and function of the mutant. Combination of RPL12 knockdown with the
      corrector drug, VX-809 (lumacaftor) restored the mutant function to ~50% of the
      wild-type channel in primary CFTRDeltaF508/DeltaF508 human bronchial epithelia.
      These results and the observation that silencing of other ribosomal stalk
      proteins partially rescue the loss-of-function phenotype of DeltaF508-CFTR
      suggest that the ribosomal stalk modulates the folding efficiency of the mutant
      and is a potential therapeutic target for correction of the DeltaF508-CFTR
      folding defect.

TI  - GPCRs Direct Germline Development and Somatic Gonad Function in Planarians.
PG  - e1002457
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002457 [doi]
AB  - Planarians display remarkable plasticity in maintenance of their germline, with
      the ability to develop or dismantle reproductive tissues in response to systemic 
      and environmental cues. Here, we investigated the role of G protein-coupled
      receptors (GPCRs) in this dynamic germline regulation. By genome-enabled receptor
      mining, we identified 566 putative planarian GPCRs and classified them into
      conserved and phylum-specific subfamilies. We performed a functional screen to
      identify NPYR-1 as the cognate receptor for NPY-8, a neuropeptide required for
      sexual maturation and germ cell differentiation. Similar to NPY-8, knockdown of
      this receptor results in loss of differentiated germ cells and sexual maturity.
      NPYR-1 is expressed in neuroendocrine cells of the central nervous system and can
      be activated specifically by NPY-8 in cell-based assays. Additionally, we
      screened the complement of GPCRs with expression enriched in sexually reproducing
      planarians, and identified an orphan chemoreceptor family member, ophis, that
      controls differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs). ophis is expressed in
      somatic cells of male and female gonads, as well as in accessory reproductive
      tissues. We have previously shown that somatic gonadal cells are required for
      male GSC specification and maintenance in planarians. However, ophis is not
      essential for GSC specification or maintenance and, therefore, defines a
      secondary role for planarian gonadal niche cells in promoting GSC
      differentiation. Our studies uncover the complement of planarian GPCRs and reveal
      previously unappreciated roles for these receptors in systemic and local (i.e.,
      niche) regulation of germ cell development.

TI  - Platelets Guide Leukocytes to Their Sites of Extravasation.
PG  - e1002459
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002459 [doi]
AB  - Effective immune responses require the directed migration of leukocytes from the 
      vasculature to the site of injury or infection. How immune cells "find" their
      site of extravasation remains largely obscure. Here, we identified a previously
      unrecognized role of platelets as pathfinders guiding leukocytes to their exit
      points in the microvasculature: upon onset of inflammation, circulating platelets
      were found to immediately adhere at distinct sites in venular microvessels
      enabling these cellular blood components to capture neutrophils and, in turn,
      inflammatory monocytes via CD40-CD40L-dependent interactions. In this cellular
      crosstalk, ligation of PSGL-1 by P-selectin leads to ERK1/2 MAPK-dependent
      conformational changes of leukocyte integrins, which promote the successive
      extravasation of neutrophils and monocytes to the perivascular tissue.
      Conversely, blockade of this cellular partnership resulted in misguided,
      inefficient leukocyte responses. Our experimental data uncover a
      platelet-directed, spatiotemporally organized, multicellular crosstalk that is
      essential for effective trafficking of leukocytes to the site of inflammation.

AB  - The oversupply of postdoctoral scholars relative to available faculty positions
      has led to calls for better assessment of career outcomes. Here, we report the
      results of a study of postdoctoral outcomes at the University of California, San 
      Francisco, and suggest that institutions have an obligation to determine where
      their postdoc alumni are employed and to share this information with current and 
      future trainees. Further, we contend that local efforts will be more meaningful
      than a national survey, because of the great variability in training environment 
      and the classification of postdoctoral scholars among institutions. We provide a 
      framework and methodology that can be adopted by others, with the goal of
      developing a finely grained portrait of postdoctoral career outcomes across the
      United States.

TI  - Neuronal Cell Fate Specification by the Convergence of Different Spatiotemporal
      Cues on a Common Terminal Selector Cascade.
PG  - e1002450
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002450 [doi]
AB  - Specification of the myriad of unique neuronal subtypes found in the nervous
      system depends upon spatiotemporal cues and terminal selector gene cascades,
      often acting in sequential combinatorial codes to determine final cell fate.
      However, a specific neuronal cell subtype can often be generated in different
      parts of the nervous system and at different stages, indicating that different
      spatiotemporal cues can converge on the same terminal selectors to thereby
      generate a similar cell fate. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying such 
      convergence are poorly understood. The Nplp1 neuropeptide neurons in the
      Drosophila ventral nerve cord can be subdivided into the thoracic-ventral Tv1
      neurons and the dorsal-medial dAp neurons. The activation of Nplp1 in Tv1 and dAp
      neurons depends upon the same terminal selector cascade: col>ap/eya>dimm>Nplp1.
      However, Tv1 and dAp neurons are generated by different neural progenitors
      (neuroblasts) with different spatiotemporal appearance. Here, we find that the
      same terminal selector cascade is triggered by Kr/pdm>grn in dAp neurons, but by 
      Antp/hth/exd/lbe/cas in Tv1 neurons. Hence, two different spatiotemporal
      combinations can funnel into a common downstream terminal selector cascade to
      determine a highly related cell fate.

TI  - Neuropeptides Modulate Female Chemosensory Processing upon Mating in Drosophila.
PG  - e1002455
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002455 [doi]
AB  - A female's reproductive state influences her perception of odors and tastes along
      with her changed behavioral state and physiological needs. The mechanism that
      modulates chemosensory processing, however, remains largely elusive. Using
      Drosophila, we have identified a behavioral, neuronal, and genetic mechanism that
      adapts the senses of smell and taste, the major modalities for food quality
      perception, to the physiological needs of a gravid female. Pungent smelling
      polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are essential for cell
      proliferation, reproduction, and embryonic development in all animals. A
      polyamine-rich diet increases reproductive success in many species, including
      flies. Using a combination of behavioral analysis and in vivo physiology, we show
      that polyamine attraction is modulated in gravid females through a G-protein
      coupled receptor, the sex peptide receptor (SPR), and its neuropeptide ligands,
      MIPs (myoinhibitory peptides), which act directly in the polyamine-detecting
      olfactory and taste neurons. This modulation is triggered by an increase of SPR
      expression in chemosensory neurons, which is sufficient to convert virgin to
      mated female olfactory choice behavior. Together, our data show that
      neuropeptide-mediated modulation of peripheral chemosensory neurons increases a
      gravid female's preference for important nutrients, thereby ensuring optimal
      conditions for her growing progeny.

AB  - The ability to find and consume nutrient-rich diets for successful reproduction
      and survival is fundamental to animal life. Among the nutrients important for all
      animals are polyamines, a class of pungent smelling compounds required in
      numerous cellular and organismic processes. Polyamine deficiency or excess has
      detrimental effects on health, cognitive function, reproduction, and lifespan.
      Here, we show that a diet high in polyamine is beneficial and increases
      reproductive success of flies, and we unravel the sensory mechanisms that attract
      Drosophila to polyamine-rich food and egg-laying substrates. Using a combination 
      of behavioral genetics and in vivo calcium imaging, we demonstrate that
      Drosophila uses multisensory detection to find and evaluate polyamines present in
      overripe and fermenting fruit, their favored feeding and egg-laying substrate. In
      the olfactory system, two coexpressed ionotropic receptors (IRs), IR76b and
      IR41a, mediate the long-range attraction to the odor. In the gustatory system,
      multimodal taste sensation by IR76b receptor and GR66a bitter receptor neurons is
      used to evaluate quality and valence of the polyamine providing a mechanism for
      the fly's high attraction to polyamine-rich and sweet decaying fruit. Given their
      universal and highly conserved biological roles, we propose that the ability to
      evaluate food for polyamine content may impact health and reproductive success
      also of other animals including humans.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002453 [doi]
AB  - Agricultural biotechnology continues to generate considerable controversy. We
      argue that to address this controversy, serious changes to governance are needed.
      The new wave of genomic tools and products (e.g., CRISPR, gene drives, RNAi,
      synthetic biology, and genetically modified [GM] insects and fish), provide a
      particularly useful opportunity to reflect on and revise agricultural
      biotechnology governance. In response, we present five essential features to
      advance more socially responsible forms of governance. In presenting these, we
      hope to stimulate further debate and action towards improved forms of governance,
      particularly as these new genomic tools and products continue to emerge.

AB  - Functional residues in proteins tend to be highly conserved over evolutionary
      time. However, to what extent functional sites impose evolutionary constraints on
      nearby or even more distant residues is not known. Here, we report pervasive
      conservation gradients toward catalytic residues in a dataset of 524 distinct
      enzymes: evolutionary conservation decreases approximately linearly with
      increasing distance to the nearest catalytic residue in the protein structure.
      This trend encompasses, on average, 80% of the residues in any enzyme, and it is 
      independent of known structural constraints on protein evolution such as residue 
      packing or solvent accessibility. Further, the trend exists in both monomeric and
      multimeric enzymes and irrespective of enzyme size and/or location of the active 
      site in the enzyme structure. By contrast, sites in protein-protein interfaces,
      unlike catalytic residues, are only weakly conserved and induce only minor rate
      gradients. In aggregate, these observations show that functional sites, and in
      particular catalytic residues, induce long-range evolutionary constraints in
      enzymes.

TI  - Cued Reactivation of Motor Learning during Sleep Leads to Overnight Changes in
      Functional Brain Activity and Connectivity.
PG  - e1002451
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002451 [doi]
AB  - Sleep plays a role in memory consolidation. This is demonstrated by improved
      performance and neural plasticity underlying that improvement after sleep.
      Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) allows the manipulation of sleep-dependent
      consolidation through intentionally biasing the replay of specific memories in
      sleep, but the underlying neural basis of these altered memories remains unclear.
      We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show a change in the
      neural representation of a motor memory after targeted reactivation in slow-wave 
      sleep (SWS). Participants learned two serial reaction time task (SRTT) sequences 
      associated with different auditory tones (high or low pitch). During subsequent
      SWS, one sequence was reactivated by replaying the associated tones. Participants
      were retested on both sequences the following day during fMRI. As predicted, they
      showed faster reaction times for the cued sequence after targeted memory
      reactivation. Furthermore, increased activity in bilateral caudate nucleus and
      hippocampus for the cued relative to uncued sequence was associated with time in 
      SWS, while increased cerebellar and cortical motor activity was related to time
      in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Functional connectivity between the caudate
      nucleus and hippocampus was also increased after targeted memory reactivation.
      These findings suggest that the offline performance gains associated with memory 
      reactivation are supported by altered functional activity in key cognitive and
      motor networks, and that this consolidation is differentially mediated by both
      REM sleep and SWS.

TI  - Structural and Molecular Mechanism of CdpR Involved in Quorum-Sensing and
      Bacterial Virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
PG  - e1002449
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002449 [doi]
AB  - Although quorum-sensing (QS) systems are important regulators of virulence gene
      expression in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their
      detailed regulatory mechanisms have not been fully characterized. Here, we show
      that deletion of PA2588 resulted in increased production of pyocyanin and
      biofilm, as well as enhanced pathogenicity in a mouse model. To gain insights
      into the function of PA2588, we performed a ChIP-seq assay and identified 28
      targets of PA2588, including the intergenic region between PA2588 and pqsH, which
      encodes the key synthase of Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). Though the
      C-terminal domain was similar to DNA-binding regions of other AraC family
      members, structural studies revealed that PA2588 has a novel fold at the
      N-terminal region (NTR), and its C-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain is also
      unique in DNA recognition. We also demonstrated that the adaptor protein ClpS, an
      essential regulator of ATP-dependent protease ClpAP, directly interacted with
      PA2588 before delivering CdpR to ClpAP for degradation. We named PA2588 as CdpR
      (ClpAP-degradation and pathogenicity Regulator). Moreover, deletion of clpP or
      clpS/clpA promotes bacterial survival in a mouse model of acute pneumonia
      infection. Taken together, this study uncovered that CdpR is an important QS
      regulator, which can interact with the ClpAS-P system to regulate the expression 
      of virulence factors and pathogenicity.

TI  - Connective Auxin Transport in the Shoot Facilitates Communication between Shoot
      Apices.
PG  - e1002446
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002446 [doi]
AB  - The bulk polar movement of the plant signaling molecule auxin through the stem is
      a long-recognized but poorly understood phenomenon. Here we show that the highly 
      polar, high conductance polar auxin transport stream (PATS) is only part of a
      multimodal auxin transport network in the stem. The dynamics of auxin movement
      through stems are inconsistent with a single polar transport regime and instead
      suggest widespread low conductance, less polar auxin transport in the stem, which
      we term connective auxin transport (CAT). The bidirectional movement of auxin
      between the PATS and the surrounding tissues, mediated by CAT, can explain the
      complex auxin transport kinetics we observe. We show that the auxin efflux
      carriers PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 are major contributors to this auxin transport
      connectivity and that their activity is important for communication between shoot
      apices in the regulation of shoot branching. We propose that the PATS provides a 
      long-range, consolidated stream of information throughout the plant, while CAT
      acts locally, allowing tissues to modulate and be modulated by information in the
      PATS.

PG  - e1002448
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002448 [doi]
AB  - The One Health initiative is a global effort fostering interdisciplinary
      collaborations to address challenges in human, animal, and environmental health. 
      While One Health has received considerable press, its benefits remain unclear
      because its effects have not been quantitatively described. We systematically
      surveyed the published literature and used social network analysis to measure
      interdisciplinarity in One Health studies constructing dynamic pathogen
      transmission models. The number of publications fulfilling our search criteria
      increased by 14.6% per year, which is faster than growth rates for life sciences 
      as a whole and for most biology subdisciplines. Surveyed publications clustered
      into three communities: one used by ecologists, one used by veterinarians, and a 
      third diverse-authorship community used by population biologists, mathematicians,
      epidemiologists, and experts in human health. Overlap between these communities
      increased through time in terms of author number, diversity of co-author
      affiliations, and diversity of citations. However, communities continue to differ
      in the systems studied, questions asked, and methods employed. While the
      infectious disease research community has made significant progress toward
      integrating its participating disciplines, some segregation--especially along the
      veterinary/ecological research interface--remains.

AB  - During development, sensory neurons must choose identities that allow them to
      detect specific signals and connect with appropriate target neurons. Ultimately, 
      these sensory neurons will successfully integrate into appropriate neural
      circuits to generate defined motor outputs, or behavior. This integration
      requires a developmental coordination between the identity of the neuron and the 
      identity of the circuit. The mechanisms that underlie this coordination are
      currently unknown. Here, we describe two modes of regulation that coordinate the 
      sensory identities of Drosophila melanogaster olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs)
      involved in sex-specific behaviors with the sex-specific behavioral circuit
      identity marker fruitless (fru). The first mode involves a developmental program 
      that coordinately restricts to appropriate ORNs the expression of fru and two
      olfactory receptors (Or47b and Ir84a) involved in sex-specific behaviors. This
      regulation requires the chromatin modulatory protein Alhambra (Alh). The second
      mode relies on the signaling from the olfactory receptors through CamK and
      histone acetyl transferase p300/CBP to maintain ORN-specific fru expression. Our 
      results highlight two feed-forward regulatory mechanisms with both
      developmentally hardwired and olfactory receptor activity-dependent components
      that establish and maintain fru expression in ORNs. Such a dual mechanism of fru 
      regulation in ORNs might be a trait of neurons driving plastic aspects of
      sex-specific behaviors.

AB  - For millennia, seeds have been freely available to use for farming and plant
      breeding without restriction. Within the past century, however, intellectual
      property rights (IPRs) have threatened this tradition. In response, a movement
      has emerged to counter the trend toward increasing consolidation of control and
      ownership of plant germplasm. One effort, the Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI, 
      www.osseeds.org), aims to ensure access to crop genetic resources by embracing an
      open source mechanism that fosters exchange and innovation among farmers, plant
      breeders, and seed companies. Plant breeders across many sectors have taken the
      OSSI Pledge to create a protected commons of plant germplasm for future
      generations.

AB  - In an age of free international shipments of mail-ordered seeds and plants, more

      in a preemptive response based on an internationally coordinated genomic
      deployment of global biodiversity in the largest breeding project since the
      "Garden of Eden." This plan will enrich the narrow genetic basis of annual and
      perennial plants with adaptations to changing environments and resistances to the

TI  - Tracking Resilience to Infections by Mapping Disease Space.
PG  - e1002436
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002436 [doi]
AB  - Infected hosts differ in their responses to pathogens; some hosts are resilient
      and recover their original health, whereas others follow a divergent path and
      die. To quantitate these differences, we propose mapping the routes infected
      individuals take through "disease space." We find that when plotting
      physiological parameters against each other, many pairs have hysteretic
      relationships that identify the current location of the host and predict the
      future route of the infection. These maps can readily be constructed from
      experimental longitudinal data, and we provide two methods to generate the maps
      from the cross-sectional data that is commonly gathered in field trials. We
      hypothesize that resilient hosts tend to take small loops through disease space, 
      whereas nonresilient individuals take large loops. We support this hypothesis
      with experimental data in mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi, finding that
      dying mice trace a large arc in red blood cells (RBCs) by reticulocyte space as
      compared to surviving mice. We find that human malaria patients who are
      heterozygous for sickle cell hemoglobin occupy a small area of RBCs by
      reticulocyte space, suggesting this approach can be used to distinguish
      resilience in human populations. This technique should be broadly useful in
      describing the in-host dynamics of infections in both model hosts and patients at
      both population and individual levels.

TI  - How Many Parameters Does It Take to Describe Disease Tolerance?
PG  - e1002435
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002435 [doi]
AB  - The study of infectious disease has been aided by model organisms, which have
      helped to elucidate molecular mechanisms and contributed to the development of
      new treatments; however, the lack of a conceptual framework for unifying findings
      across models, combined with host variability, has impeded progress and
      translation. Here, we fill this gap with a simple graphical and mathematical
      framework to study disease tolerance, the dose response curve relating health to 
      microbe load; this approach helped uncover parameters that were previously
      overlooked. Using a model experimental system in which we challenged Drosophila
      melanogaster with the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, we tested this framework, 
      finding that microbe growth, the immune response, and disease tolerance were all 
      well represented by sigmoid models. As we altered the system by varying host or
      pathogen genetics, disease tolerance varied, as we would expect if it was indeed 
      governed by parameters controlling the sensitivity of the system (the number of
      bacteria required to trigger a response) and maximal effect size according to a
      logistic equation. Though either the pathogen or host immune response or both
      together could theoretically be the proximal cause of pathology that killed the
      flies, we found that the pathogen, but not the immune response, drove damage in
      this model. With this new understanding of the circuitry controlling disease
      tolerance, we can now propose better ways of choosing, combining, and developing 
      treatments.

PG  - e1002445
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002445 [doi]
AB  - The primate visual system consists of a ventral stream, specialized for object
      recognition, and a dorsal visual stream, which is crucial for spatial vision and 
      actions. However, little is known about the interactions and information flow
      between these two streams. We investigated these interactions within the network 
      processing three-dimensional (3D) object information, comprising both the dorsal 
      and ventral stream. Reversible inactivation of the macaque caudal intraparietal
      area (CIP) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reduced fMRI
      activations in posterior parietal cortex in the dorsal stream and, surprisingly, 
      also in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC) in the ventral visual stream. Moreover,
      CIP inactivation caused a perceptual deficit in a depth-structure categorization 
      task. CIP-microstimulation during fMRI further suggests that CIP projects via
      posterior parietal areas to the ITC in the ventral stream. To our knowledge,
      these results provide the first causal evidence for the flow of visual 3D
      information from the dorsal stream to the ventral stream, and identify CIP as a
      key area for depth-structure processing. Thus, combining reversible inactivation 
      and electrical microstimulation during fMRI provides a detailed view of the
      functional interactions between the two visual processing streams.

TI  - Structure of Type IIL Restriction-Modification Enzyme MmeI in Complex with DNA
      Has Implications for Engineering New Specificities.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002442 [doi]
AB  - The creation of restriction enzymes with programmable DNA-binding and -cleavage
      specificities has long been a goal of modern biology. The recently discovered
      Type IIL MmeI family of restriction-and-modification (RM) enzymes that possess a 
      shared target recognition domain provides a framework for engineering such new
      specificities. However, a lack of structural information on Type IIL enzymes has 
      limited the repertoire that can be rationally engineered. We report here a
      crystal structure of MmeI in complex with its DNA substrate and an
      S-adenosylmethionine analog (Sinefungin). The structure uncovers for the first
      time the interactions that underlie MmeI-DNA recognition and methylation
      (5'-TCCRAC-3'; R = purine) and provides a molecular basis for changing
      specificity at four of the six base pairs of the recognition sequence
      (5'-TCCRAC-3'). Surprisingly, the enzyme is resilient to specificity changes at
      the first position of the recognition sequence (5'-TCCRAC-3'). Collectively, the 
      structure provides a basis for engineering further derivatives of MmeI and
      delineates which base pairs of the recognition sequence are more amenable to
      alterations than others.

TI  - Roles of the TRAPP-II Complex and the Exocyst in Membrane Deposition during
      Fission Yeast Cytokinesis.
PG  - e1002437
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002437 [doi]
AB  - The cleavage-furrow tip adjacent to the actomyosin contractile ring is believed
      to be the predominant site for plasma-membrane insertion through exocyst-tethered
      vesicles during cytokinesis. Here we found that most secretory vesicles are
      delivered by myosin-V on linear actin cables in fission yeast cytokinesis.
      Surprisingly, by tracking individual exocytic and endocytic events, we found that
      vesicles with new membrane are deposited to the cleavage furrow relatively evenly
      during contractile-ring constriction, but the rim of the cleavage furrow is the
      main site for endocytosis. Fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane requires
      vesicle tethers. Our data suggest that the transport particle protein II
      (TRAPP-II) complex and Rab11 GTPase Ypt3 help to tether secretory vesicles or
      tubulovesicular structures along the cleavage furrow while the exocyst tethers
      vesicles at the rim of the division plane. We conclude that the exocyst and
      TRAPP-II complex have distinct localizations at the division site, but both are
      important for membrane expansion and exocytosis during cytokinesis.

TI  - Characterization of Greenbeard Genes Involved in Long-Distance Kind
      Discrimination in a Microbial Eukaryote.
PG  - e1002431
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002431 [doi]
AB  - Microorganisms are capable of communication and cooperation to perform social
      activities. Cooperation can be enforced using kind discrimination mechanisms in
      which individuals preferentially help or punish others, depending on genetic
      relatedness only at certain loci. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa,
      genetically identical asexual spores (germlings) communicate and fuse in a highly
      regulated process, which is associated with fitness benefits during colony
      establishment. Recognition and chemotropic interactions between isogenic
      germlings requires oscillation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      signal transduction protein complex (NRC-1, MEK-2, MAK-2, and the scaffold
      protein HAM-5) to specialized cell fusion structures termed conidial anastomosis 
      tubes. Using a population of 110 wild N. crassa isolates, we investigated
      germling fusion between genetically unrelated individuals and discovered that
      chemotropic interactions are regulated by kind discrimination. Distinct
      communication groups were identified, in which germlings within one communication
      group interacted at high frequency, while germlings from different communication 
      groups avoided each other. Bulk segregant analysis followed by whole genome
      resequencing identified three linked genes (doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3), which were 
      associated with communication group phenotype. Alleles at doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3
      fell into five haplotypes that showed transspecies polymorphism. Swapping doc-1
      and doc-2 alleles from different communication group strains was necessary and
      sufficient to confer communication group affiliation. During chemotropic
      interactions, DOC-1 oscillated with MAK-2 to the tips of conidial anastomosis
      tubes, while DOC-2 was statically localized to the plasma membrane. Our data
      indicate that doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3 function as "greenbeard" genes, involved in
      mediating long-distance kind recognition that involves actively searching for
      one's own type, resulting in cooperation between non-genealogical relatives. Our 
      findings serve as a basis for investigations into the mechanisms associated with 
      attraction, fusion, and kind recognition in other eukaryotic species.

TI  - Kif13b Regulates PNS and CNS Myelination through the Dlg1 Scaffold.
PG  - e1002440
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002440 [doi]
AB  - Microtubule-based kinesin motors have many cellular functions, including the
      transport of a variety of cargos. However, unconventional roles have recently
      emerged, and kinesins have also been reported to act as scaffolding proteins and 
      signaling molecules. In this work, we further extend the notion of unconventional
      functions for kinesin motor proteins, and we propose that Kif13b kinesin acts as 
      a signaling molecule regulating peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central
      nervous system (CNS) myelination. In this process, positive and negative signals 
      must be tightly coordinated in time and space to orchestrate myelin biogenesis.
      Here, we report that in Schwann cells Kif13b positively regulates myelination by 
      promoting p38gamma mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated
      phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Discs large 1 (Dlg1), a known brake on
      myelination, which downregulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/v-AKT
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) pathway. Interestingly, Kif13b also
      negatively regulates Dlg1 stability in oligodendrocytes, in which Dlg1, in
      contrast to Schwann cells, enhances AKT activation and promotes myelination.
      Thus, our data indicate that Kif13b is a negative regulator of CNS myelination.
      In summary, we propose a novel function for the Kif13b kinesin in glial cells as 
      a key component of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which controls myelination in 
      both PNS and CNS.

TI  - Time Slices: What Is the Duration of a Percept?
PG  - e1002433
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002433 [doi]
AB  - We experience the world as a seamless stream of percepts. However, intriguing
      illusions and recent experiments suggest that the world is not continuously
      translated into conscious perception. Instead, perception seems to operate in a
      discrete manner, just like movies appear continuous although they consist of
      discrete images. To explain how the temporal resolution of human vision can be
      fast compared to sluggish conscious perception, we propose a novel conceptual
      framework in which features of objects, such as their color, are
      quasi-continuously and unconsciously analyzed with high temporal resolution. Like
      other features, temporal features, such as duration, are coded as quantitative
      labels. When unconscious processing is "completed," all features are
      simultaneously rendered conscious at discrete moments in time, sometimes even
      hundreds of milliseconds after stimuli were presented.

AB  - It was recently proposed that long-term population studies be exempted from the
      expectation that authors publicly archive the primary data underlying published
      articles. Such studies are valuable to many areas of ecological and evolutionary 
      biological research, and multiple risks to their viability were anticipated as a 
      result of public data archiving (PDA), ultimately all stemming from independent
      reuse of archived data. However, empirical assessment was missing, making it
      difficult to determine whether such fears are realistic. I addressed this by
      surveying data packages from long-term population studies archived in the Dryad
      Digital Repository. I found no evidence that PDA results in reuse of data by
      independent parties, suggesting the purported costs of PDA for long-term
      population studies have been overstated.

AB  - Numerous studies demonstrating that statistical errors are common in basic
      science publications have led to calls to improve statistical training for basic 
      scientists. In this article, we sought to evaluate statistical requirements for
      PhD training and to identify opportunities for improving biostatistics education 
      in the basic sciences. We provide recommendations for improving statistics
      training for basic biomedical scientists, including: 1. Encouraging departments
      to require statistics training, 2. Tailoring coursework to the students' fields
      of research, and 3. Developing tools and strategies to promote education and
      dissemination of statistical knowledge. We also provide a list of statistical
      considerations that should be addressed in statistics education for basic
      scientists.

TI  - Excessive Osteocytic Fgf23 Secretion Contributes to Pyrophosphate Accumulation
      and Mineralization Defect in Hyp Mice.
PG  - e1002427
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002427 [doi]
AB  - X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most frequent form of inherited rickets in
      humans caused by mutations in the phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to
      endopeptidases on the X-chromosome (PHEX). Hyp mice, a murine homologue of XLH,
      are characterized by hypophosphatemia, inappropriately low serum vitamin D
      levels, increased serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (Fgf23), and osteomalacia.
      Although Fgf23 is known to be responsible for hypophosphatemia and reduced
      vitamin D hormone levels in Hyp mice, its putative role as an auto-/paracrine
      osteomalacia-causing factor has not been explored. We recently reported that
      Fgf23 is a suppressor of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (Tnap)
      transcription via FGF receptor-3 (FGFR3) signaling, leading to inhibition of
      mineralization through accumulation of the TNAP substrate pyrophosphate. Here, we
      report that the pyrophosphate concentration is increased in Hyp bones, and that
      Tnap expression is decreased in Hyp-derived osteocyte-like cells but not in
      Hyp-derived osteoblasts ex vivo and in vitro. In situ mRNA expression profiling
      in bone cryosections revealed a ~70-fold up-regulation of Fgfr3 mRNA in
      osteocytes versus osteoblasts of Hyp mice. In addition, we show that blocking of 
      increased Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling with anti-Fgf23 antibodies or an FGFR3 inhibitor 
      partially restored the suppression of Tnap expression, phosphate production, and 
      mineralization, and decreased pyrophosphate concentration in Hyp-derived
      osteocyte-like cells in vitro. In vivo, bone-specific deletion of Fgf23 in Hyp
      mice rescued the suppressed TNAP activity in osteocytes of Hyp mice. Moreover,
      treatment of wild-type osteoblasts or mice with recombinant FGF23 suppressed Tnap
      mRNA expression and increased pyrophosphate concentrations in the culture medium 
      and in bone, respectively. In conclusion, we found that the cell autonomous
      increase in Fgf23 secretion in Hyp osteocytes drives the accumulation of
      pyrophosphate through auto-/paracrine suppression of TNAP. Hence, we have
      identified a novel mechanism contributing to the mineralization defect in Hyp
      mice.

TI  - NREM2 and Sleep Spindles Are Instrumental to the Consolidation of Motor Sequence 
      Memories.
PG  - e1002429
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002429 [doi]
AB  - Although numerous studies have convincingly demonstrated that sleep plays a
      critical role in motor sequence learning (MSL) consolidation, the specific
      contribution of the different sleep stages in this type of memory consolidation
      is still contentious. To probe the role of stage 2 non-REM sleep (NREM2) in this 
      process, we used a conditioning protocol in three different groups of
      participants who either received an odor during initial training on a motor
      sequence learning task and were re-exposed to this odor during different sleep
      stages of the post-training night (i.e., NREM2 sleep [Cond-NREM2], REM sleep
      [Cond-REM], or were not conditioned during learning but exposed to the odor
      during NREM2 [NoCond]). Results show that the Cond-NREM2 group had significantly 
      higher gains in performance at retest than both the Cond-REM and NoCond groups.
      Also, only the Cond-NREM2 group yielded significant changes in sleep spindle
      characteristics during cueing. Finally, we found that a change in frequency of
      sleep spindles during cued-memory reactivation mediated the relationship between 
      the experimental groups and gains in performance the next day. These findings
      strongly suggest that cued-memory reactivation during NREM2 sleep triggers an
      increase in sleep spindle activity that is then related to the consolidation of
      motor sequence memories.

AB  - Coral reefs on remote islands and atolls are less exposed to direct human
      stressors but are becoming increasingly vulnerable because of their development
      for geopolitical and military purposes. Here we document dredging and filling
      activities by countries in the South China Sea, where building new islands and
      channels on atolls is leading to considerable losses of, and perhaps irreversible
      damages to, unique coral reef ecosystems. Preventing similar damage across other 
      reefs in the region necessitates the urgent development of cooperative management
      of disputed territories in the South China Sea. We suggest using the Antarctic
      Treaty as a positive precedent for such international cooperation.

TI  - Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Dependent Mutual Amplification between Netrin-1 
      and the Hepatitis C Virus.
PG  - e1002421
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002421 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an oncogenic virus associated with the onset of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study investigated the possible link 
      between HCV infection and Netrin-1, a ligand for dependence receptors that
      sustains tumorigenesis, in particular in inflammation-associated tumors. We show 
      that Netrin-1 expression is significantly elevated in HCV+ liver biopsies
      compared to hepatitis B virus (HBV+) and uninfected samples. Furthermore,
      Netrin-1 was upregulated in all histological stages of HCV+ hepatic lesions, from
      minimal liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and HCC, compared to histologically matched
      HCV- tissues. Both cirrhosis and HCV contributed to the induction of Netrin-1
      expression, whereas anti-HCV treatment resulted in a reduction of Netrin-1
      expression. In vitro, HCV increased the level and translation of Netrin-1 in a
      NS5A-La-related protein 1 (LARP1)-dependent fashion. Knockdown and forced
      expression experiments identified the receptor uncoordinated receptor-5 (UNC5A)
      as an antagonist of the Netrin-1 signal, though it did not affect the death of
      HCV-infected cells. Netrin-1 enhanced infectivity of HCV particles and promoted
      viral entry by increasing the activation and decreasing the recycling of the
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a protein that is dysregulated in HCC.
      Netrin-1 and HCV are, therefore, reciprocal inducers in vitro and in patients, as
      seen from the increase in viral morphogenesis and viral entry, both phenomena
      converging toward an increase in the level of infectivity of HCV virions. This
      functional association involving a cancer-related virus and Netrin-1 argues for

AB  - Cloud cover can influence numerous important ecological processes, including
      reproduction, growth, survival, and behavior, yet our assessment of its
      importance at the appropriate spatial scales has remained remarkably limited. If 
      captured over a large extent yet at sufficiently fine spatial grain, cloud cover 
      dynamics may provide key information for delineating a variety of habitat types
      and predicting species distributions. Here, we develop new near-global,
      fine-grain ( approximately 1 km) monthly cloud frequencies from 15 y of
      twice-daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite
      images that expose spatiotemporal cloud cover dynamics of previously undocumented
      global complexity. We demonstrate that cloud cover varies strongly in its
      geographic heterogeneity and that the direct, observation-based nature of
      cloud-derived metrics can improve predictions of habitats, ecosystem, and species
      distributions with reduced spatial autocorrelation compared to commonly used
      interpolated climate data. These findings support the fundamental role of remote 
      sensing as an effective lens through which to understand and globally monitor the
      fine-grain spatial variability of key biodiversity and ecosystem properties.

TI  - Crystal Structure of an Ammonia-Permeable Aquaporin.
PG  - e1002411
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002411 [doi]
AB  - Aquaporins of the TIP subfamily (Tonoplast Intrinsic Proteins) have been
      suggested to facilitate permeation of water and ammonia across the vacuolar
      membrane of plants, allowing the vacuole to efficiently sequester ammonium ions
      and counteract cytosolic fluctuations of ammonia. Here, we report the structure
      determined at 1.18 A resolution from twinned crystals of Arabidopsis thaliana
      aquaporin AtTIP2;1 and confirm water and ammonia permeability of the purified
      protein reconstituted in proteoliposomes as further substantiated by molecular
      dynamics simulations. The structure of AtTIP2;1 reveals an extended selectivity
      filter with the conserved arginine of the filter adopting a unique unpredicted
      position. The relatively wide pore and the polar nature of the selectivity filter
      clarify the ammonia permeability. By mutational studies, we show that the
      identified determinants in the extended selectivity filter region are sufficient 
      to convert a strictly water-specific human aquaporin into an AtTIP2;1-like
      ammonia channel. A flexible histidine and a novel water-filled side pore are
      speculated to deprotonate ammonium ions, thereby possibly increasing permeation
      of ammonia. The molecular understanding of how aquaporins facilitate ammonia flux
      across membranes could potentially be used to modulate ammonia losses over the
      plasma membrane to the atmosphere, e.g., during photorespiration, and thereby to 
      modify the nitrogen use efficiency of plants.

TI  - Modulation of Cortical Oscillations by Low-Frequency Direct Cortical Stimulation 
      Is State-Dependent.
PG  - e1002424
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002424 [doi]
AB  - Cortical oscillations play a fundamental role in organizing large-scale
      functional brain networks. Noninvasive brain stimulation with temporally
      patterned waveforms such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have been proposed to
      modulate these oscillations. Thus, these stimulation modalities represent
      promising new approaches for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses in which
      these oscillations are impaired. However, the mechanism by which periodic brain
      stimulation alters endogenous oscillation dynamics is debated and appears to
      depend on brain state. Here, we demonstrate with a static model and a neural
      oscillator model that recurrent excitation in the thalamo-cortical circuit,
      together with recruitment of cortico-cortical connections, can explain the
      enhancement of oscillations by brain stimulation as a function of brain state. We
      then performed concurrent invasive recording and stimulation of the human
      cortical surface to elucidate the response of cortical oscillations to periodic
      stimulation and support the findings from the computational models. We found that
      (1) stimulation enhanced the targeted oscillation power, (2) this enhancement
      outlasted stimulation, and (3) the effect of stimulation depended on behavioral
      state. Together, our results show successful target engagement of oscillations by
      periodic brain stimulation and highlight the role of nonlinear interaction
      between endogenous network oscillations and stimulation. These mechanistic
      insights will contribute to the design of adaptive, more targeted stimulation
      paradigms.

AB  - Target 19, set by the Convention on Biological Diversity, seeks to improve the
      knowledge, science base, and technologies relating to biodiversity. We will fail 
      to achieve this target unless prolific biases in the field of conservation
      science are addressed. We reveal that comparatively less research is undertaken
      in the world's most biodiverse countries, the science conducted in these
      countries is often not led by researchers based in-country, and these scientists 
      are also underrepresented in important international fora. Mitigating these
      biases requires wide-ranging solutions: reforming open access publishing
      policies, enhancing science communication strategies, changing author attribution
      practices, improving representation in international processes, and strengthening
      infrastructure and human capacity for research in countries where it is most
      needed.

TI  - The Effects of Context and Attention on Spiking Activity in Human Early Visual
      Cortex.
PG  - e1002420
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002420 [doi]
AB  - Here we report the first quantitative analysis of spiking activity in human early
      visual cortex. We recorded multi-unit activity from two electrodes in area V2/V3 
      of a human patient implanted with depth electrodes as part of her treatment for
      epilepsy. We observed well-localized multi-unit receptive fields with tunings for
      contrast, orientation, spatial frequency, and size, similar to those reported in 
      the macaque. We also observed pronounced gamma oscillations in the local-field
      potential that could be used to estimate the underlying spiking response
      properties. Spiking responses were modulated by visual context and attention. We 
      observed orientation-tuned surround suppression: responses were suppressed by
      image regions with a uniform orientation and enhanced by orientation contrast.
      Additionally, responses were enhanced on regions that perceptually segregated
      from the background, indicating that neurons in the human visual cortex are
      sensitive to figure-ground structure. Spiking responses were also modulated by
      object-based attention. When the patient mentally traced a curve through the
      neurons' receptive fields, the accompanying shift of attention enhanced neuronal 
      activity. These results demonstrate that the tuning properties of cells in the
      human early visual cortex are similar to those in the macaque and that responses 
      can be modulated by both contextual factors and behavioral relevance. Our
      results, therefore, imply that the macaque visual system is an excellent model
      for the human visual cortex.

TI  - Low Genetic Quality Alters Key Dimensions of the Mutational Spectrum.
PG  - e1002419
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002419 [doi]
AB  - Mutations affect individual health, population persistence, adaptation,
      diversification, and genome evolution. There is evidence that the mutation rate
      varies among genotypes, but the causes of this variation are poorly understood.
      Here, we link differences in genetic quality with variation in spontaneous
      mutation in a Drosophila mutation accumulation experiment. We find that
      chromosomes maintained in low-quality genetic backgrounds experience a higher
      rate of indel mutation and a lower rate of gene conversion in a manner consistent
      with condition-based differences in the mechanisms used to repair DNA double
      strand breaks. These aspects of the mutational spectrum were also associated with
      body mass, suggesting that the effect of genetic quality on DNA repair was
      mediated by overall condition, and providing a mechanistic explanation for the
      differences in mutational fitness decline among these genotypes. The rate and
      spectrum of substitutions was unaffected by genetic quality, but we find
      variation in the probability of substitutions and indels with respect to several 
      aspects of local sequence context, particularly GC content, with implications for
      models of molecular evolution and genome scans for signs of selection. Our
      finding that the chances of mutation depend on genetic context and overall
      condition has important implications for how sequences evolve, the risk of
      extinction, and human health.

TI  - Hemotin, a Regulator of Phagocytosis Encoded by a Small ORF and Conserved across 
      Metazoans.
PG  - e1002395
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002395 [doi]
AB  - Translation of hundreds of small ORFs (smORFs) of less than 100 amino acids has
      recently been revealed in vertebrates and Drosophila. Some of these peptides have
      essential and conserved cellular functions. In Drosophila, we have predicted a
      particular smORF class encoding ~80 aa hydrophobic peptides, which may function
      in membranes and cell organelles. Here, we characterise hemotin, a gene encoding 
      an 88aa transmembrane smORF peptide localised to early endosomes in Drosophila
      macrophages. hemotin regulates endosomal maturation during phagocytosis by
      repressing the cooperation of 14-3-3zeta with specific phosphatidylinositol (PI) 
      enzymes. hemotin mutants accumulate undigested phagocytic material inside
      enlarged endo-lysosomes and as a result, hemotin mutants have reduced ability to 
      fight bacteria, and hence, have severely reduced life span and resistance to
      infections. We identify Stannin, a peptide involved in organometallic toxicity,
      as the Hemotin functional homologue in vertebrates, showing that this novel
      regulator of phagocytic processing is widely conserved, emphasizing the
      significance of smORF peptides in cell biology and disease.

TI  - Transgenerational Epigenetic Contributions to Stress Responses: Fact or Fiction?
PG  - e1002426
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002426 [doi]
AB  - There has been increasing interest in the possibility that behavioral
      experience--in particular, exposure to stress--can be passed on to subsequent
      generations through heritable epigenetic modifications. The possibility remains
      highly controversial, however, reflecting the lack of standardized definitions of
      epigenetics and the limited empirical support for potential mechanisms of
      transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Nonetheless, growing evidence supports 
      a role for epigenetic regulation as a key mechanism underlying lifelong
      regulation of gene expression that mediates stress vulnerability. This
      Perspective provides an overview of the multiple meanings of the term epigenetic,
      discusses the challenges of studying epigenetic contributions to stress
      susceptibility--and the experimental evidence for and against the existence of
      such mechanisms--and outlines steps required for future investigations.

TI  - Honey Bee Inhibitory Signaling Is Tuned to Threat Severity and Can Act as a
      Colony Alarm Signal.
PG  - e1002423
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002423 [doi]
AB  - Alarm communication is a key adaptation that helps social groups resist predation
      and rally defenses. In Asia, the world's largest hornet, Vespa mandarinia, and
      the smaller hornet, Vespa velutina, prey upon foragers and nests of the Asian
      honey bee, Apis cerana. We attacked foragers and colony nest entrances with these
      predators and provide the first evidence, in social insects, of an alarm signal
      that encodes graded danger and attack context. We show that, like Apis mellifera,
      A. cerana possesses a vibrational "stop signal," which can be triggered by
      predator attacks upon foragers and inhibits waggle dancing. Large hornet attacks 
      were more dangerous and resulted in higher bee mortality. Per attack at the
      colony level, large hornets elicited more stop signals than small hornets.
      Unexpectedly, stop signals elicited by large hornets (SS large hornet) had a
      significantly higher vibrational fundamental frequency than those elicited by
      small hornets (SS small hornet) and were more effective at inhibiting waggle
      dancing. Stop signals resulting from attacks upon the nest entrance (SS nest)
      were produced by foragers and guards and were significantly longer in pulse
      duration than stop signals elicited by attacks upon foragers (SS forager). Unlike
      SS forager, SS nest were targeted at dancing and non-dancing foragers and had the
      common effect, tuned to hornet threat level, of inhibiting bee departures from
      the safe interior of the nest. Meanwhile, nest defenders were triggered by the
      bee alarm pheromone and live hornet presence to heat-ball the hornet. In A.
      cerana, sophisticated recruitment communication that encodes food location, the
      waggle dance, is therefore matched with an inhibitory/alarm signal that encodes
      information about the context of danger and its threat level.

AB  - There is no unified place where genomics researchers can search through all
      available raw genomic data in a way similar to OMIM for genes or Uniprot for
      proteins. With the recent increase in the amount of genomic data that is being
      produced and the ever-growing promises of precision medicine, this is becoming
      more and more of a problem. DNAdigest is a charity working to promote efficient
      sharing of human genomic data to improve the outcome of genomic research and
      diagnostics for the benefit of patients. Repositive, a social enterprise spin-out
      of DNAdigest, is building an online platform that indexes genomic data stored in 
      repositories and thus enables researchers to search for and access a range of
      human genomic data sources through a single, easy-to-use interface, free of
      charge.

TI  - Separable Roles for a Caenorhabditis elegans RMI1 Homolog in Promoting and
      Antagonizing Meiotic Crossovers Ensure Faithful Chromosome Inheritance.
PG  - e1002412
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002412 [doi]
AB  - During the first meiotic division, crossovers (COs) between homologous
      chromosomes ensure their correct segregation. COs are produced by homologous
      recombination (HR)-mediated repair of programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).
      As more DSBs are induced than COs, mechanisms are required to establish a
      regulated number of COs and to repair remaining intermediates as non-crossovers
      (NCOs). We show that the Caenorhabditis elegans RMI1 homolog-1 (RMH-1) functions 
      during meiosis to promote both CO and NCO HR at appropriate chromosomal sites.
      RMH-1 accumulates at CO sites, dependent on known pro-CO factors, and acts to
      promote CO designation and enforce the CO outcome of HR-intermediate resolution. 
      RMH-1 also localizes at NCO sites and functions in parallel with SMC-5 to
      antagonize excess HR-based connections between chromosomes. Moreover, RMH-1 also 
      has a major role in channeling DSBs into an NCO HR outcome near the centers of
      chromosomes, thereby ensuring that COs form predominantly at off-center
      positions.

AB  - Bacteriophage modulation of microbial populations impacts critical processes in
      ocean, soil, and animal ecosystems. However, the role of bacteriophages with RNA 
      genomes (RNA bacteriophages) in these processes is poorly understood, in part
      because of the limited number of known RNA bacteriophage species. Here, we
      identify partial genome sequences of 122 RNA bacteriophage phylotypes that are
      highly divergent from each other and from previously described RNA
      bacteriophages. These novel RNA bacteriophage sequences were present in samples
      collected from a range of ecological niches worldwide, including invertebrates
      and extreme microbial sediment, demonstrating that they are more widely
      distributed than previously recognized. Genomic analyses of these novel
      bacteriophages yielded multiple novel genome organizations. Furthermore, one RNA 
      bacteriophage was detected in the transcriptome of a pure culture of Streptomyces
      avermitilis, suggesting for the first time that the known tropism of RNA
      bacteriophages may include gram-positive bacteria. Finally, reverse transcription
      PCR (RT-PCR)-based screening for two specific RNA bacteriophages in stool samples
      from a longitudinal cohort of macaques suggested that they are generally acutely 
      present rather than persistent.

AB  - The diversification of prokaryotes is accelerated by their ability to acquire DNA
      from other genomes. However, the underlying processes also facilitate genome
      infection by costly mobile genetic elements. The discovery that cells can uptake 
      DNA by natural transformation was instrumental to the birth of molecular biology 
      nearly a century ago. Surprisingly, a new study shows that this mechanism could
      efficiently cure the genome of mobile elements acquired through previous sexual
      exchanges.

TI  - MKS5 and CEP290 Dependent Assembly Pathway of the Ciliary Transition Zone.
PG  - e1002416
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002416 [doi]
AB  - Cilia have a unique diffusion barrier ("gate") within their proximal region,
      termed transition zone (TZ), that compartmentalises signalling proteins within
      the organelle. The TZ is known to harbour two functional modules/complexes
      (Meckel syndrome [MKS] and Nephronophthisis [NPHP]) defined by genetic
      interaction, interdependent protein localisation (hierarchy), and proteomic
      studies. However, the composition and molecular organisation of these modules and
      their links to human ciliary disease are not completely understood. Here, we
      reveal Caenorhabditis elegans CEP-290 (mammalian Cep290/Mks4/Nphp6 orthologue) as
      a central assembly factor that is specific for established MKS module components 
      and depends on the coiled coil region of MKS-5 (Rpgrip1L/Rpgrip1) for TZ
      localisation. Consistent with a critical role in ciliary gate function, CEP-290
      prevents inappropriate entry of membrane-associated proteins into cilia and keeps
      ARL-13 (Arl13b) from leaking out of cilia via the TZ. We identify a novel MKS
      module component, TMEM-218 (Tmem218), that requires CEP-290 and other MKS module 
      components for TZ localisation and functions together with the NPHP module to
      facilitate ciliogenesis. We show that TZ localisation of TMEM-138 (Tmem138) and
      CDKL-1 (Cdkl1/Cdkl2/Cdkl3/Cdlk4 related), not previously linked to a specific TZ 
      module, similarly depends on CEP-290; surprisingly, neither TMEM-138 or CDKL-1
      exhibit interdependent localisation or genetic interactions with core MKS or NPHP
      module components, suggesting they are part of a distinct, CEP-290-associated
      module. Lastly, we show that families presenting with Oral-Facial-Digital
      syndrome type 6 (OFD6) have likely pathogenic mutations in CEP-290-dependent TZ
      proteins, namely Tmem17, Tmem138, and Tmem231. Notably, patient fibroblasts
      harbouring mutated Tmem17, a protein not yet ciliopathy-associated, display
      ciliogenesis defects. Together, our findings expand the repertoire of MKS
      module-associated proteins--including the previously uncharacterised mammalian
      Tmem80--and suggest an MKS-5 and CEP-290-dependent assembly pathway for building 
      a functional TZ.

TI  - Self-Generated Chemoattractant Gradients: Attractant Depletion Extends the Range 
      and Robustness of Chemotaxis.
PG  - e1002404
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002404 [doi]
AB  - Chemotaxis is fundamentally important, but the sources of gradients in vivo are
      rarely well understood. Here, we analyse self-generated chemotaxis, in which
      cells respond to gradients they have made themselves by breaking down globally
      available attractants, using both computational simulations and experiments. We
      show that chemoattractant degradation creates steep local gradients. This leads
      to surprising results, in particular the existence of a leading population of
      cells that moves highly directionally, while cells behind this group are
      undirected. This leading cell population is denser than those following,
      especially at high attractant concentrations. The local gradient moves with the
      leading cells as they interact with their surroundings, giving directed movement 
      that is unusually robust and can operate over long distances. Even when gradients
      are applied from external sources, attractant breakdown greatly changes cells'
      responses and increases robustness. We also consider alternative mechanisms for
      directional decision-making and show that they do not predict the features of
      population migration we observe experimentally. Our findings provide useful
      diagnostics to allow identification of self-generated gradients and suggest that 
      self-generated chemotaxis is unexpectedly universal in biology and medicine.

TI  - MamO Is a Repurposed Serine Protease that Promotes Magnetite Biomineralization
      through Direct Transition Metal Binding in Magnetotactic Bacteria.
PG  - e1002402
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002402 [doi]
AB  - Many living organisms transform inorganic atoms into highly ordered crystalline
      materials. An elegant example of such biomineralization processes is the
      production of nano-scale magnetic crystals in magnetotactic bacteria. Previous
      studies implicated the involvement of two putative serine proteases, MamE and
      MamO, during the early stages of magnetite formation in Magnetospirillum
      magneticum AMB-1. Here, using genetic analysis and X-ray crystallography, we show
      that MamO has a degenerate active site, rendering it incapable of protease
      activity. Instead, MamO promotes magnetosome formation through two genetically
      distinct, noncatalytic activities: activation of MamE-dependent proteolysis of
      biomineralization factors and direct binding to transition metal ions. By solving
      the structure of the protease domain bound to a metal ion, we identify a
      surface-exposed di-histidine motif in MamO that contributes to metal binding and 
      show that it is required to initiate biomineralization in vivo. Finally, we find 
      that pseudoproteases are widespread in magnetotactic bacteria and that they have 
      evolved independently in three separate taxa. Our results highlight the
      versatility of protein scaffolds in accommodating new biochemical activities and 
      provide unprecedented insight into the earliest stages of biomineralization.

TI  - Energetic Constraints on Species Coexistence in Birds.
PG  - e1002407
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002407 [doi]
AB  - The association between species richness and ecosystem energy availability is one
      of the major geographic trends in biodiversity. It is often explained in terms of
      energetic constraints, such that coexistence among competing species is limited
      in low productivity environments. However, it has proven challenging to reject
      alternative views, including the null hypothesis that species richness has simply
      had more time to accumulate in productive regions, and thus the role of energetic
      constraints in limiting coexistence remains largely unknown. We use the
      phylogenetic relationships and geographic ranges of sister species (pairs of
      lineages who are each other's closest extant relatives) to examine the
      association between energy availability and coexistence across an entire
      vertebrate class (Aves). We show that the incidence of coexistence among sister
      species increases with overall species richness and is elevated in more
      productive ecosystems, even when accounting for differences in the evolutionary
      time available for coexistence to occur. Our results indicate that energy
      availability promotes species coexistence in closely related lineages, providing 
      a key step toward a more mechanistic understanding of the productivity-richness
      relationship underlying global gradients in biodiversity.

TI  - Invagination of Ectodermal Placodes Is Driven by Cell Intercalation-Mediated
      Contraction of the Suprabasal Tissue Canopy.
PG  - e1002405
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002405 [doi]
AB  - Ectodermal organs such as teeth, hair follicles, and mammary glands begin their
      development as placodes. These are local epithelial thickenings that invaginate
      into mesenchymal space. There is currently little mechanistic understanding of
      the cellular processes driving the early morphogenesis of these organs and of why
      they lead to invagination rather than simple tissue thickening. Here, we show
      that placode invagination depends on horizontal contraction of superficial layers
      of cells that form a shrinking and thickening canopy over underlying epithelial
      cells. This contraction occurs by cell intercalation and is mechanically coupled 
      to the basal layer by peripheral basal cells that extend apically and
      centripetally while remaining attached to the basal lamina. This process is
      topologically analogous to well-studied apical constriction mechanisms, but very 
      different from them both in scale and molecular mechanism. Mechanical cell-cell
      coupling is propagated through the tissue via E-cadherin junctions, which in turn
      depend on tissue-wide tension. We further present evidence that this mechanism is
      conserved among different ectodermal organs and is, therefore, a novel and
      fundamental morphogenetic motif widespread in embryonic development.

PG  - e1002399
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002399 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial Microcompartments (BMCs) are proteinaceous organelles that encapsulate 
      critical segments of autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways; they are
      functionally diverse and are found across 23 different phyla. The majority of
      catabolic BMCs (metabolosomes) compartmentalize a common core of enzymes to
      metabolize compounds via a toxic and/or volatile aldehyde intermediate. The core 
      enzyme phosphotransacylase (PTAC) recycles Coenzyme A and generates an acyl
      phosphate that can serve as an energy source. The PTAC predominantly associated
      with metabolosomes (PduL) has no sequence homology to the PTAC ubiquitous among
      fermentative bacteria (Pta). Here, we report two high-resolution PduL crystal
      structures with bound substrates. The PduL fold is unrelated to that of Pta; it
      contains a dimetal active site involved in a catalytic mechanism distinct from
      that of the housekeeping PTAC. Accordingly, PduL and Pta exemplify functional,
      but not structural, convergent evolution. The PduL structure, in the context of
      the catalytic core, completes our understanding of the structural basis of
      cofactor recycling in the metabolosome lumen.

AB  - Active learning methods have been shown to be superior to traditional lecture in 
      terms of student achievement, and our findings on the use of Peer-Led Team
      Learning (PLTL) concur. Students in our introductory biology course performed
      significantly better if they engaged in PLTL. There was also a drastic reduction 
      in the failure rate for underrepresented minority (URM) students with PLTL, which
      further resulted in closing the achievement gap between URM and non-URM students.
      With such compelling findings, we strongly encourage the adoption of Peer-Led
      Team Learning in undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
      (STEM) courses.

AB  - Given the amount of knowledge and data accruing in the neurosciences, is it time 
      to formulate a general principle for neuronal dynamics that holds at
      evolutionary, developmental, and perceptual timescales? In this paper, we propose
      that the brain (and other self-organised biological systems) can be characterised
      via the mathematical apparatus of a gauge theory. The picture that emerges from
      this approach suggests that any biological system (from a neuron to an organism) 
      can be cast as resolving uncertainty about its external milieu, either by
      changing its internal states or its relationship to the environment. Using formal
      arguments, we show that a gauge theory for neuronal dynamics--based on
      approximate Bayesian inference--has the potential to shed new light on phenomena 
      that have thus far eluded a formal description, such as attention and the link
      between action and perception.

      Fields in the Anesthetized Rat.
PG  - e1002397
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002397 [doi]
AB  - Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) in single neurons of the auditory cortex was
      suggested to be a potential neural correlate of the mismatch negativity (MMN), a 
      widely studied component of the auditory event-related potentials (ERP) that is
      elicited by changes in the auditory environment. However, several aspects on this
      SSA/MMN relation remain unresolved. SSA occurs in the primary auditory cortex
      (A1), but detailed studies on SSA beyond A1 are lacking. To study the topographic
      organization of SSA, we mapped the whole rat auditory cortex with multiunit
      activity recordings, using an oddball paradigm. We demonstrate that SSA occurs
      outside A1 and differs between primary and nonprimary cortical fields. In
      particular, SSA is much stronger and develops faster in the nonprimary than in
      the primary fields, paralleling the organization of subcortical SSA. Importantly,
      strong SSA is present in the nonprimary auditory cortex within the latency range 
      of the MMN in the rat and correlates with an MMN-like difference wave in the
      simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP). We present new and strong
      evidence linking SSA at the cellular level to the MMN, a central tool in
      cognitive and clinical neuroscience.

      Ligand-Gated Ion Channels.
PG  - e1002393
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002393 [doi]
AB  - Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are activated by the binding of agonists to 
      a site distant from the ion conduction path. These membrane proteins consist of
      distinct ligand-binding and pore domains that interact via an extended interface.
      Here, we have investigated the role of residues at this interface for channel
      activation to define critical interactions that couple conformational changes
      between the two structural units. By characterizing point mutants of the
      prokaryotic channels ELIC and GLIC by electrophysiology, X-ray crystallography
      and isothermal titration calorimetry, we have identified conserved residues that,
      upon mutation, apparently prevent activation but not ligand binding. The
      positions of nonactivating mutants cluster at a loop within the extracellular
      domain connecting beta-strands 6 and 7 and at a loop joining the pore-forming
      helix M2 with M3 where they contribute to a densely packed core of the protein.
      An ionic interaction in the extracellular domain between the turn connecting
      beta-strands 1 and 2 and a residue at the end of beta-strand 10 stabilizes a
      state of the receptor with high affinity for agonists, whereas contacts of this
      turn to a conserved proline residue in the M2-M3 loop appear to be less important
      than previously anticipated. When mapping residues with strong functional
      phenotype on different channel structures, mutual distances are closer in
      conducting than in nonconducting conformations, consistent with a potential role 
      of contacts in the stabilization of the open state. Our study has revealed a
      pattern of interactions that are crucial for the relay of conformational changes 
      from the extracellular domain to the pore region of prokaryotic pentameric
      ligand-gated ion channels. Due to the strong conservation of the interface, these
      results are relevant for the entire family.

TI  - Comparative Developmental Transcriptomics Reveals Rewiring of a Highly Conserved 
      Gene Regulatory Network during a Major Life History Switch in the Sea Urchin
      Genus Heliocidaris.
PG  - e1002391
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002391 [doi]
AB  - The ecologically significant shift in developmental strategy from planktotrophic 
      (feeding) to lecithotrophic (nonfeeding) development in the sea urchin genus
      Heliocidaris is one of the most comprehensively studied life history transitions 
      in any animal. Although the evolution of lecithotrophy involved substantial
      changes to larval development and morphology, it is not known to what extent
      changes in gene expression underlie the developmental differences between
      species, nor do we understand how these changes evolved within the context of the
      well-defined gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying sea urchin development. To 
      address these questions, we used RNA-seq to measure expression dynamics across
      development in three species: the lecithotroph Heliocidaris erythrogramma, the
      closely related planktotroph H. tuberculata, and an outgroup planktotroph
      Lytechinus variegatus. Using well-established statistical methods, we developed a
      novel framework for identifying, quantifying, and polarizing evolutionary changes
      in gene expression profiles across the transcriptome and within the GRN. We found
      that major changes in gene expression profiles were more numerous during the
      evolution of lecithotrophy than during the persistence of planktotrophy, and that
      genes with derived expression profiles in the lecithotroph displayed specific
      characteristics as a group that are consistent with the dramatically altered
      developmental program in this species. Compared to the transcriptome, changes in 
      gene expression profiles within the GRN were even more pronounced in the
      lecithotroph. We found evidence for conservation and likely divergence of
      particular GRN regulatory interactions in the lecithotroph, as well as
      significant changes in the expression of genes with known roles in larval
      skeletogenesis. We further use coexpression analysis to identify genes of unknown
      function that may contribute to both conserved and derived developmental traits
      between species. Collectively, our results indicate that distinct evolutionary
      processes operate on gene expression during periods of life history conservation 
      and periods of life history divergence, and that this contrast is even more
      pronounced within the GRN than across the transcriptome as a whole.

TI  - An Evolution-Guided Analysis Reveals a Multi-Signaling Regulation of Fas by
      Tyrosine Phosphorylation and its Implication in Human Cancers.
PG  - e1002401
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002401 [doi]
AB  - Demonstrations of both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival abilities of Fas
      (TNFRSF6/CD95/APO-1) have led to a shift from the exclusive "Fas apoptosis" to
      "Fas multisignals" paradigm and the acceptance that Fas-related therapies face a 
      major challenge, as it remains unclear what determines the mode of Fas signaling.
      Through protein evolution analysis, which reveals unconventional substitutions of
      Fas tyrosine during divergent evolution, evolution-guided tyrosine-phosphorylated
      Fas proxy, and site-specific phosphorylation detection, we show that the Fas
      signaling outcome is determined by the tyrosine phosphorylation status of its
      death domain. The phosphorylation dominantly turns off the Fas-mediated apoptotic
      signal, while turning on the pro-survival signal. We show that while
      phosphorylations at Y232 and Y291 share some common functions, their
      contributions to Fas signaling differ at several levels. The findings that Fas
      tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by Src family kinases (SFKs) and the
      phosphatase SHP-1 and that Y291 phosphorylation primes clathrin-dependent Fas
      endocytosis, which contributes to Fas pro-survival signaling, reveals for the
      first time the mechanistic link between SFK/SHP-1-dependent Fas tyrosine
      phosphorylation, internalization route, and signaling choice. We also demonstrate
      that levels of phosphorylated Y232 and Y291 differ among human cancer types and
      differentially respond to anticancer therapy, suggesting context-dependent
      involvement of Fas phosphorylation in cancer. This report provides a new insight 
      into the control of TNF receptor multisignaling by receptor phosphorylation and
      its implication in cancer biology, which brings us a step closer to overcoming
      the challenge in handling Fas signaling in treatments of cancer as well as other 
      pathologies such as autoimmune and degenerative diseases.

TI  - An Ancient Fingerprint Indicates the Common Ancestry of Rossmann-Fold Enzymes
      Utilizing Different Ribose-Based Cofactors.
PG  - e1002396
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002396 [doi]
AB  - Nucleoside-based cofactors are presumed to have preceded proteins. The Rossmann
      fold is one of the most ancient and functionally diverse protein folds, and most 
      Rossmann enzymes utilize nucleoside-based cofactors. We analyzed an omnipresent
      Rossmann ribose-binding interaction: a carboxylate side chain at the tip of the
      second beta-strand (beta2-Asp/Glu). We identified a canonical motif, defined by
      the beta2-topology and unique geometry. The latter relates to the interaction
      being bidentate (both ribose hydroxyls interacting with the carboxylate oxygens),
      to the angle between the carboxylate and the ribose, and to the ribose's ring
      configuration. We found that this canonical motif exhibits hallmarks of
      divergence rather than convergence. It is uniquely found in Rossmann enzymes that
      use different cofactors, primarily SAM (S-adenosyl methionine), NAD (nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide), and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide). Ribose-carboxylate 
      bidentate interactions in other folds are not only rare but also have a different
      topology and geometry. We further show that the canonical geometry is not
      dictated by a physical constraint--geometries found in noncanonical interactions 
      have similar calculated bond energies. Overall, these data indicate the
      divergence of several major Rossmann-fold enzyme classes, with different
      cofactors and catalytic chemistries, from a common pre-LUCA (last universal
      common ancestor) ancestor that possessed the beta2-Asp/Glu motif.

TI  - An Interferon Regulated MicroRNA Provides Broad Cell-Intrinsic Antiviral Immunity
      through Multihit Host-Directed Targeting of the Sterol Pathway.
PG  - e1002364
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002364 [doi]
AB  - In invertebrates, small interfering RNAs are at the vanguard of cell-autonomous
      antiviral immunity. In contrast, antiviral mechanisms initiated by interferon
      (IFN) signaling predominate in mammals. Whilst mammalian IFN-induced miRNA are
      known to inhibit specific viruses, it is not known whether host-directed
      microRNAs, downstream of IFN-signaling, have a role in mediating broad antiviral 
      resistance. By performing an integrative, systematic, global analysis of RNA
      turnover utilizing 4-thiouridine labeling of newly transcribed RNA and
      pri/pre-miRNA in IFN-activated macrophages, we identify a new
      post-transcriptional viral defense mechanism mediated by miR-342-5p. On the basis
      of ChIP and site-directed promoter mutagenesis experiments, we find the synthesis
      of miR-342-5p is coupled to the antiviral IFN response via the IFN-induced
      transcription factor, IRF1. Strikingly, we find miR-342-5p targets
      mevalonate-sterol biosynthesis using a multihit mechanism suppressing the pathway
      at different functional levels: transcriptionally via SREBF2,
      post-transcriptionally via miR-33, and enzymatically via IDI1 and SC4MOL. Mass
      spectrometry-based lipidomics and enzymatic assays demonstrate the targeting
      mechanisms reduce intermediate sterol pathway metabolites and total cholesterol
      in macrophages. These results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which
      IFN regulates the sterol pathway. The sterol pathway is known to be an integral
      part of the macrophage IFN antiviral response, and we show that miR-342-5p exerts
      broad antiviral effects against multiple, unrelated pathogenic viruses such
      Cytomegalovirus and Influenza A (H1N1). Metabolic rescue experiments confirm the 
      specificity of these effects and demonstrate that unrelated viruses have
      differential mevalonate and sterol pathway requirements for their replication.
      This study, therefore, advances the general concept of broad antiviral defense
      through multihit targeting of a single host pathway.

AB  - In its report Global Health 2035, the Commission on Investing in Health proposed 
      that health investments can reduce mortality in nearly all low- and middle-income
      countries to very low levels, thereby averting 10 million deaths per year from
      2035 onward. Many of these gains could be achieved through scale-up of existing
      technologies and health services. A key instrument to close this gap is policy
      and implementation research (PIR) that aims to produce generalizable evidence on 
      what works to implement successful interventions at scale. Rigorously designed
      PIR promotes global learning and local accountability. Much greater national and 
      global investments in PIR capacity will be required to enable the scaling of
      effective approaches and to prevent the recycling of failed ideas. Sample
      questions for the PIR research agenda include how to close the gap in the
      delivery of essential services to the poor, which population interventions for
      non-communicable diseases are most applicable in different contexts, and how to
      engage non-state actors in equitable provision of health services in the context 
      of universal health coverage.

TI  - Horizontal DNA Transfer Mechanisms of Bacteria as Weapons of Intragenomic
      Conflict.
PG  - e1002394
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002394 [doi]
AB  - Horizontal DNA transfer (HDT) is a pervasive mechanism of diversification in many
      microbial species, but its primary evolutionary role remains controversial. Much 
      recent research has emphasised the adaptive benefit of acquiring novel DNA, but
      here we argue instead that intragenomic conflict provides a coherent framework
      for understanding the evolutionary origins of HDT. To test this hypothesis, we
      developed a mathematical model of a clonally descended bacterial population
      undergoing HDT through transmission of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and genetic
      transformation. Including the known bias of transformation toward the acquisition
      of shorter alleles into the model suggested it could be an effective means of
      counteracting the spread of MGEs. Both constitutive and transient competence for 
      transformation were found to provide an effective defence against parasitic MGEs;
      transient competence could also be effective at permitting the selective spread
      of MGEs conferring a benefit on their host bacterium. The coordination of
      transient competence with cell-cell killing, observed in multiple species, was
      found to result in synergistic blocking of MGE transmission through releasing
      genomic DNA for homologous recombination while simultaneously reducing horizontal
      MGE spread by lowering the local cell density. To evaluate the feasibility of the
      functions suggested by the modelling analysis, we analysed genomic data from
      longitudinal sampling of individuals carrying Streptococcus pneumoniae. This
      revealed the frequent within-host coexistence of clonally descended cells that
      differed in their MGE infection status, a necessary condition for the proposed
      mechanism to operate. Additionally, we found multiple examples of MGEs inhibiting
      transformation through integrative disruption of genes encoding the competence
      machinery across many species, providing evidence of an ongoing "arms race."
      Reduced rates of transformation have also been observed in cells infected by MGEs
      that reduce the concentration of extracellular DNA through secretion of DNases.
      Simulations predicted that either mechanism of limiting transformation would
      benefit individual MGEs, but also that this tactic's effectiveness was limited by
      competition with other MGEs coinfecting the same cell. A further observed
      behaviour we hypothesised to reduce elimination by transformation was MGE
      activation when cells become competent. Our model predicted that this response
      was effective at counteracting transformation independently of competing MGEs.
      Therefore, this framework is able to explain both common properties of MGEs, and 
      the seemingly paradoxical bacterial behaviours of transformation and cell-cell
      killing within clonally related populations, as the consequences of intragenomic 
      conflict between self-replicating chromosomes and parasitic MGEs. The
      antagonistic nature of the different mechanisms of HDT over short timescales
      means their contribution to bacterial evolution is likely to be substantially
      greater than previously appreciated.

      Achieve a Grand Convergence in Malaria?
PG  - e1002380
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002380 [doi]
AB  - Progress made in malaria control during the past decade has prompted increasing
      global dialogue on malaria elimination and eradication. The product development
      pipeline for malaria has never been stronger, with promising new tools to detect,
      treat, and prevent malaria, including innovative diagnostics, medicines,
      vaccines, vector control products, and improved mechanisms for surveillance and
      response. There are at least 25 projects in the global malaria vaccine pipeline, 
      as well as 47 medicines and 13 vector control products. In addition, there are
      several next-generation diagnostic tools and reference methods currently in
      development, with many expected to be introduced in the next decade. The
      development and adoption of these tools, bolstered by strategies that ensure
      rapid uptake in target populations, intensified mechanisms for information
      management, surveillance, and response, and continued financial and political
      commitment are all essential to achieving global eradication.

AB  - In the aftermath of the Ebola crisis, the global health community has a unique
      opportunity to reflect on the lessons learned and apply them to prepare the world
      for the next crisis. Part of that preparation will entail knowing, with greater
      precision, what the scale and scope of our specific global health challenges are 
      and what resources are needed to address them. However, how can we know the
      magnitude of the challenge, and what resources are needed without knowing the
      current status of the world through accurate primary data? Once we know the
      current status, how can we decide on an intervention today with a predicted
      impact decades out if we cannot project into that future? Making a case for more 
      investments will require not just better data generation and sharing but a whole 
      new level of sophistication in our analytical capability--a fundamental shift in 
      our thinking to set expectations to match the reality. In this current status of 
      a distributed world, being transparent with our assumptions and specific with the
      case for investing in global health is a powerful approach to finding solutions
      to the problems that have plagued us for centuries.

AB  - In the last 15 years, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been the most globally
      impactful life-saving development of medical research. Antiretrovirals (ARVs) are
      used with great success for both the treatment and prevention of HIV infection.
      Despite these remarkable advances, this epidemic grows relentlessly worldwide.
      Over 2.1 million new infections occur each year, two-thirds in women and 240,000 
      in children. The widespread elimination of HIV will require the development of
      new, more potent prevention tools. Such efforts are imperative on a global scale.
      However, it must also be recognised that true containment of the epidemic
      requires the development and widespread implementation of a scientific
      advancement that has eluded us to date--a highly effective vaccine. Striving for 
      such medical advances is what is required to achieve the end of AIDS.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002392 [doi]
AB  - In Drosophila, the fat body, functionally equivalent to the mammalian liver and
      adipocytes, plays a central role in regulating systemic growth in response to
      nutrition. The fat body senses intracellular amino acids through Target of
      Rapamycin (TOR) signaling, and produces an unidentified humoral factor(s) to
      regulate insulin-like peptide (ILP) synthesis and/or secretion in the
      insulin-producing cells. Here, we find that two peptides, Growth-Blocking Peptide
      (GBP1) and CG11395 (GBP2), are produced in the fat body in response to amino
      acids and TOR signaling. Reducing the expression of GBP1 and GBP2 (GBPs)
      specifically in the fat body results in smaller body size due to reduced growth
      rate. In addition, we found that GBPs stimulate ILP secretion from the
      insulin-producing cells, either directly or indirectly, thereby increasing
      insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling activity throughout the body.
      Our findings fill an important gap in our understanding of how the fat body
      transmits nutritional information to the insulin producing cells to control body 
      size.

TI  - Social Evolution Selects for Redundancy in Bacterial Quorum Sensing.

AB  - Quorum sensing is a process of chemical communication that bacteria use to
      monitor cell density and coordinate cooperative behaviors. Quorum sensing relies 
      on extracellular signal molecules and cognate receptor pairs. While a single
      quorum-sensing system is sufficient to probe cell density, bacteria frequently
      use multiple quorum-sensing systems to regulate the same cooperative behaviors.
      The potential benefits of these redundant network structures are not clear. Here,
      we combine modeling and experimental analyses of the Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio
      harveyi quorum-sensing networks to show that accumulation of multiple
      quorum-sensing systems may be driven by a facultative cheating mechanism. We
      demonstrate that a strain that has acquired an additional quorum-sensing system
      can exploit its ancestor that possesses one fewer system, but nonetheless, resume
      full cooperation with its kin when it is fixed in the population. We identify the
      molecular network design criteria required for this advantage. Our results
      suggest that increased complexity in bacterial social signaling circuits can
      evolve without providing an adaptive advantage in a clonal population.

TI  - Adaptation to Temporally Fluctuating Environments by the Evolution of Maternal
      Effects.
PG  - e1002388
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002388 [doi]
AB  - All organisms live in temporally fluctuating environments. Theory predicts that
      the evolution of deterministic maternal effects (i.e., anticipatory maternal
      effects or transgenerational phenotypic plasticity) underlies adaptation to
      environments that fluctuate in a predictably alternating fashion over
      maternal-offspring generations. In contrast, randomizing maternal effects (i.e., 
      diversifying and conservative bet-hedging), are expected to evolve in response to
      unpredictably fluctuating environments. Although maternal effects are common,
      evidence for their adaptive significance is equivocal since they can easily
      evolve as a correlated response to maternal selection and may or may not increase
      the future fitness of offspring. Using the hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis
      elegans, we here show that the experimental evolution of maternal glycogen
      provisioning underlies adaptation to a fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching
      environment by increasing embryo survival under anoxia. In strictly alternating
      environments, we found that hermaphrodites evolved the ability to increase embryo
      glycogen provisioning when they experienced normoxia and to decrease embryo
      glycogen provisioning when they experienced anoxia. At odds with existing theory,
      however, populations facing irregularly fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching
      environments failed to evolve randomizing maternal effects. Instead, adaptation
      in these populations may have occurred through the evolution of fitness effects
      that percolate over multiple generations, as they maintained considerably high
      expected growth rates during experimental evolution despite evolving reduced
      fecundity and reduced embryo survival under one or two generations of anoxia. We 
      develop theoretical models that explain why adaptation to a wide range of
      patterns of environmental fluctuations hinges on the existence of deterministic
      maternal effects, and that such deterministic maternal effects are more likely to
      contribute to adaptation than randomizing maternal effects.

TI  - An Attention-Sensitive Memory Trace in Macaque MT Following Saccadic Eye
      Movements.
PG  - e1002390
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002390 [doi]
AB  - We experience a visually stable world despite frequent retinal image
      displacements induced by eye, head, and body movements. The neural mechanisms
      underlying this remain unclear. One mechanism that may contribute is
      transsaccadic remapping, in which the responses of some neurons in various
      attentional, oculomotor, and visual brain areas appear to anticipate the
      consequences of saccades. The functional role of transsaccadic remapping is
      actively debated, and many of its key properties remain unknown. Here, recording 
      from two monkeys trained to make a saccade while directing attention to one of
      two spatial locations, we show that neurons in the middle temporal area (MT), a
      key locus in the motion-processing pathway of humans and macaques, show a form of
      transsaccadic remapping called a memory trace. The memory trace in MT neurons is 
      enhanced by the allocation of top-down spatial attention. Our data provide the
      first demonstration, to our knowledge, of the influence of top-down attention on 
      the memory trace anywhere in the brain. We find evidence only for a small and
      transient effect of motion direction on the memory trace (and in only one of two 
      monkeys), arguing against a role for MT in the theoretically critical yet
      empirically contentious phenomenon of spatiotopic feature-comparison and
      adaptation transfer across saccades. Our data support the hypothesis that
      transsaccadic remapping represents the shift of attentional pointers in a
      retinotopic map, so that relevant locations can be tracked and rapidly processed 
      across saccades. Our results resolve important issues concerning the perisaccadic
      representation of visual stimuli in the dorsal stream and demonstrate a
      significant role for top-down attention in modulating this representation.

TI  - Tel1 and Rif2 Regulate MRX Functions in End-Tethering and Repair of DNA
      Double-Strand Breaks.
PG  - e1002387
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002387 [doi]
AB  - The cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is initiated by the
      MRX/MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 in yeast; Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in mammals), which
      recruits the checkpoint kinase Tel1/ATM to DSBs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
      role of Tel1 at DSBs remains enigmatic, as tel1Delta cells do not show obvious
      hypersensitivity to DSB-inducing agents. By performing a synthetic phenotype
      screen, we isolated a rad50-V1269M allele that sensitizes tel1Delta cells to
      genotoxic agents. The MRV1269MX complex associates poorly to DNA ends, and its
      retention at DSBs is further reduced by the lack of Tel1. As a consequence,
      tel1Delta rad50-V1269M cells are severely defective both in keeping the DSB ends 
      tethered to each other and in repairing a DSB by either homologous recombination 
      (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). These data indicate that Tel1 promotes 
      MRX retention to DSBs and this function is important to allow proper MRX-DNA
      binding that is needed for end-tethering and DSB repair. The role of Tel1 in
      promoting MRX accumulation to DSBs is counteracted by Rif2, which is recruited to
      DSBs. We also found that Rif2 enhances ATP hydrolysis by MRX and attenuates MRX
      function in end-tethering, suggesting that Rif2 can regulate MRX activity at DSBs
      by modulating ATP-dependent conformational changes of Rad50.

TI  - Ret and Etv4 Promote Directed Movements of Progenitor Cells during Renal
      Branching Morphogenesis.
PG  - e1002382
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002382 [doi]
AB  - Branching morphogenesis of the epithelial ureteric bud forms the renal collecting
      duct system and is critical for normal nephron number, while low nephron number
      is implicated in hypertension and renal disease. Ureteric bud growth and
      branching requires GDNF signaling from the surrounding mesenchyme to cells at the
      ureteric bud tips, via the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase and coreceptor Gfralpha1;
      Ret signaling up-regulates transcription factors Etv4 and Etv5, which are also
      critical for branching. Despite extensive knowledge of the genetic control of
      these events, it is not understood, at the cellular level, how renal branching
      morphogenesis is achieved or how Ret signaling influences epithelial cell
      behaviors to promote this process. Analysis of chimeric embryos previously
      suggested a role for Ret signaling in promoting cell rearrangements in the
      nephric duct, but this method was unsuited to study individual cell behaviors
      during ureteric bud branching. Here, we use Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers
      (MADM), combined with organ culture and time-lapse imaging, to trace the
      movements and divisions of individual ureteric bud tip cells. We first examine
      wild-type clones and then Ret or Etv4 mutant/wild-type clones in which the mutant
      and wild-type sister cells are differentially and heritably marked by green and
      red fluorescent proteins. We find that, in normal kidneys, most individual tip
      cells behave as self-renewing progenitors, some of whose progeny remain at the
      tips while others populate the growing UB trunks. In Ret or Etv4 MADM clones, the
      wild-type cells generated at a UB tip are much more likely to remain at, or move 
      to, the new tips during branching and elongation, while their Ret-/- or Etv4-/-
      sister cells tend to lag behind and contribute only to the trunks. By tracking
      successive mitoses in a cell lineage, we find that Ret signaling has little
      effect on proliferation, in contrast to its effects on cell movement. Our results
      show that Ret/Etv4 signaling promotes directed cell movements in the ureteric bud
      tips, and suggest a model in which these cell movements mediate branching
      morphogenesis.

TI  - Interactome Mapping Reveals the Evolutionary History of the Nuclear Pore Complex.
PG  - e1002365
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002365 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport and
      constitutes a hub for control of gene expression. The components of NPCs from
      several eukaryotic lineages have been determined, but only the yeast and
      vertebrate NPCs have been extensively characterized at the quaternary level.
      Significantly, recent evidence indicates that compositional similarity does not
      necessarily correspond to homologous architecture between NPCs from different
      taxa. To address this, we describe the interactome of the trypanosome NPC, a
      representative, highly divergent eukaryote. We identify numerous new NPC
      components and report an exhaustive interactome, allowing assignment of
      trypanosome nucleoporins to discrete NPC substructures. Remarkably, despite
      retaining similar protein composition, there are exceptional architectural
      dissimilarities between opisthokont (yeast and vertebrates) and excavate
      (trypanosomes) NPCs. Whilst elements of the inner core are conserved, numerous
      peripheral structures are highly divergent, perhaps reflecting requirements to
      interface with divergent nuclear and cytoplasmic functions. Moreover, the
      trypanosome NPC has almost complete nucleocytoplasmic symmetry, in contrast to
      the opisthokont NPC; this may reflect divergence in RNA export processes at the
      NPC cytoplasmic face, as we find evidence supporting Ran-dependent mRNA export in
      trypanosomes, similar to protein transport. We propose a model of stepwise
      acquisition of nucleocytoplasmic mechanistic complexity and demonstrate that
      detailed dissection of macromolecular complexes provides fuller understanding of 
      evolutionary processes.

TI  - Whisking, Sniffing, and the Hippocampal theta-Rhythm: A Tale of Two Oscillators.
PG  - e1002385
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002385 [doi]
AB  - The hippocampus has unique access to neuronal activity across all of the
      neocortex. Yet an unanswered question is how the transfer of information between 
      these structures is gated. One hypothesis involves temporal-locking of activity
      in the neocortex with that in the hippocampus. New data from the Matthew E.
      Diamond laboratory shows that the rhythmic neuronal activity that accompanies
      vibrissa-based sensation, in rats, transiently locks to ongoing hippocampal
      theta-rhythmic activity during the sensory-gathering epoch of a discrimination
      task. This result complements past studies on the locking of sniffing and the
      theta-rhythm as well as the relation of sniffing and whisking. An overarching
      possibility is that the preBotzinger inspiration oscillator, which paces
      whisking, can selectively lock with the theta-rhythm to traffic sensorimotor
      information between the rat's neocortex and hippocampus.

TI  - Coherence between Rat Sensorimotor System and Hippocampus Is Enhanced during
      Tactile Discrimination.
PG  - e1002384
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002384 [doi]
AB  - Rhythms with time scales of multiple cycles per second permeate the mammalian
      brain, yet neuroscientists are not certain of their functional roles. One leading
      idea is that coherent oscillation between two brain regions facilitates the
      exchange of information between them. In rats, the hippocampus and the vibrissal 
      sensorimotor system both are characterized by rhythmic oscillation in the theta
      range, 5-12 Hz. Previous work has been divided as to whether the two rhythms are 
      independent or coherent. To resolve this question, we acquired three measures
      from rats--whisker motion, hippocampal local field potential (LFP), and barrel
      cortex unit firing--during a whisker-mediated texture discrimination task and
      during control conditions (not engaged in a whisker-mediated memory task).
      Compared to control conditions, the theta band of hippocampal LFP showed a marked
      increase in power as the rats approached and then palpated the texture. Phase
      synchronization between whisking and hippocampal LFP increased by almost 50%
      during approach and texture palpation. In addition, a greater proportion of
      barrel cortex neurons showed firing that was phase-locked to hippocampal theta
      while rats were engaged in the discrimination task. Consistent with a behavioral 
      consequence of phase synchronization, the rats identified the texture more
      rapidly and with lower error likelihood on trials in which there was an increase 
      in theta-whisking coherence at the moment of texture palpation. These results
      suggest that coherence between the whisking rhythm, barrel cortex firing, and
      hippocampal LFP is augmented selectively during epochs in which the rat collects 
      sensory information and that such coherence enhances the efficiency of
      integration of stimulus information into memory and decision-making centers.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002383 [doi]
AB  - Cortical gamma activity (30-80 Hz) is believed to play important functions in
      neural computation and arises from the interplay of parvalbumin-expressing
      interneurons (PV) and pyramidal cells (PYRs). However, the subthreshold dynamics 
      underlying its emergence in the cortex of awake animals remain unclear. Here, we 
      characterized the intracellular dynamics of PVs and PYRs during spontaneous and
      visually evoked gamma activity in layers 2/3 of V1 of awake mice using targeted
      patch-clamp recordings and synchronous local field potentials (LFPs). Strong
      gamma activity patterned in short bouts (one to three cycles), occurred when PVs 
      and PYRs were depolarizing and entrained their membrane potential dynamics
      regardless of the presence of visual stimulation. PV firing phase locked
      unconditionally to gamma activity. However, PYRs only phase locked to visually
      evoked gamma bouts. Taken together, our results indicate that gamma activity
      corresponds to short pulses of correlated background synaptic activity
      synchronizing the output of cortical neurons depending on external sensory drive.

TI  - Gbeta Regulates Coupling between Actin Oscillators for Cell Polarity and
      Directional Migration.
PG  - e1002381
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002381 [doi]
AB  - For directional movement, eukaryotic cells depend on the proper organization of
      their actin cytoskeleton. This engine of motility is made up of highly dynamic
      nonequilibrium actin structures such as flashes, oscillations, and traveling
      waves. In Dictyostelium, oscillatory actin foci interact with signals such as Ras
      and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) to form protrusions. However,
      how signaling cues tame actin dynamics to produce a pseudopod and guide cellular 
      motility is a critical open question in eukaryotic chemotaxis. Here, we
      demonstrate that the strength of coupling between individual actin oscillators
      controls cell polarization and directional movement. We implement an inducible
      sequestration system to inactivate the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gbeta and
      find that this acute perturbation triggers persistent, high-amplitude cortical
      oscillations of F-actin. Actin oscillators that are normally weakly coupled to
      one another in wild-type cells become strongly synchronized following acute
      inactivation of Gbeta. This global coupling impairs sensing of internal cues
      during spontaneous polarization and sensing of external cues during directional
      motility. A simple mathematical model of coupled actin oscillators reveals the
      importance of appropriate coupling strength for chemotaxis: moderate coupling can
      increase sensitivity to noisy inputs. Taken together, our data suggest that Gbeta
      regulates the strength of coupling between actin oscillators for efficient
      polarity and directional migration. As these observations are only possible
      following acute inhibition of Gbeta and are masked by slow compensation in
      genetic knockouts, our work also shows that acute loss-of-function approaches can
      complement and extend the reach of classical genetics in Dictyostelium and likely
      other systems as well.

TI  - mTORC1 in Thymic Epithelial Cells Is Critical for Thymopoiesis, T-Cell
      Generation, and Temporal Control of gammadeltaT17 Development and TCRgamma/delta 
      Recombination.
PG  - e1002370

AB  - Thymus is crucial for generation of a diverse repertoire of T cells essential for
      adaptive immunity. Although thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are crucial for
      thymopoiesis and T cell generation, how TEC development and function are
      controlled is poorly understood. We report here that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in
      TECs plays critical roles in thymopoiesis and thymus function. Acute deletion of 
      mTORC1 in adult mice caused severe thymic involution. TEC-specific deficiency of 
      mTORC1 (mTORC1KO) impaired TEC maturation and function such as decreased
      expression of thymotropic chemokines, decreased medullary TEC to cortical TEC
      ratios, and altered thymic architecture, leading to severe thymic atrophy,
      reduced recruitment of early thymic progenitors, and impaired development of
      virtually all T-cell lineages. Strikingly, temporal control of IL-17-producing
      gammadeltaT (gammadeltaT17) cell differentiation and TCRVgamma/delta
      recombination in fetal thymus is lost in mTORC1KO thymus, leading to elevated
      gammadeltaT17 differentiation and rearranging of fetal specific TCRVgamma/delta
      in adulthood. Thus, mTORC1 is central for TEC development/function and
      establishment of thymic environment for proper T cell development, and modulating
      mTORC1 activity can be a strategy for preventing thymic involution/atrophy.

AB  - Crowdfunding represents an attractive new option for funding research projects,
      especially for students and early-career scientists or in the absence of
      governmental aid in some countries. The number of successful science-related
      crowdfunding campaigns is growing, which demonstrates the public's willingness to
      support and participate in scientific projects. Putting together a crowdfunding
      campaign is not trivial, however, so here is a guide to help you make yours a
      success.

TI  - Phylogenomics Reveals Three Sources of Adaptive Variation during a Rapid
      Radiation.
PG  - e1002379
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002379 [doi]
AB  - Speciation events often occur in rapid bursts of diversification, but the
      ecological and genetic factors that promote these radiations are still much
      debated. Using whole transcriptomes from all 13 species in the ecologically and
      reproductively diverse wild tomato clade (Solanum sect. Lycopersicon), we infer
      the species phylogeny and patterns of genetic diversity in this group. Despite
      widespread phylogenetic discordance due to the sorting of ancestral variation, we
      date the origin of this radiation to approximately 2.5 million years ago and find
      evidence for at least three sources of adaptive genetic variation that fuel
      diversification. First, we detect introgression both historically between
      early-branching lineages and recently between individual populations, at specific
      loci whose functions indicate likely adaptive benefits. Second, we find evidence 
      of lineage-specific de novo evolution for many genes, including loci involved in 
      the production of red fruit color. Finally, using a "PhyloGWAS" approach, we
      detect environment-specific sorting of ancestral variation among populations that
      come from different species but share common environmental conditions. Estimated 
      across the whole clade, small but substantial and approximately equal fractions
      of the euchromatic portion of the genome are inferred to contribute to each of
      these three sources of adaptive genetic variation. These results indicate that
      multiple genetic sources can promote rapid diversification and speciation in
      response to new ecological opportunity, in agreement with our emerging
      phylogenomic understanding of the complexity of both ancient and recent species
      radiations.

AB  - Almost all higher organisms, including plants, insects, and mammals, are
      colonized by complex microbial communities and harbor a microbiome. Emerging
      studies with plants reveal that these microbiomes are structured and form
      complex, interconnected microbial networks. Within these networks, different taxa
      have different roles, and keystone species have been identified that could be
      crucial for plant health and ecosystem functioning. A new paper in this issue of 
      PLOS Biology by Agler et al. highlights the presence of microbial hubs in these
      networks that may act as mediators between the plant and its microbiome. A next
      major frontier is now to link microbiome composition to function. In order to do 
      this, we present a number of hypothetical examples of how microbiome diversity
      and function potentially influence host performance.

PG  - e1002369
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002369 [doi]
AB  - Faithful meiotic chromosome segregation and fertility require meiotic
      recombination between homologous chromosomes rather than the equally available
      sister chromatid, a bias that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on the meiotic 
      kinase, Mek1. Mek1 is thought to mediate repair template bias by specifically
      suppressing sister-directed repair. Instead, we found that when Mek1 persists on 
      closely paired (synapsed) homologues, DNA repair is severely delayed, suggesting 
      that Mek1 suppresses any proximal repair template. Accordingly, Mek1 is excluded 
      from synapsed homologues in wild-type cells. Exclusion requires the AAA+-ATPase
      Pch2 and is directly coupled to synaptonemal complex assembly. Stage-specific
      depletion experiments further demonstrate that DNA repair in the context of
      synapsed homologues requires Rad54, a repair factor inhibited by Mek1. These data
      indicate that the sister template is distinguished from the homologue primarily
      by its closer proximity to inhibitory Mek1 activity. We propose that once pairing
      or synapsis juxtaposes homologues, exclusion of Mek1 is necessary to avoid
      suppression of all templates and accelerate repair progression.

TI  - PI(4)P Promotes Phosphorylation and Conformational Change of Smoothened through
      Interaction with Its C-terminal Tail.
PG  - e1002375
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002375 [doi]
AB  - In Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, binding of Hh to the Patched-Interference Hh
      (Ptc-Ihog) receptor complex relieves Ptc inhibition on Smoothened (Smo). A
      longstanding question is how Ptc inhibits Smo and how such inhibition is relieved
      by Hh stimulation. In this study, we found that Hh elevates production of
      phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P). Increased levels of PI(4)P promote,
      whereas decreased levels of PI(4)P inhibit, Hh signaling activity. We further
      found that PI(4)P directly binds Smo through an arginine motif, which then
      triggers Smo phosphorylation and activation. Moreover, we identified the
      pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2) as
      an essential component for enriching PI(4)P and facilitating Smo activation.
      PI(4)P also binds mouse Smo (mSmo) and promotes its phosphorylation and ciliary
      accumulation. Finally, Hh treatment increases the interaction between Smo and
      PI(4)P but decreases the interaction between Ptc and PI(4)P, indicating that, in 
      addition to promoting PI(4)P production, Hh regulates the pool of PI(4)P
      associated with Ptc and Smo.

TI  - Science Educational Outreach Programs That Benefit Students and Scientists.
PG  - e1002368
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002368 [doi]
AB  - Both scientists and the public would benefit from improved communication of basic
      scientific research and from integrating scientists into education outreach, but 
      opportunities to support these efforts are limited. We have developed two
      low-cost programs--"Present Your PhD Thesis to a 12-Year-Old" and "Shadow a
      Scientist"--that combine training in science communication with outreach to area 
      middle schools. We assessed the outcomes of these programs and found a 2-fold
      benefit: scientists improve their communication skills by explaining basic
      science research to a general audience, and students' enthusiasm for science and 
      their scientific knowledge are increased. Here we present details about both
      programs, along with our assessment of them, and discuss the feasibility of
      exporting these programs to other universities.

TI  - Temporal Structure in Cooperative Interactions: What Does the Timing of
      Exploitation Tell Us about Its Cost?
PG  - e1002371
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002371 [doi]
AB  - Exploitation in cooperative interactions both within and between species is
      widespread. Although it is assumed to be costly to be exploited, mechanisms to
      control exploitation are surprisingly rare, making the persistence of cooperation
      a fundamental paradox in evolutionary biology and ecology. Focusing on
      between-species cooperation (mutualism), we hypothesize that the temporal
      sequence in which exploitation occurs relative to cooperation affects its net
      costs and argue that this can help explain when and where control mechanisms are 
      observed in nature. Our principal prediction is that when exploitation occurs
      late relative to cooperation, there should be little selection to limit its
      effects (analogous to "tolerated theft" in human cooperative groups). Although we
      focus on cases in which mutualists and exploiters are different individuals (of
      the same or different species), our inferences can readily be extended to cases
      in which individuals exhibit mixed cooperative-exploitative strategies. We
      demonstrate that temporal structure should be considered alongside spatial
      structure as an important process affecting the evolution of cooperation. We also
      provide testable predictions to guide future empirical research on interspecific 
      as well as intraspecific cooperation.

TI  - Molecular Basis of Orb2 Amyloidogenesis and Blockade of Memory Consolidation.
PG  - e1002361
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002361 [doi]
AB  - Amyloids are ordered protein aggregates that are typically associated with
      neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. By contrast, the
      amyloid-like state of the neuronal RNA binding protein Orb2 in Drosophila was
      recently implicated in memory consolidation, but it remains unclear what features
      of this functional amyloid-like protein give rise to such diametrically opposed
      behaviour. Here, using an array of biophysical, cell biological and behavioural
      assays we have characterized the structural features of Orb2 from the monomer to 
      the amyloid state. Surprisingly, we find that Orb2 shares many structural traits 
      with pathological amyloids, including the intermediate toxic oligomeric species, 
      which can be sequestered in vivo in hetero-oligomers by pathological amyloids.
      However, unlike pathological amyloids, Orb2 rapidly forms amyloids and its toxic 
      intermediates are extremely transient, indicating that kinetic parameters
      differentiate this functional amyloid from pathological amyloids. We also
      observed that a well-known anti-amyloidogenic peptide interferes with long-term
      memory in Drosophila. These results provide structural insights into how the
      amyloid-like state of the Orb2 protein can stabilize memory and be nontoxic. They
      also provide insight into how amyloid-based diseases may affect memory processes.

TI  - Near-Stasis in the Long-Term Diversification of Mesozoic Tetrapods.
PG  - e1002359
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002359 [doi]
AB  - How did evolution generate the extraordinary diversity of vertebrates on land?
      Zero species are known prior to ~380 million years ago, and more than 30,000 are 
      present today. An expansionist model suggests this was achieved by large and
      unbounded increases, leading to substantially greater diversity in the present
      than at any time in the geological past. This model contrasts starkly with
      empirical support for constrained diversification in marine animals, suggesting
      different macroevolutionary processes on land and in the sea. We quantify
      patterns of vertebrate standing diversity on land during the Mesozoic-early
      Paleogene interval, applying sample-standardization to a global fossil dataset
      containing 27,260 occurrences of 4,898 non-marine tetrapod species. Our results
      show a highly stable pattern of Mesozoic tetrapod diversity at regional and local
      levels, underpinned by a weakly positive, but near-zero, long-term net
      diversification rate over 190 million years. Species diversity of non-flying
      terrestrial tetrapods less than doubled over this interval, despite the origins
      of exceptionally diverse extant groups within mammals, squamates, amphibians, and
      dinosaurs. Therefore, although speciose groups of modern tetrapods have Mesozoic 
      origins, rates of Mesozoic diversification inferred from the fossil record are
      slow compared to those inferred from molecular phylogenies. If high speciation
      rates did occur in the Mesozoic, then they seem to have been balanced by
      extinctions among older clades. An apparent 4-fold expansion of species richness 
      after the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary deserves further examination in
      light of potential taxonomic biases, but is consistent with the hypothesis that
      global environmental disturbances such as mass extinction events can rapidly
      adjust limits to diversity by restructuring ecosystems, and suggests that the
      gradualistic evolutionary diversification of tetrapods was punctuated by brief
      but dramatic episodes of radiation.

TI  - Microbial Hub Taxa Link Host and Abiotic Factors to Plant Microbiome Variation.
PG  - e1002352
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002352 [doi]
AB  - Plant-associated microorganisms have been shown to critically affect host
      physiology and performance, suggesting that evolution and ecology of plants and
      animals can only be understood in a holobiont (host and its associated organisms)
      context. Host-associated microbial community structures are affected by abiotic
      and host factors, and increased attention is given to the role of the microbiome 
      in interactions such as pathogen inhibition. However, little is known about how
      these factors act on the microbial community, and especially what role
      microbe-microbe interaction dynamics play. We have begun to address this
      knowledge gap for phyllosphere microbiomes of plants by simultaneously studying
      three major groups of Arabidopsis thaliana symbionts (bacteria, fungi and
      oomycetes) using a systems biology approach. We evaluated multiple potential
      factors of microbial community control: we sampled various wild A. thaliana
      populations at different times, performed field plantings with different host
      genotypes, and implemented successive host colonization experiments under lab
      conditions where abiotic factors, host genotype, and pathogen colonization was
      manipulated. Our results indicate that both abiotic factors and host genotype
      interact to affect plant colonization by all three groups of microbes.
      Considering microbe-microbe interactions, however, uncovered a network of
      interkingdom interactions with significant contributions to community structure. 
      As in other scale-free networks, a small number of taxa, which we call microbial 
      "hubs," are strongly interconnected and have a severe effect on communities. By
      documenting these microbe-microbe interactions, we uncover an important mechanism
      explaining how abiotic factors and host genotypic signatures control microbial
      communities. In short, they act directly on "hub" microbes, which, via
      microbe-microbe interactions, transmit the effects to the microbial community. We
      analyzed two "hub" microbes (the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen Albugo and
      the basidiomycete yeast fungus Dioszegia) more closely. Albugo had strong effects
      on epiphytic and endophytic bacterial colonization. Specifically, alpha diversity
      decreased and beta diversity stabilized in the presence of Albugo infection,
      whereas they otherwise varied between plants. Dioszegia, on the other hand,
      provided evidence for direct hub interaction with phyllosphere bacteria. The
      identification of microbial "hubs" and their importance in phyllosphere
      microbiome structuring has crucial implications for plant-pathogen and
      microbe-microbe research and opens new entry points for ecosystem management and 
      future targeted biocontrol. The revelation that effects can cascade through
      communities via "hub" microbes is important to understand community structure
      perturbations in parallel fields including human microbiomes and bioprocesses. In
      particular, parallels to human microbiome "keystone" pathogens and microbes open 
      new avenues of interdisciplinary research that promise to better our
      understanding of functions of host-associated microbiomes.

AB  - Despite significant efforts to reform undergraduate science education, students
      often perform worse on assessments of perceptions of science after introductory
      courses, demonstrating a need for new educational interventions to reverse this
      trend. To address this need, we created An Inexplicable Disease, an engaging,
      active-learning case study that is unusual because it aims to simulate scientific
      inquiry by allowing students to iteratively investigate the Kuru epidemic of 1957
      in a choose-your-own-experiment format in large lectures. The case emphasizes the
      importance of specialization and communication in science and is broadly
      applicable to courses of any size and sub-discipline of the life sciences.

      Areas: The End Is Not in Sight.
PG  - e1002357
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002357 [doi]
AB  - Extinction rates in the Anthropocene are three orders of magnitude higher than
      background and disproportionately occur in the tropics, home of half the world's 
      species. Despite global efforts to combat tropical species extinctions, lack of
      high-quality, objective information on tropical biodiversity has hampered
      quantitative evaluation of conservation strategies. In particular, the scarcity
      of population-level monitoring in tropical forests has stymied assessment of
      biodiversity outcomes, such as the status and trends of animal populations in
      protected areas. Here, we evaluate occupancy trends for 511 populations of
      terrestrial mammals and birds, representing 244 species from 15 tropical forest
      protected areas on three continents. For the first time to our knowledge, we use 
      annual surveys from tropical forests worldwide that employ a standardized camera 
      trapping protocol, and we compute data analytics that correct for imperfect
      detection. We found that occupancy declined in 22%, increased in 17%, and
      exhibited no change in 22% of populations during the last 3-8 years, while 39% of
      populations were detected too infrequently to assess occupancy changes. Despite
      extensive variability in occupancy trends, these 15 tropical protected areas have
      not exhibited systematic declines in biodiversity (i.e., occupancy, richness, or 
      evenness) at the community level. Our results differ from reports of widespread
      biodiversity declines based on aggregated secondary data and expert opinion and
      suggest less extreme deterioration in tropical forest protected areas. We
      simultaneously fill an important conservation data gap and demonstrate the value 
      of large-scale monitoring infrastructure and powerful analytics, which can be
      scaled to incorporate additional sites, ecosystems, and monitoring methods. In an
      era of catastrophic biodiversity loss, robust indicators produced from
      standardized monitoring infrastructure are critical to accurately assess
      population outcomes and identify conservation strategies that can avert
      biodiversity collapse.

TI  - Evolutionary Novelty in a Butterfly Wing Pattern through Enhancer Shuffling.
PG  - e1002353
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002353 [doi]
AB  - An important goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic changes
      underlying novel morphological structures. We investigated the origins of a
      complex wing pattern found among Amazonian Heliconius butterflies. Genome
      sequence data from 142 individuals across 17 species identified narrow regions
      associated with two distinct red colour pattern elements, dennis and ray. We
      hypothesise that these modules in non-coding sequence represent distinct
      cis-regulatory loci that control expression of the transcription factor optix,
      which in turn controls red pattern variation across Heliconius. Phylogenetic
      analysis of the two elements demonstrated that they have distinct evolutionary
      histories and that novel adaptive morphological variation was created by
      shuffling these cis-regulatory modules through recombination between divergent
      lineages. In addition, recombination of modules into different combinations
      within species further contributes to diversity. Analysis of the timing of
      diversification in these two regions supports the hypothesis of introgression
      moving regulatory modules between species, rather than shared ancestral
      variation. The dennis phenotype introgressed into Heliconius melpomene at about
      the same time that ray originated in this group, while ray introgressed back into
      H. elevatus much more recently. We show that shuffling of existing enhancer
      elements both within and between species provides a mechanism for rapid
      diversification and generation of novel morphological combinations during
      adaptive radiation.

      KtrAB K+ Transporter.
PG  - e1002356
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002356 [doi]
AB  - KtrAB belongs to the Trk/Ktr/HKT superfamily of monovalent cation (K+ and Na+)
      transport proteins that closely resemble K+ channels. These proteins underlie a
      plethora of cellular functions that are crucial for environmental adaptation in
      plants, fungi, archaea, and bacteria. The activation mechanism of the Trk/Ktr/HKT
      proteins remains unknown. It has been shown that ATP stimulates the activity of
      KtrAB while ADP does not. Here, we present X-ray structural information on the
      KtrAB complex with bound ADP. A comparison with the KtrAB-ATP structure reveals
      conformational changes in the ring and in the membrane protein. In combination
      with a biochemical and functional analysis, we uncover how ligand-dependent
      changes in the KtrA ring are propagated to the KtrB membrane protein and conclude
      that, despite their structural similarity, the activation mechanism of KtrAB is
      markedly different from the activation mechanism of K+ channels.

TI  - Interpreting the Dependence of Mutation Rates on Age and Time.
PG  - e1002355
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002355 [doi]
AB  - Mutations can originate from the chance misincorporation of nucleotides during
      DNA replication or from DNA lesions that arise between replication cycles and are
      not repaired correctly. We introduce a model that relates the source of mutations
      to their accumulation with cell divisions, providing a framework for
      understanding how mutation rates depend on sex, age, and cell division rate. We
      show that the accrual of mutations should track cell divisions not only when
      mutations are replicative in origin but also when they are non-replicative and
      repaired efficiently. One implication is that observations from diverse fields
      that to date have been interpreted as pointing to a replicative origin of most
      mutations could instead reflect the accumulation of mutations arising from
      endogenous reactions or exogenous mutagens. We further find that only mutations
      that arise from inefficiently repaired lesions will accrue according to absolute 
      time; thus, unless life history traits co-vary, the phylogenetic "molecular
      clock" should not be expected to run steadily across species.

TI  - FIH Regulates Cellular Metabolism through Hydroxylation of the Deubiquitinase
      OTUB1.
PG  - e1002347
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002347 [doi]
AB  - The asparagine hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), confers
      oxygen-dependence upon the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a master regulator of 
      the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia. Studies investigating whether
      asparagine hydroxylation is a general regulatory oxygen-dependent modification
      have identified multiple non-HIF targets for FIH. However, the functional
      consequences of this outside of the HIF pathway remain unclear. Here, we
      demonstrate that the deubiquitinase ovarian tumor domain containing ubiquitin
      aldehyde binding protein 1 (OTUB1) is a substrate for hydroxylation by FIH on
      N22. Mutation of N22 leads to a profound change in the interaction of OTUB1 with 
      proteins important in cellular metabolism. Furthermore, in cultured cells,
      overexpression of N22A mutant OTUB1 impairs cellular metabolic processes when
      compared to wild type. Based on these data, we hypothesize that OTUB1 is a target
      for functional hydroxylation by FIH. Additionally, we propose that our results
      provide new insight into the regulation of cellular energy metabolism during
      hypoxic stress and the potential for targeting hydroxylases for therapeutic
      benefit.

TI  - Wuho Is a New Member in Maintaining Genome Stability through its Interaction with
      Flap Endonuclease 1.
PG  - e1002349
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002349 [doi]
AB  - Replication forks are vulnerable to wayward nuclease activities. We report here
      our discovery of a new member in guarding genome stability at replication forks. 
      We previously isolated a Drosophila mutation, wuho (wh, no progeny),
      characterized by a severe fertility defect and affecting expression of a protein 
      (WH) in a family of conserved proteins with multiple WD40 repeats. Knockdown of
      WH by siRNA in Drosophila, mouse, and human cultured cells results in DNA damage 
      with strand breaks and apoptosis through ATM/Chk2/p53 signaling pathway. Mice
      with mWh knockout are early embryonic lethal and display DNA damage. We identify 
      that the flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is one of the interacting proteins.
      Fluorescence microscopy showed the localization of WH at the site of nascent DNA 
      synthesis along with other replication proteins, including FEN1 and PCNA. We show
      that WH is able to modulate FEN1's endonucleolytic activities depending on the
      substrate DNA structure. The stimulatory or inhibitory effects of WH on FEN1's
      flap versus gap endonuclease activities are consistent with the proposed WH's
      functions in protecting the integrity of replication fork. These results suggest 
      that wh is a new member of the guardians of genome stability because it regulates
      FEN1's potential DNA cleavage threat near the site of replication.

AB  - Recent advancements in animal tracking technology and high-throughput sequencing 
      are rapidly changing the questions and scope of research in the biological
      sciences. The integration of genomic data with high-tech animal instrumentation
      comes as a natural progression of traditional work in ecological genetics, and we
      provide a framework for linking the separate data streams from these
      technologies. Such a merger will elucidate the genetic basis of adaptive
      behaviors like migration and hibernation and advance our understanding of
      fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes such as pathogen transmission, 
      population responses to environmental change, and communication in natural
      populations.

TI  - Neuropeptide-Driven Cross-Modal Plasticity following Sensory Loss in
      Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - e1002348
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002348 [doi]
AB  - Sensory loss induces cross-modal plasticity, often resulting in altered
      performance in remaining sensory modalities. Whereas much is known about the
      macroscopic mechanisms underlying cross-modal plasticity, only scant information 
      exists about its cellular and molecular underpinnings. We found that
      Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes deprived of a sense of body touch exhibit
      various changes in behavior, associated with other unimpaired senses. We focused 
      on one such behavioral alteration, enhanced odor sensation, and sought to reveal 
      the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that translate mechanosensory loss into
      improved olfactory acuity. To this end, we analyzed in mechanosensory mutants
      food-dependent locomotion patterns that are associated with olfactory responses
      and found changes that are consistent with enhanced olfaction. The altered
      locomotion could be reversed in adults by optogenetic stimulation of the touch
      receptor (mechanosensory) neurons. Furthermore, we revealed that the enhanced
      odor response is related to a strengthening of inhibitory AWC-->AIY synaptic
      transmission in the olfactory circuit. Consistently, inserting in this circuit an
      engineered electrical synapse that diminishes AWC inhibition of AIY counteracted 
      the locomotion changes in touch-deficient mutants. We found that this cross-modal
      signaling between the mechanosensory and olfactory circuits is mediated by
      neuropeptides, one of which we identified as FLP-20. Our results indicate that
      under normal function, ongoing touch receptor neuron activation evokes FLP-20
      release, suppressing synaptic communication and thus dampening odor sensation. In
      contrast, in the absence of mechanosensory input, FLP-20 signaling is reduced,
      synaptic suppression is released, and this enables enhanced olfactory acuity;
      these changes are long lasting and do not represent ongoing modulation, as
      revealed by optogenetic experiments. Our work adds to a growing literature on the
      roles of neuropeptides in cross-modal signaling, by showing how
      activity-dependent neuropeptide signaling leads to specific cross-modal plastic
      changes in neural circuit connectivity, enhancing sensory performance.

PG  - e1002336
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002336 [doi]
AB  - Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is secreted by chemotactic neutrophils, forming a secondary
      gradient that amplifies the reach of primary chemoattractants. This strategy
      increases the recruitment range for neutrophils and is important during
      inflammation. Here, we show that LTB4 and its synthesizing enzymes localize to
      intracellular multivesicular bodies that, upon stimulation, release their content
      as exosomes. Purified exosomes can activate resting neutrophils and elicit
      chemotactic activity in a LTB4 receptor-dependent manner. Inhibition of exosome
      release leads to loss of directional motility with concomitant loss of LTB4
      release. Our findings establish that the exosomal pool of LTB4 acts in an
      autocrine fashion to sensitize neutrophils towards the primary chemoattractant,
      and in a paracrine fashion to mediate the recruitment of neighboring neutrophils 
      in trans. We envision that this mechanism is used by other signals to foster
      communication between cells in harsh extracellular environments.

TI  - Oocyte Polarization Is Coupled to the Chromosomal Bouquet, a Conserved Polarized 
      Nuclear Configuration in Meiosis.
PG  - e1002335
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002335 [doi]
AB  - The source of symmetry breaking in vertebrate oocytes is unknown. Animal-vegetal 
      oocyte polarity is established by the Balbiani body (Bb), a conserved structure
      found in all animals examined that contains an aggregate of specific mRNAs,
      proteins, and organelles. The Bb specifies the oocyte vegetal pole, which is key 
      to forming the embryonic body axes as well as the germline in most vertebrates.
      How Bb formation is regulated and how its asymmetric position is established are 
      unknown. Using quantitative image analysis, we trace oocyte symmetry breaking in 
      zebrafish to a nuclear asymmetry at the onset of meiosis called the chromosomal
      bouquet. The bouquet is a universal feature of meiosis where all telomeres
      cluster to one pole on the nuclear envelope, facilitating chromosomal pairing and
      meiotic recombination. We show that Bb precursor components first localize with
      the centrosome to the cytoplasm adjacent to the telomere cluster of the bouquet. 
      They then aggregate around the centrosome in a specialized nuclear cleft that we 
      identified, assembling the early Bb. We show that the bouquet nuclear events and 
      the cytoplasmic Bb precursor localization are mechanistically coordinated by
      microtubules. Thus the animal-vegetal axis of the oocyte is aligned to the
      nuclear axis of the bouquet. We further show that the symmetry breaking events
      lay upstream to the only known regulator of Bb formation, the Bucky ball protein.
      Our findings link two universal features of oogenesis, the Bb and the chromosomal
      bouquet, to oocyte polarization. We propose that a meiotic-vegetal center couples
      meiosis and oocyte patterning. Our findings reveal a novel mode of cellular
      polarization in meiotic cells whereby cellular and nuclear polarity are aligned. 
      We further reveal that in zygotene nests, intercellular cytoplasmic bridges
      remain between oocytes and that the position of the cytoplasmic bridge coincides 
      with the location of the centrosome meiotic-vegetal organizing center. These
      results suggest that centrosome positioning is set by the last mitotic oogonial
      division plane. Thus, oocytes are polarized in two steps: first, mitotic
      divisions preset the centrosome with no obvious polarization yet, then the
      meiotic-vegetal center forms at zygotene bouquet stages, when symmetry is, in
      effect, broken.

TI  - A Novel Platform for the Potentiation of Therapeutic Antibodies Based on

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002344 [doi]
AB  - IgG antibodies can organize into ordered hexamers on cell surfaces after binding 
      their antigen. These hexamers bind the first component of complement C1 inducing 
      complement-dependent target cell killing. Here, we translated this natural
      concept into a novel technology platform (HexaBody technology) for therapeutic
      antibody potentiation. We identified mutations that enhanced hexamer formation
      and complement activation by IgG1 antibodies against a range of targets on cells 
      from hematological and solid tumor indications. IgG1 backbones with preferred
      mutations E345K or E430G conveyed a strong ability to induce conditional
      complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of cell lines and chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) patient tumor cells, while retaining regular pharmacokinetics and 
      biopharmaceutical developability. Both mutations potently enhanced CDC- and
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of a type II CD20 antibody that
      was ineffective in complement activation, while retaining its ability to induce
      apoptosis. The identified IgG1 Fc backbones provide a novel platform for the
      generation of therapeutics with enhanced effector functions that only become
      activated upon binding to target cell-expressed antigen.

TI  - High-Throughput Genetic Screens Identify a Large and Diverse Collection of New
      Sporulation Genes in Bacillus subtilis.
PG  - e1002341
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002341 [doi]
AB  - The differentiation of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis into a dormant spore is
      among the most well-characterized developmental pathways in biology. Classical
      genetic screens performed over the past half century identified scores of factors
      involved in every step of this morphological process. More recently,
      transcriptional profiling uncovered additional sporulation-induced genes required
      for successful spore development. Here, we used transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) to
      assess whether there were any sporulation genes left to be discovered. Our screen
      identified 133 out of the 148 genes with known sporulation defects. Surprisingly,
      we discovered 24 additional genes that had not been previously implicated in
      spore formation. To investigate their functions, we used fluorescence microscopy 
      to survey early, middle, and late stages of differentiation of null mutants from 
      the B. subtilis ordered knockout collection. This analysis identified mutants
      that are delayed in the initiation of sporulation, defective in membrane
      remodeling, and impaired in spore maturation. Several mutants had novel
      sporulation phenotypes. We performed in-depth characterization of two new factors
      that participate in cell-cell signaling pathways during sporulation. One (SpoIIT)
      functions in the activation of sigmaE in the mother cell; the other (SpoIIIL) is 
      required for sigmaG activity in the forespore. Our analysis also revealed that as
      many as 36 sporulation-induced genes with no previously reported mutant
      phenotypes are required for timely spore maturation. Finally, we discovered a
      large set of transposon insertions that trigger premature initiation of
      sporulation. Our results highlight the power of Tn-seq for the discovery of new
      genes and novel pathways in sporulation and, combined with the recently completed
      null mutant collection, open the door for similar screens in other, less
      well-characterized processes.

TI  - ALS-Causing Mutations Significantly Perturb the Self-Assembly and Interaction
      with Nucleic Acid of the Intrinsically Disordered Prion-Like Domain of TDP-43.
PG  - e1002338
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002338 [doi]
AB  - TAR-DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) C-terminus encodes a prion-like domain widely
      presented in RNA-binding proteins, which functions to form dynamic oligomers and 
      also, amazingly, hosts most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing
      mutations. Here, as facilitated by our previous discovery, by circular dichroism 
      (CD), fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have
      successfully determined conformations, dynamics, and self-associations of the
      full-length prion-like domains of the wild type and three ALS-causing mutants
      (A315E, Q331K, and M337V) in both aqueous solutions and membrane environments.
      The study decodes the following: (1) The TDP-43 prion-like domain is
      intrinsically disordered only with some nascent secondary structures in aqueous
      solutions, but owns the capacity to assemble into dynamic oligomers rich in
      beta-sheet structures. By contrast, despite having highly similar conformations, 
      three mutants gained the ability to form amyloid oligomers. The wild type and
      three mutants all formed amyloid fibrils after incubation as imaged by electron
      microscopy. (2) The interaction with nucleic acid enhances the self-assembly for 
      the wild type but triggers quick aggregation for three mutants. (3) A
      membrane-interacting subdomain has been identified over residues Met311-Gln343
      indispensable for TDP-43 neurotoxicity, which transforms into a well-folded
      Omega-loop-helix structure in membrane environments. Furthermore, despite having 
      very similar membrane-embedded conformations, three mutants will undergo further 
      self-association in the membrane environment. Our study implies that the TDP-43
      prion-like domain appears to have an energy landscape, which allows the assembly 
      of the wild-type sequence into dynamic oligomers only under very limited
      condition sets, and ALS-causing point mutations are sufficient to remodel it to
      more favor the amyloid formation or irreversible aggregation, thus supporting the
      emerging view that the pathologic aggregation may occur via the exaggeration of
      functionally important assemblies. Furthermore, the coupled capacity of TDP-43 in
      aggregation and membrane interaction may critically account for its high
      neurotoxicity, and therefore its decoupling may represent a promising therapeutic
      strategy to treat TDP-43 causing neurodegenerative diseases.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002345 [doi]
AB  - The insula, particularly its posterior portion, is often regarded as a primary
      cortex for pain. However, this interpretation is largely based on reverse
      inference, and a specific involvement of the insula in pain has never been
      demonstrated. Taking advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of direct
      intracerebral recordings, we investigated whether the human insula exhibits local
      field potentials (LFPs) specific for pain. Forty-seven insular sites were
      investigated. Participants received brief stimuli belonging to four different
      modalities (nociceptive, vibrotactile, auditory, and visual). Both nociceptive
      stimuli and non-nociceptive vibrotactile, auditory, and visual stimuli elicited
      consistent LFPs in the posterior and anterior insula, with matching spatial
      distributions. Furthermore, a blind source separation procedure showed that
      nociceptive LFPs are largely explained by multimodal neural activity also
      contributing to non-nociceptive LFPs. By revealing that LFPs elicited by
      nociceptive stimuli reflect activity unrelated to nociception and pain, our
      results confute the widespread assumption that these brain responses are a
      signature for pain perception and its modulation.

TI  - A Latex Metabolite Benefits Plant Fitness under Root Herbivore Attack.
PG  - e1002332
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002332 [doi]
AB  - Plants produce large amounts of secondary metabolites in their shoots and roots
      and store them in specialized secretory structures. Although secondary
      metabolites and their secretory structures are commonly assumed to have a
      defensive function, evidence that they benefit plant fitness under herbivore
      attack is scarce, especially below ground. Here, we tested whether latex
      secondary metabolites produced by the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale
      agg.) decrease the performance of its major native insect root herbivore, the
      larvae of the common cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha), and benefit plant
      vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha attack. Across 17 T.
      officinale genotypes screened by gas and liquid chromatography, latex
      concentrations of the sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl 
      ester (TA-G) were negatively associated with M. melolontha larval growth. Adding 
      purified TA-G to artificial diet at ecologically relevant concentrations reduced 
      larval feeding. Silencing the germacrene A synthase ToGAS1, an enzyme that was
      identified to catalyze the first committed step of TA-G biosynthesis, resulted in
      a 90% reduction of TA-G levels and a pronounced increase in M. melolontha
      feeding. Transgenic, TA-G-deficient lines were preferred by M. melolontha and
      suffered three times more root biomass reduction than control lines. In a common 
      garden experiment involving over 2,000 T. officinale individuals belonging to 17 
      different genotypes, high TA-G concentrations were associated with the
      maintenance of high vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha
      attack. Taken together, our study demonstrates that a latex secondary metabolite 
      benefits plants under herbivore attack, a result that provides a mechanistic
      framework for root herbivore driven natural selection and evolution of plant
      defenses below ground.

AB  - Understanding the structure-function relationship of cells and organelles in
      their natural context requires multidimensional imaging. As techniques for
      multimodal 3-D imaging have become more accessible, effective processing,
      visualization, and analysis of large datasets are posing a bottleneck for the
      workflow. Here, we present a new software package for high-performance
      segmentation and image processing of multidimensional datasets that improves and 
      facilitates the full utilization and quantitative analysis of acquired data,
      which is freely available from a dedicated website. The open-source environment
      enables modification and insertion of new plug-ins to customize the program for
      specific needs. We provide practical examples of program features used for
      processing, segmentation and analysis of light and electron microscopy datasets, 
      and detailed tutorials to enable users to rapidly and thoroughly learn how to use
      the program.

TI  - Reproducible Research Practices and Transparency across the Biomedical
      Literature.
PG  - e1002333
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002333 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing movement to encourage reproducibility and transparency
      practices in the scientific community, including public access to raw data and
      protocols, the conduct of replication studies, systematic integration of evidence
      in systematic reviews, and the documentation of funding and potential conflicts
      of interest. In this survey, we assessed the current status of reproducibility
      and transparency addressing these indicators in a random sample of 441 biomedical
      journal articles published in 2000-2014. Only one study provided a full protocol 
      and none made all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n =
      4), and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review
      or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding 
      or conflicts of interest. The percentage of articles with no statement of
      conflict decreased substantially between 2000 and 2014 (94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in
      2014); the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts (0% in 2000, 
      15.4% in 2014) or no conflicts (5.6% in 2000, 50.0% in 2014) increased. Articles 
      published in journals in the clinical medicine category versus other fields were 
      almost twice as likely to not include any information on funding and to have
      private funding. This study provides baseline data to compare future progress in 
      improving these indicators in the scientific literature.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002331 [doi]
AB  - Given small sample sizes, loss of animals in preclinical experiments can
      dramatically alter results. However, effects of attrition on distortion of
      results are unknown. We used a simulation study to analyze the effects of random 
      and biased attrition. As expected, random loss of samples decreased statistical
      power, but biased removal, including that of outliers, dramatically increased
      probability of false positive results. Next, we performed a meta-analysis of
      animal reporting and attrition in stroke and cancer. Most papers did not
      adequately report attrition, and extrapolating from the results of the simulation
      data, we suggest that their effect sizes were likely overestimated.
