TI  - Genetic scores to stratify risk of developing multiple islet autoantibodies and
      type 1 diabetes: A prospective study in children.
PG  - e1002548

AB  - BACKGROUND: Around 0.3% of newborns will develop autoimmunity to pancreatic beta 
      cells in childhood and subsequently develop type 1 diabetes before adulthood.
      Primary prevention of type 1 diabetes will require early intervention in
      genetically at-risk infants. The objective of this study was to determine to what
      extent genetic scores (two previous genetic scores and a merged genetic score)
      can improve the prediction of type 1 diabetes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The
      Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study followed
      genetically at-risk children at 3- to 6-monthly intervals from birth for the
      development of islet autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes. Infants were enrolled
      between 1 September 2004 and 28 February 2010 and monitored until 31 May 2016.
      The risk (positive predictive value) for developing multiple islet autoantibodies
      (pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes) and type 1 diabetes was determined in 4,543
      children who had no first-degree relatives with type 1 diabetes and either a
      heterozygous HLA DR3 and DR4-DQ8 risk genotype or a homozygous DR4-DQ8 genotype, 
      and in 3,498 of these children in whom genetic scores were calculated from 41
      single nucleotide polymorphisms. In the children with the HLA risk genotypes,
      risk for developing multiple islet autoantibodies was 5.8% (95% CI 5.0%-6.6%) by 
      age 6 years, and risk for diabetes by age 10 years was 3.7% (95% CI 3.0%-4.4%).
      Risk for developing multiple islet autoantibodies was 11.0% (95% CI 8.7%-13.3%)
      in children with a merged genetic score of >14.4 (upper quartile; n = 907)
      compared to 4.1% (95% CI 3.3%-4.9%, P < 0.001) in children with a genetic score
      of </=14.4 (n = 2,591). Risk for developing diabetes by age 10 years was 7.6%
      (95% CI 5.3%-9.9%) in children with a merged score of >14.4 compared with 2.7%
      (95% CI 1.9%-3.6%) in children with a score of </=14.4 (P < 0.001). Of 173
      children with multiple islet autoantibodies by age 6 years and 107 children with 
      diabetes by age 10 years, 82 (sensitivity, 47.4%; 95% CI 40.1%-54.8%) and 52
      (sensitivity, 48.6%, 95% CI 39.3%-60.0%), respectively, had a score >14.4. Scores
      were higher in European versus US children (P = 0.003). In children with a merged
      score of >14.4, risk for multiple islet autoantibodies was similar and
      consistently >10% in Europe and in the US; risk was greater in males than in
      females (P = 0.01). Limitations of the study include that the genetic scores were
      originally developed from case-control studies of clinical diabetes in
      individuals of mainly European decent. It is, therefore, possible that it may not
      be suitable to all populations. CONCLUSIONS: A type 1 diabetes genetic score
      identified infants without family history of type 1 diabetes who had a greater
      than 10% risk for pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes, and a nearly 2-fold higher
      risk than children identified by high-risk HLA genotypes alone. This finding
      extends the possibilities for enrolling children into type 1 diabetes primary
      prevention trials.

TI  - Integration of postpartum healthcare services for HIV-infected women and their
      infants in South Africa: A randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e1002547
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the number of HIV-infected women initiating lifelong
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy increases globally, concerns have
      emerged regarding low levels of retention in HIV services and suboptimal
      adherence to ART during the postpartum period. We examined the impact of
      integrating postpartum ART for HIV+ mothers alongside infant follow-up within
      maternal and child health (MCH) services in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We conducted a randomised trial among HIV+ postpartum women aged >/=18 
      years who initiated ART during pregnancy in the local antenatal care clinic and
      were breastfeeding when screened before 6 weeks postpartum. We compared an
      integrated postnatal service among mothers and their infants (the MCH-ART
      intervention) to the local standard of care (control)-immediate postnatal
      referral of HIV+ women on ART to general adult ART services and their infants to 
      separate routine infant follow-up. Evaluation data were collected through medical
      records and trial measurement visits scheduled and located separately from
      healthcare services involved in either arm. The primary trial outcome was a
      composite endpoint of women's retention in ART care and viral suppression (VS)
      (viral load < 50 copies/ml) at 12 months postpartum; secondary outcomes included 
      duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding, mother-to-child HIV transmission,
      and infant mortality. Between 5 June 2013 and 10 December 2014, a total of 471
      mother-infant pairs were enrolled and randomised (mean age, 28.6 years; 18%
      nulliparous; 57% newly diagnosed with HIV in pregnancy; median duration of ART
      use at randomisation, 18 weeks). Among 411 women (87%) with primary endpoint data
      available, 77% of women (n = 155) randomised to the MCH-ART intervention achieved
      the primary composite outcome of retention in ART services with VS at 12 months
      postpartum, compared to 56% of women (n = 117) randomised to the control arm
      (absolute risk difference, 0.21; 95% CI: 0.12-0.30; p < 0.001). The findings for 
      improved retention in care and VS among women in the MCH-ART intervention arm
      were consistent across subgroups of participants according to demographic and
      clinical characteristics. The median durations of any breastfeeding and exclusive
      breastfeeding were longer in women randomised to the intervention versus control 
      arm (6.9 versus 3.0 months, p = 0.006, and 3.0 versus 1.4 months, p < 0.001,
      respectively). For the infants, overall HIV-free survival through 12 months of
      age was 97%: mother-to-child HIV transmission was 1.2% overall (n = 4 and n = 1
      transmissions in the intervention and control arms, respectively), and infant
      mortality was 1.9% (n = 6 and n = 3 deaths in the intervention and control arms, 
      respectively), and these outcomes were similar by trial arm. Interpretation of
      these findings should be qualified by the location of this study in a single
      urban area as well as the self-reported nature of breastfeeding outcomes.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that integrating ART services into the MCH
      platform during the postnatal period was a simple and effective intervention, and
      this should be considered for improving maternal and child outcomes in the
      context of HIV. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01933477.

TI  - Polycystic ovary syndrome, androgen excess, and the risk of nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease in women: A longitudinal study based on a United Kingdom primary
      care database.
PG  - e1002542
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002542 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen excess is a defining feature of polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS), which affects 10% of women and represents a lifelong metabolic disorder, 
      with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular events. 
      Previous studies have suggested an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) in individuals with PCOS and implicated androgen excess as a
      potential driver. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We carried out a retrospective
      longitudinal cohort study utilizing a large primary care database in the United
      Kingdom, evaluating NAFLD rates in 63,120 women with PCOS and 121,064 age-, body 
      mass index (BMI)-, and location-matched control women registered from January
      2000 to May 2016. In 2 independent cohorts, we also determined the rate of NAFLD 
      in women with a measurement of serum testosterone (n = 71,061) and sex
      hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; n = 49,625). We used multivariate Cox models to
      estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for NAFLD and found that women with PCOS had an
      increased rate of NAFLD (HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.86-2.66, p < 0.001), also after
      adjusting for BMI or dysglycemia. Serum testosterone >3.0 nmol/L was associated
      with an increase in NAFLD (HR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.16-4.53, p = 0.017 for 3-3.49
      nmol/L and HR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.24-4.66, p = 0.009 for >3.5 nmol/L). Mirroring
      this finding, SHBG <30 nmol/L was associated with increased NAFLD hazard (HR =
      4.75, 95% CI 2.44-9.25, p < 0.001 for 20-29.99 nmol/L and HR = 4.98, 95% CI
      2.45-10.11, p < 0.001 for <20 nmol/L). Limitations of this study include its
      retrospective nature, absence of detailed information on criteria used to
      diagnosis PCOS and NAFLD, and absence of data on laboratory assays used to
      measure serum androgens. CONCLUSIONS: We found that women with PCOS have an
      increased rate of NAFLD. In addition to increased BMI and dysglycemia, androgen
      excess contributes to the development of NAFLD in women with PCOS. In women with 
      PCOS-related androgen excess, systematic NAFLD screening should be considered.

TI  - Comorbidity health pathways in heart failure patients: A sequences-of-regressions
      analysis using cross-sectional data from 10,575 patients in the Swedish Heart
      Failure Registry.
PG  - e1002540
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimally treated heart failure (HF) patients often have persisting
      symptoms and poor health-related quality of life. Comorbidities are common, but
      little is known about their impact on these factors, and guideline-driven HF care
      remains focused on cardiovascular status. The following hypotheses were tested:
      (i) comorbidities are associated with more severe symptoms and functional
      limitations and subsequently worse patient-rated health in HF, and (ii) these
      patterns of association differ among selected comorbidities. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SHFR) is a national
      population-based register of HF patients admitted to >85% of hospitals in Sweden 
      or attending outpatient clinics. This study included 10,575 HF patients with
      patient-rated health recorded during first registration in the SHFR (1 February
      2008 to 1 November 2013). An a priori health model and sequences-of-regressions
      analysis were used to test associations among comorbidities and patient-reported 
      symptoms, functional limitations, and patient-rated health. Patient-rated health 
      measures included the EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the EuroQol
      visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). EQ-VAS score ranges from 0 (worst health) to 100 
      (best health). Patient-rated health declined progressively from patients with no 
      comorbidities (mean EQ-VAS score, 66) to patients with cardiovascular
      comorbidities (mean EQ-VAS score, 62) to patients with non-cardiovascular
      comorbidities (mean EQ-VAS score, 59). The relationships among cardiovascular
      comorbidities and patient-rated health were explained by their associations with 
      anxiety or depression (atrial fibrillation, odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 
      1.27; ischemic heart disease [IHD], OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.32) and with pain
      (IHD, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38). Associations of non-cardiovascular
      comorbidities with patient-rated health were explained by their associations with
      shortness of breath (diabetes, OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32; chronic kidney
      disease [CKD, OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.38; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      [COPD], OR 95% CI 1.84, 1.62 to 2.10) and with fatigue (diabetes, OR 1.27, 95% CI
      1.13 to 1.42; CKD, OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.38; COPD, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.50 to
      1.91). There were direct associations between all symptoms and patient-rated
      health, and indirect associations via functional limitations. Anxiety or
      depression had the strongest association with functional limitations (OR 10.03,
      95% CI 5.16 to 19.50) and patient-rated health (mean difference in EQ-VAS score, 
      -18.68, 95% CI -23.22 to -14.14). HF optimizing therapies did not influence these
      associations. Key limitations of the study include the cross-sectional design and
      unclear generalisability to other populations. Further prospective HF studies are
      required to test the consistency of the relationships and their implications for 
      health. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of distinct comorbidity health pathways in HF
      could provide the evidence for individualised person-centred care that targets
      specific comorbidities and associated symptoms.

TI  - Antiviral efficacy of favipiravir against Ebola virus: A translational study in
      cynomolgus macaques.
PG  - e1002535
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002535 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite repeated outbreaks, in particular the devastating 2014-2016
      epidemic, there is no effective treatment validated for patients with Ebola virus
      disease (EVD). Among the drug candidates is the broad-spectrum polymerase
      inhibitor favipiravir, which showed a good tolerance profile in patients with EVD
      (JIKI trial) but did not demonstrate a strong antiviral efficacy. In order to
      gain new insights into the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir and improve
      preparedness and public health management of future outbreaks, we assess the
      efficacy achieved by ascending doses of favipiravir in Ebola-virus-infected
      nonhuman primates (NHPs). METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 26 animals (Macaca
      fascicularis) were challenged intramuscularly at day 0 with 1,000 focus-forming
      units of Ebola virus Gabon 2001 strain and followed for 21 days (study
      termination). This included 13 animals left untreated and 13 treated with doses
      of 100, 150, and 180 mg/kg (N = 3, 5, and 5, respectively) favipiravir
      administered intravenously twice a day for 14 days, starting 2 days before
      infection. All animals left untreated or treated with 100 mg/kg died within 10
      days post-infection, while animals receiving 150 and 180 mg/kg had extended
      survival (P < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively, compared to untreated animals),
      leading to a survival rate of 40% (2/5) and 60% (3/5), respectively, at day 21.
      Favipiravir inhibited viral replication (molecular and infectious viral loads) in
      a drug-concentration-dependent manner (P values < 0.001), and genomic deep
      sequencing analyses showed an increase in virus mutagenesis over time. These
      results allowed us to identify that plasma trough favipiravir concentrations
      greater than 70-80 mug/ml were associated with reduced viral loads, lower virus
      infectivity, and extended survival. These levels are higher than those found in
      the JIKI trial, where patients had median trough drug concentrations equal to 46 
      and 26 mug/ml at day 2 and day 4 post-treatment, respectively, and suggest that
      the dosing regimen in the JIKI trial was suboptimal. The environment of a
      biosafety level 4 laboratory introduces a number of limitations, in particular
      the difficulty of conducting blind studies and performing detailed
      pharmacological assessments. Further, the extrapolation of the results to
      patients with EVD is limited by the fact that the model is fully lethal and that 
      treatment initiation in patients with EVD is most often initiated several days
      after infection, when symptoms and high levels of viral replication are already
      present. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that favipiravir may be an effective
      antiviral drug against Ebola virus that relies on RNA chain termination and
      possibly error catastrophe. These results, together with previous data collected 
      on tolerance and pharmacokinetics in both NHPs and humans, support a potential
      role for high doses of favipiravir for future human interventions.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the association between 35 frailty scores and
      cardiovascular events, cancer, and total mortality in an elderly general
      population in England: An observational study.
PG  - e1002543
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002543 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frail elderly people experience elevated mortality. However, no
      consensus exists on the definition of frailty, and many frailty scores have been 
      developed. The main aim of this study was to compare the association between 35
      frailty scores and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), incident cancer, and
      all-cause mortality. Also, we aimed to assess whether frailty scores added
      predictive value to basic and adjusted models for these outcomes. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Through a structured literature search, we identified 35 frailty scores
      that could be calculated at wave 2 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
      (ELSA), an observational cohort study. We analysed data from 5,294 participants, 
      44.9% men, aged 60 years and over. We studied the association between each of the
      scores and the incidence of CVD, cancer, and all-cause mortality during a 7-year 
      follow-up using Cox proportional hazard models at progressive levels of
      adjustment. We also examined the added predictive performance of each score on
      top of basic models using Harrell's C statistic. Using age of the participant as 
      a timescale, in sex-adjusted models, hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence
      intervals) for all-cause mortality ranged from 2.4 (95% CI: 1.7-3.3) to 26.2 (95%
      CI: 15.4-44.5). In further adjusted models including smoking status and alcohol
      consumption, HR ranged from 2.3 (95% CI: 1.6-3.1) to 20.2 (95% CI: 11.8-34.5). In
      fully adjusted models including lifestyle and comorbidity, HR ranged from 0.9
      (95% CI: 0.5-1.7) to 8.4 (95% CI: 4.9-14.4). HRs for CVD and cancer incidence in 
      sex-adjusted models ranged from 1.2 (95% CI: 0.5-3.2) to 16.5 (95% CI: 7.8-35.0) 
      and from 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4-1.2) to 2.4 (95% CI: 1.0-5.7), respectively. In sex-
      and age-adjusted models, all frailty scores showed significant added predictive
      performance for all-cause mortality, increasing the C statistic by up to 3%. None
      of the scores significantly improved basic prediction models for CVD or cancer. A
      source of bias could be the differences in mortality follow-up time compared to
      CVD/cancer, because the existence of informative censoring cannot be excluded.
      CONCLUSION: There is high variability in the strength of the association between 
      frailty scores and 7-year all-cause mortality, incident CVD, and cancer. With
      regard to all-cause mortality, some scores give a modest improvement to the
      predictive ability. Our results show that certain scores clearly outperform
      others with regard to three important health outcomes in later life. Finally, we 
      think that despite their limitations, the use of frailty scores to identify the
      elderly population at risk is still a useful measure, and the choice of a frailty
      score should balance feasibility with performance.

TI  - Transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations within partner-pairs: A
      cross-sectional study of a primary HIV infection cohort.
PG  - e1002537
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002537 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug
      resistance mutations, particularly that of minority drug-resistant variants,
      remains poorly understood. Population-based studies suggest that drug-resistant
      HIV-1 is less transmissible than drug-susceptible viruses. We compared HIV-1
      drug-resistant genotypes among partner-pairs in order to assess the likelihood of
      transmission of drug resistance mutations and investigate the role of minority
      variants in HIV transmission. METHODS AND FINDINGS: From 1992-2010, 340 persons
      with primary HIV-1 infection and their partners were enrolled into observational 
      research studies at the University of Washington Primary Infection Clinic
      (UWPIC). Out of 50 partner-pairs enrolled, 36 (72%) transmission relationships
      were confirmed by phylogenetic distance analysis of HIV-1 envelope (env)
      sequences, and 31 partner-pairs enrolled after 1995 met criteria for this study. 
      Drug resistance mutations in the region of the HIV-1 polymerase gene (pol) that
      encodes protease and reverse transcriptase were assessed by 454-pyrosequencing.
      In 25 partner-pairs where the transmission direction could be determined, 12
      (48%) transmitters had 1-4 drug resistance mutations (23 total) detected in their
      HIV-1 populations at a median frequency of 6.0% (IQR 1.5%-98.7%, range
      1.0%-99.6%). Of 10 major mutations detected in five transmitters at a frequency
      >95%, 100% (95% CI 69.2%-100%) were detected in recipients. All of these
      transmitters were antiretroviral (ARV)-naive at the time of specimen collection. 
      Fourteen mutations (eight major mutations and six accessory mutations) were
      detected in nine transmitters at low frequencies (1.0%-11.8%); four of these
      transmitters had previously received ARV therapy. Two (14% [95% CI 1.8%-42.8%])
      G73S accessory mutations were detected in both transmitter and recipient. This
      number is not significantly different from the number expected based on the
      observed frequencies of drug-resistant viruses in transmitting partners.
      Limitations of this study include the small sample size and uncertainties in
      determining the timing of virus transmission and mutation history. CONCLUSIONS:
      Drug-resistant majority variants appeared to be commonly transmitted by ARV-naive
      participants in our analysis and may contribute significantly to transmitted drug
      resistance on a population level. When present at low frequency, no major
      mutation was observed to be shared between partner-pairs; identification of
      accessory mutations shared within a pair could be due to transmission, laboratory
      artifact, or apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptides
      (APOBECs), and warrants further study.

TI  - Multimorbidity in patients with heart failure from 11 Asian regions: A
      prospective cohort study using the ASIAN-HF registry.
PG  - e1002541
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbidities are common in patients with heart failure (HF) and
      complicate treatment and outcomes. We identified patterns of multimorbidity in
      Asian patients with HF and their association with patients' quality of life (QoL)
      and health outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data on 6,480 patients with
      chronic HF (1,204 with preserved ejection fraction) enrolled between 1 October
      2012 and 6 October 2016 in the Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure
      (ASIAN-HF) registry. The ASIAN-HF registry is a prospective cohort study, with
      patients prospectively enrolled from in- and outpatient clinics from 11 Asian
      regions (Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Thailand,
      Singapore, Indonesia, and Philippines). Latent class analysis was used to
      identify patterns of multimorbidity. The primary outcome was defined as a
      composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization within 1 year. To assess
      differences in QoL, we used the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. We
      identified 5 distinct multimorbidity groups: elderly/atrial fibrillation (AF) (N 
      = 1,048; oldest, more AF), metabolic (N = 1,129; obesity, diabetes,
      hypertension), young (N = 1,759; youngest, low comorbidity rates, non-ischemic
      etiology), ischemic (N = 1,261; ischemic etiology), and lean diabetic (N = 1,283;
      diabetic, hypertensive, low prevalence of obesity, high prevalence of chronic
      kidney disease). Patients in the lean diabetic group had the worst QoL, more
      severe signs and symptoms of HF, and the highest rate of the primary combined
      outcome within 1 year (29% versus 11% in the young group) (p for all <0.001).
      Adjusting for confounders (demographics, New York Heart Association class, and
      medication) the lean diabetic (hazard ratio [HR] 1.79, 95% CI 1.46-2.22),
      elderly/AF (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26-1.96), ischemic (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.22-1.88), and
      metabolic (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.60) groups had higher rates of the primary
      combined outcome compared to the young group. Potential limitations include site 
      selection and participation bias. CONCLUSIONS: Among Asian patients with HF,
      comorbidities naturally clustered in 5 distinct patterns, each differentially
      impacting patients' QoL and health outcomes. These data underscore the importance
      of studying multimorbidity in HF and the need for more comprehensive approaches
      in phenotyping patients with HF and multimorbidity. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of multidisciplinary care in mild to moderate chronic kidney
      disease in the United States: A modeling study.
PG  - e1002532
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002532 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary care (MDC) programs have been proposed as a way to 
      alleviate the cost and morbidity associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 
      the US. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a theoretical
      Medicare-based MDC program for CKD compared to usual CKD care in Medicare
      beneficiaries with stage 3 and 4 CKD between 45 and 84 years old in the US. The
      program used nephrologists, advanced practitioners, educators, dieticians, and
      social workers. From Medicare claims and published literature, we developed a
      novel deterministic Markov model for CKD progression and calibrated it to
      long-term risks of mortality and progression to end-stage renal disease. We then 
      used the model to project accrued discounted costs and quality-adjusted life
      years (QALYs) over patients' remaining lifetime. We estimated the incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MDC, or the cost of the intervention per QALY 
      gained. MDC added 0.23 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.42) QALYs over usual care, costing
      $51,285 per QALY gained (net monetary benefit of $23,100 at a threshold of
      $150,000 per QALY gained; 95% CI: $6,252, $44,323). In all subpopulations
      analyzed, ICERs ranged from $42,663 to $72,432 per QALY gained. MDC was generally
      more cost-effective in patients with higher urine albumin excretion. Although
      ICERs were higher in younger patients, MDC could yield greater improvements in
      health in younger than older patients. MDC remained cost-effective when we
      decreased its effectiveness to 25% of the base case or increased the cost 5-fold.
      The program costed less than $70,000 per QALY in 95% of probabilistic sensitivity
      analyses and less than $87,500 per QALY in 99% of analyses. Limitations of our
      study include its theoretical nature and being less generalizable to populations 
      at low risk for progression to ESRD. We did not study the potential impact of MDC
      on hospitalization (cardiovascular or other). CONCLUSIONS: Our model estimates
      that a Medicare-funded MDC program could reduce the need for dialysis, prolong
      life expectancy, and meet conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds in
      middle-aged to elderly patients with mild to moderate CKD.

TI  - HIV treatment eligibility expansion and timely antiretroviral treatment
      initiation following enrollment in HIV care: A metaregression analysis of
      programmatic data from 22 countries.
PG  - e1002534
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002534 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligibility expansions
      on patient outcomes, including rates of timely ART initiation among those
      enrolling in care, has not been assessed on a large scale. In addition, it is not
      known whether ART eligibility expansions may lead to "crowding out" of sicker
      patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined changes in timely ART initiation
      (within 6 months) at the original site of HIV care enrollment after ART
      eligibility expansions among 284,740 adult ART-naive patients at 171
      International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) network sites in 22
      countries where national policies expanding ART eligibility were introduced
      between 2007 and 2015. Half of the sites included in this analysis were from
      Southern Africa, one-third were from East Africa, and the remainder were from the
      Asia-Pacific, Central Africa, North America, and South and Central America
      regions. The median age of patients enrolling in care at contributing sites was
      33.5 years, and the median percentage of female patients at these clinics was
      62.5%. We assessed the 6-month cumulative incidence of timely ART initiation
      (CI-ART) before and after major expansions of ART eligibility (i.e., expansion to
      treat persons with CD4 </= 350 cells/muL [145 sites in 22 countries] and CD4 </= 
      500 cells/muL [152 sites in 15 countries]). Random effects metaregression models 
      were used to estimate absolute changes in CI-ART at each site before and after
      guideline expansion. The crude pooled estimate of change in CI-ART was 4.3
      percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6 to 6.1) after ART eligibility
      expansion to CD4 </= 350, from a baseline median CI-ART of 53%; and 15.9
      percentage points (pp) (95% CI 14.3 to 17.4) after ART eligibility expansion to
      CD4 </= 500, from a baseline median CI-ART of 57%. The largest increases in
      CI-ART were observed among those newly eligible for treatment (18.2 pp after
      expansion to CD4 </= 350 and 47.4 pp after expansion to CD4 </= 500), with no
      change or small increases among those eligible under prior guidelines (CD4 </=
      350: -0.6 pp, 95% CI -2.0 to 0.7 pp; CD4 </= 500: 4.9 pp, 95% CI 3.3 to 6.5 pp). 
      For ART eligibility expansion to CD4 </= 500, changes in CI-ART were largest
      among younger patients (16-24 years: 21.5 pp, 95% CI 18.9 to 24.2 pp). Key
      limitations include the lack of a counterfactual and difficulty accounting for
      secular outcome trends, due to universal exposure to guideline changes in each
      country. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of ART eligibility 
      expansion to improve the timeliness of ART initiation globally, particularly for 
      young adults.

TI  - Cerebral white matter disease and functional decline in older adults from the
      Northern Manhattan Study: A longitudinal cohort study.
PG  - e1002529
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002529 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI are common and
      associated with vascular and functional outcomes. However, the relationship
      between WMHs and longitudinal trajectories of functional status is not well
      characterized. We hypothesized that whole brain WMHs are associated with
      functional decline independently of intervening clinical vascular events and
      other vascular risk factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In the Northern Manhattan
      Study (NOMAS), a population-based racially/ethnically diverse prospective cohort 
      study, 1,290 stroke-free individuals underwent brain MRI and were followed
      afterwards for a mean 7.3 years with annual functional assessments using the
      Barthel index (BI) (range 0-100) and vascular event surveillance. Whole brain
      white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) (as percentage of total cranial volume 
      [TCV]) was standardized and treated continuously. Generalized estimating equation
      (GEE) models tested associations between whole brain WMHV and baseline BI and
      change in BI, adjusting for sociodemographic, vascular, and cognitive risk
      factors, as well as stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) occurring during
      follow-up. Mean age was 70.6 (standard deviation [SD] 9.0) years, 40% of
      participants were male, 66% Hispanic; mean whole brain WMHV was 0.68% (SD 0.84). 
      In fully adjusted models, annual functional change was -1.04 BI points (-1.20,
      -0.88), with -0.74 additional points annually per SD whole brain WMHV increase
      from the mean (-0.99, -0.49). Whole brain WMHV was not associated with baseline
      BI, and results were similar for mobility and non-mobility BI domains and among
      those with baseline BI 95-100. A limitation of the study is the possibility of a 
      healthy survivor bias, which would likely have underestimated the associations we
      found. CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study, greater whole brain
      WMHV was associated with steeper annual decline in functional status over the
      long term, independently of risk factors, vascular events, and baseline
      functional status. Subclinical brain ischemic changes may be an independent
      marker of long-term functional decline.

TI  - Causes of death and infant mortality rates among full-term births in the United
      States between 2010 and 2012: An observational study.
PG  - e1002531
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002531 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the high prevalence of preterm births and its impact on infant 
      mortality in the US have been widely acknowledged, recent data suggest that even 
      full-term births in the US face substantially higher mortality risks compared to 
      European countries with low infant mortality rates. In this paper, we use the
      most recent birth records in the US to more closely analyze the primary causes
      underlying mortality rates among full-term births. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Linked
      birth and death records for the period 2010-2012 were used to identify the state-
      and cause-specific burden of infant mortality among full-term infants (born at
      37-42 weeks of gestation). Multivariable logistic models were used to assess the 
      extent to which state-level differences in full-term infant mortality (FTIM) were
      attributable to observed differences in maternal and birth characteristics.
      Random effects models were used to assess the relative contribution of
      state-level variation to FTIM. Hypothetical mortality outcomes were computed
      under the assumption that all states could achieve the survival rates of the
      best-performing states. A total of 10,175,481 infants born full-term in the US
      between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012, were analyzed. FTIM rate (FTIMR) 
      was 2.2 per 1,000 live births overall, and ranged between 1.29 (Connecticut, 95% 
      CI 1.08, 1.53) and 3.77 (Mississippi, 95% CI 3.39, 4.19) at the state level. Zero
      states reached the rates reported in the 6 low-mortality European countries
      analyzed (FTIMR < 1.25), and 13 states had FTIMR > 2.75. Sudden unexpected death 
      in infancy (SUDI) accounted for 43% of FTIM; congenital malformations and
      perinatal conditions accounted for 31% and 11.3% of FTIM, respectively. The
      largest mortality differentials between states with good and states with poor
      FTIMR were found for SUDI, with particularly large risk differentials for deaths 
      due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (odds ratio [OR] 2.52, 95% CI 1.86,
      3.42) and suffocation (OR 4.40, 95% CI 3.71, 5.21). Even though these mortality
      differences were partially explained by state-level differences in maternal
      education, race, and maternal health, substantial state-level variation in infant
      mortality remained in fully adjusted models (SIDS OR 1.45, suffocation OR 2.92). 
      The extent to which these state differentials are due to differential antenatal
      care standards as well as differential access to health services could not be
      determined due to data limitations. Overall, our estimates suggest that infant
      mortality could be reduced by 4,003 deaths (95% CI 2,284, 5,587) annually if all 
      states were to achieve the mortality levels of the best-performing state in each 
      cause-of-death category. Key limitations of the analysis are that information on 
      termination rates at the state level was not available, and that causes of deaths
      may have been coded differentially across states. CONCLUSIONS: More than 7,000
      full-term infants die in the US each year. The results presented in this paper
      suggest that a substantial share of these deaths may be preventable. Potential
      improvements seem particularly large for SUDI, where very low rates have been
      achieved in a few states while average mortality rates remain high in most other 
      areas. Given the high mortality burden due to SIDS and suffocation, policy
      efforts to promote compliance with recommended sleeping arrangements could be an 
      effective first step in this direction.

TI  - Blood pressure-lowering treatment strategies based on cardiovascular risk versus 
      blood pressure: A meta-analysis of individual participant data.
PG  - e1002538
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002538 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have traditionally recommended blood
      pressure treatment based primarily on blood pressure thresholds. In contrast,
      using predicted cardiovascular risk has been advocated as a more effective
      strategy to guide treatment decisions for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      prevention. We aimed to compare outcomes from a blood pressure-lowering treatment
      strategy based on predicted cardiovascular risk with one based on systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP) level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used individual participant data
      from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (BPLTTC) from
      1995 to 2013. Trials randomly assigned participants to either blood
      pressure-lowering drugs versus placebo or more intensive versus less intensive
      blood pressure-lowering regimens. We estimated 5-y risk of CVD events using a
      multivariable Weibull model previously developed in this dataset. We compared the
      two strategies at specific SBP thresholds and across the spectrum of risk and
      blood pressure levels studied in BPLTTC trials. The primary outcome was number of
      CVD events avoided per persons treated. We included data from 11 trials (47,872
      participants). During a median of 4.0 y of follow-up, 3,566 participants (7.5%)
      experienced a major cardiovascular event. Areas under the curve comparing the two
      treatment strategies throughout the range of possible thresholds for CVD risk and
      SBP demonstrated that, on average, a greater number of CVD events would be
      avoided for a given number of persons treated with the CVD risk strategy compared
      with the SBP strategy (area under the curve 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI)
      0.70-0.72] for the CVD risk strategy versus 0.54 [95% CI 0.53-0.55] for the SBP
      strategy). Compared with treating everyone with SBP >/= 150 mmHg, a CVD risk
      strategy would require treatment of 29% (95% CI 26%-31%) fewer persons to prevent
      the same number of events or would prevent 16% (95% CI 14%-18%) more events for
      the same number of persons treated. Compared with treating everyone with SBP >/= 
      140 mmHg, a CVD risk strategy would require treatment of 3.8% (95% CI 12.5% fewer
      to 7.2% more) fewer persons to prevent the same number of events or would prevent
      3.1% (95% CI 1.5%-5.0%) more events for the same number of persons treated,
      although the former estimate was not statistically significant. In subgroup
      analyses, the CVD risk strategy did not appear to be more beneficial than the SBP
      strategy in patients with diabetes mellitus or established CVD. CONCLUSIONS: A
      blood pressure-lowering treatment strategy based on predicted cardiovascular risk
      is more effective than one based on blood pressure levels alone across a range of
      thresholds. These results support using cardiovascular risk assessment to guide
      blood pressure treatment decision-making in moderate- to high-risk individuals,
      particularly for primary prevention.

TI  - Progression of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke multimorbidity in middle-aged 
      women: A 20-year cohort study.
PG  - e1002516
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002516 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke multimorbidity 
      (co-occurrence of two or three of these conditions) has increased rapidly. Little
      is known about how the three conditions progress from one to another sequentially
      through the life course. We aimed to delineate this progression in middle-aged
      women and to determine the roles of common risk factors in the accumulation of
      diabetes, heart disease, and stroke multimorbidity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used
      data from 13,714 women aged 45-50 years without a history of any of the three
      conditions. They were participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on
      Women's Health (ALSWH), enrolled in 1996, and surveyed approximately every 3
      years to 2016. We characterized the longitudinal progression of the three
      conditions and multimorbidity. We estimated the accumulation of multimorbidity
      over 20 years of follow-up and investigated their association with both baseline 
      and time-varying predictors (sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and
      other chronic conditions). Over 20 years, 2,511 (18.3%) of the women progressed
      to at least one condition, of whom 1,420 (56.6%) had diabetes, 1,277 (50.9%) had 
      heart disease, and 308 (12.3%) had stroke; 423 (16.8%) had two or three of these 
      conditions. Over a 3-year period, the age-adjusted odds of two or more conditions
      was approximately twice that of developing one new condition compared to women
      who did not develop any new conditions. For example, the odds for developing one 
      new condition between Surveys 7 and 8 were 2.29 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.93-2.72), whereas the odds for developing two or more conditions was 6.51 (95% 
      CI, 3.95-10.75). The onset of stroke was more strongly associated with the
      progression to the other conditions (i.e., 23.4% [95% CI, 16.3%-32.2%] of women
      after first onset of stroke progressed to other conditions, whereas the
      percentages for diabetes and heart disease were 9.9% [95% CI, 7.9%-12.4%] and
      11.4% [95% CI, 9.1%-14.4%], respectively). Being separated, divorced, or widowed;
      being born outside Australia; having difficulty managing on their available
      income; being overweight or obese; having hypertension; being physically
      inactive; being a current smoker; and having prior chronic conditions (i.e.,
      mental disorders, asthma, cancer, osteoporosis, and arthritis) were significantly
      associated with increased odds of accumulation of diabetes, heart disease, and
      stroke multimorbidity. The main limitations of this study were the use of
      self-reported data and the low number of events. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke was
      associated with increased risk of progression to diabetes or heart disease.
      Social inequality, obesity, hypertension, physical inactivity, smoking, or having
      other chronic conditions were also significantly associated with increased odds
      of accumulating multimorbidity. Our findings highlight the importance of
      awareness of the role of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke multimorbidity among
      middle-aged women for clinicians and health-promotion agencies.

TI  - Validation of a genetic risk score for atrial fibrillation: A prospective
      multicenter cohort study.
PG  - e1002525
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002525 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered arrhythmia 
      and is associated with an elevated risk of stroke. Improving the identification
      of patients with the highest risk for AF to enable appropriate surveillance and
      treatment, if necessary, is critical to reducing AF-associated morbidity and
      mortality. Multiple common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are
      unequivocally associated with the lifetime risk of AF. In the current study we
      aimed to prospectively validate an AF genetic risk score (GRS) in previously
      undiagnosed patients at risk for AF. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Individuals 40 years
      of age or older with 1 clinical risk factor for AF, presenting with symptoms of
      AF, or with a first diagnosis of AF, were enrolled for genetic testing and
      ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring with an adhesive patch monitor or a
      long-term Holter monitor (mean wear time 10 days 21 hours and 13 days 18 hours,
      respectively). An AF event was the first diagnosis of AF by ECG, patch monitor,
      or long-term Holter monitor. The AF GRS was determined for each participant based
      on the weighted contribution of 12 genetic risk loci. Of 904 participants, 85
      manifested AF. Their mean age was 66.2 (SD 11.8) years; 38% of participants were 
      male. Participants in the highest quintile of AF GRS were more likely (odds ratio
      3.11; 95% CI 1.27-7.58; p = 0.01) to have had an AF event than participants in
      the lowest quintile after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, BMI,
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and prior myocardial infarction. 
      Study limitations included an ethnically homogenous population, a restricted
      rhythm monitoring period, and the evolving discovery of SNPs associated with AF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Prospective assessment of a GRS for AF identified participants with 
      elevated risk of AF beyond established clinical criteria. Accordingly, a GRS for 
      AF could be incorporated into overall risk assessment to better identify patients
      at the highest risk of developing AF, although further testing in larger
      populations is needed to confirm these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - A clinical decision support tool for improving adherence to guidelines on
      anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk of stroke: A
      cluster-randomized trial in a Swedish primary care setting (the CDS-AF study).
PG  - e1002528
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002528 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with substantial morbidity, in
      particular stroke. Despite good evidence for the reduction of stroke risk with
      anticoagulant therapy, there remains significant undertreatment. The main aim of 
      the current study was to investigate whether a clinical decision support tool
      (CDS) for stroke prevention integrated in the electronic health record could
      improve adherence to guidelines for stroke prevention in patients with AF.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial where all 43
      primary care clinics in the county of Ostergotland, Sweden (population 444,347), 
      were randomized to be part of the CDS intervention or to serve as controls. The
      CDS produced an alert for physicians responsible for patients with AF and at
      increased risk for thromboembolism (according to the CHA2DS2-VASc algorithm)
      without anticoagulant therapy. The primary endpoint was adherence to guidelines
      after 1 year. After randomization, there were 22 and 21 primary care clinics in
      the CDS and control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences
      in baseline adherence to guidelines regarding anticoagulant therapy between the 2
      groups (CDS group 70.3% [5,186/7,370; 95% CI 62.9%-77.7%], control group 70.0%
      [4,187/6,009; 95% CI 60.4%-79.6%], p = 0.83). After 12 months, analysis with
      linear regression with adjustment for primary care clinic size and adherence to
      guidelines at baseline revealed a significant increase in guideline adherence in 
      the CDS (73.0%, 95% CI 64.6%-81.4%) versus the control group (71.2%, 95% CI
      60.8%-81.6%, p = 0.013, with a treatment effect estimate of 0.016 [95% CI
      0.003-0.028]; number of patients with AF included in the final analysis 8,292 and
      6,508 in the CDS and control group, respectively). Over the study period, there
      was no difference in the incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or
      systemic thromboembolism in the CDS group versus the control group (49 [95% CI
      43-55] per 1,000 patients with AF in the CDS group compared to 47 [95% CI 39-55] 
      per 1,000 patients with AF in the control group, p = 0.64). Regarding safety, the
      CDS group had a lower incidence of significant bleeding, with events in 12 (95%
      CI 9-15) per 1,000 patients with AF compared to 16 (95% CI 12-20) per 1,000
      patients with AF in the control group (p = 0.04). Limitations of the study design
      include that the analysis was carried out in a catchment area with a high
      baseline adherence rate, and issues regarding reproducibility to other regions.
      CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that a CDS can increase guideline
      adherence for anticoagulant therapy in patients with AF. Even though the observed

TI  - Physical activity levels in adults and older adults 3-4 years after
      pedometer-based walking interventions: Long-term follow-up of participants from
      two randomised controlled trials in UK primary care.
PG  - e1002526
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002526 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is an important cause of noncommunicable
      diseases. Interventions can increase short-term physical activity (PA), but
      health benefits require maintenance. Few interventions have evaluated PA
      objectively beyond 12 months. We followed up two pedometer interventions with
      positive 12-month effects to examine objective PA levels at 3-4 years. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: Long-term follow-up of two completed trials: Pedometer And
      Consultation Evaluation-UP (PACE-UP) 3-arm (postal, nurse support, control) at 3 
      years and Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation-Lift (PACE-Lift) 2-arm 
      (nurse support, control) at 4 years post-baseline. Randomly selected patients
      from 10 United Kingdom primary care practices were recruited (PACE-UP: 45-75
      years, PACE-Lift: 60-75 years). Intervention arms received 12-week walking
      programmes (pedometer, handbooks, PA diaries) postally (PACE-UP) or with nurse
      support (PACE-UP, PACE-Lift). Main outcomes were changes in 7-day accelerometer
      average daily step counts and weekly time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in
      >/=10-minute bouts in intervention versus control groups, between baseline and 3 
      years (PACE-UP) and 4 years (PACE-Lift). PACE-UP 3-year follow-up was 67%
      (681/1,023) (mean age: 59, 64% female), and PACE-Lift 4-year follow-up was 76%
      (225/298) (mean age: 67, 53% female). PACE-UP 3-year intervention versus control 
      comparisons were as follows: additional steps/day postal +627 (95% CI:
      198-1,056), p = 0.004, nurse +670 (95% CI: 237-1,102), p = 0.002; total weekly
      MVPA in bouts (minutes/week) postal +28 (95% CI: 7-49), p = 0.009, nurse +24 (95%
      CI: 3-45), p = 0.03. PACE-Lift 4-year intervention versus control comparisons
      were: +407 (95% CI: -177-992), p = 0.17 steps/day, and +32 (95% CI: 5-60), p =
      0.02 minutes/week MVPA in bouts. Neither trial showed sedentary or wear-time
      differences. Main study limitation was incomplete follow-up; however, results
      were robust to missing data sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention
      participants followed up from both trials demonstrated higher levels of
      objectively measured PA at 3-4 years than controls, similar to previously
      reported 12-month trial effects. Pedometer interventions, delivered by post or
      with nurse support, can help address the public health physical inactivity
      challenge. TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: PACE-UP isrctn.com ISRCTN98538934; PACE-Lift

TI  - Role of heme in lung bacterial infection after trauma hemorrhage and stored red
      blood cell transfusion: A preclinical experimental study.
PG  - e1002522
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002522 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability in patients aged 
      1-46 y. Severely injured patients experience considerable blood loss and
      hemorrhagic shock requiring treatment with massive transfusion of red blood cells
      (RBCs). Preclinical and retrospective human studies in trauma patients have
      suggested that poorer therapeutic efficacy, increased severity of organ injury,
      and increased bacterial infection are associated with transfusion of large
      volumes of stored RBCs, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: We developed a murine model of trauma hemorrhage (TH) followed by
      resuscitation with plasma and leukoreduced RBCs (in a 1:1 ratio) that were banked
      for 0 (fresh) or 14 (stored) days. Two days later, lungs were infected with
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa K-strain (PAK). Resuscitation with stored RBCs
      significantly increased the severity of lung injury caused by P. aeruginosa, as
      demonstrated by higher mortality (median survival 35 h for fresh RBC group and 8 
      h for stored RBC group; p < 0.001), increased pulmonary edema (mean [95% CI]
      106.4 mul [88.5-124.3] for fresh RBCs and 192.5 mul [140.9-244.0] for stored
      RBCs; p = 0.003), and higher bacterial numbers in the lung (mean [95% CI] 1.2 x
      107 [-1.0 x 107 to 2.5 x 107] for fresh RBCs and 3.6 x 107 [2.5 x 107 to 4.7 x
      107] for stored RBCs; p = 0.014). The mechanism underlying this increased
      infection susceptibility and severity was free-heme-dependent, as recombinant
      hemopexin or pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of toll-like receptor
      4 (TLR4) during TH and resuscitation completely prevented P. aeruginosa-induced
      mortality after stored RBC transfusion (p < 0.001 for all groups relative to
      stored RBC group). Evidence from studies transfusing fresh and stored RBCs mixed 
      with stored and fresh RBC supernatants, respectively, indicated that heme arising
      both during storage and from RBC hemolysis post-resuscitation plays a role in
      increased mortality after PAK (p < 0.001). Heme also increased endothelial
      permeability and inhibited macrophage-dependent phagocytosis in cultured cells.
      Stored RBCs also increased circulating high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1; mean
      [95% CI] 15.4 ng/ml [6.7-24.0] for fresh RBCs and 50.3 ng/ml [12.3-88.2] for
      stored RBCs), and anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody protected against PAK-induced
      mortality in vivo (p = 0.001) and restored macrophage-dependent phagocytosis of
      P. aeruginosa in vitro. Finally, we showed that TH patients, admitted to the
      University of Alabama at Birmingham ER between 1 January 2015 and 30 April 2016
      (n = 50), received high micromolar-millimolar levels of heme proportional to the 
      number of units transfused, sufficient to overwhelm endogenous hemopexin levels
      early after TH and resuscitation. Limitations of the study include lack of
      assessment of temporal changes in different products of hemolysis after
      resuscitation and the small sample size precluding testing of associations
      between heme levels and adverse outcomes in resuscitated TH patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that large volume resuscitation with stored
      blood, compared to fresh blood, in mice increases mortality from subsequent
      pneumonia, which occurs via mechanisms sensitive to hemopexin and TLR4 and HMGB1 
      inhibition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the effect of health information on immunisation uptake in 
      rural India, we conducted an individually randomised controlled trial of health
      information messages targeting the mothers of unvaccinated or incompletely
      vaccinated children through home visits in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: The study tested a brief intervention that provided mothers
      face-to-face with information on the benefits of the tetanus vaccine.
      Participants were 722 mothers of children aged 0-36 months who had not received 3
      doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine (DPT3). Mothers were randomly
      assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 study arms: mothers in the first treatment
      group received information framed as a gain (e.g., the child is less likely to
      get tetanus and more likely to be healthy if vaccinated), mothers in the second
      treatment group received information framed in terms of a loss (e.g., the child
      is more likely to get tetanus and suffer ill health if not vaccinated), and the
      third arm acted as a control group, with no information given to the mother.
      Surveys were conducted at baseline (September 2015) and after the intervention
      (April 2016). The primary outcome was the proportion of children who had received
      DPT3 measured after 7 months of follow-up. The analysis was by intention to
      treat. A total of 16 (2.2%) participants were lost to follow-up. The coverage of 
      DPT3 was 28% in the control group and 43% in the pooled information groups,
      giving a risk difference of 15 percentage points (95% CI: 7% to 22%, p < 0.001)
      and a relative risk of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.9, p < 0.001). The information
      intervention increased the rate of measles vaccination by 22 percentage points
      (risk difference: 22%, 95% CI: 14% to 30%, p < 0.001; relative risk: 1.53, 95%
      CI: 1.29 to 1.80) and the rate of full immunisation by 14 percentage points (risk
      difference: 14%, 95% CI: 8% to 21%, p < 0.001; relative risk: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.29 
      to 2.29). It had a large positive effect on knowledge of the causes, symptoms,
      and prevention of tetanus but no effect on perceptions of vaccine efficacy. There
      was no difference in the proportion of children with DPT3 between the group that 
      received information framed as a loss and the group that received information
      framed as a gain (risk difference: 4%, 95% CI: -5% to 13%; p = 0.352; relative
      risk: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.36). The cost per disability-adjusted life year
      averted of providing information was US$186, making the intervention highly
      cost-effective with respect to the WHO-recommended threshold of once the gross
      domestic product per capita (US$793 in the case of Uttar Pradesh). Key study
      limitations include the modest sample size for this trial, limiting power to
      detect small differences in the framing of information, and the potential for
      contamination among households. CONCLUSIONS: Providing mothers of
      unvaccinated/incompletely vaccinated children with information on tetanus and the
      benefits of DPT vaccination substantially increased immunisation coverage and was
      highly cost-effective. The framing of the health information message did not
      appear to matter. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number
      ISRCTN84560580.

TI  - Trajectories of functional decline in older adults with neuropsychiatric and
      cardiovascular multimorbidity: A Swedish cohort study.
PG  - e1002503
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional decline is a strong health determinant in older adults,
      and chronic diseases play a major role in this age-related phenomenon. In this
      study, we explored possible clinical pathways underlying functional heterogeneity
      in older adults by quantifying the impact of cardiovascular (CV) and
      neuropsychiatric (NP) chronic diseases and their co-occurrence on trajectories of
      functional decline. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied 2,385 people >/=60 years
      (range 60-101 years) participating in the Swedish National study of Aging and
      Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K). Participants underwent clinical examination at
      baseline (2001-2004) and every 3 or 6 years for up to 9 years. We grouped
      participants on the basis of 7 mutually exclusive clinical patterns of 0, 1, or
      more CV and NP diseases and their co-occurrence, from a group without any CV and 
      NP disease to a group characterised by the presence of CV or NP multimorbidity,
      accompanied by at least 1 other CV or NP disorder. The group with no CV and/or NP
      diseases served as the reference group. Functional decline was estimated over 9
      years of follow-up by measuring mobility (walking speed, m/s) and independence
      (ability to carry out six activities of daily living [ADL]). Mixed-effect linear 
      regression models were used (1) to explore the individual-level prognostic
      predictivity of the different CV and NP clinical patterns at baseline and (2) to 
      quantify the association between the clinical patterns and functional decline at 
      the group level by entering the clinical patterns as time-varying measures.
      During the 9-year follow-up, participants with multiple CV and NP diseases had
      the steepest decline in walking speed (up to 0.7 m/s; p < 0.001) and ADL
      independence (up to three impairments in ADL, p < 0.001) (reference group:
      participants without any CV and NP disease). When the clinical patterns were
      analyzed as time varying, isolated CV multimorbidity impacted only walking speed 
      (beta -0.1; p < 0.001). Conversely, all the clinical patterns that included at
      least 1 NP disease were significantly associated with decline in both walking
      speed (beta -0.21--0.08; p < 0.001) and ADL independence (beta -0.27--0.06; p <
      0.05). Groups with the most complex clinical patterns had 5%-20% lower
      functioning at follow-up than the reference group. Key limitations of the study
      include that we did not take into account the specific weight of single diseases 
      and their severity and that the exclusion of participants with less than 2
      assessments may have led to an underestimation of the tested associations.
      CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, different patterns of CV and NP morbidity lead to
      different trajectories of functional decline over time, a finding that explains
      part of the heterogeneity observed in older adults' functionality. NP diseases,
      alone or in association, are prevalent and major determinants of functional
      decline, whereas isolated CV multimorbidity is associated only with declines in
      mobility.

TI  - The current and potential health benefits of the National Health Service Health
      Check cardiovascular disease prevention programme in England: A microsimulation
      study.
PG  - e1002517
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Health Service (NHS) Health Check programme was
      introduced in 2009 in England to systematically assess all adults in midlife for 
      cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, its current benefit and impact on
      health inequalities are unknown. It is also unclear whether feasible changes in
      how it is delivered could result in increased benefits. It is one of the first
      such programmes in the world. We sought to estimate the health benefits and
      effect on inequalities of the current NHS Health Check programme and the impact
      of making feasible changes to its implementation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      developed a microsimulation model to estimate the health benefits (incident
      ischaemic heart disease, stroke, dementia, and lung cancer) of the NHS Health
      Check programme in England. We simulated a population of adults in England aged
      40-45 years and followed until age 100 years, using data from the Health Survey
      of England (2009-2012) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (1998-2012),
      to simulate changes in risk factors for simulated individuals over time. We used 
      recent programme data to describe uptake of NHS Health Checks and of 4 associated
      interventions (statin medication, antihypertensive medication, smoking cessation,
      and weight management). Estimates of treatment efficacy and adherence were based 
      on trial data. We estimated the benefits of the current NHS Health Check
      programme compared to a healthcare system without systematic health checks. This 
      counterfactual scenario models the detection and treatment of risk factors that
      occur within 'routine' primary care. We also explored the impact of making
      feasible changes to implementation of the programme concerning eligibility,
      uptake of NHS Health Checks, and uptake of treatments offered through the
      programme. We estimate that the NHS Health Check programme prevents 390 (95%
      credible interval 290 to 500) premature deaths before 80 years of age and results
      in an additional 1,370 (95% credible interval 1,100 to 1,690) people being free
      of disease (ischaemic heart disease, stroke, dementia, and lung cancer) at age 80
      years per million people aged 40-45 years at baseline. Over the life of the
      cohort (i.e., followed from 40-45 years to 100 years), the changes result in an
      additional 10,000 (95% credible interval 8,200 to 13,000) quality-adjusted life
      years (QALYs) and an additional 9,000 (6,900 to 11,300) years of life. This
      equates to approximately 300 fewer premature deaths and 1,000 more people living 
      free of these diseases each year in England. We estimate that the current
      programme is increasing QALYs by 3.8 days (95% credible interval 3.0-4.7) per
      head of population and increasing survival by 3.3 days (2.5-4.1) per head of
      population over the 60 years of follow-up. The current programme has a greater
      absolute impact on health for those living in the most deprived areas compared to
      those living in the least deprived areas (4.4 [2.7-6.5] days of additional
      quality-adjusted life per head of population versus 2.8 [1.7-4.0] days; 5.1
      [3.4-7.1] additional days lived per head of population versus 3.3 [2.1-4.5]
      days). Making feasible changes to the delivery of the existing programme could
      result in a sizable increase in the benefit. For example, a strategy that
      combines extending eligibility to those with preexisting hypertension, extending 
      the upper age of eligibility to 79 years, increasing uptake of health checks by
      30%, and increasing treatment rates 2.5-fold amongst eligible patients (i.e.,
      'maximum potential' scenario) results in at least a 3-fold increase in benefits
      compared to the current programme (1,360 premature deaths versus 390; 5,100
      people free of 1 of the 4 diseases versus 1,370; 37,000 additional QALYs versus
      10,000; 33,000 additional years of life versus 9,000). Ensuring those who are
      assessed and eligible for statins receive statins is a particularly important
      strategy to increase benefits. Estimates of overall benefit are based on current 
      incidence and management, and future declines in disease incidence or
      improvements in treatment could alter the actual benefits observed in the long
      run. We have focused on the cardiovascular element of the NHS Health Check
      programme. Some important noncardiovascular health outcomes (e.g., chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] prevention from smoking cessation and cancer
      prevention from weight loss) and other parts of the programme (e.g., brief
      interventions to reduce harmful alcohol consumption) have not been modelled.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our model indicates that the current NHS Health Check programme is
      contributing to improvements in health and reducing health inequalities. Feasible
      changes in the organisation of the programme could result in more than a 3-fold
      increase in health benefits.

TI  - Multimorbidity and survival for patients with acute myocardial infarction in
      England and Wales: Latent class analysis of a nationwide population-based cohort.
PG  - e1002501
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge of the scale and impact of multimorbidity 
      for patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Therefore, this
      study aimed to determine the extent to which multimorbidity is associated with
      long-term survival following AMI. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This national
      observational study included 693,388 patients (median age 70.7 years, 452,896
      [65.5%] male) from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (England and
      Wales) who were admitted with AMI between 1 January 2003 and 30 June 2013. There 
      were 412,809 (59.5%) patients with multimorbidity at the time of admission with
      AMI, i.e., having at least 1 of the following long-term health conditions:
      diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, heart failure, renal
      failure, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, or hypertension.
      Those with heart failure, renal failure, or cerebrovascular disease had the worst
      outcomes (39.5 [95% CI 39.0-40.0], 38.2 [27.7-26.8], and 26.6 [25.2-26.4] deaths 
      per 100 person-years, respectively). Latent class analysis revealed 3
      multimorbidity phenotype clusters: (1) a high multimorbidity class, with
      concomitant heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension, (2) a
      medium multimorbidity class, with peripheral vascular disease and hypertension,
      and (3) a low multimorbidity class. Patients in class 1 were less likely to
      receive pharmacological therapies compared with class 2 and 3 patients (including
      aspirin, 83.8% versus 87.3% and 87.2%, respectively; beta-blockers, 74.0% versus 
      80.9% and 81.4%; and statins, 80.6% versus 85.9% and 85.2%). Flexible parametric 
      survival modelling indicated that patients in class 1 and class 2 had a 2.4-fold 
      (95% CI 2.3-2.5) and 1.5-fold (95% CI 1.4-1.5) increased risk of death and a loss
      in life expectancy of 2.89 and 1.52 years, respectively, compared with those in
      class 3 over the 8.4-year follow-up period. The study was limited to all-cause
      mortality due to the lack of available cause-specific mortality data. However, we
      isolated the disease-specific association with mortality by providing the loss in
      life expectancy following AMI according to multimorbidity phenotype cluster
      compared with the general age-, sex-, and year-matched population. CONCLUSIONS:
      Multimorbidity among patients with AMI was common, and conferred an accumulative 
      increased risk of death. Three multimorbidity phenotype clusters that were
      significantly associated with loss in life expectancy were identified and should 
      be a concomitant treatment target to improve cardiovascular outcomes. TRIAL

TI  - Patterns and temporal trends of comorbidity among adult patients with incident
      cardiovascular disease in the UK between 2000 and 2014: A population-based cohort
      study.
PG  - e1002513
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity in people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is common,
      but large-scale contemporary reports of patterns and trends in patients with
      incident CVD are limited. We investigated the burden of comorbidities in patients
      with incident CVD, how it changed between 2000 and 2014, and how it varied by
      age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the UK
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics, 
      a population-based dataset from 674 UK general practices covering approximately
      7% of the current UK population. We estimated crude and age/sex-standardised (to 
      the 2013 European Standard Population) prevalence and 95% confidence intervals
      for 56 major comorbidities in individuals with incident non-fatal CVD. We further
      assessed temporal trends and patterns by age, sex, and SES groups, between 2000
      and 2014. Among a total of 4,198,039 people aged 16 to 113 years, 229,205
      incident cases of non-fatal CVD, defined as first diagnosis of ischaemic heart
      disease, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, were identified. Although the
      age/sex-standardised incidence of CVD decreased by 34% between 2000 to 2014, the 
      proportion of CVD patients with higher numbers of comorbidities increased. The
      prevalence of having 5 or more comorbidities increased 4-fold, rising from 6.3%
      (95% CI 5.6%-17.0%) in 2000 to 24.3% (22.1%-34.8%) in 2014 in
      age/sex-standardised models. The most common comorbidities in
      age/sex-standardised models were hypertension (28.9% [95% CI 27.7%-31.4%]),
      depression (23.0% [21.3%-26.0%]), arthritis (20.9% [19.5%-23.5%]), asthma (17.7% 
      [15.8%-20.8%]), and anxiety (15.0% [13.7%-17.6%]). Cardiometabolic conditions and
      arthritis were highly prevalent among patients aged over 40 years, and mental
      illnesses were highly prevalent in patients aged 30-59 years. The
      age-standardised prevalence of having 5 or more comorbidities was 19.1% (95% CI
      17.2%-22.7%) in women and 12.5% (12.0%-13.9%) in men, and women had twice the
      age-standardised prevalence of depression (31.1% [28.3%-35.5%] versus 15.0%
      [14.3%-16.5%]) and anxiety (19.6% [17.6%-23.3%] versus 10.4% [9.8%-11.8%]). The
      prevalence of depression was 46% higher in the most deprived fifth of SES
      compared with the least deprived fifth (age/sex-standardised prevalence of 38.4% 
      [31.2%-62.0%] versus 26.3% [23.1%-34.5%], respectively). This is a descriptive
      study of routine electronic health records in the UK, which might underestimate
      the true prevalence of diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of multimorbidity and
      comorbidity in patients with incident non-fatal CVD increased between 2000 and
      2014. On average, older patients, women, and socioeconomically deprived groups
      had higher numbers of comorbidities, but the type of comorbidities varied by age 
      and sex. Cardiometabolic conditions contributed substantially to the burden, but 
      4 out of the 10 top comorbidities were non-cardiometabolic. The current
      single-disease paradigm in CVD management needs to broaden and incorporate the
      large and increasing burden of comorbidities.

TI  - The epidemiology of adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV: A
      cross-region global cohort analysis.
PG  - e1002514
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002514 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, the population of adolescents living with perinatally
      acquired HIV (APHs) continues to expand. In this study, we pooled data from
      observational pediatric HIV cohorts and cohort networks, allowing comparisons of 
      adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV in "real-life" settings across multiple
      regions. We describe the geographic and temporal characteristics and mortality
      outcomes of APHs across multiple regions, including South America and the
      Caribbean, North America, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast
      Asia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Through the Collaborative Initiative for Paediatric
      HIV Education and Research (CIPHER), individual retrospective longitudinal data
      from 12 cohort networks were pooled. All children infected with HIV who entered
      care before age 10 years, were not known to have horizontally acquired HIV, and
      were followed up beyond age 10 years were included in this analysis conducted
      from May 2016 to January 2017. Our primary analysis describes patient and
      treatment characteristics of APHs at key time points, including first
      HIV-associated clinic visit, antiretroviral therapy (ART) start, age 10 years,
      and last visit, and compares these characteristics by geographic region, country 
      income group (CIG), and birth period. Our secondary analysis describes mortality,
      transfer out, and lost to follow-up (LTFU) as outcomes at age 15 years, using
      competing risk analysis. Among the 38,187 APHs included, 51% were female, 79%
      were from sub-Saharan Africa and 65% lived in low-income countries. APHs from 51 
      countries were included (Europe: 14 countries and 3,054 APHs; North America: 1
      country and 1,032 APHs; South America and the Caribbean: 4 countries and 903
      APHs; South and Southeast Asia: 7 countries and 2,902 APHs; sub-Saharan Africa,
      25 countries and 30,296 APHs). Observation started as early as 1982 in Europe and
      1996 in sub-Saharan Africa, and continued until at least 2014 in all regions. The
      median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of adolescent follow-up was 3.1
      (1.5-5.2) years for the total cohort and 6.4 (3.6-8.0) years in Europe, 3.7
      (2.0-5.4) years in North America, 2.5 (1.2-4.4) years in South and Southeast
      Asia, 5.0 (2.7-7.5) years in South America and the Caribbean, and 2.1 (0.9-3.8)
      years in sub-Saharan Africa. Median (IQR) age at first visit differed
      substantially by region, ranging from 0.7 (0.3-2.1) years in North America to 7.1
      (5.3-8.6) years in sub-Saharan Africa. The median age at ART start varied from
      0.9 (0.4-2.6) years in North America to 7.9 (6.0-9.3) years in sub-Saharan
      Africa. The cumulative incidence estimates (95% confidence interval [CI]) at age 
      15 years for mortality, transfers out, and LTFU for all APHs were 2.6%
      (2.4%-2.8%), 15.6% (15.1%-16.0%), and 11.3% (10.9%-11.8%), respectively.
      Mortality was lowest in Europe (0.8% [0.5%-1.1%]) and highest in South America
      and the Caribbean (4.4% [3.1%-6.1%]). However, LTFU was lowest in South America
      and the Caribbean (4.8% [3.4%-6.7%]) and highest in sub-Saharan Africa (13.2%
      [12.6%-13.7%]). Study limitations include the high LTFU rate in sub-Saharan
      Africa, which could have affected the comparison of mortality across regions;
      inclusion of data only for APHs receiving ART from some countries; and
      unavailability of data from high-burden countries such as Nigeria. CONCLUSION: To
      our knowledge, our study represents the largest multiregional epidemiological
      analysis of APHs. Despite probable under-ascertained mortality, mortality in APHs
      remains substantially higher in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and
      South America and the Caribbean than in Europe. Collaborations such as CIPHER
      enable us to monitor current global temporal trends in outcomes over time to
      inform appropriate policy responses.

TI  - Delays in completion and results reporting of clinical trials under the
      Paediatric Regulation in the European Union: A cohort study.
PG  - e1002520
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002520 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few medicines have been approved for children, leading to rates of
      off-label prescribing reported to be as high as 90%. In 2007, the European Union 
      adopted the Paediatric Regulation, which mandates that pharmaceutical companies
      conduct paediatric studies for all new medicines, unless granted a waiver. We
      aimed to evaluate the availability of paediatric trial results from studies
      required under the Paediatric Regulation for new medicines authorised in the EU. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) public database of
      paediatric investigation plans was searched for new medicines centrally
      authorised in the EU between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014 with at least 1 
      required paediatric study. For our study cohort of paediatric clinical trials
      required for these medicines, we used internal EMA databases and publicly
      available trial registries to determine changes to the planned completion date or
      study design, rates of trial completion, time to trial completion, and results
      reporting (peer-reviewed publication or posting on trial registry). Cox
      proportional hazards regression models were constructed to examine factors
      associated with study completion. A total of 326 paediatric clinical trials were 
      required for 122 novel medicines authorised by the EMA between 2010 and 2014. In 
      all, 76% (247/326) of paediatric studies were not planned to be completed until
      after the initial marketing authorisation. The planned completion dates for 50%
      (162/326) were further postponed by a median of 2.2 years. Overall, 38% (124/326)
      of paediatric studies were completed as of 30 November 2017. The rate of trial
      completion for paediatric studies planned to be completed after initial marketing
      authorisation was 23% (56/247), versus 86% (68/79) for trials planned to be
      completed before authorisation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.11; 95% CI 0.06-0.19).
      Among completed studies, the results were reported in a public registry or in the
      peer-reviewed literature for 85% (105/124) at a median of 1.1 years after study
      completion, and 60% (74/124) were published in a peer-reviewed journal.
      Limitations of this study include the potential lack of generalisability to
      medicines not authorised by the EMA and the possibility for more of these trials 
      to be completed or published in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The completion of many
      paediatric studies required under the Paediatric Regulation has been delayed.
      Paediatric studies planned to be completed after marketing authorisation were
      associated with a lower likelihood of eventual completion, highlighting the need 
      to examine the implementation of current policies in ensuring timely availability
      of important paediatric information.

TI  - Mortality, ethnicity, and country of birth on a national scale, 2001-2013: A
      retrospective cohort (Scottish Health and Ethnicity Linkage Study).
PG  - e1002515
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migrant and ethnic minority groups are often assumed to have poor
      health relative to the majority population. Few countries have the capacity to
      study a key indicator, mortality, by ethnicity and country of birth. We
      hypothesized at least 10% differences in mortality by ethnic group in Scotland
      that would not be wholly attenuated by adjustment for socio-economic factors or
      country of birth. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We linked the Scottish 2001 Census to
      mortality data (2001-2013) in 4.62 million people (91% of estimated population), 
      calculating age-adjusted mortality rate ratios (RRs; multiplied by 100 as
      percentages) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 13 ethnic groups, with the
      White Scottish group as reference (ethnic group classification follows the
      Scottish 2001 Census). The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, education
      status, and household tenure were socio-economic status (SES) confounding
      variables and born in the UK or Republic of Ireland (UK/RoI) an interacting and
      confounding variable. Smoking and diabetes data were from a primary care
      sub-sample (about 53,000 people). Males and females in most minority groups had
      lower age-adjusted mortality RRs than the White Scottish group. The 95% CIs
      provided good evidence that the RR was more than 10% lower in the following
      ethnic groups: Other White British (72.3 [95% CI 64.2, 81.3] in males and 75.2
      [68.0, 83.2] in females); Other White (80.8 [72.8, 89.8] in males and 76.2 [68.6,
      84.7] in females); Indian (62.6 [51.6, 76.0] in males and 60.7 [50.4, 73.1] in
      females); Pakistani (66.1 [57.4, 76.2] in males and 73.8 [63.7, 85.5] in
      females); Bangladeshi males (50.7 [32.5, 79.1]); Caribbean females (57.5 [38.5,
      85.9]); and Chinese (52.2 [43.7, 62.5] in males and 65.8 [55.3, 78.2] in
      females). The differences were diminished but not eliminated after adjusting for 
      UK/RoI birth and SES variables. A mortality advantage was evident in all 12
      minority groups for those born abroad, but in only 6/12 male groups and 5/12
      female groups of those born in the UK/RoI. In the primary care sub-sample, after 
      adjustment for age, UK/RoI born, SES, smoking, and diabetes, the RR was not lower
      in Indian males (114.7 [95% CI 78.3, 167.9]) and Pakistani females (103.9 [73.9, 
      145.9]) than in White Scottish males and females, respectively. The main
      limitations were the inability to include deaths abroad and the small number of
      deaths in some ethnic minority groups, especially for people born in the UK/RoI. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was relatively low mortality for many ethnic minority groups
      compared to the White Scottish majority. The mortality advantage was less clear
      in UK/RoI-born minority group offspring than in immigrants. These differences
      need explaining, and health-related behaviours seem important. Similar analyses
      are required internationally to fulfil agreed goals for monitoring,
      understanding, and improving health in ethnically diverse societies and to apply 
      to health policy, especially on health inequalities and inequities.

TI  - Diet during pregnancy and infancy and risk of allergic or autoimmune disease: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002507
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002507 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the influence of diet during pregnancy and
      infancy on a child's immune development. We assessed whether variations in
      maternal or infant diet can influence risk of allergic or autoimmune disease.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two authors selected studies, extracted data, and assessed 
      risk of bias. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
      (GRADE) was used to assess certainty of findings. We searched Medical Literature 
      Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE
      (EMBASE), Web of Science, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and
      Literatura Latino Americana em Ciencias da Saude (LILACS) between January 1946
      and July 2013 for observational studies and until December 2017 for intervention 
      studies that evaluated the relationship between diet during pregnancy, lactation,
      or the first year of life and future risk of allergic or autoimmune disease. We
      identified 260 original studies (964,143 participants) of milk feeding, including
      1 intervention trial of breastfeeding promotion, and 173 original studies
      (542,672 participants) of other maternal or infant dietary exposures, including
      80 trials of maternal (n = 26), infant (n = 32), or combined (n = 22)
      interventions. Risk of bias was high in 125 (48%) milk feeding studies and 44
      (25%) studies of other dietary exposures. Evidence from 19 intervention trials
      suggests that oral supplementation with nonpathogenic micro-organisms
      (probiotics) during late pregnancy and lactation may reduce risk of eczema (Risk 
      Ratio [RR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.68-0.90; I2 = 61%; Absolute Risk Reduction 44 cases per
      1,000; 95% CI 20-64), and 6 trials suggest that fish oil supplementation during
      pregnancy and lactation may reduce risk of allergic sensitisation to egg (RR
      0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90; I2 = 15%; Absolute Risk Reduction 31 cases per 1,000; 95%
      CI 10-47). GRADE certainty of these findings was moderate. We found weaker
      support for the hypotheses that breastfeeding promotion reduces risk of eczema
      during infancy (1 intervention trial), that longer exclusive breastfeeding is
      associated with reduced type 1 diabetes mellitus (28 observational studies), and 
      that probiotics reduce risk of allergic sensitisation to cow's milk (9
      intervention trials), where GRADE certainty of findings was low. We did not find 
      that other dietary exposures-including prebiotic supplements, maternal allergenic
      food avoidance, and vitamin, mineral, fruit, and vegetable intake-influence risk 
      of allergic or autoimmune disease. For many dietary exposures, data were
      inconclusive or inconsistent, such that we were unable to exclude the possibility
      of important beneficial or harmful effects. In this comprehensive systematic
      review, we were not able to include more recent observational studies or verify
      data via direct contact with authors, and we did not evaluate measures of food
      diversity during infancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a relationship
      between maternal diet and risk of immune-mediated diseases in the child. Maternal
      probiotic and fish oil supplementation may reduce risk of eczema and allergic
      sensitisation to food, respectively.

TI  - The potential impact of case-area targeted interventions in response to cholera
      outbreaks: A modeling study.
PG  - e1002509
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002509 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholera prevention and control interventions targeted to neighbors of
      cholera cases (case-area targeted interventions [CATIs]), including improved
      water, sanitation, and hygiene, oral cholera vaccine (OCV), and prophylactic
      antibiotics, may be able to efficiently avert cholera cases and deaths while
      saving scarce resources during epidemics. Efforts to quickly target interventions
      to neighbors of cases have been made in recent outbreaks, but little empirical
      evidence related to the effectiveness, efficiency, or ideal design of this
      approach exists. Here, we aim to provide practical guidance on how CATIs might be
      used by exploring key determinants of intervention impact, including the mix of
      interventions, "ring" size, and timing, in simulated cholera epidemics fit to
      data from an urban cholera epidemic in Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed
      a micro-simulation model and calibrated it to both the epidemic curve and the
      small-scale spatiotemporal clustering pattern of case households from a large
      2011 cholera outbreak in N'Djamena, Chad (4,352 reported cases over 232 days),
      and explored the potential impact of CATIs in simulated epidemics. CATIs were
      implemented with realistic logistical delays after cases presented for care using
      different combinations of prophylactic antibiotics, OCV, and/or point-of-use
      water treatment (POUWT) starting at different points during the epidemics and
      targeting rings of various radii around incident case households. Our findings
      suggest that CATIs shorten the duration of epidemics and are more
      resource-efficient than mass campaigns. OCV was predicted to be the most
      effective single intervention, followed by POUWT and antibiotics. CATIs with OCV 
      started early in an epidemic focusing on a 100-m radius around case households
      were estimated to shorten epidemics by 68% (IQR 62% to 72%), with an 81% (IQR 69%
      to 87%) reduction in cases compared to uncontrolled epidemics. These same
      targeted interventions with OCV led to a 44-fold (IQR 27 to 78) reduction in the 
      number of people needed to target to avert a single case of cholera, compared to 
      mass campaigns in high-cholera-risk neighborhoods. The optimal radius to target
      around incident case households differed by intervention type, with antibiotics
      having an optimal radius of 30 m to 45 m compared to 70 m to 100 m for OCV and
      POUWT. Adding POUWT or antibiotics to OCV provided only marginal impact and
      efficiency improvements. Starting CATIs early in an epidemic with OCV and POUWT
      targeting those within 100 m of an incident case household reduced epidemic
      durations by 70% (IQR 65% to 75%) and the number of cases by 82% (IQR 71% to 88%)
      compared to uncontrolled epidemics. CATIs used late in epidemics, even after the 
      peak, were estimated to avert relatively few cases but substantially reduced the 
      number of epidemic days (e.g., by 28% [IQR 15% to 45%] for OCV in a 100-m
      radius). While this study is based on a rigorous, data-driven approach, the
      relatively high uncertainty about the ways in which POUWT and antibiotic
      interventions reduce cholera risk, as well as the heterogeneity in outbreak
      dynamics from place to place, limits the precision and generalizability of our
      quantitative estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that CATIs using
      OCV, antibiotics, and water treatment interventions at an appropriate radius
      around cases could be an effective and efficient way to fight cholera epidemics. 
      They can provide a complementary and efficient approach to mass intervention
      campaigns and may prove particularly useful during the initial phase of an
      outbreak, when there are few cases and few available resources, or in order to
      shorten the often protracted tails of cholera epidemics.

TI  - Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis among women
      in sub-Saharan Africa: An individual participant data meta-analysis of 18 HIV
      prevention studies.
PG  - e1002511
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimates of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence are
      essential for efforts to prevent and control STIs. Few large STI prevalence
      studies exist, especially for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our
      primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea,
      trichomoniasis, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and bacterial
      vaginosis (BV) among women in sub-Saharan Africa by age, region, and population
      type. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed individual-level data from 18 HIV
      prevention studies (cohort studies and randomized controlled trials; conducted
      during 1993-2011), representing >37,000 women, that tested participants for >/=1 
      selected STIs or BV at baseline. We used a 2-stage meta-analysis to combine data.
      After calculating the proportion of participants with each infection and standard
      error by study, we used a random-effects model to obtain a summary mean
      prevalence of each infection and 95% confidence interval (CI) across ages,
      regions, and population types. Despite substantial study heterogeneity for some
      STIs/populations, several patterns emerged. Across the three primary
      region/population groups (South Africa community-based, Southern/Eastern Africa
      community-based, and Eastern Africa higher-risk), prevalence was higher among
      15-24-year-old than 25-49-year-old women for all STIs except HSV-2. In general,
      higher-risk populations had greater prevalence of gonorrhea and syphilis than
      clinic/community-based populations. For chlamydia, prevalence among
      15-24-year-olds was 10.3% (95% CI: 7.4%, 14.1%; I2 = 75.7%) among women
      specifically recruited from higher-risk settings for HIV in Eastern Africa and
      was 15.1% (95% CI: 12.7%, 17.8%; I2 = 82.3%) in South African
      clinic/community-based populations. Among clinic/community-based populations,
      prevalence was generally greater in South Africa than in Southern/Eastern Africa 
      for most STIs; for gonorrhea, prevalence among 15-24-year-olds was 4.6% (95% CI: 
      3.3%, 6.4%; I2 = 82.8%) in South Africa and was 1.7% (95% CI: 1.2%, 2.6%; I2 =
      55.2%) in Southern/Eastern Africa. Across the three primary region/population
      groups, HSV-2 and BV prevalence was high among 25-49-year-olds (ranging from 70% 
      to 83% and 33% to 44%, respectively). The main study limitation is that the data 
      are not from random samples of the target populations. CONCLUSIONS: Combining
      data from 18 HIV prevention studies, our findings highlight important features of
      STI/BV epidemiology among sub-Saharan African women. This methodology can be used
      where routine STI surveillance is limited and offers a new approach to obtaining 
      critical information on STI and BV prevalence in LMICs.

TI  - Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among young people in South Africa:
      A nested survey in a health and demographic surveillance site.
PG  - e1002512
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV)
      are associated with increased transmission of HIV, and poor reproductive and
      sexual health. The burden of STIs/BV among young people is unknown in many high
      HIV prevalence settings. We conducted an acceptability, feasibility, and
      prevalence study of home-based sampling for STIs/BV among young men and women
      aged 15-24 years old in a health and demographic surveillance site (HDSS) in
      rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 1,342 young
      people, stratified by age (15-19 and 20-24 years) and sex were selected from the 
      HDSS sampling frame; 1,171/1,342 (87%) individuals had >/=1 attempted home visit 
      between 4 October 2016 and 31 January 2017, of whom 790 (67%) were successfully
      contacted. Among the 645 who were contacted and eligible, 447 (69%) enrolled.
      Consenting/assenting participants were interviewed, and blood, self-collected
      urine (men), and vaginal swabs (women) were tested for herpes simplex virus type 
      2 (HSV-2), chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and BV. Both men and 
      women reported that sample collection was easy. Participants disagreed that
      sampling was painful; more than half of the participants disagreed that they felt
      anxious or embarrassed. The weighted prevalence of STIs/BV among men and women,
      respectively, was 5.3% and 11.2% for chlamydia, 1.5% and 1.8% for gonorrhoea, 0% 
      and 0.4% for active syphilis, 0.6% and 4.6% for trichomoniasis, 16.8% and 28.7%
      for HSV-2, and 42.1% for BV (women only). Of the women with >/=1 curable STI, 75%
      reported no symptoms. Factors associated with STIs/BV included having older age, 
      being female, and not being in school or working. Among those who participated in
      the 2016 HIV serosurvey, the prevalence of HIV was 5.6% among men and 19% among
      women. Feasibility was impacted by the short study duration and the difficulty
      finding men at home. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of STIs/BV was found in this 
      rural setting with high HIV prevalence in South Africa. Most STIs and HIV
      infections were asymptomatic and would not have been identified or treated under 
      national syndromic management guidelines. A nested STI/BV survey within a HDSS
      proved acceptable and feasible. This is a proof of concept for population-based
      STI surveillance in low- and middle-income countries that could be utilised in
      the evaluation of STI/HIV prevention and control programmes.

TI  - Risk and surrogate benefit for pediatric Phase I trials in oncology: A systematic
      review with meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002505
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002505 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric Phase I cancer trials are critical for establishing the
      safety and dosing of anti-cancer treatments in children. Their implementation,
      however, must contend with the rarity of many pediatric cancers and limits on
      allowable risk in minors. The aim of this study is to describe the risk and
      benefit for pediatric cancer Phase I trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our protocol
      was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42015015961). We systematically
      searched Embase and PubMed for solid and hematological malignancy Phase I
      pediatric trials published between 1 January 2004 and 1 March 2015. We included
      pediatric cancer Phase I studies, defined as "small sample size, nonrandomized,
      dose escalation studies that defined the recommended dose for subsequent study of
      a new drug in each schedule tested." We measured risk using grade 3, 4, and 5
      (fatal) drug-related adverse events (AEs) and benefit using objective response
      rates. When possible, data were meta-analyzed. We identified 170 studies meeting 
      our eligibility criteria, accounting for 4,604 patients. The pooled overall
      objective response rate was 10.29% (95% CI 8.33% to 12.25%), and was lower in
      solid tumors, 3.17% (95% CI 2.62% to 3.72%), compared with hematological
      malignancies, 27.90% (95% CI 20.53% to 35.27%); p < 0.001. The overall fatal
      (grade 5) AE rate was 2.09% (95% CI 1.45% to 2.72%). Across the 4,604 evaluated
      patients, there were 4,675 grade 3 and 4 drug-related AEs, with an average grade 
      3/4 AE rate per person equal to 1.32. Our study had the following limitations:
      trials included in our review were heterogeneous (to minimize heterogeneity, we
      separated types of therapy and cancer types), and we relied on published data
      only and encountered challenges with the quality of reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      meta-analysis suggests that, on the whole, AE and response rates in pediatric
      Phase I trials are similar to those in adult Phase I trials. Our findings provide
      an empirical basis for the refinement and review of pediatric Phase I trials, and
      for communication about their risk and benefit.

TI  - The 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak and primary healthcare delivery in
      Liberia: Time-series analyses for 2010-2016.
PG  - e1002508
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to estimate the immediate and lasting
      effects of the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak on public-sector
      primary healthcare delivery in Liberia using 7 years of comprehensive routine
      health information system data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed 10 key primary 
      healthcare indicators before, during, and after the EVD outbreak using 31,836
      facility-month service outputs from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016 across a
      census of 379 public-sector health facilities in Liberia (excluding Montserrado
      County). All indicators had statistically significant decreases during the first 
      4 months of the EVD outbreak, with all indicators having their lowest raw mean
      outputs in August 2014. Decreases in outputs comparing the end of the initial EVD
      period (September 2014) to May 2014 (pre-EVD) ranged in magnitude from a 67.3%
      decrease in measles vaccinations (95% CI: -77.9%, -56.8%, p < 0.001) and a 61.4% 
      decrease in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) treatments for malaria
      (95% CI: -69.0%, -53.8%, p < 0.001) to a 35.2% decrease in first antenatal care
      (ANC) visits (95% CI: -45.8%, -24.7%, p < 0.001) and a 38.5% decrease in
      medroxyprogesterone acetate doses (95% CI: -47.6%, -29.5%, p < 0.001). Following 
      the nadir of system outputs in August 2014, all indicators showed statistically
      significant increases from October 2014 to December 2014. All indicators had
      significant positive trends during the post-EVD period, with every system output 
      exceeding pre-Ebola forecasted trends for 3 consecutive months by November 2016. 
      Health system outputs lost during and after the EVD outbreak were large and
      sustained for most indicators. Prior to exceeding pre-EVD forecasted trends for 3
      months, we estimate statistically significant cumulative losses of -776,110
      clinic visits (95% CI: -1,480,896, -101,357, p = 0.030); -24,449 bacille
      Calmette-Guerin vaccinations (95% CI: -45,947, -2,020, p = 0.032); -9,129 measles
      vaccinations (95% CI: -12,312, -5,659, p < 0.001); -17,191 postnatal care (PNC)
      visits within 6 weeks of birth (95% CI: -28,344, -5,775, p = 0.002); and -101,857
      ACT malaria treatments (95% CI: -205,839, -2,139, p = 0.044) due to the EVD
      outbreak. Other outputs showed statistically significant cumulative losses only
      through December 2014, including losses of -12,941 first pentavalent vaccinations
      (95% CI: -20,309, -5,527, p = 0.002); -5,122 institutional births (95% CI:
      -8,767, -1,234, p = 0.003); and -45,024 acute respiratory infections treated (95%
      CI: -66,185, -24,019, p < 0.001). Compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends,
      medroxyprogesterone acetate doses and first ANC visits did not show statistically
      significant net losses. ACT treatment for malaria was the only indicator with an 
      estimated net increase in system outputs through December 2016, showing an excess
      of +78,583 outputs (95% CI: -309,417, +450,661, p = 0.634) compared to pre-EVD
      forecasted trends, although this increase was not statistically significant.
      However, comparing December 2013 to December 2017, ACT malaria cases have
      increased 49.2% (95% CI: 33.9%, 64.5%, p < 0.001). Compared to pre-EVD forecasted
      trends, there remains a statistically significant loss of -15,144 PNC visits
      within 6 weeks (95% CI: -29,453, -787, p = 0.040) through December 2016.
      CONCLUSIONS: The Liberian public-sector primary healthcare system has made
      strides towards recovery from the 2014-2015 EVD outbreak. All primary healthcare 
      indicators tracked have recovered to pre-EVD levels as of November 2016. Yet, for
      most indicators, it took more than 1 year to recover to pre-EVD levels. During
      this time, large losses of essential primary healthcare services occurred
      compared to what would have been expected had the EVD outbreak not occurred. The 
      disruption of malaria case management during the EVD outbreak may have resulted
      in increased malaria cases. Large and sustained investments in public-sector
      primary care health system strengthening are urgently needed for EVD-affected
      countries.

TI  - Perfluoroalkyl substances and changes in body weight and resting metabolic rate
      in response to weight-loss diets: A prospective study.
PG  - e1002502
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002502 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential endocrine-disrupting effects of perfluoroalkyl
      substances (PFASs) have been demonstrated in animal studies, but whether PFASs
      may interfere with body weight regulation in humans is largely unknown. This
      study aimed to examine the associations of PFAS exposure with changes in body
      weight and resting metabolic rate (RMR) in a diet-induced weight-loss setting.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: In the 2-year POUNDS Lost randomized clinical trial based
      in Boston, Massachusetts, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that examined the effects
      of energy-restricted diets on weight changes, baseline plasma concentrations of
      major PFASs were measured among 621 overweight and obese participants aged 30-70 
      years. Body weight was measured at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. RMR and
      other metabolic parameters, including glucose, lipids, thyroid hormones, and
      leptin, were measured at baseline and 6 and 24 months. Participants lost an
      average of 6.4 kg of body weight during the first 6 months (weight-loss period)
      and subsequently regained an average of 2.7 kg of body weight during the period
      of 6-24 months (weight regain period). After multivariate adjustment, baseline
      PFAS concentrations were not significantly associated with concurrent body weight
      or weight loss during the first 6 months. In contrast, higher baseline levels of 
      PFASs were significantly associated with a greater weight regain, primarily in
      women. In women, comparing the highest to the lowest tertiles of PFAS
      concentrations, the multivariate-adjusted mean weight regain (SE) was 4.0 (0.8)
      versus 2.1 (0.9) kg for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Ptrend = 0.01); 4.3 
      (0.9) versus 2.2 (0.8) kg for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (Ptrend = 0.007); 4.7
      (0.9) versus 2.5 (0.9) kg for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (Ptrend = 0.006); 4.9
      (0.9) versus 2.7 (0.8) kg for perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) (Ptrend =
      0.009); and 4.2 (0.8) versus 2.5 (0.9) kg for perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA)
      (Ptrend = 0.03). When further adjusted for changes in body weight or thyroid
      hormones during the first 6 months, results remained similar. Moreover, higher
      baseline plasma PFAS concentrations, especially for PFOS and PFNA, were
      significantly associated with greater decline in RMR during the weight-loss
      period and less increase in RMR during the weight regain period in both men and
      women. Limitations of the study include the possibility of unmeasured or residual
      confounding by socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, as well as possible
      relapse to the usual diet prior to randomization, which could have been rich in
      foods contaminated by PFASs through food packaging and also dense in energy.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this diet-induced weight-loss trial, higher baseline plasma PFAS 
      concentrations were associated with a greater weight regain, especially in women,
      possibly explained by a slower regression of RMR levels. These data illustrate a 
      potential novel pathway through which PFASs interfere with human body weight
      regulation and metabolism. The possible impact of environmental chemicals on the 
      obesity epidemic therefore deserves attention. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Population impact of lung cancer screening in the United States: Projections from
      a microsimulation model.
PG  - e1002506
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002506 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous simulation studies estimating the impacts of lung cancer
      screening have ignored the changes in smoking prevalence over time in the United 
      States. Our primary rationale was to perform, to our knowledge, the first
      simulation study that estimates the health outcomes of lung cancer screening with
      explicit modeling of smoking trends for the whole US population.
      METHODS/FINDINGS: Utilizing a well-validated microsimulation model, we estimated 
      the benefits and harms of an annual low-dose computed tomography screening
      scenario with a realistic screening adherence rate versus a no-screening scenario
      for the US population from 2016-2030. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services (CMS) eligibility criteria were applied: age 55-77 years at time of
      screening, history of at least 30 pack-years of smoking, and current smoker or
      former smoker with fewer than 15 years since quitting. In the screened
      population, cumulative mortality reduction was projected to reach 16.98% (95% CI 
      16.90%-17.07%). Cumulative mortality reduction was estimated to be 3.52% (95% CI 
      3.50%-3.53%) for the overall study population, with annual mortality reduction
      peaking at 4.38% (95% CI 4.36%-4.41%) in 2021 and falling to 3.53% (95% CI
      3.50%-3.56%) by 2030. Lung cancer screening would save a projected 148,484
      life-years (95% CI 147,429-149,540) across the total population through 2030.
      There were estimated to be 9,054 (95% CI 9,011-9,098) overdiagnosed cases among
      the 252,429 (95% CI 251,208-253,649) screen-detected lung cancer diagnoses,
      yielding an overdiagnosis rate of 3.59%. The limitations of our study are that we
      do not explicitly model race or socioeconomic status and our model was calibrated
      to data from studies performed in academic centers, both of which may impact the 
      generalizability of our results. We also exclusively model the effects of the CMS
      guidelines for lung cancer screening and not any other screening strategies.
      CONCLUSIONS: The mortality reduction and life-years gained estimated by this
      study are lower than those of single birth cohort studies. Single cohort studies 
      neglect the changing dynamics of smoking behavior across generations, whereas
      this study reflects the trend of decreasing smoking prevalence since the 1960s.
      Maximum benefit could be derived from lung cancer screening through 2021; in
      later years, mortality reduction due to screening will decline. If a
      comprehensive screening program is not implemented in the near future, the
      opportunity to achieve these benefits will have passed.

TI  - Impact of person-centred care training and person-centred activities on quality
      of life, agitation, and antipsychotic use in people with dementia living in
      nursing homes: A cluster-randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e1002500
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Agitation is a common, challenging symptom affecting large numbers of
      people with dementia and impacting on quality of life (QoL). There is an urgent
      need for evidence-based, cost-effective psychosocial interventions to improve
      these outcomes, particularly in the absence of safe, effective pharmacological
      therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a person-centred care and
      psychosocial intervention incorporating an antipsychotic review, WHELD, on QoL,
      agitation, and antipsychotic use in people with dementia living in nursing homes,
      and to determine its cost. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a randomised controlled
      cluster trial conducted between 1 January 2013 and 30 September 2015 that
      compared the WHELD intervention with treatment as usual (TAU) in people with
      dementia living in 69 UK nursing homes, using an intention to treat analysis. All
      nursing homes allocated to the intervention received staff training in
      person-centred care and social interaction and education regarding antipsychotic 
      medications (antipsychotic review), followed by ongoing delivery through a care
      staff champion model. The primary outcome measure was QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy).
      Secondary outcomes were agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]),
      neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version
      [NPI-NH]), antipsychotic use, global deterioration (Clinical Dementia Rating),
      mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia), unmet needs (Camberwell
      Assessment of Need for the Elderly), mortality, quality of interactions (Quality 
      of Interactions Scale [QUIS]), pain (Abbey Pain Scale), and cost. Costs were
      calculated using cost function figures compared with usual costs. In all, 847
      people were randomised to WHELD or TAU, of whom 553 completed the 9-month
      randomised controlled trial. The intervention conferred a statistically
      significant improvement in QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy Z score 2.82, p = 0.0042; mean
      difference 2.54, SEM 0.88; 95% CI 0.81, 4.28; Cohen's D effect size 0.24). There 
      were also statistically significant benefits in agitation (CMAI Z score 2.68, p =
      0.0076; mean difference 4.27, SEM 1.59; 95% CI -7.39, -1.15; Cohen's D 0.23) and 
      overall neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-NH Z score 3.52, p < 0.001; mean
      difference 4.55, SEM 1.28; 95% CI -7.07,-2.02; Cohen's D 0.30). Benefits were
      greatest in people with moderately severe dementia. There was a statistically
      significant benefit in positive care interactions as measured by QUIS (19.7%
      increase, SEM 8.94; 95% CI 2.12, 37.16, p = 0.03; Cohen's D 0.55). There were no 
      statistically significant differences between WHELD and TAU for the other
      outcomes. A sensitivity analysis using a pre-specified imputation model confirmed
      statistically significant benefits in DEMQOL-Proxy, CMAI, and NPI-NH outcomes
      with the WHELD intervention. Antipsychotic drug use was at a low stable level in 
      both treatment groups, and the intervention did not reduce use. The WHELD
      intervention reduced cost compared to TAU, and the benefits achieved were
      therefore associated with a cost saving. The main limitation was that
      antipsychotic review was based on augmenting processes within care homes to
      trigger medical review and did not in this study involve proactive primary care
      education. An additional limitation was the inherent challenge of assessing QoL
      in this patient group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the WHELD
      intervention confers benefits in terms of QoL, agitation, and neuropsychiatric
      symptoms, albeit with relatively small effect sizes, as well as cost saving in a 
      model that can readily be implemented in nursing homes. Future work should
      consider how to facilitate sustainability of the intervention in this setting.

TI  - Susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to azithromycin and ceftriaxone in China:
      A retrospective study of national surveillance data from 2013 to 2016.
PG  - e1002499
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002499 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gonorrhea remains one of the most common sexually transmitted
      diseases worldwide. Successful treatment has been hampered by emerging resistance
      to each of the antibiotics recommended as first-line therapies. We
      retrospectively analyzed the susceptibility of gonorrhea to azithromycin and
      ceftriaxone using data from the China Gonococcal Resistance Surveillance
      Programme (China-GRSP) in order to provide evidence for updating the treatment
      recommendations in China. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we included 3,849 
      isolates collected from patients with a confirmed positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
      (N. gonorrhoeae) culture at clinic visits during the period of 1 January 2013
      through 31 December 2016 in 7 provinces. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 
      gonorrhea isolates using agar dilution was conducted to determine minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance to azithromycin (RTA) was defined as
      MIC >/= 1.0 mg/l, and decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (DSC) was defined
      as MIC >/= 0.125 mg/l. The prevalence of isolates with RTA was 18.6% (710/3,827; 
      95% CI 17.4%-19.8%). The percentage of patients with DSC fluctuated between 9.7% 
      and 12.2% over this period. The overall prevalence of isolates with both RTA and 
      DSC was 2.3% (87/3,827; 95% CI 1.9%-2.8%) and it increased from 1.9% in 2013 to
      3.3% in 2016 (chi-squared test for trend, P = 0.03). Study limitations include
      the retrospective study design and potential biases in the sample, which may
      overrepresent men with symptomatic infection, coastal residents, and people
      reporting as heterosexual. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first
      national study on susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to azithromycin and
      ceftriaxone in China. Our findings indicate high rates of RTA and DSC from 2013
      to 2016. Although dual therapy with azithromycin and ceftriaxone has been
      recommended by WHO and many countries to treat gonorrhea, reevaluation of this
      therapy is needed prior to its introduction in China.

TI  - Traumatic brain injury and the risk of dementia diagnosis: A nationwide cohort
      study.
PG  - e1002496
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002496 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with dementia. The
      questions of whether the risk of dementia decreases over time after TBI, whether 
      it is similar for different TBI types, and whether it is influenced by familial
      aggregation are not well studied. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The cohort considered for
      inclusion comprised all individuals in Sweden aged >/=50 years on December 31,
      2005 (n = 3,329,360). Diagnoses of dementia and TBI were tracked through
      nationwide databases from 1964 until December 31, 2012. In a first cohort,
      individuals diagnosed with TBI (n = 164,334) were matched with up to two
      controls. A second cohort consisted of subjects diagnosed with dementia during
      follow-up (n = 136,233) matched with up to two controls. A third cohort consisted
      of 46,970 full sibling pairs with discordant TBI status. During a mean follow-up 
      period of 15.3 (range, 0-49) years, 21,963 individuals in the first cohort (6.3% 
      with TBI, 3.6% without TBI) were diagnosed with dementia (adjusted odds ratio
      [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-1.86). The association was
      strongest in the first year after TBI (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 3.23-3.84), but the risk
      remained significant >30 years (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11-1.41). Single mild TBI
      showed a weaker association with dementia (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.70) than did 
      more severe TBI (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.95-2.19) and multiple TBIs (OR, 2.81; 95%
      CI, 2.51-3.15). These results were in general confirmed in the nested
      case-control cohort. TBI was also associated with an increased risk of dementia
      diagnosis in sibling pairs with discordant TBI status (OR, 1.89; 95% CI,
      1.62-2.21). A main limitation of the present study is the observational design.
      Thus, no causal inferences can be made based on the associations found.
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of dementia diagnosis decreased over time after TBI, but it
      was still evident >30 years after the trauma. The association was stronger for
      more severe TBI and multiple TBIs, and it persisted after adjustment for familial
      factors.

TI  - Long-term trends in mortality and AIDS-defining events after combination ART
      initiation among children and adolescents with perinatal HIV infection in 17
      middle- and high-income countries in Europe and Thailand: A cohort study.
PG  - e1002491
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Published estimates of mortality and progression to AIDS as children 
      with HIV approach adulthood are limited. We describe rates and risk factors for
      death and AIDS-defining events in children and adolescents after initiation of
      combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in 17 middle- and high-income
      countries, including some in Western and Central Europe (W&CE), Eastern Europe
      (Russia and Ukraine), and Thailand. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Children with perinatal
      HIV aged <18 years initiating cART were followed until their 21st birthday,
      transfer to adult care, death, loss to follow-up, or last visit up until 31
      December 2013. Rates of death and first AIDS-defining events were calculated.
      Baseline and time-updated risk factors for early/late (</=/>6 months of cART)
      death and progression to AIDS were assessed. Of 3,526 children included, 32% were
      from the United Kingdom or Ireland, 30% from elsewhere in W&CE, 18% from Russia
      or Ukraine, and 20% from Thailand. At cART initiation, median age was 5.2 (IQR
      1.4-9.3) years; 35% of children aged <5 years had a CD4 lymphocyte percentage
      <15% in 1997-2003, which fell to 15% of children in 2011 onwards (p < 0.001).
      Similarly, 53% and 18% of children >/=5 years had a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 in
      1997-2003 and in 2011 onwards, respectively (p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 5.6
      (2.9-8.7) years. Of 94 deaths and 237 first AIDS-defining events, 43 (46%) and
      100 (42%) were within 6 months of initiating cART, respectively. Multivariable
      predictors of early death were: being in the first year of life; residence in
      Russia, Ukraine, or Thailand; AIDS at cART start; initiating cART on a
      nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen; severe
      immune suppression; and low BMI-for-age z-score. Current severe immune
      suppression, low current BMI-for-age z-score, and current viral load >400 c/mL
      predicted late death. Predictors of early and late progression to AIDS were
      similar. Study limitations include incomplete recording of US Centers for Disease
      Control (CDC) disease stage B events and serious adverse events in some
      countries; events that were distributed over a long time period, and that we
      lacked power to analyse trends in patterns and causes of death over time.
      CONCLUSIONS: In our study, 3,526 children and adolescents with perinatal HIV
      infection initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in countries in Europe and
      Thailand. We observed that over 40% of deaths occurred </=6 months after cART
      initiation. Greater early mortality risk in infants, as compared to older
      children, and in Russia, Ukraine, or Thailand as compared to W&CE, raises
      concern. Current severe immune suppression, being underweight, and unsuppressed
      viral load were associated with a higher risk of death at >6 months after
      initiation of cART.

TI  - PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition and anti-CTLA-4 whole tumor cell vaccination counter 
      adaptive immune resistance: A mouse neuroblastoma model that mimics human
      disease.
PG  - e1002497
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adaptive immune resistance induces an immunosuppressive tumor
      environment that enables immune evasion. This phenomenon results in tumor escape 
      with progression and metastasis. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed
      on tumors is thought to inhibit tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) through
      programmed cell death 1 (PD1), enabling adaptive immune resistance. This study
      investigates the role of PD-L1 in both mouse and human neuroblastoma immunity.
      The consequence of PD-L1 inhibition is characterized in the context of an
      established whole tumor cell vaccine. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A mouse model of
      neuroblastoma was investigated using an Id2 knockdown whole cell vaccine in
      combination with checkpoint inhibition. We show that immunogenic mouse
      neuroblastoma acquires adaptive immune resistance by up-regulating PD-L1
      expression, whereas PD-L1 is of lesser consequence in nonimmunogenic
      neuroblastoma tumors. Combining PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition with whole tumor
      cell/anti-CTLA-4 vaccination enhanced tumor cell killing, cured mice with
      established tumors, and induced long-term immune memory (6 months). From an
      evaluation of patient neuroblastoma tumors, we found that the inflammatory
      environment of the mouse neuroblastoma mimicked human disease in which PD-L1
      expression was associated directly with TILs and lower-risk tumors. High-risk
      patient tumors were lacking both TILs and PD-L1 expression. Although a
      correlation in immunity seems to exist between the mouse model and human
      findings, the mouse tumor model is induced and not spontaneously occurring, and
      furthermore, the number of both mouse and human correlates is limited.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the role PD-L1 plays in neuroblastoma's
      resistance to immunity and defines the nonredundant effect of combination
      checkpoint inhibition with vaccine therapy in a mouse model. High-risk,
      nonimmunogenic human tumors display both diminished PD-L1 expression and adaptive
      immune resistance. Paradoxically, high-risk tumors may be more responsive to
      effective vaccine therapy because of their apparent lack of adaptive immune
      resistance.

TI  - Brain and blood metabolite signatures of pathology and progression in Alzheimer
      disease: A targeted metabolomics study.
PG  - e1002482
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002482 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The metabolic basis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is poorly understood,
      and the relationships between systemic abnormalities in metabolism and AD
      pathogenesis are unclear. Understanding how global perturbations in metabolism
      are related to severity of AD neuropathology and the eventual expression of AD
      symptoms in at-risk individuals is critical to developing effective
      disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we undertook parallel metabolomics
      analyses in both the brain and blood to identify systemic correlates of
      neuropathology and their associations with prodromal and preclinical measures of 
      AD progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Quantitative and targeted metabolomics
      (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ [identification and quantification] p180) assays were
      performed on brain tissue samples from the autopsy cohort of the Baltimore
      Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (N = 44, mean age = 81.33, % female = 36.36)
      from AD (N = 15), control (CN; N = 14), and "asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease"
      (ASYMAD, i.e., individuals with significant AD pathology but no cognitive
      impairment during life; N = 15) participants. Using machine-learning methods, we 
      identified a panel of 26 metabolites from two main classes-sphingolipids and
      glycerophospholipids-that discriminated AD and CN samples with accuracy,
      sensitivity, and specificity of 83.33%, 86.67%, and 80%, respectively. We then
      assayed these 26 metabolites in serum samples from two well-characterized
      longitudinal cohorts representing prodromal (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative [ADNI], N = 767, mean age = 75.19, % female = 42.63) and preclinical
      (BLSA) (N = 207, mean age = 78.68, % female = 42.63) AD, in which we tested their
      associations with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-related brain
      atrophy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology, risk of conversion
      to incident AD, and trajectories of cognitive performance. We developed an
      integrated blood and brain endophenotype score that summarized the relative
      importance of each metabolite to severity of AD pathology and disease progression
      (Endophenotype Association Score in Early Alzheimer's Disease [EASE-AD]).
      Finally, we mapped the main metabolite classes emerging from our analyses to key 
      biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. We found that distinct
      sphingolipid species including sphingomyelin (SM) with acyl residue sums C16:0,
      C18:1, and C16:1 (SM C16:0, SM C18:1, SM C16:1) and hydroxysphingomyelin with
      acyl residue sum C14:1 (SM (OH) C14:1) were consistently associated with severity
      of AD pathology at autopsy and AD progression across prodromal and preclinical
      stages. Higher log-transformed blood concentrations of all four sphingolipids in 
      cognitively normal individuals were significantly associated with increased risk 
      of future conversion to incident AD: SM C16:0 (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.430, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 1.703-11.520, p = 0.002), SM C16:1 (HR = 3.455, 95% CI
      = 1.516-7.873, p = 0.003), SM (OH) C14:1 (HR = 3.539, 95% CI = 1.373-9.122, p =
      0.009), and SM C18:1 (HR = 2.255, 95% CI = 1.047-4.855, p = 0.038). The
      sphingolipid species identified map to several biologically relevant pathways
      implicated in AD, including tau phosphorylation, amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism,
      calcium homeostasis, acetylcholine biosynthesis, and apoptosis. Our study has
      limitations: the relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited
      our power to detect significant associations, control for heterogeneity between
      groups, and replicate our findings in independent, autopsy-derived brain samples.
      CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel framework to identify biologically relevant brain
      and blood metabolites associated with disease pathology and progression during
      the prodromal and preclinical stages of AD. Our results show that perturbations
      in sphingolipid metabolism are consistently associated with endophenotypes across
      preclinical and prodromal AD, as well as with AD pathology at autopsy.
      Sphingolipids may be biologically relevant biomarkers for the early detection of 
      AD, and correcting perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism may be a plausible
      and novel therapeutic strategy in AD.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of the Fc-modified HIV-1 human monoclonal antibody
      VRC01LS: A Phase 1 open-label clinical trial in healthy adults.
PG  - e1002493
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002493 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: VRC01 is a human broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (bnMAb)
      against the CD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) that is
      currently being evaluated in a Phase IIb adult HIV-1 prevention efficacy trial.
      VRC01LS is a modified version of VRC01, designed for extended serum half-life by 
      increased binding affinity to the neonatal Fc receptor. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      This Phase I dose-escalation study of VRC01LS in HIV-negative healthy adults was 
      conducted by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institutes of
      Health (NIH) Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD). The age range of the study
      volunteers was 21-50 years; 51% of study volunteers were male and 49% were
      female. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability of VRC01LS intravenous
      (IV) infusions at 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg infused once, 20 mg/kg given three times at
      12-week intervals, and subcutaneous (SC) delivery at 5 mg/kg delivered once, or
      three times at 12-week intervals. Secondary objectives were pharmacokinetics
      (PK), serum neutralization activity, and development of antidrug antibodies.
      Enrollment began on November 16, 2015, and concluded on August 23, 2017. This
      report describes the safety data for the first 37 volunteers who received
      administrations of VRC01LS. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or
      dose-limiting toxicities. Mild malaise and myalgia were the most common adverse
      events (AEs). There were six AEs assessed as possibly related to VRC01LS
      administration, and all were mild in severity and resolved during the study. PK
      data were modeled based on the first dose of VRC01LS in the first 25 volunteers
      to complete their schedule of evaluations. The mean (+/-SD) serum concentration
      12 weeks after one IV administration of 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg were 180 +/- 43
      mug/mL (n = 7) and 326 +/- 35 mug/mL (n = 5), respectively. The mean (+/-SD)
      serum concentration 12 weeks after one IV and SC administration of 5 mg/kg were
      40 +/- 3 mug/mL (n = 2) and 25 +/- 5 mug/mL (n = 9), respectively. Over the 5-40 
      mg/kg IV dose range (n = 16), the clearance was 36 +/- 8 mL/d with an elimination
      half-life of 71 +/- 18 days. VRC01LS retained its expected neutralizing activity 
      in serum, and anti-VRC01 antibody responses were not detected. Potential
      limitations of this study include the small sample size typical of Phase I trials
      and the need to further describe the PK properties of VRC01LS administered on
      multiple occasions. CONCLUSIONS: The human bnMAb VRC01LS was safe and well
      tolerated when delivered intravenously or subcutaneously. The half-life was more 
      than 4-fold greater when compared to wild-type VRC01 historical data. The reduced
      clearance and extended half-life may make it possible to achieve therapeutic
      levels with less frequent and lower-dose administrations. This would potentially 
      lower the costs of manufacturing and improve the practicality of using passively 
      administered monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the prevention of HIV-1 infection.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of alternative vaccination strategies for polyvalent
      meningococcal vaccines in Burkina Faso: A transmission dynamic modeling study.
PG  - e1002495
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of a conjugate vaccine for serogroup A Neisseria
      meningitidis has dramatically reduced disease in the African meningitis belt. In 
      this context, important questions remain about the performance of different
      vaccine policies that target remaining serogroups. Here, we estimate the health
      impact and cost associated with several alternative vaccination policies in
      Burkina Faso. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed and calibrated a mathematical
      model of meningococcal transmission to project the disability-adjusted life years
      (DALYs) averted and costs associated with the current Base policy (serogroup A
      conjugate vaccination at 9 months, as part of the Expanded Program on
      Immunization [EPI], plus district-specific reactive vaccination campaigns using
      polyvalent meningococcal polysaccharide [PMP] vaccine in response to outbreaks)
      and three alternative policies: (1) Base Prime: novel polyvalent meningococcal
      conjugate (PMC) vaccine replaces the serogroup A conjugate in EPI and is also
      used in reactive campaigns; (2) Prevention 1: PMC used in EPI and in a nationwide
      catch-up campaign for 1-18-year-olds; and (3) Prevention 2: Prevention 1, except 
      the nationwide campaign includes individuals up to 29 years old. Over a 30-year
      simulation period, Prevention 2 would avert 78% of the meningococcal cases (95%
      prediction interval: 63%-90%) expected under the Base policy if serogroup A is
      not replaced by remaining serogroups after elimination, and would avert 87%
      (77%-93%) of meningococcal cases if complete strain replacement occurs. Compared 
      to the Base policy and at the PMC vaccine price of US$4 per dose, strategies that
      use PMC vaccine (i.e., Base Prime and Preventions 1 and 2) are expected to be
      cost saving if strain replacement occurs, and would cost US$51 (-US$236, US$490),
      US$188 (-US$97, US$626), and US$246 (-US$53, US$703) per DALY averted,
      respectively, if strain replacement does not occur. An important potential
      limitation of our study is the simplifying assumption that all circulating
      meningococcal serogroups can be aggregated into a single group; while this
      assumption is critical for model tractability, it would compromise the insights
      derived from our model if the effectiveness of the vaccine differs markedly
      between serogroups or if there are complex between-serogroup interactions that
      influence the frequency and magnitude of future meningitis epidemics.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a vaccination strategy that includes a
      catch-up nationwide immunization campaign in young adults with a PMC vaccine and 
      the addition of this new vaccine into EPI is cost-effective and would avert a
      substantial portion of meningococcal cases expected under the current World
      Health Organization-recommended strategy of reactive vaccination. This analysis
      is limited to Burkina Faso and assumes that polyvalent vaccines offer equal
      protection against all meningococcal serogroups; further studies are needed to
      evaluate the robustness of this assumption and applicability for other countries 
      in the meningitis belt.

TI  - Long-term risks and benefits associated with cesarean delivery for mother, baby, 
      and subsequent pregnancies: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002494
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002494 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cesarean birth rates continue to rise worldwide with recent (2016)
      reported rates of 24.5% in Western Europe, 32% in North America, and 41% in South
      America. The objective of this systematic review is to describe the long-term
      risks and benefits of cesarean delivery for mother, baby, and subsequent
      pregnancies. The primary maternal outcome was pelvic floor dysfunction, the
      primary baby outcome was asthma, and the primary subsequent pregnancy outcome was
      perinatal death. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Cumulative 
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases were
      systematically searched for published studies in human subjects (last search 25
      May 2017), supplemented by manual searches. Included studies were randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) and large (more than 1,000 participants) prospective
      cohort studies with greater than or equal to one-year follow-up comparing
      outcomes of women delivering by cesarean delivery and by vaginal delivery. Two
      assessors screened 30,327 abstracts. Studies were graded for risk of bias by two 
      assessors using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) Methodology
      Checklist and the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-Randomized Studies.
      Results were pooled in fixed effects meta-analyses or in random effects models
      when significant heterogeneity was present (I2 >/= 40%). One RCT and 79 cohort
      studies (all from high income countries) were included, involving 29,928,274
      participants. Compared to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery was associated with
      decreased risk of urinary incontinence, odds ratio (OR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.47 to
      0.66; n = 58,900; 8 studies) and pelvic organ prolapse (OR 0.29, 0.17 to 0.51; n 
      = 39,208; 2 studies). Children delivered by cesarean delivery had increased risk 
      of asthma up to the age of 12 years (OR 1.21, 1.11 to 1.32; n = 887,960; 13
      studies) and obesity up to the age of 5 years (OR 1.59, 1.33 to 1.90; n = 64,113;
      6 studies). Pregnancy after cesarean delivery was associated with increased risk 
      of miscarriage (OR 1.17, 1.03 to 1.32; n = 151,412; 4 studies) and stillbirth (OR
      1.27, 1.15 to 1.40; n = 703,562; 8 studies), but not perinatal mortality (OR
      1.11, 0.89 to 1.39; n = 91,429; 2 studies). Pregnancy following cesarean delivery
      was associated with increased risk of placenta previa (OR 1.74, 1.62 to 1.87; n =
      7,101,692; 10 studies), placenta accreta (OR 2.95, 1.32 to 6.60; n = 705,108; 3
      studies), and placental abruption (OR 1.38, 1.27 to 1.49; n = 5,667,160; 6
      studies). This is a comprehensive review adhering to a registered protocol, and
      guidelines for the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology were
      followed, but it is based on predominantly observational data, and in some
      meta-analyses, between-study heterogeneity is high; therefore, causation cannot
      be inferred and the results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: When
      compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery is associated with a reduced
      rate of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, but this should be
      weighed against the association with increased risks for fertility, future
      pregnancy, and long-term childhood outcomes. This information could be valuable
      in counselling women on mode of delivery.

TI  - Progression of the first stage of spontaneous labour: A prospective cohort study 
      in two sub-Saharan African countries.
PG  - e1002492
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002492 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escalation in the global rates of labour interventions, particularly 
      cesarean section and oxytocin augmentation, has renewed interest in a better
      understanding of natural labour progression. Methodological advancements in
      statistical and computational techniques addressing the limitations of pioneer
      studies have led to novel findings and triggered a re-evaluation of current
      labour practices. As part of the World Health Organization's Better Outcomes in
      Labour Difficulty (BOLD) project, which aimed to develop a new labour
      monitoring-to-action tool, we examined the patterns of labour progression as
      depicted by cervical dilatation over time in a cohort of women in Nigeria and
      Uganda who gave birth vaginally following a spontaneous labour onset. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: This was a prospective, multicentre, cohort study of 5,606 women with
      singleton, vertex, term gestation who presented at </= 6 cm of cervical
      dilatation following a spontaneous labour onset that resulted in a vaginal birth 
      with no adverse birth outcomes in 13 hospitals across Nigeria and Uganda. We
      independently applied survival analysis and multistate Markov models to estimate 
      the duration of labour centimetre by centimetre until 10 cm and the cumulative
      duration of labour from the cervical dilatation at admission through 10 cm.
      Multistate Markov and nonlinear mixed models were separately used to construct
      average labour curves. All analyses were conducted according to three parity
      groups: parity = 0 (n = 2,166), parity = 1 (n = 1,488), and parity = 2+ (n =
      1,952). We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of oxytocin
      augmentation on labour progression by re-examining the progression patterns after
      excluding women with augmented labours. Labour was augmented with oxytocin in 40%
      of nulliparous and 28% of multiparous women. The median time to advance by 1 cm
      exceeded 1 hour until 5 cm was reached in both nulliparous and multiparous women.
      Based on a 95th percentile threshold, nulliparous women may take up to 7 hours to
      progress from 4 to 5 cm and over 3 hours to progress from 5 to 6 cm. Median
      cumulative duration of labour indicates that nulliparous women admitted at 4 cm, 
      5 cm, and 6 cm reached 10 cm within an expected time frame if the dilatation rate
      was >/= 1 cm/hour, but their corresponding 95th percentiles show that labour
      could last up to 14, 11, and 9 hours, respectively. Substantial differences exist
      between actual plots of labour progression of individual women and the 'average
      labour curves' derived from study population-level data. Exclusion of women with 
      augmented labours from the study population resulted in slightly faster labour
      progression patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical dilatation during labour in the
      slowest-yet-normal women can progress more slowly than the widely accepted
      benchmark of 1 cm/hour, irrespective of parity. Interventions to expedite labour 
      to conform to a cervical dilatation threshold of 1 cm/hour may be inappropriate, 
      especially when applied before 5 cm in nulliparous and multiparous women.
      Averaged labour curves may not truly reflect the variability associated with
      labour progression, and their use for decision-making in labour management should
      be de-emphasized.

TI  - Increased risk of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes in
      women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus, a target group in general
      practice for preventive interventions: A population-based cohort study.
PG  - e1002488
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002488 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with developing
      type 2 diabetes, but very few studies have examined its effect on developing
      cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort
      study utilizing a large primary care database in the United Kingdom. From 1
      February 1990 to 15 May 2016, 9,118 women diagnosed with GDM were identified and 
      randomly matched with 37,281 control women by age and timing of pregnancy (up to 
      3 months). Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals
      (CIs) were calculated for cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease.
      Women with GDM were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (IRR = 21.96; 95% CI
      18.31-26.34) and hypertension (IRR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59-2.16) after adjusting for 
      age, Townsend (deprivation) quintile, body mass index, and smoking. For ischemic 
      heart disease (IHD), the IRR was 2.78 (95% CI 1.37-5.66), and for cerebrovascular
      disease 0.95 (95% CI 0.51-1.77; p-value = 0.87), after adjusting for the above
      covariates and lipid-lowering medication and hypertension at baseline. Follow-up 
      screening for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors was poor.
      Limitations include potential selective documentation of severe GDM for women in 
      primary care, higher surveillance for outcomes in women diagnosed with GDM than
      control women, and a short median follow-up postpartum period, with a small
      number of outcomes for IHD and cerebrovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Women
      diagnosed with GDM were at very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and had a
      significantly increased incidence of hypertension and IHD. Identifying this group
      of women in general practice and targeting cardiovascular risk factors could
      improve long-term outcomes.

TI  - Estimated mortality on HIV treatment among active patients and patients lost to
      follow-up in 4 provinces of Zambia: Findings from a multistage sampling-based
      survey.
PG  - e1002489
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002489 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival represents the single most important indicator of successful
      HIV treatment. Routine monitoring fails to capture most deaths. As a result, both
      regional assessments of the impact of HIV services and identification of hotspots
      for improvement efforts are limited. We sought to assess true mortality on
      treatment, characterize the extent under-reporting of mortality in routine health
      information systems in Zambia, and identify drivers of mortality across sites and
      over time using a multistage, regionally representative sampling approach.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enumerated all HIV infected adults on antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) who visited any one of 64 facilities across 4 provinces in Zambia
      during the 24-month period from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2015. We identified a
      probability sample of patients who were lost to follow-up through selecting
      facilities probability proportional to size and then a simple random sample of
      lost patients. Outcomes among patients lost to follow-up were incorporated into
      survival analysis and multivariate regression through probability weights. Of
      165,464 individuals (64% female, median age 39 years (IQR 33-46), median CD4 201 
      cells/mm3 (IQR 111-312), the 2-year cumulative incidence of mortality increased
      from 1.9% (95% CI 1.7%-2.0%) to a corrected rate of 7.0% (95% CI 5.7%-8.4%) (all 
      ART users) and from 2.1% (95% CI 1.8%-2.4%) to 8.3% (95% CI 6.1%-10.7%) (new ART 
      users). Revised provincial mortality rates ranged from 3-9 times higher than
      naive rates for new ART users and were lowest in Lusaka Province (4.6 per 100
      person-years) and highest in Western Province (8.7 per 100 person-years) after
      correction. Corrected mortality rates varied markedly by clinic, with an IQR of
      3.5 to 7.5 deaths per 100 person-years and a high of 13.4 deaths per 100
      person-years among new ART users, even after adjustment for clinical (e.g.,
      pretherapy CD4) and contextual (e.g., province and clinic size) factors.
      Mortality rates (all ART users) were highest year 1 after treatment at 4.6/100
      person-years (95% CI 3.9-5.5), 2.9/100 person-years (95% CI 2.1-3.9) in year 2,
      and approximately 1.6% per year through 8 years on treatment. In multivariate
      analysis, patient-level factors including male sex and pretherapy CD4 levels and 
      WHO stage were associated with higher mortality among new ART users, while male
      sex and HIV disclosure were associated with mortality among all ART users. In
      both cases, being late (>14 days late for appointment) or lost (>90 days late for
      an appointment) was associated with deaths. We were unable to ascertain the vital
      status of about one-quarter of those lost and selected for tracing and did not
      adjudicate causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: HIV treatment in Zambia is not optimally
      effective. The high and sustained mortality rates and marked under-reporting of
      mortality at the provincial-level and unexplained heterogeneity between regions
      and sites suggest opportunities for the use of corrected mortality rates for
      quality improvement. A regionally representative sampling-based approach can
      bring gaps and opportunities for programs into clear epidemiological focus for
      local and global decision makers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a practical method for determining probable
      causes of death at the population level in places where systems for medical
      certification of cause of death are weak. VA methods suitable for use in routine 
      settings, such as civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, have
      developed rapidly in the last decade. These developments have been part of a
      growing global momentum to strengthen CRVS systems in low-income countries. With 
      this momentum have come pressure for continued research and development of VA
      methods and the need for a single standard VA instrument on which multiple
      automated diagnostic methods can be developed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 2016,
      partners harmonized a WHO VA standard instrument that fully incorporates the
      indicators necessary to run currently available automated diagnostic algorithms. 
      The WHO 2016 VA instrument, together with validated approaches to analyzing VA
      data, offers countries solutions to improving information about patterns of
      cause-specific mortality. This VA instrument offers the opportunity to harmonize 
      the automated diagnostic algorithms in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Despite all
      improvements in design and technology, VA is only recommended where medical
      certification of cause of death is not possible. The method can nevertheless
      provide sufficient information to guide public health priorities in communities
      in which physician certification of deaths is largely unavailable. The WHO 2016
      VA instrument, together with validated approaches to analyzing VA data, offers
      countries solutions to improving information about patterns of cause-specific
      mortality.

TI  - Immune-related genetic enrichment in frontotemporal dementia: An analysis of
      genome-wide association studies.
PG  - e1002487
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002487 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Converging evidence suggests that immune-mediated dysfunction plays
      an important role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although 
      genetic studies have shown that immune-associated loci are associated with
      increased FTD risk, a systematic investigation of genetic overlap between
      immune-mediated diseases and the spectrum of FTD-related disorders has not been
      performed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using large genome-wide association studies
      (GWASs) (total n = 192,886 cases and controls) and recently developed tools to
      quantify genetic overlap/pleiotropy, we systematically identified single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with FTD-related
      disorders-namely, FTD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear 
      palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-and 1 or more
      immune-mediated diseases including Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis (UC),
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease (CeD), and
      psoriasis. We found up to 270-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and RA, up to
      160-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and UC, up to 180-fold genetic enrichment
      between FTD and T1D, and up to 175-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and CeD.
      In contrast, for CBD and PSP, only 1 of the 6 immune-mediated diseases produced
      genetic enrichment comparable to that seen for FTD, with up to 150-fold genetic
      enrichment between CBD and CeD and up to 180-fold enrichment between PSP and RA. 
      Further, we found minimal enrichment between ALS and the immune-mediated diseases
      tested, with the highest levels of enrichment between ALS and RA (up to 20-fold).
      For FTD, at a conjunction false discovery rate < 0.05 and after excluding SNPs in
      linkage disequilibrium, we found that 8 of the 15 identified loci mapped to the
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on Chromosome (Chr) 6. We also found novel
      candidate FTD susceptibility loci within LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2),
      TBKBP1 (TBK1 binding protein 1), and PGBD5 (piggyBac transposable element derived
      5). Functionally, we found that the expression of FTD-immune pleiotropic genes
      (particularly within the HLA region) is altered in postmortem brain tissue from
      patients with FTD and is enriched in microglia/macrophages compared to other
      central nervous system cell types. The main study limitation is that the results 
      represent only clinically diagnosed individuals. Also, given the complex
      interconnectedness of the HLA region, we were not able to define the specific
      gene or genes on Chr 6 responsible for our pleiotropic signal. CONCLUSIONS: We
      show immune-mediated genetic enrichment specifically in FTD, particularly within 
      the HLA region. Our genetic results suggest that for a subset of patients, immune
      dysfunction may contribute to FTD risk. These findings have potential
      implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with
      FTD.

TI  - Association between intake of less-healthy foods defined by the United Kingdom's 
      nutrient profile model and cardiovascular disease: A population-based cohort
      study.
PG  - e1002484
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002484 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency-Ofcom nutrient
      profiling model (FSA-Ofcom model) is used to define less-healthy foods that
      cannot be advertised to children. However, there has been limited investigation
      of whether less-healthy foods defined by this model are associated with
      prospective health outcomes. The objective of this study was to test whether
      consumption of less-healthy food as defined by the FSA-Ofcom model is associated 
      with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data from the
      European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort study in
      adults (n = 25,639) aged 40-79 years who completed a 7-day diet diary between
      1993 and 1997. Incident CVD (primary outcome), cardiovascular mortality, and
      all-cause mortality (secondary outcomes) were identified using record linkage to 
      hospital admissions data and death certificates up to 31 March 2015. Each food
      and beverage item reported was coded and given a continuous score, using the
      FSA-Ofcom model, based on the consumption of energy; saturated fat; total sugar; 
      sodium; nonsoluble fibre; protein; and fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Items were
      classified as less-healthy using Ofcom regulation thresholds. We used Cox
      proportional hazards regression to test for an association between consumption of
      less-healthy food and incident CVD. Sensitivity analyses explored whether the
      results differed based on the definition of the exposure. Analyses were adjusted 
      for age, sex, behavioural risk factors, clinical risk factors, and socioeconomic 
      status. Participants were followed up for a mean of 16.4 years. During follow-up,
      there were 4,965 incident cases of CVD (1,524 fatal within 30 days). In the
      unadjusted analyses, we observed an association between consumption of
      less-healthy food and incident CVD (test for linear trend over quintile groups, p
      < 0.01). After adjustment for covariates (sociodemographic, behavioural, and
      indices of cardiovascular risk), we found no association between consumption of
      less-healthy food and incident CVD (p = 0.84) or cardiovascular mortality (p =
      0.90), but there was an association between consumption of less-healthy food and 
      all-cause mortality (test for linear trend, p = 0.006; quintile group 5, highest 
      consumption of less-healthy food, versus quintile group 1, HR = 1.11, 95% CI
      1.02-1.20). Sensitivity analyses produced similar results. The study is
      observational and relies on self-report of dietary consumption. Despite
      adjustment for known and reported confounders, residual confounding is possible. 
      CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, no significant
      association between consumption of less-healthy food (as classified by the
      FSA-Ofcom model) and CVD was observed in this study. This suggests, in the UK
      setting, that the FSA-Ofcom model is not consistently discriminating among foods 
      with respect to their association with CVD. More studies are needed to understand
      better the relationship between consumption of less-healthy food, defined by the 
      FSA-Ofcom model, and indices of health.

TI  - Pelvic inflammatory disease risk following negative results from chlamydia
      nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) versus non-NAATs in Denmark: A
      retrospective cohort.
PG  - e1002483
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002483 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) are the recommended test
      type for diagnosing Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia). However, less sensitive
      diagnostic methods-including direct immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme-linked
      immunoassay (ELISA)-remain in use in lower resourced settings. We estimate the
      risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) following undiagnosed infection in
      women tested with non-NAATs and estimate the health gain from using accurate
      diagnostic tests. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used Denmark's national Chlamydia
      Study dataset to extract all chlamydia tests performed in women aged 15-34 years 
      (1998-2001). Tests were categorised as non-NAAT (IF/ELISA) or NAAT and limited to
      each woman's first test in the study period. We linked test data to hospital
      presentations for PID within 12 months from the Danish National Patient Register.
      The study included 272,105 women with a chlamydia test, just under half (44.78%, 
      n = 121,857) were tested using NAATs. Overall, 6.38% (n = 17,353) tested positive
      for chlamydia and 0.64% (n = 1,732) were diagnosed with PID within 12 months. The
      risk of PID following a positive chlamydia test did not differ by test type (NAAT
      0.81% [95% CI 0.61-1.00], non-NAAT 0.78% [0.59-0.96]). The risk of PID following 
      a negative test was significantly lower in women tested with NAATs compared to
      non-NAATs (0.55% [0.51-0.59] compared to 0.69% [0.64-0.73]; adjusted odds ratio
      (AOR) 0.83 [0.75-0.93]). We estimate that 18% of chlamydia infections in women
      tested with a non-NAAT were undiagnosed and that the risk of progression from
      undiagnosed chlamydia infection to PID within 12 months was 9.52% (9.30-9.68).
      Using non-NAATs could lead to an excess 120 cases of PID per 100,000 women tested
      compared to using NAATs. The key limitations of this study are under
      ascertainment of PID cases, misclassification bias in chlamydia and PID exposure 
      status, bias to the association between clinical presentation and test type and
      the presence of unmeasured confounders (including other sexually transmitted
      infection [STI] diagnoses and clinical indication for chlamydia test).
      CONCLUSION: This retrospective observational study estimates the positive impact 
      on women's reproductive health from using accurate chlamydia diagnostic tests and
      provides further evidence for restricting the use of inferior tests. Women with a
      negative chlamydia test have a 17% higher adjusted risk of PID by 12 months if
      they are tested using a non-NAAT compared to a NAAT.

TI  - Life course socioeconomic position, alcohol drinking patterns in midlife, and
      cardiovascular mortality: Analysis of Norwegian population-based health surveys.
PG  - e1002476
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups tend to experience more harm
      from the same level of exposure to alcohol as advantaged groups. Alcohol has
      multiple biological effects on the cardiovascular system, both potentially
      harmful and protective. We investigated whether the diverging relationships
      between alcohol drinking patterns and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality
      differed by life course socioeconomic position (SEP). METHODS AND FINDINGS: From 
      3 cohorts (the Counties Studies, the Cohort of Norway, and the Age 40 Program,
      1987-2003) containing data from population-based cardiovascular health surveys in
      Norway, we included participants with self-reported information on alcohol
      consumption frequency (n = 207,394) and binge drinking episodes (>/=5 units per
      occasion, n = 32,616). We also used data from national registries obtained by
      linkage. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CVD mortality 
      was estimated using Cox models, including alcohol, life course SEP, age, gender, 
      smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, heart
      rate, triglycerides, diabetes, history of CVD, and family history of coronary
      heart disease (CHD). Analyses were performed in the overall sample and stratified
      by high, middle, and low strata of life course SEP. A total of 8,435 CVD deaths
      occurred during the mean 17 years of follow-up. Compared to infrequent
      consumption (<once/month), moderately frequent consumption (2-3 times per week)
      was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.72, 0.84) 
      overall. HRs for the high, middle, and low strata of SEP were 0.66 (95% CI 0.58, 
      0.76), 0.87 (95% CI 0.78, 0.97), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.64, 0.98), respectively,
      compared with infrequent users in each stratum. HRs for effect modification were 
      1.30 (95% CI 1.10, 1.54, p = 0.002; middle versus high), 1.23 (95% CI 0.96, 1.58,
      p = 0.10; low versus high), and 0.96 (95% CI 0.76, 1.21, p = 0.73; low versus
      middle). In the group with data on binge drinking, 2,284 deaths (15 years) from
      CVDs occurred. In comparison to consumers who did not binge during the past year,
      HRs among frequent bingers (>/=1 time per week) were 1.58 (95% CI 1.31, 1.91)
      overall, and 1.22 (95% CI 0.84, 1.76), 1.71 (95% CI 1.31, 2.23), and 1.85 (95% CI
      1.16, 2.94) in the strata, respectively. HRs for effect modification were 1.36
      (95% CI 0.87, 2.13, p = 0.18; middle versus high), 1.63 (95% CI 0.92, 2.91, p =
      0.10; low versus high), and 1.32 (95% CI 0.79, 2.20, p = 0.29; low versus
      middle). A limitation of this study was the use of a single measurement to
      reflect lifetime alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately frequent consumers 
      had a lower risk of CVD mortality compared with infrequent consumers, and we
      observed that this association was more pronounced among participants with higher
      SEP throughout their life course. Frequent binge drinking was associated with a
      higher risk of CVD mortality, but it was more uncertain whether the risk differed
      by life course SEP. It is unclear if these findings reflect differential
      confounding of alcohol consumption with health-protective or damaging exposures, 
      or differing effects of alcohol on health across socioeconomic groups.

TI  - Healthcare provider perspectives on managing sexually transmitted infections in
      HIV care settings in Kenya: A qualitative thematic analysis.
PG  - e1002480
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002480 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been
      increasing in Kenya, as is the case elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, while
      measures for control and prevention are weak. The objectives of this study were
      to (1) describe healthcare provider (HCP) knowledge and practices, (2) explore
      HCP attitudes and beliefs, (3) identify structural and environmental factors
      affecting STI management, and (4) seek recommendations to improve the STI program
      in Kenya. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using individual in-depth interviews (IDIs), data
      were obtained from 87 HCPs working in 21 high-volume comprehensive HIV care
      centers (CCCs) in 7 of Kenya's 8 regions. Transcript coding was performed through
      an inductive and iterative process, and the data were analyzed using NVivo 10.0. 
      Overall, HCPs were knowledgeable about STIs, saw STIs as a priority, reported
      high STI co-infection amongst people living with HIV (PLHIV), and believed STIs
      in PLHIV facilitate HIV transmission. Most used the syndromic approach for STI
      management. Condoms and counseling were available in most of the clinics. HCPs
      believed that having an STI increased stigma in the community, that there was STI
      antimicrobial drug resistance, and that STIs were not prioritized by the
      authorities. HCPs had positive attitudes toward managing STIs, but were
      uncomfortable discussing sexual issues with patients in general, and profoundly
      for anal sex. The main barriers to the management of STIs reported were low
      commitment by higher levels of management, few recent STI-focused trainings, high
      stigma and low community participation, and STI drug stock-outs. Solutions
      recommended by HCPs included formulation of new STI policies that would increase 
      access, availability, and quality of STI services; integrated STI/HIV management;
      improved STI training; increased supervision; standardized reporting; and
      community involvement in STI prevention. The key limitations of our study were
      that (1) participant experience and how much of their workload was devoted to
      managing STIs was not considered, (2) some responses may have been subject to
      recall and social desirability bias, and (3) patients or clients of STI services 
      were not interviewed, and therefore their inputs were not obtained. While
      considering these limitations, the number and variety of facilities sampled, the 
      mix of staff cadres interviewed, the use of a standardized instrument, and the
      consistency of responses add strength to our findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that HCPs understood the challenges of, and solutions for, improving the
      management of STIs in Kenya. Commitment by higher management, training in the
      management of STIs, measures for reducing stigma, and introducing new policies of
      STI management should be considered by health authorities in Kenya.

TI  - Internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection (e-STI) testing and results
      service: A randomised, single-blind, controlled trial.
PG  - e1002479
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002479 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internet-accessed sexually transmitted infection testing (e-STI
      testing) is increasingly available as an alternative to testing in clinics.
      Typically this testing modality enables users to order a test kit from a virtual 
      service (via a website or app), collect their own samples, return test samples to
      a laboratory, and be notified of their results by short message service (SMS) or 
      telephone. e-STI testing is assumed to increase access to testing in comparison
      with face-to-face services, but the evidence is unclear. We conducted a
      randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an e-STI testing and
      results service (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV, and syphilis) on STI testing uptake 
      and STI cases diagnosed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study took place in the London
      boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. Between 24 November 2014 and 31 August 2015,
      we recruited 2,072 participants, aged 16-30 years, who were resident in these
      boroughs, had at least 1 sexual partner in the last 12 months, stated willingness
      to take an STI test, and had access to the internet. Those unable to provide
      consent and unable to read English were excluded. Participants were randomly
      allocated to receive 1 text message with the web link of an e-STI testing and
      results service (intervention group) or to receive 1 text message with the web
      link of a bespoke website listing the locations, contact details, and websites of
      7 local sexual health clinics (control group). Participants were free to use any 
      other services or interventions during the study period. The primary outcomes
      were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks, and
      self-reported STI diagnosis at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks.
      Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants prescribed treatment for
      an STI, time from randomisation to completion of an STI test, and time from
      randomisation to treatment of an STI. Participants were sent a pound10 cash
      incentive on submission of self-reported data. We completed all follow-up,
      including patient record checks, by 17 June 2016. Uptake of STI testing was
      increased in the intervention group at 6 weeks (50.0% versus 26.6%, relative risk
      [RR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.15, P < 0.001). The proportion of participants
      diagnosed was 2.8% in the intervention group versus 1.4% in the control group (RR
      2.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.70, P = 0.079). No evidence of heterogeneity was observed 
      for any of the pre-specified subgroup analyses. The proportion of participants
      treated was 1.1% in the intervention group versus 0.7% in the control group (RR
      1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.16, P = 0.231). Time to test, was shorter in the
      intervention group compared to the control group (28.8 days versus 36.5 days, P <
      0.001, test for difference in restricted mean survival time [RMST]), but no
      differences were observed for time to treatment (83.2 days versus 83.5 days, P = 
      0.51, test for difference in RMST). We were unable to recruit the planned 3,000
      participants and therefore lacked power for the analyses of STI diagnoses and STI
      cases treated. CONCLUSIONS: The e-STI testing service increased uptake of STI
      testing for all groups including high-risk groups. The intervention required
      people to attend clinic for treatment and did not reduce time to treatment.
      Service innovations to improve treatment rates for those diagnosed online are
      required and could include e-treatment and postal treatment services. e-STI
      testing services require long-term monitoring and evaluation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Dual-strain genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in the US,
      Peru, and 8 countries in sub-Saharan Africa: A nested cross-sectional viral
      genotyping study.
PG  - e1002475
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative estimation of the extent to which the immune system's
      protective effect against one herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection
      protects against infection with additional HSV-2 strains is important for
      understanding the potential for HSV-2 vaccine development. Using viral
      genotyping, we estimated the prevalence of HSV-2 dual-strain infection and
      identified risk factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: People with and without HIV
      infection participating in HSV-2 natural history studies (University of
      Washington Virology Research Clinic) and HIV prevention trials (HIV Prevention
      Trials Network 039 and Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study) in the 
      US, Africa, and Peru with 2 genital specimens each containing >/=105 copies
      herpes simplex virus DNA/ml collected a median of 5 months apart (IQR: 2-11
      months) were included. It is unlikely that 2 strains would be detected in the
      same sample simultaneously; therefore, 2 samples were required to detect
      dual-strain infection. We identified 85 HSV-2 SNPs that, in aggregate, could
      determine whether paired HSV-2 strains were the same or different with >90%
      probability. These SNPs were then used to create a customized high-throughput
      array-based genotyping assay. Participants were considered to be infected with
      more than 1 strain of HSV-2 if their samples differed by >/=5 SNPs between the
      paired samples, and dual-strain infection was confirmed using high-throughput
      sequencing (HTS). We genotyped pairs of genital specimens from 459 people; 213
      (46%) were men, the median age was 34 years (IQR: 27-44), and 130 (28%) were HIV 
      seropositive. Overall, 272 (59%) people were from the US, 59 (13%) were from
      Peru, and 128 (28%) were from 8 countries in Africa. Of the 459 people, 18 (3.9%)
      met the criteria for dual-strain infection. HTS and phylogenetic analysis of
      paired specimens confirmed shedding of 2 distinct HSV-2 strains collected at
      different times in 17 pairs, giving an estimated dual-strain infection prevalence
      of 3.7% (95% CI = 2.0%-5.4%). Paired samples with dual-strain infection differed 
      by a median of 274 SNPs in the UL_US region (range 129-413). Matching our
      observed dual-strain infection frequency to simulated data of varying prevalences
      and allowing only 2 samples per person, we inferred the true prevalence of
      dual-strain infection to be 7%. In multivariable analysis, controlling for HIV
      status and continent of origin, people from Africa had a higher risk for
      dual-strain infection (risk ratio [RR] = 9.20, 95% CI = 2.05-41.32), as did
      people who were HIV seropositive (RR = 4.06, 95% CI = 1.42-11.56). CONCLUSIONS:
      HSV-2 dual-strain infection was detected in 3.7% of paired samples from
      individual participants, and was more frequent among people with HIV infection.
      Simulations suggest that the true prevalence of dual-strain infection is 7%. Our 
      data indicate that naturally occurring immunity to HSV-2 may be protective
      against infection with a second strain. This study is limited by the inability to
      determine the timing of acquisition of the second strain.

TI  - Shortages of benzathine penicillin for prevention of mother-to-child transmission
      of syphilis: An evaluation from multi-country surveys and stakeholder interviews.
PG  - e1002473
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002473 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the only recommended treatment to
      prevent mother-to-child transmission of syphilis. Due to recent reports of
      country-level shortages of BPG, an evaluation was undertaken to quantify
      countries that have experienced shortages in the past 2 years and to describe
      factors contributing to these shortages. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Country-level data
      about BPG shortages were collected using 3 survey approaches. First, a survey
      designed by the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research was
      distributed to 41 countries and territories in the Americas and 41 more in
      Africa. Second, WHO conducted an email survey of 28 US Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention country directors. An additional 13 countries were in
      contact with WHO for related congenital syphilis prevention activities and also
      reported on BPG shortages. Third, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)
      collected data from 14 countries (where it has active operations) to understand
      the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing, usage behavior, and breadth of
      available purchasing options to identify stock-outs worldwide. CHAI also
      conducted in-person interviews in the same 14 countries to understand the extent 
      of stock-outs, in-country purchasing and usage behavior, and available purchasing
      options. CHAI also completed a desk review of 10 additional high-income
      countries, which were also included. BPG shortages were attributable to
      shortfalls in supply, demand, and procurement in the countries assessed. This
      assessment should not be considered globally representative as countries not
      surveyed may also have experienced BPG shortages. Country contacts may not have
      been aware of BPG shortages when surveyed or may have underreported medication
      substitutions due to desirability bias. Funding for the purchase of BPG by
      countries was not evaluated. In all, 114 countries and territories were
      approached to provide information on BPG shortages occurring during 2014-2016. Of
      unique countries and territories, 95 (83%) responded or had information evaluable
      from public records. Of these 95 countries and territories, 39 (41%) reported a
      BPG shortage, and 56 (59%) reported no BPG shortage; 10 (12%) countries with and 
      without BPG shortages reported use of antibiotic alternatives to BPG for
      treatment of maternal syphilis. Market exits, inflexible production cycles, and
      minimum order quantities affect BPG supply. On the demand side, inaccurate
      forecasts and sole sourcing lead to under-procurement. Clinicians may also
      incorrectly prescribe BPG substitutes due to misperceptions of quality or of the 
      likelihood of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Targets for improvement include drug
      forecasting and procurement, and addressing provider reluctance to use BPG.
      Opportunities to improve global supply, demand, and use of BPG should be
      prioritized alongside congenital syphilis elimination efforts.

TI  - Cell salvage and donor blood transfusion during cesarean section: A pragmatic,
      multicentre randomised controlled trial (SALVO).
PG  - e1002471
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002471 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive haemorrhage at cesarean section requires donor (allogeneic)
      blood transfusion. Cell salvage may reduce this requirement. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We conducted a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (at 26 obstetric
      units; participants recruited from 4 June 2013 to 17 April 2016) of routine cell 
      salvage use (intervention) versus current standard of care without routine
      salvage use (control) in cesarean section among women at risk of haemorrhage.
      Randomisation was stratified, using random permuted blocks of variable sizes. In 
      an intention-to-treat analysis, we used multivariable models, adjusting for
      stratification variables and prognostic factors identified a priori, to compare
      rates of donor blood transfusion (primary outcome) and fetomaternal haemorrhage
      >/=2 ml in RhD-negative women with RhD-positive babies (a secondary outcome)
      between groups. Among 3,028 women randomised (2,990 analysed), 95.6% of 1,498
      assigned to intervention had cell salvage deployed (50.8% had salvaged blood
      returned; mean 259.9 ml) versus 3.9% of 1,492 assigned to control. Donor blood
      transfusion rate was 3.5% in the control group versus 2.5% in the intervention
      group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42 to 1.01, 
      p = 0.056; adjusted risk difference -1.03, 95% CI -2.13 to 0.06). In a planned
      subgroup analysis, the transfusion rate was 4.6% in women assigned to control
      versus 3.0% in the intervention group among emergency cesareans (adjusted OR
      0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99), whereas it was 2.2% versus 1.8% among elective
      cesareans (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.83) (interaction p = 0.46). No case
      of amniotic fluid embolism was observed. The rate of fetomaternal haemorrhage was
      higher with the intervention (10.5% in the control group versus 25.6% in the
      intervention group, adjusted OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.43 to 22.14, p = 0.013). We are
      unable to comment on long-term antibody sensitisation effects. CONCLUSIONS: The
      overall reduction observed in donor blood transfusion associated with the routine
      use of cell salvage during cesarean section was not statistically significant.

TI  - Estimated clinical impact of the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra cartridge for diagnosis of
      pulmonary tuberculosis: A modeling study.
PG  - e1002472
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002472 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay offers rapid and accurate diagnosis
      of tuberculosis (TB) but still suffers from imperfect sensitivity. The newer
      Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra cartridge has shown improved sensitivity in recent field
      trials, but at the expense of reduced specificity. The clinical implications of
      switching from the existing Xpert cartridge to the Xpert Ultra cartridge in
      different populations remain uncertain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a
      Markov microsimulation model of hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 individuals
      undergoing diagnostic sputum evaluation with Xpert for suspected pulmonary TB, in
      each of 3 emblematic settings: an HIV clinic in South Africa, a public TB center 
      in India, and an adult primary care setting in China. In each setting, we used
      existing data to project likely diagnostic results, treatment decisions, and
      ultimate clinical outcomes, assuming use of the standard Xpert versus Xpert Ultra
      cartridge. Our primary outcomes were the projected number of additional
      unnecessary treatments generated, the projected number of TB deaths averted, and 
      the projected number of unnecessary treatments generated per TB death averted, if
      standard Xpert were switched to Xpert Ultra. We also simulated alternative
      approaches to interpreting positive results of the Ultra cartridge's
      semi-quantitative trace call. Extensive sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were
      performed to evaluate the drivers and generalizability of projected results. In
      the Indian TB center setting, replacing the standard Xpert cartridge with the
      Xpert Ultra cartridge was projected to avert 0.5 TB deaths (95% uncertainty range
      [UR]: 0, 1.3) and generate 18 unnecessary treatments (95% UR: 10, 29) per 1,000
      individuals evaluated-resulting in a median ratio of 38 incremental unnecessary
      treatments added by Ultra per incremental death averted by Ultra compared to
      outcomes using standard Xpert (95% UR: 12, indefinite upper bound). In the South 
      African HIV care setting-where TB mortality rates are higher and Ultra's improved
      sensitivity has greater absolute benefit-this ratio improved to 7 unnecessary
      treatments per TB death averted (95% UR: 2, 43). By contrast, in the Chinese
      primary care setting, this ratio was much less favorable, at 372 unnecessary
      treatments per TB death averted (95% UR: 75, indefinite upper bound), although
      the projected number of unnecessary treatments using Xpert Ultra was lower (with 
      a possibility of no increased overtreatment) when using specificity data only
      from lower-burden settings. Alternative interpretations of the trace call had
      little effect on these ratios. Limitations include uncertainty in key parameters 
      (including the clinical implications of false-negative results), the exclusion of
      transmission effects, and restriction of this analysis to adult pulmonary TB.
      CONCLUSIONS: Switching from the standard Xpert cartridge to the Xpert Ultra
      cartridge for diagnosis of adult pulmonary TB may have different consequences in 
      different clinical settings. In settings with high TB and HIV prevalence, Xpert
      Ultra is likely to offer considerable mortality benefit, whereas in
      lower-prevalence settings, Xpert Ultra will likely result in considerable
      overtreatment unless the possibility of higher specificity of Ultra in
      lower-prevalence settings in confirmed. The ideal use of the Ultra cartridge may 
      therefore involve a more nuanced, setting-specific approach to implementation,
      with priority given to populations in which the anticipated prevalence of TB (and
      HIV) is the highest.

TI  - Association between infrastructure and observed quality of care in 4 healthcare
      services: A cross-sectional study of 4,300 facilities in 8 countries.
PG  - e1002464
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002464 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is increasingly apparent that access to healthcare without
      adequate quality of care is insufficient to improve population health outcomes.
      We assess whether the most commonly measured attribute of health facilities in
      low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)-the structural inputs to care-predicts
      the clinical quality of care provided to patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Service 
      Provision Assessments are nationally representative health facility surveys
      conducted by the Demographic and Health Survey Program with support from the US
      Agency for International Development. These surveys assess health system capacity
      in LMICs. We drew data from assessments conducted in 8 countries between 2007 and
      2015: Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. The
      surveys included an audit of facility infrastructure and direct observation of
      family planning, antenatal care (ANC), sick-child care, and (in 2 countries)
      labor and delivery. To measure structural inputs, we constructed indices that
      measured World Health Organization-recommended amenities, equipment, and
      medications in each service. For clinical quality, we used data from direct
      observations of care to calculate providers' adherence to evidence-based care
      guidelines. We assessed the correlation between these metrics and used spline
      models to test for the presence of a minimum input threshold associated with good
      clinical quality. Inclusion criteria were met by 32,531 observations of care in
      4,354 facilities. Facilities demonstrated moderate levels of infrastructure,
      ranging from 0.63 of 1 in sick-child care to 0.75 of 1 for family planning on
      average. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines was low, with an average of 37%
      adherence in sick-child care, 46% in family planning, 60% in labor and delivery, 
      and 61% in ANC. Correlation between infrastructure and evidence-based care was
      low (median 0.20, range from -0.03 for family planning in Senegal to 0.40 for ANC
      in Tanzania). Facilities with similar infrastructure scores delivered care of
      widely varying quality in each service. We did not detect a minimum level of
      infrastructure that was reliably associated with higher quality of care delivered
      in any service. These findings rely on cross-sectional data, preventing
      assessment of relationships between structural inputs and clinical quality over
      time; measurement error may attenuate the estimated associations. CONCLUSION:
      Inputs to care are poorly correlated with provision of evidence-based care in
      these 4 clinical services. Healthcare workers in well-equipped facilities often
      provided poor care and vice versa. While it is important to have strong
      infrastructure, it should not be used as a measure of quality. Insight into
      health system quality requires measurement of processes and outcomes of care.

TI  - Estimating the impact of antiretroviral treatment on adult mortality trends in
      South Africa: A mathematical modelling study.
PG  - e1002468
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002468 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substantial reductions in adult mortality have been observed in South
      Africa since the mid-2000s, but there has been no formal evaluation of how much
      of this decline is attributable to the scale-up of antiretroviral treatment
      (ART), as previous models have not been calibrated to vital registration data. We
      developed a deterministic mathematical model to simulate the mortality trends
      that would have been expected in the absence of ART, and with earlier
      introduction of ART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Model estimates of mortality rates in 
      ART patients were obtained from the International Epidemiology Databases to
      Evaluate AIDS-Southern Africa (IeDEA-SA) collaboration. The model was calibrated 
      to HIV prevalence data (1997-2013) and mortality data from the South African
      vital registration system (1997-2014), using a Bayesian approach. In the
      1985-2014 period, 2.70 million adult HIV-related deaths occurred in South Africa.
      Adult HIV deaths peaked at 231,000 per annum in 2006 and declined to 95,000 in
      2014, a reduction of 74.7% (95% CI: 73.3%-76.1%) compared to the scenario without
      ART. However, HIV mortality in 2014 was estimated to be 69% (95% CI: 46%-97%)
      higher in 2014 (161,000) if the model was calibrated only to HIV prevalence data.
      In the 2000-2014 period, the South African ART programme is estimated to have
      reduced the cumulative number of HIV deaths in adults by 1.72 million (95% CI:
      1.58 million-1.84 million) and to have saved 6.15 million life years in adults
      (95% CI: 5.52 million-6.69 million). This compares with a potential saving of
      8.80 million (95% CI: 7.90 million-9.59 million) life years that might have been 
      achieved if South Africa had moved swiftly to implement WHO guidelines
      (2004-2013) and had achieved high levels of ART uptake in HIV-diagnosed
      individuals from 2004 onwards. The model is limited by its reliance on all-cause 
      mortality data, given the lack of reliable cause-of-death reporting, and also
      does not allow for changes over time in tuberculosis control programmes and ART
      effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: ART has had a dramatic impact on adult mortality in
      South Africa, but delays in the rollout of ART, especially in the early stages of
      the ART programme, have contributed to substantial loss of life. This is the
      first study to our knowledge to calibrate a model of ART impact to
      population-level recorded death data in Africa; models that are not calibrated to
      population-level death data may overestimate HIV-related mortality.

TI  - Psychosocial and socioeconomic determinants of cardiovascular mortality in
      Eastern Europe: A multicentre prospective cohort study.
PG  - e1002459
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eastern European countries have some of the highest rates of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, much of which cannot be adequately
      accounted for by conventional CVD risk factors. Psychosocial and socioeconomic
      factors may affect risk of CVD, but relatively few studies on this issue have
      been undertaken in Eastern Europe. We investigated whether various psychosocial
      factors are associated with CVD mortality independently from each other and
      whether they can help explain differences in CVD mortality between Eastern
      European populations. METHODS: Participants were from the Health, Alcohol and
      Psychological factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) cohort study in Russia, Poland
      and the Czech Republic, including a total of 20,867 men and women aged 43-74
      years and free of CVD at baseline examination during 2002-2005. Participants were
      followed-up for CVD mortality after linkage to national mortality registries for 
      a median of 7.2 years. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 556 participants died from 
      CVD. After mutual adjustment, six psychosocial and socioeconomic factors were
      associated with increased risk of CVD death: unemployment, low material
      amenities, depression, being single, infrequent contacts with friends or
      relatives. The hazard ratios [HRs] for these six factors ranged between 1.26 [95%
      confidence interval 1.14-1.40] and 1.81 [95% confidence interval 1.24-2.64],
      fully adjusted for each other, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors.
      Population-attributable fractions ranged from 8% [4%-13%] to 22% [11%-31%] for
      each factor, when measured on average across the three cohorts. However, the
      prevalence of psychosocial and socioeconomic risk factors and their HRs were
      similar between the three countries. Altogether, these factors could not explain 
      why participants from Russia had higher CVD mortality when compared to
      participants from Poland/Czech Republic. Limitations of this study include
      measurement error that could lead to residual confounding; and the possibilities 
      for reverse causation and/or unmeasured confounding from observational studies to
      lead to associations that are not causal in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Six psychosocial
      and socioeconomic factors were associated with cardiovascular mortality,
      independent of each other. Differences in mortality between cohorts from Russia
      versus Poland or Check Republic remained unexplained.

TI  - Effects of women's groups practising participatory learning and action on
      preventive and care-seeking behaviours to reduce neonatal mortality: A
      meta-analysis of cluster-randomised trials.
PG  - e1002467
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends participatory learning and
      action (PLA) in women's groups to improve maternal and newborn health,
      particularly in rural settings with low access to health services. There have
      been calls to understand the pathways through which this community intervention
      may affect neonatal mortality. We examined the effect of women's groups on key
      antenatal, delivery, and postnatal behaviours in order to understand pathways to 
      mortality reduction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a meta-analysis using
      data from 7 cluster-randomised controlled trials that took place between 2001 and
      2012 in rural India (2 trials), urban India (1 trial), rural Bangladesh (2
      trials), rural Nepal (1 trial), and rural Malawi (1 trial), with the number of
      participants ranging between 6,125 and 29,901 live births. Behavioural outcomes
      included appropriate antenatal care, facility delivery, use of a safe delivery
      kit, hand washing by the birth attendant prior to delivery, use of a sterilised
      instrument to cut the umbilical cord, immediate wrapping of the newborn after
      delivery, delayed bathing of the newborn, early initiation of breastfeeding, and 
      exclusive breastfeeding. We used 2-stage meta-analysis techniques to estimate the
      effect of the women's group intervention on behavioural outcomes. In the first
      stage, we used random effects models with individual patient data to assess the
      effect of groups on outcomes separately for the different trials. In the second
      stage of the meta-analysis, random effects models were applied using
      summary-level estimates calculated in the first stage of the analysis. To
      determine whether behaviour change was related to group attendance, we used
      random effects models to assess associations between outcomes and the following
      categories of group attendance and allocation: women attending a group and
      allocated to the intervention arm; women not attending a group but allocated to
      the intervention arm; and women allocated to the control arm. Overall, women's
      groups practising PLA improved behaviours during and after home deliveries,
      including the use of safe delivery kits (odds ratio [OR] 2.92, 95% CI 2.02-4.22; 
      I2 = 63.7%, 95% CI 4.4%-86.2%), use of a sterile blade to cut the umbilical cord 
      (1.88, 1.25-2.82; 67.6%, 16.1%-87.5%), birth attendant washing hands prior to
      delivery (1.87, 1.19-2.95; 79%, 53.8%-90.4%), delayed bathing of the newborn for 
      at least 24 hours (1.47, 1.09-1.99; 68.0%, 29.2%-85.6%), and wrapping the newborn
      within 10 minutes of delivery (1.27, 1.02-1.60; 0.0%, 0%-79.2%). Effects were
      partly dependent on the proportion of pregnant women attending groups. We did not
      find evidence of effects on uptake of antenatal care (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.77-1.38; 
      I2 = 86.3%, 95% CI 73.8%-92.8%), facility delivery (1.02, 0.93-1.12; 21.4%,
      0%-65.8%), initiating breastfeeding within 1 hour (1.08, 0.85-1.39; 76.6%,
      50.9%-88.8%), or exclusive breastfeeding for 6 weeks after delivery (1.18,
      0.93-1.48; 72.9%, 37.8%-88.2%). The main limitation of our analysis is the high
      degree of heterogeneity for effects on most behaviours, possibly due to the
      limited number of trials involving women's groups and context-specific effects.
      CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that women's groups practising PLA
      improve key behaviours on the pathway to neonatal mortality, with the strongest
      evidence for home care behaviours and practices during home deliveries. A lack of
      consistency in improved behaviours across all trials may reflect differences in
      local priorities, capabilities, and the responsiveness of health services. Future
      research could address the mechanisms behind how PLA improves survival, in order 
      to adapt this method to improve maternal and newborn health in different
      contexts, as well as improve other outcomes across the continuum of care for
      women, children, and adolescents.

TI  - malERA: An updated research agenda for insecticide and drug resistance in malaria
      elimination and eradication.
PG  - e1002450
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002450 [doi]
AB  - Resistance to first-line treatments for Plasmodium falciparum malaria and the
      insecticides used for Anopheles vector control are threatening malaria
      elimination efforts. Suboptimal responses to drugs and insecticides are both
      spreading geographically and emerging independently and are being seen at
      increasing intensities. Whilst resistance is unavoidable, its effects can be
      mitigated through resistance management practices, such as exposing the parasite 
      or vector to more than one selective agent. Resistance contributed to the failure
      of the 20th century Global Malaria Eradication Programme, and yet the global
      response to this issue continues to be slow and poorly coordinated-too often, too
      little, too late. The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) Refresh
      process convened a panel on resistance of both insecticides and antimalarial
      drugs. This paper outlines developments in the field over the past 5 years,
      highlights gaps in knowledge, and proposes a research agenda focused on managing 
      resistance. A deeper understanding of the complex biological processes involved
      and how resistance is selected is needed, together with evidence of its public
      health impact. Resistance management will require improved use of entomological
      and parasitological data in decision making, and optimisation of the useful life 
      of new and existing products through careful implementation, combination, and
      evaluation. A proactive, collaborative approach is needed from basic science and 
      the development of new tools to programme and policy interventions that will
      ensure that the armamentarium of drugs and insecticides is sufficient to deal
      with the challenges of malaria control and its elimination.

AB  - Achieving a malaria-free world presents exciting scientific challenges as well as
      overwhelming health, equity, and economic benefits. WHO and countries are setting
      ambitious goals for reducing the burden and eliminating malaria through the
      "Global Technical Strategy" and 21 countries are aiming to eliminate malaria by
      2020. The commitment to achieve these targets should be celebrated. However, the 
      need for innovation to achieve these goals, sustain elimination, and free the
      world of malaria is greater than ever. Over 180 experts across multiple
      disciplines are engaged in the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA)
      Refresh process to address problems that need to be solved. The result is a
      research and development agenda to accelerate malaria elimination and, in the
      longer term, transform the malaria community's ability to eradicate it globally.

      malaria elimination and eradication.

AB  - This paper summarises key advances and priorities since the 2011 presentation of 
      the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA), with a focus on the
      combinations of intervention tools and strategies for elimination and their
      evaluation using modelling approaches. With an increasing number of countries
      embarking on malaria elimination programmes, national and local decisions to
      select combinations of tools and deployment strategies directed at malaria
      elimination must address rapidly changing transmission patterns across diverse
      geographic areas. However, not all of these approaches can be systematically
      evaluated in the field. Thus, there is potential for modelling to investigate
      appropriate 'packages' of combined interventions that include various forms of
      vector control, case management, surveillance, and population-based approaches
      for different settings, particularly at lower transmission levels. Modelling can 
      help prioritise which intervention packages should be tested in field studies,
      suggest which intervention package should be used at a particular level or
      stratum of transmission intensity, estimate the risk of resurgence when scaling
      down specific interventions after local transmission is interrupted, and evaluate
      the risk and impact of parasite drug resistance and vector insecticide
      resistance. However, modelling intervention package deployment against a
      heterogeneous transmission background is a challenge. Further validation of
      malaria models should be pursued through an iterative process, whereby field data
      collected with the deployment of intervention packages is used to refine models
      and make them progressively more relevant for assessing and predicting
      elimination outcomes.

TI  - malERA: An updated research agenda for diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, and vector
      control in malaria elimination and eradication.

AB  - Since the turn of the century, a remarkable expansion has been achieved in the
      range and effectiveness of products and strategies available to prevent, treat,
      and control malaria, including advances in diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, and
      vector control. These advances have once again put malaria elimination on the
      agenda. However, it is clear that even with the means available today, malaria
      control and elimination pose a formidable challenge in many settings. Thus,
      currently available resources must be used more effectively, and new products and
      approaches likely to achieve these goals must be developed. This paper considers 
      tools (both those available and others that may be required) to achieve and
      maintain malaria elimination. New diagnostics are needed to direct treatment and 
      detect transmission potential; new drugs and vaccines to overcome existing
      resistance and protect against clinical and severe disease, as well as block
      transmission and prevent relapses; and new vector control measures to overcome
      insecticide resistance and more powerfully interrupt transmission. It is also
      essential that strategies for combining new and existing approaches are developed
      for different settings to maximise their longevity and effectiveness in areas
      with continuing transmission and receptivity. For areas where local elimination
      has been recently achieved, understanding which measures are needed to maintain
      elimination is necessary to prevent rebound and the reestablishment of
      transmission. This becomes increasingly important as more countries move towards 
      elimination.

AB  - Health systems underpin disease elimination and eradication programmes. In an
      elimination and eradication context, innovative research approaches are needed
      across health systems to assess readiness for programme reorientation, mitigate
      any decreases in effectiveness of interventions ('effectiveness decay'), and
      respond to dynamic and changing needs. The malaria eradication research agenda
      (malERA) Refresh consultative process for the Panel on Health Systems and Policy 
      Research identifies opportunities to build health systems evidence and the tools 
      needed to eliminate malaria from different zones, countries, and regions and to
      eradicate it globally. The research questions are organised as a portfolio that
      global health practitioners, researchers, and funders can identify with and
      support. This supports the promotion of an actionable and more cohesive approach 
      to building the evidence base for scaled-up implementation of findings. Gaps and 
      opportunities discussed in the paper include delivery strategies to meet the
      changing dynamics of needs of individuals, environments, and malaria programme
      successes; mechanisms and approaches to best support accelerated policy and
      financial responsiveness at national and global level to ensure timely response
      to evidence and needs, including in crisis situations; and systems' readiness
      tools and decision-support systems.

TI  - malERA: An updated research agenda for characterising the reservoir and measuring
      transmission in malaria elimination and eradication.
PG  - e1002452
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002452 [doi]
AB  - This paper summarises key advances in defining the infectious reservoir for
      malaria and the measurement of transmission for research and programmatic use
      since the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) publication in 2011. Rapid
      and effective progress towards elimination requires an improved understanding of 
      the sources of transmission as well as those at risk of infection. Characterising
      the transmission reservoir in different settings will enable the most appropriate
      choice, delivery, and evaluation of interventions. Since 2011, progress has been 
      made in a number of areas. The extent of submicroscopic and asymptomatic
      infections is better understood, as are the biological parameters governing
      transmission of sexual stage parasites. Limitations of existing transmission
      measures have been documented, and proof-of-concept has been established for new 
      innovative serological and molecular methods to better characterise transmission.
      Finally, there now exists a concerted effort towards the use of ensemble datasets
      across the spectrum of metrics, from passive and active sources, to develop more 
      accurate risk maps of transmission. These can be used to better target
      interventions and effectively monitor progress toward elimination. The success of
      interventions depends not only on the level of endemicity but also on how rapidly
      or recently an area has undergone changes in transmission. Improved understanding
      of the biology of mosquito-human and human-mosquito transmission is needed
      particularly in low-endemic settings, where heterogeneity of infection is
      pronounced and local vector ecology is variable. New and improved measures of
      transmission need to be operationally feasible for the malaria programmes.
      Outputs from these research priorities should allow the development of a set of
      approaches (applicable to both research and control programmes) that address the 
      unique challenges of measuring and monitoring transmission in near-elimination
      settings and defining the absence of transmission.

AB  - Basic science holds enormous power for revealing the biological mechanisms of
      disease and, in turn, paving the way toward new, effective interventions.
      Recognizing this power, the 2011 Research Agenda for Malaria Eradication included
      key priorities in fundamental research that, if attained, could help accelerate
      progress toward disease elimination and eradication. The Malaria Eradication
      Research Agenda (malERA) Consultative Panel on Basic Science and Enabling
      Technologies reviewed the progress, continuing challenges, and major
      opportunities for future research. The recommendations come from a literature of 
      published and unpublished materials and the deliberations of the malERA Refresh
      Consultative Panel. These areas span multiple aspects of the Plasmodium life
      cycle in both the human host and the Anopheles vector and include critical,
      unanswered questions about parasite transmission, human infection in the liver,
      asexual-stage biology, and malaria persistence. We believe an integrated approach

TI  - Treatment eligibility and retention in clinical HIV care: A regression
      discontinuity study in South Africa.
PG  - e1002463
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss to follow-up is high among HIV patients not yet receiving
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical
      efficacy of early ART; however, these trials may miss an important real-world
      consequence of providing ART at diagnosis: its impact on retention in care.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined the effect of immediate (versus deferred) ART
      on retention in care using a regression discontinuity design. The analysis
      included all patients (N = 11,306) entering clinical HIV care with a first CD4
      count between 12 August 2011 and 31 December 2012 in a public-sector HIV care and
      treatment program in rural South Africa. Patients were assigned to immediate
      versus deferred ART eligibility, as determined by a CD4 count < 350 cells/mul,
      per South African national guidelines. Patients referred to pre-ART care were
      instructed to return every 6 months for CD4 monitoring. Patients initiated on ART
      were instructed to return at 6 and 12 months post-initiation and annually
      thereafter for CD4 and viral load monitoring. We assessed retention in HIV care
      at 12 months, as measured by the presence of a clinic visit, lab test, or ART
      initiation 6 to 18 months after initial CD4 test. Differences in retention
      between patients presenting with CD4 counts just above versus just below the
      350-cells/mul threshold were estimated using local linear regression models with 
      a data-driven bandwidth and with the algorithm for selecting the bandwidth chosen
      ex ante. Among patients with CD4 counts close to the 350-cells/mul threshold,
      having an ART-eligible CD4 count (<350 cells/mul) was associated with higher
      12-month retention than not having an ART-eligible CD4 count (50% versus 32%), an
      intention-to-treat risk difference of 18 percentage points (95% CI 11 to 23; p < 
      0.001). The decision to start ART was determined by CD4 count for one in four
      patients (25%) presenting close to the eligibility threshold (95% CI 20% to 31%; 
      p < 0.001). In this subpopulation, having an ART-eligible CD4 count was
      associated with higher 12-month retention than not having an ART-eligible CD4
      count (91% versus 21%), a complier causal risk difference of 70 percentage points
      (95% CI 42 to 98; p < 0.001). The major limitations of the study are the
      potential for limited generalizability, the potential for outcome
      misclassification, and the absence of data on longer-term health outcomes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were eligible for immediate ART had dramatically higher
      retention in HIV care than patients who just missed the CD4-count eligibility
      cutoff. The clinical and population health benefits of offering immediate ART
      regardless of CD4 count may be larger than suggested by clinical trials.

TI  - Respondent-driven sampling for identification of HIV- and HCV-infected people who
      inject drugs and men who have sex with men in India: A cross-sectional,
      community-based analysis.
PG  - e1002460
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002460 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major barrier to achieving ambitious targets for global control of 
      HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is low levels of awareness of infection among key
      populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs
      (PWID). We explored the potential of a strategy routinely used for surveillance
      in these groups, respondent-driven sampling (RDS), to be used as an intervention 
      to identify HIV- and HCV-infected PWID and MSM who are unaware of their status
      and those who are viremic across 26 Indian cities at various epidemic stages.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected as part of the baseline assessment of
      an ongoing cluster-randomized trial. RDS was used to accrue participants at 27
      sites (15 PWID sites and 12 MSM sites) selected to reflect varying stages of the 
      HIV epidemic among MSM and PWID in India. A total of 56 seeds recruited a sample 
      of 26,447 persons (approximately 1,000 participants per site) between October 1, 
      2012, and December 19, 2013. Across MSM sites (n = 11,997), the median age was 25
      years and the median number of lifetime male partners was 8. Across PWID sites (n
      = 14,450), 92.4% were male, the median age was 30 years, and 87.5% reported
      injection in the prior 6 months. RDS identified 4,051 HIV-infected persons, of
      whom 2,325 (57.4%) were unaware of their HIV infection and 2,816 (69.5%) were HIV
      viremic. It also identified 5,777 HCV-infected persons, of whom 5,337 (92.4%)
      were unaware that they were infected with HCV and 4,728 (81.8%) were viremic. In 
      the overall sample (both MSM and PWID), the prevalence of HIV-infected persons
      who were unaware of their status increased with sampling depth, from 7.9% in
      participants recruited in waves 1 through 5 to 12.8% among those recruited in
      waves 26 and above (p-value for trend < 0.001). The overall detection rate of
      people unaware of their HIV infection was 0.5 persons per day, and the detection 
      rate of HIV-infected persons with viremia (regardless of their awareness status) 
      was 0.7 per day. The detection rate of HIV viremic individuals was positively
      associated with underlying HIV prevalence and the prevalence of HIV viremia
      (linear regression coefficient per 1-percentage-point increase in prevalence:
      0.05 and 0.07, respectively). The median detection rate of PWID who were unaware 
      of their HCV infection was 2.5 per day. The cost of identifying 1 unaware
      HIV-infected individual ranged from US$51 to US$2,072 across PWID sites and from 
      US$189 to US$5,367 across MSM sites. The mean additional cost of identifying 1
      unaware HCV-infected PWID was US$13 (site range: US$7-US$140). Limitations of the
      study include the exclusivity of study sites to India, lack of prior HIV/HCV
      diagnosis confirmation with clinic records, and lack of cost data from other
      case-finding approaches commonly used in India. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, RDS
      was able to rapidly identify at nominal cost a substantial number of unaware and 
      viremic HIV-infected and HCV-infected individuals who were currently not being
      reached by existing programs and who were at high risk for transmission.
      Combining RDS (or other network-driven recruitment approaches) with strategies
      focused on linkage to care, particularly in high-burden settings, may be a viable
      option for achieving the 90-90-90 targets in key populations in resource-limited 
      settings.

TI  - Direct provision versus facility collection of HIV self-tests among female sex
      workers in Uganda: A cluster-randomized controlled health systems trial.
PG  - e1002458
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002458 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV self-testing allows HIV testing at any place and time and without
      health workers. HIV self-testing may thus be particularly useful for female sex
      workers (FSWs), who should test frequently but face stigma and financial and time
      barriers when accessing healthcare facilities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted
      a cluster-randomized controlled health systems trial among FSWs in Kampala,
      Uganda, to measure the effect of 2 HIV self-testing delivery models on HIV
      testing and linkage to care outcomes. FSW peer educator groups (1 peer educator
      and 8 participants) were randomized to either (1) direct provision of HIV
      self-tests, (2) provision of coupons for free collection of HIV self-tests in a
      healthcare facility, or (3) standard of care HIV testing. We randomized 960
      participants in 120 peer educator groups from October 18, 2016, to November 16,
      2016. Participants' median age was 28 years (IQR 24-32). Our prespecified primary
      outcomes were self-report of any HIV testing at 1 month and at 4 months; our
      prespecified secondary outcomes were self-report of HIV self-test use, seeking
      HIV-related medical care and ART initiation. In addition, we analyzed 2 secondary
      outcomes that were not prespecified: self-report of repeat HIV testing-to
      understand the intervention effects on frequent testing-and self-reported
      facility-based testing-to quantify substitution effects. Participants in the
      direct provision arm were significantly more likely to have tested for HIV than
      those in the standard of care arm, both at 1 month (risk ratio [RR] 1.33, 95% CI 
      1.17-1.51, p < 0.001) and at 4 months (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.22, p < 0.001).
      Participants in the direct provision arm were also significantly more likely to
      have tested for HIV than those in the facility collection arm, both at 1 month
      (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.31, p = 0.001) and at 4 months (RR 1.03, 95% CI
      1.01-1.05, p = 0.02). At 1 month, fewer participants in the intervention arms had
      sought medical care for HIV than in the standard of care arm, but these
      differences were not significant and were reduced in magnitude at 4 months. There
      were no statistically significant differences in ART initiation across study
      arms. At 4 months, participants in the direct provision arm were significantly
      more likely to have tested twice for HIV than those in the standard of care arm
      (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.29-1.77, p < 0.001) and those in the facility collection arm
      (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.37, p = 0.001). Participants in the HIV self-testing arms
      almost completely replaced facility-based testing with self-testing. Two adverse 
      events related to HIV self-testing were reported: interpersonal violence and
      mental distress. Study limitations included self-reported outcomes and limited
      generalizability beyond FSWs in similar settings. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, HIV
      self-testing appeared to be safe and increased recent and repeat HIV testing
      among FSWs. We found that direct provision of HIV self-tests was significantly
      more effective in increasing HIV testing among FSWs than passively offering HIV
      self-tests for collection in healthcare facilities. HIV self-testing could play
      an important role in supporting HIV interventions that require frequent HIV
      testing, such as HIV treatment as prevention, behavior change for transmission
      reduction, and pre-exposure prophylaxis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Extensive virologic and immunologic characterization in an HIV-infected
      individual following allogeneic stem cell transplant and analytic cessation of
      antiretroviral therapy: A case study.
PG  - e1002461
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002461 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Notwithstanding 1 documented case of HIV-1 cure following allogeneic 
      stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), several subsequent cases of allo-SCT in
      HIV-1 positive individuals have failed to cure HIV-1 infection. The aim of our
      study was to describe changes in the HIV reservoir in a single chronically
      HIV-infected patient on suppressive antiretroviral therapy who underwent allo-SCT
      for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      prospectively collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by
      leukapheresis from a 55-year-old man with chronic HIV infection before and after 
      allo-SCT to measure the size of the HIV-1 reservoir and characterize viral
      phylogeny and phenotypic changes in immune cells. At day 784 post-transplant,
      when HIV-1 was undetectable by multiple measures-including PCR measurements of
      both total and integrated HIV-1 DNA, replication-competent virus measurement by
      large cell input quantitative viral outgrowth assay, and in situ hybridization of
      colon tissue-the patient consented to an analytic treatment interruption (ATI)
      with frequent clinical monitoring. He remained aviremic off antiretroviral
      therapy until ATI day 288, when a low-level virus rebound of 60 HIV-1 copies/ml
      occurred, which increased to 1,640 HIV-1 copies/ml 5 days later, prompting
      reinitiation of ART. Rebounding plasma HIV-1 sequences were phylogenetically
      distinct from proviral HIV-1 DNA detected in circulating PBMCs before
      transplantation. The main limitations of this study are the insensitivity of
      reservoir measurements, and the fact that it describes a single case.
      CONCLUSIONS: allo-SCT led to a significant reduction in the size of the HIV-1
      reservoir and a >9-month-long ART-free remission from HIV-1 replication.
      Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the origin of rebound virus was distinct from 
      the viruses identified pre-transplant in the PBMCs.

TI  - The value of confirmatory testing in early infant HIV diagnosis programmes in
      South Africa: A cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - e1002446
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002446 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The specificity of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) used for 
      early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV infection is <100%, leading some
      HIV-uninfected infants to be incorrectly identified as HIV-infected. The World
      Health Organization recommends that infants undergo a second NAAT to confirm any 
      positive test result, but implementation is limited. Our objective was to
      determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of confirmatory HIV testing for EID
      programmes in South Africa. METHOD AND FINDINGS: Using the Cost-effectiveness of 
      Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)-Pediatric model, we simulated EID testing
      at age 6 weeks for HIV-exposed infants without and with confirmatory testing. We 
      assumed a NAAT cost of US$25, NAAT specificity of 99.6%, NAAT sensitivity of 100%
      for infants infected in pregnancy or at least 4 weeks prior to testing, and a
      mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate at 12 months of 4.9%; we simulated
      guideline-concordant rates of testing uptake, result return, and antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) initiation (100%). After diagnosis, infants were linked to and
      retained in care for 10 years (false-positive) or lifelong (true-positive). All
      parameters were varied widely in sensitivity analyses. Outcomes included number
      of infants with false-positive diagnoses linked to ART per 1,000 ART initiations,
      life expectancy (LE, in years) and per-person lifetime HIV-related healthcare
      costs. Both without and with confirmatory testing, LE was 26.2 years for
      HIV-infected infants and 61.4 years for all HIV-exposed infants; clinical
      outcomes for truly infected infants did not differ by strategy. Without
      confirmatory testing, 128/1,000 ART initiations were false-positive diagnoses;
      with confirmatory testing, 1/1,000 ART initiations were false-positive diagnoses.
      Because confirmatory testing averted costly HIV care and ART in truly
      HIV-uninfected infants, it was cost-saving: total cost US$1,790/infant tested,
      compared to US$1,830/infant tested without confirmatory testing. Confirmatory
      testing remained cost-saving unless NAAT cost exceeded US$400 or the
      HIV-uninfected status of infants incorrectly identified as infected was
      ascertained and ART stopped within 3 months of starting. Limitations include
      uncertainty in the data used in the model, which we examined with sensitivity and
      uncertainty analyses. We also excluded clinical harms to HIV-uninfected infants
      incorrectly treated with ART after false-positive diagnosis (e.g., medication
      toxicities); including these outcomes would further increase the value of
      confirmatory testing. CONCLUSIONS: Without confirmatory testing, in settings with
      MTCT rates similar to that of South Africa, more than 10% of infants who initiate
      ART may reflect false-positive diagnoses. Confirmatory testing prevents
      inappropriate HIV diagnosis, is cost-saving, and should be adopted in all EID
      programmes.

TI  - HIV self-testing among female sex workers in Zambia: A cluster randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - e1002442
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002442 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV self-testing (HIVST) may play a role in addressing gaps in HIV
      testing coverage and as an entry point for HIV prevention services. We conducted 
      a cluster randomized trial of 2 HIVST distribution mechanisms compared to the
      standard of care among female sex workers (FSWs) in Zambia. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Trained peer educators in Kapiri Mposhi, Chirundu, and Livingstone, Zambia, each 
      recruited 6 FSW participants. Peer educator-FSW groups were randomized to 1 of 3 
      arms: (1) delivery (direct distribution of an oral HIVST from the peer educator),
      (2) coupon (a coupon for collection of an oral HIVST from a health
      clinic/pharmacy), or (3) standard-of-care HIV testing. Participants in the 2
      HIVST arms received 2 kits: 1 at baseline and 1 at 10 weeks. The primary outcome 
      was any self-reported HIV testing in the past month at the 1- and 4-month visits,
      as HIVST can replace other types of HIV testing. Secondary outcomes included
      linkage to care, HIVST use in the HIVST arms, and adverse events. Participants
      completed questionnaires at 1 and 4 months following peer educator interventions.
      In all, 965 participants were enrolled between September 16 and October 12, 2016 
      (delivery, N = 316; coupon, N = 329; standard of care, N = 320); 20% had never
      tested for HIV. Overall HIV testing at 1 month was 94.9% in the delivery arm,
      84.4% in the coupon arm, and 88.5% in the standard-of-care arm (delivery versus
      standard of care risk ratio [RR] = 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, P = 0.10; coupon
      versus standard of care RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.05, P = 0.29; delivery versus
      coupon RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22, P = 0.005). Four-month rates were 84.1% for
      the delivery arm, 79.8% for the coupon arm, and 75.1% for the standard-of-care
      arm (delivery versus standard of care RR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.98-1.27, P = 0.11;
      coupon versus standard of care RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.92-1.22, P = 0.42; delivery
      versus coupon RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.94-1.18, P = 0.40). At 1 month, the majority of
      HIV tests were self-tests (88.4%). HIV self-test use was higher in the delivery
      arm compared to the coupon arm (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.23, P = 0.001) at 1
      month, but there was no difference at 4 months. Among participants reporting a
      positive HIV test at 1 (N = 144) and 4 months (N = 235), linkage to care was
      non-significantly lower in the 2 HIVST arms compared to the standard-of-care arm.
      There were 4 instances of intimate partner violence related to study
      participation, 3 of which were related to HIV self-test use. Limitations include 
      the self-reported nature of study outcomes and overall high uptake of HIV
      testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this study among FSWs in Zambia, we found that HIVST was
      acceptable and accessible. However, HIVST may not substantially increase HIV
      cascade progression in contexts where overall testing and linkage are already
      high. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02827240.

TI  - The US President's Malaria Initiative, Plasmodium falciparum transmission and
      mortality: A modelling study.
PG  - e1002448
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002448 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although significant progress has been made in reducing malaria
      transmission globally in recent years, a large number of people remain at risk
      and hence the gains made are fragile. Funding lags well behind amounts needed to 
      protect all those at risk and ongoing contributions from major donors, such as
      the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), are vital to maintain progress and
      pursue further reductions in burden. We use a mathematical modelling approach to 
      estimate the impact of PMI investments to date in reducing malaria burden and to 
      explore the potential negative impact on malaria burden should a proposed 44%
      reduction in PMI funding occur. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We combined an established 
      mathematical model of Plasmodium falciparum transmission dynamics with
      epidemiological, intervention, and PMI-financing data to estimate the
      contribution PMI has made to malaria control via funding for long-lasting
      insecticide treated nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and artemisinin
      combination therapies (ACTs). We estimate that PMI has prevented 185 million (95%
      CrI: 138 million, 230 million) malaria cases and saved 940,049 (95% CrI: 545,228,
      1.4 million) lives since 2005. If funding is maintained, PMI-funded interventions
      are estimated to avert a further 162 million (95% CrI: 116 million, 194 million) 
      cases, saving a further 692,589 (95% CrI: 392,694, 955,653) lives between 2017
      and 2020. With an estimate of US$94 (95% CrI: US$51, US$166) per Disability
      Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted, PMI-funded interventions are highly
      cost-effective. We also demonstrate the further impact of this investment by
      reducing caseloads on health systems. If a 44% reduction in PMI funding were to
      occur, we predict that this loss of direct aid could result in an additional 67
      million (95% CrI: 49 million, 82 million) cases and 290,649 (95% CrI: 167,208,
      395,263) deaths between 2017 and 2020. We have not modelled indirect impacts of
      PMI funding (such as health systems strengthening) in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our model estimates that PMI has played a significant role in reducing malaria
      cases and deaths since its inception. Reductions in funding to PMI could lead to 
      large increases in the number of malaria cases and deaths, damaging global goals 
      of malaria control and elimination.

TI  - HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and early antiretroviral treatment among female sex 
      workers in South Africa: Results from a prospective observational demonstration
      project.
PG  - e1002444
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002444 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Operational research is required to design delivery of pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) and early antiretroviral treatment (ART). This paper presents 
      the primary analysis of programmatic data, as well as demographic, behavioural,
      and clinical data, from the TAPS Demonstration Project, which offered both
      interventions to female sex workers (FSWs) at 2 urban clinic sites in South
      Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The TAPS study was conducted between 30 March 2015 
      and 30 June 2017, with the enrolment period ending on 31 July 2016. TAPS was a
      prospective observational cohort study with 2 groups receiving interventions
      delivered in existing service settings: (1) PrEP as part of combination
      prevention for HIV-negative FSWs and (2) early ART for HIV-positive FSWs. The
      main outcome was programme retention at 12 months of follow-up. Of the 947 FSWs
      initially seen in clinic, 692 were HIV tested. HIV prevalence was 49%. Among
      those returning to clinic after HIV testing and clinical screening, 93% of the
      women who were HIV-negative were confirmed as clinically eligible for PrEP (n =
      224/241), and 41% (n = 110/270) of the women who were HIV-positive had CD4 counts
      within National Department of Health ART initiation guidelines at assessment. Of 
      the remaining women who were HIV-positive, 93% were eligible for early ART (n =
      148/160). From those eligible, 98% (n = 219/224) and 94% (n = 139/148) took up
      PrEP and early ART, respectively. At baseline, a substantial fraction of women
      had a steady partner, worked in brothels, and were born in Zimbabwe. Of those
      enrolled, 22% on PrEP (n = 49/219) and 60% on early ART (n = 83/139) were seen at
      12 months; we observed high rates of loss to follow-up: 71% (n = 156/219) and 30%
      (n = 42/139) in the PrEP and early ART groups, respectively. Little change over
      time was reported in consistent condom use or the number of sexual partners in
      the last 7 days, with high levels of consistent condom use with clients and low
      use with steady partners in both study groups. There were no seroconversions on
      PrEP and 7 virological failures on early ART among women remaining in the study. 
      Reported adherence to PrEP varied over time between 70% and 85%, whereas over 90%
      of participants reported taking pills daily while on early ART. Data on
      provider-side costs were also collected and analysed. The total cost of service
      delivery was approximately US$126 for PrEP and US$406 for early ART per
      person-year. The main limitations of this study include the lack of a control
      group, which was not included due to ethical considerations; clinical study
      requirements imposed when PrEP was not approved through the regulatory system,
      which could have affected uptake; and the timing of the implementation of a
      national sex worker HIV programme, which could have also affected uptake and
      retention. CONCLUSIONS: PrEP and early ART services can be implemented within FSW
      routine services in high prevalence, urban settings. We observed good uptake for 
      both PrEP and early ART; however, retention rates for PrEP were low. Retention
      rates for early ART were similar to retention rates for the current standard of
      care. While the cost of the interventions was higher than previously published,
      there is potential for cost reduction at scale. The TAPS Demonstration Project
      results provided the basis for the first government PrEP and early ART guidelines
      and the rollout of the national sex worker HIV programme in South Africa.

TI  - Lansoprazole use and tuberculosis incidence in the United Kingdom Clinical
      Practice Research Datalink: A population based cohort.
PG  - e1002457
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent in vitro and animal studies have found the proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) lansoprazole to be highly active against Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis. Omeprazole and pantoprazole have no activity. There is no evidence 
      that, in clinical practice, lansoprazole can treat or prevent incident
      tuberculosis (TB) disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied a cohort of new users
      of lansoprazole, omeprazole, or pantoprazole from the United Kingdom Clinical
      Practice Research Datalink to determine whether lansoprazole users have a lower
      incidence of TB disease than omeprazole or pantoprazole users. Negative control
      outcomes of myocardial infarction (MI) and herpes zoster were also studied.
      Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for
      potential confounding by a wide range of factors. We identified 527,364
      lansoprazole initiators and 923,500 omeprazole or pantoprazole initiators.
      Lansoprazole users had a lower rate of TB disease (n = 86; 10.0 cases per 100,000
      person years; 95% confidence interval 8.1-12.4) than omeprazole or pantoprazole
      users (n = 193; 15.3 cases per 100,000 person years; 95% confidence interval
      13.3-17.7), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68 (0.52-0.89). No
      association was found with MI (adjusted HR 1.04; 95% confidence interval
      1.00-1.08) or herpes zoster (adjusted HR 1.03; 95% confidence interval
      1.00-1.06). Limitations of this study are that we could not determine whether TB 
      disease was due to reactivation of latent infection or a result of recent
      transmission, nor could we determine whether lansoprazole would have a beneficial
      effect if given to people presenting with TB disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this study,
      use of the commonly prescribed and cheaply available PPI lansoprazole was
      associated with reduced incidence of TB disease. Given the serious problem of
      drug resistance and the adverse side effect profiles of many TB drugs, further
      investigation of lansoprazole as a potential antituberculosis agent is warranted.

TI  - Postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of stroke: A pooled analysis of data from
      population-based cohort studies.
PG  - e1002445
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research indicates a favourable influence of postmenopausal
      hormone therapy (HT) if initiated early, but not late, on subclinical
      atherosclerosis. However, the clinical relevance of timing of HT initiation for
      hard end points such as stroke remains to be determined. Further, no previous
      research has considered the timing of initiation of HT in relation to
      haemorrhagic stroke risk. The importance of the route of administration, type,
      active ingredient, and duration of HT for stroke risk is also unclear. We aimed
      to assess the association between HT and risk of stroke, considering the timing
      of initiation, route of administration, type, active ingredient, and duration of 
      HT. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data on HT use reported by the participants in 5
      population-based Swedish cohort studies, with baseline investigations performed
      during the period 1987-2002, were combined in this observational study. In total,
      88,914 postmenopausal women who reported data on HT use and had no previous
      cardiovascular disease diagnosis were included. Incident events of stroke
      (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or unspecified) and haemorrhagic stroke were identified
      from national population registers. Laplace regression was employed to assess
      crude and multivariable-adjusted associations between HT and stroke risk by
      estimating percentile differences (PDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 
      fifth and first PDs were calculated for stroke and haemorrhagic stroke,
      respectively. Crude models were adjusted for age at baseline only. The final
      adjusted models included age at baseline, level of education, smoking status,
      body mass index, level of physical activity, and age at menopause onset.
      Additional variables evaluated for potential confounding were type of menopause, 
      parity, use of oral contraceptives, alcohol consumption, hypertension,
      dyslipidaemia, diabetes, family history of cardiovascular disease, and cohort.
      During a median follow-up of 14.3 years, 6,371 first-time stroke events were
      recorded; of these, 1,080 were haemorrhagic. Following multivariable adjustment, 
      early initiation (<5 years since menopause onset) of HT was associated with a
      longer stroke-free period than never use (fifth PD, 1.00 years; 95% CI 0.42 to
      1.57), but there was no significant extension to the time period free of
      haemorrhagic stroke (first PD, 1.52 years; 95% CI -0.32 to 3.37). When
      considering timing as a continuous variable, the stroke-free and the haemorrhagic
      stroke-free periods were maximal if HT was initiated approximately 0-5 years from
      the onset of menopause. If single conjugated equine oestrogen HT was used, late
      initiation of HT was associated with a shorter stroke-free (fifth PD, -4.41
      years; 95% CI -7.14 to -1.68) and haemorrhagic stroke-free (first PD, -9.51
      years; 95% CI -12.77 to -6.24) period than never use. Combined HT when initiated 
      late was significantly associated with a shorter haemorrhagic stroke-free period 
      (first PD, -1.97 years; 95% CI -3.81 to -0.13), but not with a shorter
      stroke-free period (fifth PD, -1.21 years; 95% CI -3.11 to 0.68) than never use. 
      Given the observational nature of this study, the possibility of uncontrolled
      confounding cannot be excluded. Further, immortal time bias, also related to the 
      observational design, cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: When initiated early in
      relation to menopause onset, HT was not associated with increased risk of
      incident stroke, regardless of the route of administration, type of HT, active
      ingredient, and duration. Generally, these findings held also for haemorrhagic
      stroke. Our results suggest that the initiation of HT 0-5 years after menopause
      onset, as compared to never use, is associated with a decreased risk of stroke
      and haemorrhagic stroke. Late initiation was associated with elevated risks of
      stroke and haemorrhagic stroke when conjugated equine oestrogen was used as
      single therapy. Late initiation of combined HT was associated with haemorrhagic
      stroke risk.

TI  - Core Outcome Set-STAndards for Development: The COS-STAD recommendations.
PG  - e1002447
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002447 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of core outcome sets (COS) ensures that researchers measure
      and report those outcomes that are most likely to be relevant to users of their
      research. Several hundred COS projects have been systematically identified to
      date, but there has been no formal quality assessment of these studies. The Core 
      Outcome Set-STAndards for Development (COS-STAD) project aimed to identify
      minimum standards for the design of a COS study agreed upon by an international
      group, while other specific guidance exists for the final reporting of COS
      development studies (Core Outcome Set-STAndards for Reporting [COS-STAR]).
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: An international group of experienced COS developers,
      methodologists, journal editors, potential users of COS (clinical trialists,
      systematic reviewers, and clinical guideline developers), and patient
      representatives produced the COS-STAD recommendations to help improve the quality
      of COS development and support the assessment of whether a COS had been developed
      using a reasonable approach. An open survey of experts generated an initial list 
      of items, which was refined by a 2-round Delphi survey involving nearly 250
      participants representing key stakeholder groups. Participants assigned
      importance ratings for each item using a 1-9 scale. Consensus that an item should
      be included in the set of minimum standards was defined as at least 70% of the
      voting participants from each stakeholder group providing a score between 7 and
      9. The Delphi survey was followed by a consensus discussion with the study
      management group representing multiple stakeholder groups. COS-STAD contains 11
      minimum standards that are the minimum design recommendations for all COS
      development projects. The recommendations focus on 3 key domains: the scope, the 
      stakeholders, and the consensus process. CONCLUSIONS: The COS-STAD project has
      established 11 minimum standards to be followed by COS developers when planning
      their projects and by users when deciding whether a COS has been developed using 
      reasonable methods.

TI  - Safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunological activities of multiple intravenous or
      subcutaneous doses of an anti-HIV monoclonal antibody, VRC01, administered to
      HIV-uninfected adults: Results of a phase 1 randomized trial.
PG  - e1002435
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002435 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: VRC01 is an HIV-1 CD4 binding site broadly neutralizing antibody
      (bnAb) that is active against a broad range of HIV-1 primary isolates in vitro
      and protects against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) when delivered
      parenterally to nonhuman primates. It has been shown to be safe and well
      tolerated after short-term administration in humans; however, its clinical and
      functional activity after longer-term administration has not been previously
      assessed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 104 was
      designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VRC01
      administered either subcutaneously or by intravenous (IV) infusion and to assess 
      the pharmacokinetics and in vitro immunologic activity of the different dosing
      regimens. Additionally, this study aimed to assess the effect that the human body
      has on the functional activities of VRC01 as measured by several in vitro assays.
      Eighty-eight healthy, HIV-uninfected, low-risk participants were enrolled in 6
      United States clinical research sites affiliated with the HVTN between September 
      9, 2014, and July 15, 2015. The median age of enrollees was 27 years (range,
      18-50); 52% were White (non-Hispanic), 25% identified as Black (non-Hispanic),
      11% were Hispanic, and 11% were non-Hispanic people of diverse origins.
      Participants were randomized to receive the following: a 40 mg/kg IV VRC01
      loading dose followed by five 20 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 4 weeks (treatment
      group 1 [T1], n = 20); eleven 5 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) VRC01 (treatment group 3 
      [T3], n = 20); placebo (placebo group 3 [P3], n = 4) doses every 2 weeks; or
      three 40 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 8 weeks (treatment group 2 [T2], n = 20).
      Treatment groups T4 and T5 (n = 12 each) received three 10 or 30 mg/kg IV VRC01
      doses every 8 weeks, respectively. Participants were followed for 32 weeks after 
      their first VRC01 administration and received a total of 249 IV infusions and 208
      SC injections, with no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, nor
      evidence for anti-VRC01 antibodies observed. Serum VRC01 levels were detected
      through 12 weeks after final administration in all participants who received all 
      scheduled doses. Mean peak serum VRC01 levels of 1,177 mug/ml (95% CI: 1,033,
      1,340) and 420 mug/ml (95% CI: 356, 494) were achieved 1 hour after the IV
      infusion series of 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Mean trough levels 
      at week 24 in the IV infusion series of 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses,
      respectively, were 16 mug/ml (95% CI: 10, 27) and 6 mug/ml (95% CI: 5, 9) levels,
      which neutralize a majority of circulating strains in vitro (50% inhibitory
      concentration [IC50] > 5 mug/ml). Post-infusion/injection serum VRC01 retained
      expected functional activity (virus neutralization, antibody-dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and virion capture). The limitations of this study
      include the relatively small sample size of each VRC01 administration regimen and
      missing data from participants who were unable to complete all study visits.
      CONCLUSIONS: VRC01 administered as either an IV infusion (10-40 mg/kg) given
      monthly or bimonthly, or as an SC injection (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, was found to
      be safe and well tolerated. In addition to maintaining drug concentrations
      consistent with neutralization of the majority of tested HIV strains, VRC01
      concentrations from participants' sera were found to avidly capture HIV virions
      and to mediate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, suggesting a range of
      anti-HIV immunological activities, warranting further clinical trials. TRIAL

TI  - Virological response and resistance among HIV-infected children receiving
      long-term antiretroviral therapy without virological monitoring in Uganda and
      Zimbabwe: Observational analyses within the randomised ARROW trial.
PG  - e1002432
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002432 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although WHO recommends viral load (VL) monitoring for those on
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), availability in low-income countries remains
      limited. We investigated long-term VL and resistance in HIV-infected children
      managed without real-time VL monitoring. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In the ARROW
      factorial trial, 1,206 children initiating ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe between 15 
      March 2007 and 18 November 2008, aged a median 6 years old, with median CD4% of
      12%, were randomised to monitoring with or without 12-weekly CD4 counts and to
      receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (2NRTI, mainly
      abacavir+lamivudine) with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      (NNRTI) or 3 NRTIs as long-term ART. All children had VL assayed retrospectively 
      after a median of 4 years on ART; those with >1,000 copies/ml were genotyped.
      Three hundred and sixteen children had VL and genotypes assayed longitudinally
      (at least every 24 weeks). Overall, 67 (6%) switched to second-line ART and 54
      (4%) died. In children randomised to WHO-recommended 2NRTI+NNRTI long-term ART,
      308/378 (81%) monitored with CD4 counts versus 297/375 (79%) without had VL
      <1,000 copies/ml at 4 years (difference = +2.3% [95% CI -3.4% to +8.0%]; P =
      0.43), with no evidence of differences in intermediate/high-level resistance to
      11 drugs. Among children with longitudinal VLs, only 5% of child-time post-week
      24 was spent with persistent low-level viraemia (80-5,000 copies/ml) and 10% with
      VL rebound >/=5,000 copies/ml. No child resuppressed <80 copies/ml after
      confirmed VL rebound >/=5,000 copies/ml. A median of 1.0 (IQR 0.0,1.5) additional
      NRTI mutation accumulated over 2 years' rebound. Nineteen out of 48 (40%) VLs
      1,000-5,000 copies/ml were immediately followed by resuppression <1,000
      copies/ml, but only 17/155 (11%) VLs >/=5,000 copies/ml resuppressed (P <
      0.0001). Main study limitations are that analyses were exploratory and treatment 
      initiation used 2006 criteria, without pre-ART genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study, children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa without real-time 
      VL monitoring had good virological and resistance outcomes over 4 years,
      regardless of CD4 monitoring strategy. Many children with detectable low-level
      viraemia spontaneously resuppressed, highlighting the importance of confirming
      virological failure before switching to second-line therapy. Children
      experiencing rebound >/=5,000 copies/ml were much less likely to resuppress, but 
      NRTI resistance increased only slowly. These results are relevant to the
      increasing numbers of HIV-infected children receiving first-line ART in
      sub-Saharan Africa with limited access to virological monitoring. TRIAL

TI  - Treatment guidelines and early loss from care for people living with HIV in Cape 
      Town, South Africa: A retrospective cohort study.
PG  - e1002434
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002434 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa has undergone multiple expansions in antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) eligibility from an initial CD4+ threshold of </=200 cells/mul to
      providing ART for all people living with HIV (PLWH) as of September 2016. We
      evaluated the association of programmatic changes in ART eligibility with loss
      from care, both prior to ART initiation and within the first 16 weeks of starting
      treatment, during a period of programmatic expansion to ART treatment at CD4+ </=
      350 cells/mul. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of
      4,025 treatment-eligible, non-pregnant PLWH accessing care in a community health 
      center in Gugulethu Township affiliated with the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre in Cape 
      Town. The median age of participants was 34 years (IQR 28-41 years), almost 62%
      were female, and the median CD4+ count was 173 cells/mul (IQR 92-254 cells/mul). 
      Participants were stratified into 2 cohorts: an early cohort, enrolled into care 
      at the health center from 1 January 2009 to 31 August 2011, when guidelines
      mandated that ART initiation required CD4+ </= 200 cells/mul, pregnancy, advanced
      clinical symptoms (World Health Organization [WHO] stage 4), or comorbidity
      (active tuberculosis); and a later cohort, enrolled into care from 1 September
      2011 to 31 December 2013, when the treatment threshold had been expanded to CD4+ 
      </= 350 cells/mul. Demographic and clinical factors were compared before and
      after the policy change using chi-squared tests to identify potentially
      confounding covariates, and logistic regression models were used to estimate the 
      risk of pre-treatment (pre-ART) loss from care and early loss within the first 16
      weeks on treatment, adjusting for age, baseline CD4+, and WHO stage. Compared
      with participants in the later cohort, participants in the earlier cohort had
      significantly more advanced disease: median CD4+ 146 cells/mul versus 214
      cells/mul (p < 0.001), 61.1% WHO stage 3/4 disease versus 42.8% (p < 0.001), and 
      pre-ART mortality of 34.2% versus 16.7% (p < 0.001). In total, 385 ART-eligible
      PLWH (9.6%) failed to initiate ART, of whom 25.7% died before ever starting
      treatment. Of the 3,640 people who started treatment, 58 (1.6%) died within the
      first 16 weeks in care, and an additional 644 (17.7%) were lost from care within 
      16 weeks of starting ART. PLWH who did start treatment in the later cohort were
      significantly more likely to discontinue care in <16 weeks (19.8% versus 15.8%, p
      = 0.002). After controlling for baseline CD4+, WHO stage, and age, this effect
      remained significant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.55). As
      such, it remains unclear if early attrition from care was due to a "healthy
      cohort" effect or to overcrowding as programs expanded to accommodate the broader
      guidelines for treatment. Our findings were limited by a lack of generalizability
      (given that these data were from a single high-volume site where testing and
      treatment were available) and an inability to formally investigate the effect of 
      crowding on the main outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-quarter of this ART-eligible 
      cohort did not achieve the long-term benefits of treatment due to early
      mortality, ART non-initiation, or early ART discontinuation. Those who started
      treatment in the later cohort appeared to be more likely to discontinue care
      early, and this outcome appeared to be independent of CD4+ count or WHO stage.
      Future interventions should focus on those most at risk for early loss from care 
      as programs continue to expand in South Africa.

TI  - Perinatal mortality associated with induction of labour versus expectant
      management in nulliparous women aged 35 years or over: An English national cohort
      study.
PG  - e1002425
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that
      induction of labour at 39 weeks of gestational age has no short-term adverse
      effect on the mother or infant among nulliparous women aged >/=35 years. However,
      the trial was underpowered to address the effect of routine induction of labour
      on the risk of perinatal death. We aimed to determine the association between
      induction of labour at >/=39 weeks and the risk of perinatal mortality among
      nulliparous women aged >/=35 years. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used English
      Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data collected between April 2009 and March
      2014 to compare perinatal mortality between induction of labour at 39, 40, and 41
      weeks of gestation and expectant management (continuation of pregnancy to either 
      spontaneous labour, induction of labour, or caesarean section at a later
      gestation). Analysis was by multivariable Poisson regression with adjustment for 
      maternal characteristics and pregnancy-related conditions. Among the cohort of
      77,327 nulliparous women aged 35 to 50 years delivering a singleton infant, 33.1%
      had labour induced: these women tended to be older and more likely to have
      medical complications of pregnancy, and the infants were more likely to be small 
      for gestational age. Induction of labour at 40 weeks (compared with expectant
      management) was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital perinatal death
      (0.08% versus 0.26%; adjusted risk ratio [adjRR] 0.33; 95% CI 0.13-0.80, P =
      0.015) and meconium aspiration syndrome (0.44% versus 0.86%; adjRR 0.52; 95% CI
      0.35-0.78, P = 0.002). Induction at 40 weeks was also associated with a slightly 
      increased risk of instrumental vaginal delivery (adjRR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.11, P 
      = 0.020) and emergency caesarean section (adjRR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09, P =
      0.019). The number needed to treat (NNT) analysis indicated that 562 (95% CI
      366-1,210) inductions of labour at 40 weeks would be required to prevent 1
      perinatal death. Limitations of the study include the reliance on observational
      data in which gestational age is recorded in weeks rather than days. There is
      also the potential for unmeasured confounders and under-recording of induction of
      labour or perinatal death in the dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Bringing forward the
      routine offer of induction of labour from the current recommendation of 41-42
      weeks to 40 weeks of gestation in nulliparous women aged >/=35 years may reduce
      overall rates of perinatal death.

TI  - A combination intervention strategy to improve linkage to and retention in HIV
      care following diagnosis in Mozambique: A cluster-randomized study.
PG  - e1002433
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerning gaps in the HIV care continuum compromise individual and
      population health. We evaluated a combination intervention strategy (CIS)
      targeting prevalent barriers to timely linkage and sustained retention in HIV
      care in Mozambique. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this cluster-randomized trial, 10
      primary health facilities in the city of Maputo and Inhambane Province were
      randomly assigned to provide the CIS or the standard of care (SOC). The CIS
      included point-of-care CD4 testing at the time of diagnosis, accelerated ART
      initiation, and short message service (SMS) health messages and appointment
      reminders. A pre-post intervention 2-sample design was nested within the CIS arm 
      to assess the effectiveness of CIS+, an enhanced version of the CIS that
      additionally included conditional non-cash financial incentives for linkage and
      retention. The primary outcome was a combined outcome of linkage to care within 1
      month and retention at 12 months after diagnosis. From April 22, 2013, to June
      30, 2015, we enrolled 2,004 out of 5,327 adults >/=18 years of age diagnosed with
      HIV in the voluntary counseling and testing clinics of participating health
      facilities: 744 (37%) in the CIS group, 493 (25%) in the CIS+ group, and 767
      (38%) in the SOC group. Fifty-seven percent of the CIS group achieved the primary
      outcome versus 35% in the SOC group (relative risk [RR]CIS vs SOC = 1.58, 95% CI 
      1.05-2.39). Eighty-nine percent of the CIS group linked to care on the day of
      diagnosis versus 16% of the SOC group (RRCIS vs SOC = 9.13, 95% CI 1.65-50.40).
      There was no significant benefit of adding financial incentives to the CIS in
      terms of the combined outcome (55% of the CIS+ group achieved the primary
      outcome, RRCIS+ vs CIS = 0.96, 95% CI 0.81-1.16). Key limitations include the use
      of existing medical records to assess outcomes, the inability to isolate the
      effect of each component of the CIS, non-concurrent enrollment of the CIS+ group,
      and exclusion of many patients newly diagnosed with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: The CIS
      showed promise for making much needed gains in the HIV care continuum in our
      study, particularly in the critical first step of timely linkage to care
      following diagnosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01930084.

TI  - Bioequivalence between innovator and generic tacrolimus in liver and kidney
      transplant recipients: A randomized, crossover clinical trial.
PG  - e1002428
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002428 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the generic drug approval process has a long-term successful
      track record, concerns remain for approval of narrow therapeutic index generic
      immunosuppressants, such as tacrolimus, in transplant recipients. Several
      professional transplant societies and publications have generated skepticism of
      the generic approval process. Three major areas of concern are that the
      pharmacokinetic properties of generic products and the innovator (that is,
      "brand") product in healthy volunteers may not reflect those in transplant
      recipients, bioequivalence between generic and innovator may not ensure
      bioequivalence between generics, and high-risk patients may have specific
      bioequivalence concerns. Such concerns have been fueled by anecdotal observations
      and retrospective and uncontrolled published studies, while well-designed,
      controlled prospective studies testing the validity of the regulatory
      bioequivalence testing approach for narrow therapeutic index immunosuppressants
      in transplant recipients have been lacking. Thus, the present study prospectively
      assesses bioequivalence between innovator tacrolimus and 2 generics in
      individuals with a kidney or liver transplant. METHODS AND FINDINGS: From
      December 2013 through October 2014, a prospective, replicate dosing, partially
      blinded, randomized, 3-treatment, 6-period crossover bioequivalence study was
      conducted at the University of Cincinnati in individuals with a kidney (n = 35)
      or liver transplant (n = 36). Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) data that 
      included manufacturing and healthy individual pharmacokinetic data for all
      generics were evaluated to select the 2 most disparate generics from innovator,
      and these were named Generic Hi and Generic Lo. During the 8-week study period,
      pharmacokinetic studies assessed the bioequivalence of Generic Hi and Generic Lo 
      with the Innovator tacrolimus and with each other. Bioequivalence of the major
      tacrolimus metabolite was also assessed. All products fell within the US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) average bioequivalence (ABE) acceptance criteria of a
      90% confidence interval contained within the confidence limits of 80.00% and
      125.00%. Within-subject variability was similar for the area under the curve
      (AUC) (range 12.11-15.81) and the concentration maximum (Cmax) (range
      17.96-24.72) for all products. The within-subject variability was utilized to
      calculate the scaled average bioequivalence (SCABE) 90% confidence interval. The 
      calculated SCABE 90% confidence interval was 84.65%-118.13% and 80.00%-125.00%
      for AUC and Cmax, respectively. The more stringent SCABE acceptance criteria were
      met for all product comparisons for AUC and Cmax in both individuals with a
      kidney transplant and those with a liver transplant. European Medicines Agency
      (EMA) acceptance criteria for narrow therapeutic index drugs were also met, with 
      the only exception being in the case of Brand versus Generic Lo, in which the
      upper limits of the 90% confidence intervals were 111.30% (kidney) and 112.12%
      (liver). These were only slightly above the upper EMA acceptance criteria limit
      for an AUC of 111.11%. SCABE criteria were also met for the major tacrolimus
      metabolite 13-O-desmethyl tacrolimus for AUC, but it failed the EMA criterion. No
      acute rejections, no differences in renal function in all individuals, and no
      differences in liver function were observed in individuals with a liver
      transplant using the Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) test for multiple 
      comparisons. Fifty-two percent and 65% of all individuals with a kidney or liver 
      transplant, respectively, reported an adverse event. The Exact McNemar test for
      paired categorical data with adjustments for multiple comparisons was used to
      compare adverse event rates among the products. No statistically significant
      differences among any pairs of products were found for any adverse event code or 
      for adverse events overall. Limitations of this study include that the
      observations were made under strictly controlled conditions that did not allow
      for the impact of nonadherence or feeding on the possible pharmacokinetic
      differences. Generic Hi and Lo were selected based upon bioequivalence data in
      healthy volunteers because no pharmacokinetic data in recipients were available
      for all products. The safety data should be interpreted in light of the small
      number of participants and the short observation periods. Lastly, only the 1 mg
      tacrolimus strength was utilized in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Using an innovative,
      controlled bioequivalence study design, we observed equivalence between
      tacrolimus innovator and 2 generic products as well as between 2 generic products
      in individuals after kidney or liver transplantation following current FDA
      bioequivalence metrics. These results support the position that bioequivalence
      for the narrow therapeutic index drug tacrolimus translates from healthy
      volunteers to individuals receiving a kidney or liver transplant and provides
      evidence that generic products that are bioequivalent with the innovator product 
      are also bioequivalent to each other. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Association between the 2012 Health and Social Care Act and specialist visits and
      hospitalisations in England: A controlled interrupted time series analysis.
PG  - e1002427
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002427 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2012 Health and Social Care Act (HSCA) in England led to among
      the largest healthcare reforms in the history of the National Health Service
      (NHS). It gave control of pound67 billion of the NHS budget for secondary care to
      general practitioner (GP) led Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). An expected
      outcome was that patient care would shift away from expensive hospital and
      specialist settings, towards less expensive community-based models. However,
      there is little evidence for the effectiveness of this approach. In this study,
      we aimed to assess the association between the NHS reforms and hospital
      admissions and outpatient specialist visits. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a
      controlled interrupted time series analysis to examine rates of outpatient
      specialist visits and inpatient hospitalisations before and after the
      implementation of the HSCA. We used national routine hospital administrative data
      (Hospital Episode Statistics) on all NHS outpatient specialist visits and
      inpatient hospital admissions in England between 2007 and 2015 (with a mean of
      26.8 million new outpatient visits and 14.9 million inpatient admissions per
      year). As a control series, we used equivalent data on hospital attendances in
      Scotland. Primary outcomes were: total, elective, and emergency hospitalisations,
      and total and GP-referred specialist visits. Both countries had stable trends in 
      all outcomes at baseline. In England, after the policy, there was a 1.1% (95% CI 
      0.7%-1.5%; p < 0.001) increase in total specialist visits per quarter and a 1.6% 
      increase in GP-referred specialist visits (95% CI 1.2%-2.0%; p < 0.001) per
      quarter, equivalent to 12.7% (647,000 over the 5,105,000 expected) and 19.1%
      (507,000 over the 2,658,000 expected) more visits per quarter by the end of 2015,
      respectively. In Scotland, there was no change in specialist visits. Neither
      country experienced a change in trends in hospitalisations: change in slope for
      total, elective, and emergency hospitalisations were -0.2% (95% CI -0.6%-0.2%; p 
      = 0.257), -0.2% (95% CI -0.6%-0.1%; p = 0.235), and 0.0% (95% CI -0.5%-0.4%; p = 
      0.866) per quarter in England. We are unable to exclude confounding due to other 
      events occurring around the time of the policy. However, we limited the
      likelihood of such confounding by including relevant control series, in which no 
      changes were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that giving control of
      healthcare budgets to GP-led CCGs was not associated with a reduction in overall 
      hospitalisations and was associated with an increase in specialist visits.

TI  - Validity of a minimally invasive autopsy for cause of death determination in
      maternal deaths in Mozambique: An observational study.
PG  - e1002431
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite global health efforts to reduce maternal mortality, rates
      continue to be unacceptably high in large parts of the world. Feasible,
      acceptable, and accurate postmortem sampling methods could provide the necessary 
      evidence to improve the understanding of the real causes of maternal mortality,
      guiding the design of interventions to reduce this burden. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      The validity of a minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) method in determining the
      cause of death was assessed in an observational study in 57 maternal deaths by
      comparing the results of the MIA with those of the gold standard (complete
      diagnostic autopsy [CDA], which includes any available clinical information).
      Concordance between the MIA and the gold standard diagnostic categories was
      assessed by the kappa statistic, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to
      identify the categories of diagnoses were estimated. The main limitation of the
      study is that both the MIA and the CDA include some degree of subjective
      interpretation in the attribution of cause of death. A cause of death was
      identified in the CDA in 98% (56/57) of cases, with indirect obstetric conditions
      accounting for 32 (56%) deaths and direct obstetric complications for 24 (42%)
      deaths. Nonobstetric infectious diseases (22/32, 69%) and obstetric hemorrhage
      (13/24, 54%) were the most common causes of death among indirect and direct
      obstetric conditions, respectively. Thirty-six (63%) women were HIV positive, and
      HIV-related conditions accounted for 16 (28%) of all deaths. Cerebral malaria
      caused 4 (7%) deaths. The MIA identified a cause of death in 86% of women. The
      overall concordance of the MIA with the CDA was moderate (kappa = 0.48, 95% CI:
      0.31-0.66). Both methods agreed in 68% of the diagnostic categories and the
      agreement was higher for indirect (91%) than for direct obstetric causes (38%).
      All HIV infections and cerebral malaria cases were identified in the MIA. The
      main limitation of the technique is its relatively low performance for
      identifying obstetric causes of death in the absence of clinical information.
      CONCLUSIONS: The MIA procedure could be a valuable tool to determine the causes
      of maternal death, especially for indirect obstetric conditions, most of which
      are infectious diseases. The information provided by the MIA could help to
      prioritize interventions to reduce maternal mortality and to monitor progress
      towards achieving global health targets.

TI  - Effectiveness of a combination strategy for linkage and retention in adult HIV
      care in Swaziland: The Link4Health cluster randomized trial.
PG  - e1002420
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002420 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gaps in the HIV care continuum contribute to poor health outcomes and
      increase HIV transmission. A combination of interventions targeting multiple
      steps in the continuum is needed to achieve the full beneficial impact of HIV
      treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Link4Health, a cluster-randomized controlled
      trial, evaluated the effectiveness of a combination intervention strategy (CIS)
      versus the standard of care (SOC) on the primary outcome of linkage to care
      within 1 month plus retention in care at 12 months after HIV-positive testing.
      Ten clusters of HIV clinics in Swaziland were randomized 1:1 to CIS versus SOC.
      The CIS included point-of-care CD4+ testing at the time of an HIV-positive test, 
      accelerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for treatment-eligible
      participants, mobile phone appointment reminders, health educational packages,
      and noncash financial incentives. Secondary outcomes included each component of
      the primary outcome, mean time to linkage, assessment for ART eligibility, ART
      initiation and time to ART initiation, viral suppression defined as HIV-1 RNA <
      1,000 copies/mL at 12 months after HIV testing among patients on ART >/=6 months,
      and loss to follow-up and death at 12 months after HIV testing. A total of 2,197 
      adults aged >/=18 years, newly tested HIV positive, were enrolled from 19 August 
      2013 to 21 November 2014 (1,096 CIS arm; 1,101 SOC arm) and followed for 12
      months. The median participant age was 31 years (IQR 26-39), and 59% were women. 
      In an intention-to-treat analysis, 64% (705/1,096) of participants at the CIS
      sites achieved the primary outcome versus 43% (477/1,101) at the SOC sites
      (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.96, p = 0.002). Participants in 
      the CIS arm versus the SOC arm had the following secondary outcomes: linkage to
      care regardless of retention at 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97-1.21, p = 0.13), 
      mean time to linkage (2.5 days versus 7.5 days, p = 0.189), retention in care at 
      12 months regardless of time to linkage (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18-1.86, p = 0.002),
      assessment for ART eligibility (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.34, p = 0.004), ART
      initiation (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.40, p = 0.12), mean time to ART initiation
      from time of HIV testing (7 days versus 14 days, p < 0.001), viral suppression
      among those on ART for >/=6 months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.07, p = 0.55), loss to
      follow-up at 12 months after HIV testing (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.79, p = 0.002), 
      and death (N = 78) within 12 months of HIV testing (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46-1.35, p 
      = 0.41). Limitations of this study include a small number of clusters and the
      inability to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of individual components of
      the combination strategy. CONCLUSIONS: A combination strategy inclusive of 5
      evidence-based interventions aimed at multiple steps in the HIV care continuum
      was associated with significant increase in linkage to care plus 12-month
      retention. This strategy offers promise of enhanced outcomes for HIV-positive
      patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01904994.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) event rates in
      HIV-positive persons at high predicted CVD and CKD risk: A prospective analysis
      of the D:A:D observational study.
PG  - e1002424
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study
      has developed predictive risk scores for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic
      kidney disease (CKD, defined as confirmed estimated glomerular filtration rate
      [eGFR] </= 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) events in HIV-positive people. We hypothesized that
      participants in D:A:D at high (>5%) predicted risk for both CVD and CKD would be 
      at even greater risk for CVD and CKD events. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included
      all participants with complete risk factor (covariate) data, baseline eGFR > 60
      ml/min/1.73 m2, and a confirmed (>3 months apart) eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2
      thereafter to calculate CVD and CKD risk scores. We calculated CVD and CKD event 
      rates by predicted 5-year CVD and CKD risk groups (</=1%, >1%-5%, >5%) and fitted
      Poisson models to assess whether CVD and CKD risk group effects were
      multiplicative. A total of 27,215 participants contributed 202,034 person-years
      of follow-up: 74% male, median (IQR) age 42 (36, 49) years, median (IQR) baseline
      year of follow-up 2005 (2004, 2008). D:A:D risk equations predicted 3,560 (13.1%)
      participants at high CVD risk, 4,996 (18.4%) participants at high CKD risk, and
      1,585 (5.8%) participants at both high CKD and high CVD risk. CVD and CKD event
      rates by predicted risk group were multiplicative. Participants at high CVD risk 
      had a 5.63-fold (95% CI 4.47, 7.09, p < 0.001) increase in CKD events compared to
      those at low risk; participants at high CKD risk had a 1.31-fold (95% CI 1.09,
      1.56, p = 0.005) increase in CVD events compared to those at low risk.
      Participants' CVD and CKD risk groups had multiplicative predictive effects, with
      no evidence of an interaction (p = 0.329 and p = 0.291 for CKD and CVD,
      respectively). The main study limitation is the difference in the ascertainment
      of the clinically defined CVD endpoints and the laboratory-defined CKD endpoints.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found that people at high predicted risk for both CVD and CKD
      have substantially greater risks for both CVD and CKD events compared with those 
      at low predicted risk for both outcomes, and compared to those at high predicted 
      risk for only CVD or CKD events. This suggests that CVD and CKD risk in
      HIV-positive persons should be assessed together. The results further encourage
      clinicians to prioritise addressing modifiable risks for CVD and CKD in
      HIV-positive people.

TI  - HIV-1 persistence following extremely early initiation of antiretroviral therapy 
      (ART) during acute HIV-1 infection: An observational study.
PG  - e1002417
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002417 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown if extremely early initiation of antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) may lead to long-term ART-free HIV remission or cure. As a result, we
      studied 2 individuals recruited from a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program
      who started prophylactic ART an estimated 10 days (Participant A; 54-year-old
      male) and 12 days (Participant B; 31-year-old male) after infection with peak
      plasma HIV RNA of 220 copies/mL and 3,343 copies/mL, respectively. Extensive
      testing of blood and tissue for HIV persistence was performed, and PrEP
      Participant A underwent analytical treatment interruption (ATI) following 32
      weeks of continuous ART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Colorectal and lymph node tissues,
      bone marrow, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and very large numbers of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained longitudinally from both
      participants and were studied for HIV persistence in several laboratories using
      molecular and culture-based detection methods, including a murine viral outgrowth
      assay (mVOA). Both participants initiated PrEP with tenofovir/emtricitabine
      during very early Fiebig stage I (detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, antibody negative)
      followed by 4-drug ART intensification. Following peak viral loads, both
      participants experienced full suppression of HIV-1 plasma viremia. Over the
      following 2 years, no further HIV could be detected in blood or tissue from PrEP 
      Participant A despite extensive sampling from ileum, rectum, lymph nodes, bone
      marrow, CSF, circulating CD4+ T cell subsets, and plasma. No HIV was detected
      from tissues obtained from PrEP Participant B, but low-level HIV RNA or DNA was
      intermittently detected from various CD4+ T cell subsets. Over 500 million CD4+ T
      cells were assayed from both participants in a humanized mouse outgrowth assay.
      Three of 8 mice infused with CD4+ T cells from PrEP Participant B developed
      viremia (50 million input cells/surviving mouse), but only 1 of 10 mice infused
      with CD4+ T cells from PrEP Participant A (53 million input cells/mouse)
      experienced very low level viremia (201 copies/mL); sequence confirmation was
      unsuccessful. PrEP Participant A stopped ART and remained aviremic for 7.4
      months, rebounding with HIV RNA of 36 copies/mL that rose to 59,805 copies/mL 6
      days later. ART was restarted promptly. Rebound plasma HIV sequences were
      identical to those obtained during acute infection by single-genome sequencing.
      Mathematical modeling predicted that the latent reservoir size was approximately 
      200 cells prior to ATI and that only around 1% of individuals with a similar HIV 
      burden may achieve lifelong ART-free remission. Furthermore, we observed that
      lymphocytes expressing the tumor marker CD30 increased in frequency weeks to
      months prior to detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma. This study was limited by the
      small sample size, which was a result of the rarity of individuals presenting
      during hyperacute infection. CONCLUSIONS: We report HIV relapse despite
      initiation of ART at one of the earliest stages of acute HIV infection possible. 
      Near complete or complete loss of detectable HIV in blood and tissues did not
      lead to indefinite ART-free HIV remission. However, the small numbers of latently
      infected cells in individuals treated during hyperacute infection may be
      associated with prolonged ART-free remission.

TI  - Comparison of two cash transfer strategies to prevent catastrophic costs for poor
      tuberculosis-affected households in low- and middle-income countries: An economic
      modelling study.
PG  - e1002418
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Illness-related costs for patients with tuberculosis (TB) >/=20% of
      pre-illness annual household income predict adverse treatment outcomes and have
      been termed "catastrophic." Social protection initiatives, including cash
      transfers, are endorsed to help prevent catastrophic costs. With this aim, cash
      transfers may either be provided to defray TB-related costs of households with a 
      confirmed TB diagnosis (termed a "TB-specific" approach); or to increase income
      of households with high TB risk to strengthen their economic resilience (termed a
      "TB-sensitive" approach). The impact of cash transfers provided with each of
      these approaches might vary. We undertook an economic modelling study from the
      patient perspective to compare the potential of these 2 cash transfer approaches 
      to prevent catastrophic costs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Model inputs for 7 low- and 
      middle-income countries (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Mexico, Tanzania, and 
      Yemen) were retrieved by literature review and included countries' mean patient
      TB-related costs, mean household income, mean cash transfers, and estimated
      TB-specific and TB-sensitive target populations. Analyses were completed for
      drug-susceptible (DS) TB-related costs in all 7 out of 7 countries, and
      additionally for drug-resistant (DR) TB-related costs in 1 of the 7 countries
      with available data. All cost data were reported in 2013 international dollars
      ($). The target population for TB-specific cash transfers was poor households
      with a confirmed TB diagnosis, and for TB-sensitive cash transfers was poor
      households already targeted by countries' established poverty-reduction cash
      transfer programme. Cash transfers offered in countries, unrelated to TB, ranged 
      from $217 to $1,091/year/household. Before cash transfers, DS TB-related costs
      were catastrophic in 6 out of 7 countries. If cash transfers were provided with a
      TB-specific approach, alone they would be insufficient to prevent DS TB
      catastrophic costs in 4 out of 6 countries, and when increased enough to prevent 
      DS TB catastrophic costs would require a budget between $3.8 million (95% CI:
      $3.8 million-$3.8 million) and $75 million (95% CI: $50 million-$100 million) per
      country. If instead cash transfers were provided with a TB-sensitive approach,
      alone they would be insufficient to prevent DS TB-related catastrophic costs in
      any of the 6 countries, and when increased enough to prevent DS TB catastrophic
      costs would require a budget between $298 million (95% CI: $219 million-$378
      million) and $165,367 million (95% CI: $134,085 million-$196,425 million) per
      country. DR TB-related costs were catastrophic before and after TB-specific or
      TB-sensitive cash transfers in 1 out of 1 countries. Sensitivity analyses showed 
      our findings to be robust to imputation of missing TB-related cost components,
      and use of 10% or 30% instead of 20% as the threshold for measuring catastrophic 
      costs. Key limitations were using national average data and not considering other
      health and social benefits of cash transfers. CONCLUSIONS: A TB-sensitive cash
      transfer approach to increase all poor households' income may have broad benefits
      by reducing poverty, but is unlikely to be as effective or affordable for
      preventing TB catastrophic costs as a TB-specific cash transfer approach to
      defray TB-related costs only in poor households with a confirmed TB diagnosis.
      Preventing DR TB-related catastrophic costs will require considerable additional 
      investment whether a TB-sensitive or a TB-specific cash transfer approach is
      used.

TI  - Contemporary disengagement from antiretroviral therapy in Khayelitsha, South
      Africa: A cohort study.
PG  - e1002407
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002407 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retention in care is an essential component of meeting the UNAIDS
      "90-90-90" HIV treatment targets. In Khayelitsha township (population ~500,000)
      in Cape Town, South Africa, more than 50,000 patients have received
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) since the inception of this public-sector program in
      2001. Disengagement from care remains an important challenge. We sought to
      determine the incidence of and risk factors associated with disengagement from
      care during 2013-2014 and outcomes for those who disengaged. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients >/=10 years
      of age who visited 1 of the 13 Khayelitsha ART clinics from 2013-2014 regardless 
      of the date they initiated ART. We described the cumulative incidence of first
      disengagement (>180 days not attending clinic) between 1 January 2013 and 31
      December 2014 using competing risks methods, enabling us to estimate
      disengagement incidence up to 10 years after ART initiation. We also described
      risk factors for disengagement based on a Cox proportional hazards model, using
      multiple imputation for missing data. We ascertained outcomes (death, return to
      care, hospital admission, other hospital contact, alive but not in care, no
      information) after disengagement until 30 June 2015 using province-wide health
      databases and the National Death Registry. Of 39,884 patients meeting our
      eligibility criteria, the median time on ART to 31 December 2014 was 33.6 months 
      (IQR 12.4-63.2). Of the total study cohort, 592 (1.5%) died in the study period, 
      1,231 (3.1%) formally transferred out, 987 (2.5%) were silent transfers and
      visited another Western Cape province clinic within 180 days, 9,005 (22.6%)
      disengaged, and 28,069 (70.4%) remained in care. Cumulative incidence of
      disengagement from care was estimated to be 25.1% by 2 years and 50.3% by 5 years
      on ART. Key factors associated with disengagement (age, male sex, pregnancy at
      ART start [HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.47-1.69], most recent CD4 count) and retention (ART 
      club membership, baseline CD4) after adjustment were similar to those found in
      previous studies; however, notably, the higher hazard of disengagement soon after
      starting ART was no longer present after adjusting for these risk factors. Of the
      9,005 who disengaged, the 2 most common initial outcomes were return to ART care 
      after 180 days (33%; n = 2,976) and being alive but not in care in the Western
      Cape (25%; n = 2,255). After disengagement, a total of 1,459 (16%) patients were 
      hospitalized and 237 (3%) died. The median follow-up from date of disengagement
      to 30 June 2015 was 16.7 months (IQR 11-22.4). As we included only patient
      follow-up from 2013-2014 by design in order to maximize the generalizability of
      our findings to current programs, this limited our ability to more fully describe
      temporal trends in first disengagement. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-three percent of ART 
      patients in the large cohort of Khayelitsha, one of the oldest public-sector ART 
      programs in South Africa, disengaged from care at least once in a contemporary
      2-year period. Fifty-eight percent of these patients either subsequently returned
      to care (some "silently") or remained alive without hospitalization, suggesting
      that many who are considered "lost" actually return to care, and that
      misclassification of "lost" patients is likely common in similar urban
      populations. A challenge to meeting ART retention targets is developing, testing,
      and implementing program designs to target mobile populations and retain them in 
      lifelong care. This should be guided by risk factors for disengagement and
      improving interlinkage of routine information systems to better support patient
      care across complex care platforms.

TI  - HIV prevalence and behavioral and psychosocial factors among transgender women
      and cisgender men who have sex with men in 8 African countries: A cross-sectional
      analysis.
PG  - e1002422
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002422 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sub-Saharan Africa bears more than two-thirds of the worldwide
      burden of HIV; however, data among transgender women from the region are sparse. 
      Transgender women across the world face significant vulnerability to HIV. This
      analysis aimed to assess HIV prevalence as well as psychosocial and behavioral
      drivers of HIV infection among transgender women compared with cisgender
      (non-transgender) men who have sex with men (cis-MSM) in 8 sub-Saharan African
      countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Respondent-driven sampling targeted cis-MSM for 
      enrollment. Data collection took place at 14 sites across 8 countries: Burkina
      Faso (January-August 2013), Cote d'Ivoire (March 2015-February 2016), The Gambia 
      (July-December 2011), Lesotho (February-September 2014), Malawi (July 2011-March 
      2012), Senegal (February-November 2015), Swaziland (August-December 2011), and
      Togo (January-June 2013). Surveys gathered information on sexual orientation,
      gender identity, stigma, mental health, sexual behavior, and HIV testing. Rapid
      tests for HIV were conducted. Data were merged, and mixed effects logistic
      regression models were used to estimate relationships between gender identity and
      HIV infection. Among 4,586 participants assigned male sex at birth, 937 (20%)
      identified as transgender or female, and 3,649 were cis-MSM. The mean age of
      study participants was approximately 24 years, with no difference between
      transgender participants and cis-MSM. Compared to cis-MSM participants,
      transgender women were more likely to experience family exclusion (odds ratio
      [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.42-2.16, p < 0.001), rape (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.63-2.36, p <
      0.001), and depressive symptoms (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.52, p < 0.001).
      Transgender women were more likely to report condomless receptive anal sex in the
      prior 12 months (OR 2.44, 95% CI 2.05-2.90, p < 0.001) and to be currently living
      with HIV (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.49-2.19, p < 0.001). Overall HIV prevalence was 25%
      (235/926) in transgender women and 14% (505/3,594) in cis-MSM. When adjusted for 
      age, condomless receptive anal sex, depression, interpersonal stigma, law
      enforcement stigma, and violence, and the interaction of gender with condomless
      receptive anal sex, the odds of HIV infection for transgender women were 2.2
      times greater than the odds for cis-MSM (95% CI 1.65-2.87, p < 0.001).
      Limitations of the study included sampling strategies tailored for cis-MSM and
      merging of datasets with non-identical survey instruments. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study in sub-Saharan Africa, we found that HIV burden and stigma differed between
      transgender women and cis-MSM, indicating a need to address gender diversity
      within HIV research and programs.

TI  - Impact of disinvestment from weekend allied health services across acute medical 
      and surgical wards: 2 stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trials.
PG  - e1002412
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disinvestment (removal, reduction, or reallocation) of routinely
      provided health services can be difficult when there is little published evidence
      examining whether the services are effective or not. Evidence is required to
      understand if removing these services produces outcomes that are inferior to
      keeping such services in place. However, organisational imperatives, such as
      budget cuts, may force healthcare providers to disinvest from these services
      before the required evidence becomes available. There are presently no
      experimental studies examining the effectiveness of allied health services (e.g.,
      physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social work) provided on weekends
      across acute medical and surgical hospital wards, despite these services being
      routinely provided internationally. The aim of this study was to understand the
      impact of removing weekend allied health services from acute medical and surgical
      wards using a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority research design. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We conducted 2 stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trials
      between 1 February 2014 and 30 April 2015 among patients on 12 acute medical or
      surgical hospital wards spread across 2 hospitals. The hospitals involved were 2 
      metropolitan teaching hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Data from n = 14,834
      patients were collected for inclusion in Trial 1, and n = 12,674 in Trial 2.
      Trial 1 was a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority stepped-wedge trial where
      the 'current' weekend allied health service was incrementally removed from
      participating wards each calendar month, in a random order, while Trial 2 used a 
      conventional non-inferiority stepped-wedge design, where a 'newly developed'
      service was incrementally reinstated on the same wards as in Trial 1. Primary
      outcome measures were patient length of stay (proportion staying longer than
      expected and mean length of stay), the proportion of patients experiencing any
      adverse event, and the proportion with an unplanned readmission within 28 days of
      discharge. The 'no weekend allied health service' condition was considered to be 
      not inferior if the 95% CIs of the differences between this condition and the
      condition with weekend allied health service delivery were below a 2% increase in
      the proportion of patients who stayed in hospital longer than expected, a 2%
      increase in the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days, a 2% 
      increase in the proportion who had any adverse event, and a 1-day increase in the
      mean length of stay. The current weekend allied health service included physical 
      therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, dietetics, social work, and allied
      health assistant services in line with usual care at the participating sites. The
      newly developed weekend allied health service allowed managers at each site to
      reprioritise tasks being performed and the balance of hours provided by each
      professional group and on which days they were provided. Analyses conducted on an
      intention-to-treat basis demonstrated that there was no estimated effect size
      difference between groups in the proportion of patients staying longer than
      expected (weekend versus no weekend; estimated effect size difference [95% CI],
      p-value) in Trial 1 (0.40 versus 0.38; estimated effect size difference 0.01
      [-0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.31, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin),
      but the proportion staying longer than expected was greater with the newly
      developed service compared to its no weekend service control condition (0.39
      versus 0.40; estimated effect size difference 0.02 [0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.04, CI
      was completely below non-inferiority margin) in Trial 2. Trial 1 and 2 findings
      were discordant for the mean length of stay outcome (Trial 1: 5.5 versus 6.3
      days; estimated effect size difference 1.3 days [0.9 to 1.8], p < 0.001, CI was
      both above and below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: 5.9 versus 5.0 days;
      estimated effect size difference -1.6 days [-2.0 to -1.1], p < 0.001, CI was
      completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between
      conditions for the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days in 
      either trial (Trial 1: 0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.18, CI was both above and
      below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: -0.01 [-0.02 to 0.01], p = 0.62, CI
      completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between
      conditions in the proportion of patients who experienced any adverse event in
      Trial 1 (0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.33, CI was both above and below
      non-inferiority margin), but a lower proportion of patients had an adverse event 
      in Trial 2 when exposed to the no weekend allied health condition (-0.03 [-0.05
      to -0.004], p = 0.02, CI completely below non-inferiority margin). Limitations of
      this research were that 1 of the trial wards was closed by the healthcare
      provider after Trial 1 and could not be included in Trial 2, and that both
      withdrawing the current weekend allied health service model and installing a new 
      one may have led to an accommodation period for staff to adapt to the new service
      settings. Stepped-wedge trials are potentially susceptible to bias from naturally
      occurring change over time at the service level; however, this was adjusted for
      in our analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In Trial 1, criteria to say that the no weekend
      allied health condition was non-inferior to current weekend allied health
      condition were not met, while neither the no weekend nor current weekend allied
      health condition demonstrated superiority. In Trial 2, the no weekend allied
      health condition was non-inferior to the newly developed weekend allied health
      condition across all primary outcomes, and superior for the outcomes proportion
      of patients staying longer than expected, proportion experiencing any adverse
      event, and mean length of stay. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand

TI  - Estimating the fitness cost and benefit of cefixime resistance in Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae to inform prescription policy: A modelling study.
PG  - e1002416
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002416 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gonorrhoea is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted
      infections in England. Over 41,000 cases were recorded in 2015, more than half of
      which occurred in men who have sex with men (MSM). As the bacterium has developed
      resistance to each first-line antibiotic in turn, we need an improved
      understanding of fitness benefits and costs of antibiotic resistance to inform
      control policy and planning. Cefixime was recommended as a single-dose treatment 
      for gonorrhoea from 2005 to 2010, during which time resistance increased, and
      subsequently declined. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a stochastic
      compartmental model representing the natural history and transmission of
      cefixime-sensitive and cefixime-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in MSM
      in England, which was applied to data on diagnoses and prescriptions between 2008
      and 2015. We estimated that asymptomatic carriers play a crucial role in overall 
      transmission dynamics, with 37% (95% credible interval CrI 24%-52%) of infections
      remaining asymptomatic and untreated, accounting for 89% (95% CrI 82%-93%) of
      onward transmission. The fitness cost of cefixime resistance in the absence of
      cefixime usage was estimated to be such that the number of secondary infections
      caused by resistant strains is only about half as much as for the susceptible
      strains, which is insufficient to maintain persistence. However, we estimated
      that treatment of cefixime-resistant strains with cefixime was unsuccessful in
      83% (95% CrI 53%-99%) of cases, representing a fitness benefit of resistance.
      This benefit was large enough to counterbalance the fitness cost when 31% (95%
      CrI 26%-36%) of cases were treated with cefixime, and when more than 55% (95% CrI
      44%-66%) of cases were treated with cefixime, the resistant strain had a net
      fitness advantage over the susceptible strain. Limitations include sparse data
      leading to large intervals on key model parameters and necessary assumptions in
      the modelling of a complex epidemiological process. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
      provides, to our knowledge, the first estimates of the fitness cost and benefit
      associated with resistance of the gonococcus to a clinically relevant antibiotic.
      Our findings have important implications for antibiotic stewardship and public
      health policies and, in particular, suggest that a previously abandoned
      antibiotic could be used again to treat a minority of gonorrhoea cases without
      raising resistance levels.

TI  - Childhood stunting in relation to the pre- and postnatal environment during the
      first 2 years of life: The MAL-ED longitudinal birth cohort study.
PG  - e1002408
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stunting is the most prevalent manifestation of childhood
      malnutrition. To characterize factors that contribute to stunting in
      resource-poor settings, we studied a priori selected biological and social
      factors collected longitudinally in a cohort of newborns. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      We enrolled 1,868 children across 7 resource-poor settings in Bangladesh, Brazil,
      India, Nepal, Peru, South Africa, and Tanzania shortly after birth and followed
      them for 24 months between 2 November 2009 and 28 February 2014. We collected
      longitudinal anthropometry, sociodemographic factors, maternal-reported
      illnesses, and antibiotic use; child feeding practices; dietary intake starting
      at 9 months; and longitudinal blood, urine, and stool samples to investigate
      non-diarrheal enteropathogens, micronutrients, gut inflammation and permeability,
      and systemic inflammation. We categorized length-for-age Z-scores into 3 groups
      (not stunted, >/=-1; at risk, <-1 to -2; and stunted, <-2), and used
      multivariable ordinal logistic regression to model the cumulative odds of being
      in a lower length-for-age category (at risk or stunted). A total of 1,197
      children with complete longitudinal data were available for analysis. The
      prevalence of having a length-for-age Z-score below -1 increased from 43% (range 
      37%-47% across sites) shortly after birth (mean 7.7 days post-delivery, range 0
      to 17 days) to 74% (16%-96%) at 24 months. The prevalence of stunting increased
      3-fold during this same time period. Factors that contributed to the odds of
      being in a lower length-for-age category at 24 months were lower enrollment
      weight-for-age (interquartile cumulative odds ratio = 1.82, 95% CI 1.49-2.23),
      shorter maternal height (2.38, 1.89-3.01), higher number of enteropathogens in
      non-diarrheal stools (1.36, 1.07-1.73), lower socioeconomic status (1.75,
      1.20-2.55), and lower percent of energy from protein (1.39, 1.13-1.72).
      Site-specific analyses suggest that reported associations were similar across
      settings. While loss to follow-up and missing data are inevitable, some study
      sites had greater loss to follow-up and more missing data than others, which may 
      limit the generalizability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal and maternal
      factors were early determinants of lower length-for-age, and their contribution
      remained important throughout the first 24 months of life, whereas the average
      number of enteropathogens in non-diarrheal stools, socioeconomic status, and
      dietary intake became increasingly important contributors by 24 months relative
      to neonatal and maternal factors.

TI  - Effectiveness of cervical screening after age 60 years according to screening
      history: Nationwide cohort study in Sweden.
PG  - e1002414
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relatively high incidence of cervical cancer in women at older
      ages is a continuing concern in countries with long-established cervical
      screening. Controversy remains on when and how to cease screening. Existing
      population-based studies on the effectiveness of cervical screening at older ages
      have not considered women's screening history. We performed a nationwide cohort
      study to investigate the incidence of cervical cancer after age 60 years and its 
      association with cervical screening at age 61-65, stratified by screening history
      at age 51-60. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Total Population Register, we
      identified 569,132 women born between 1 January 1919 and 31 December 1945,
      resident in Sweden since age 51. Women's cytological screening records, cervical 
      cancer occurrence, and FIGO stage (for those diagnosed with cancer) were
      retrieved from national registers and medical charts. We calculated the
      cumulative incidence of cervical cancer from age 61 to age 80 using a survival
      function considering competing risk, and estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of
      cervical cancer in relation to screening status at age 61-65 from Cox models,
      adjusted for birth cohort and level of education, conditioning on women's
      screening history in their 50s. In women unscreened in their 50s, the cumulative 
      incidence up to age 80 was 5.0 per 1,000 women, and screening at age 61-65 was
      associated with a lower risk for cervical cancer (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.72),
      corresponding to a decrease of 3.3 cancer cases per 1,000 women. A higher
      cumulative incidence and similarly statistically significant risk decrease was
      seen for women with abnormal smears in their 50s. In women adequately or
      inadequately screened with only normal results between age 51 and age 60, the
      cumulative incidence of cervical cancer from age 61 to 80 was 1.6 and 2.5 per
      1,000 women, respectively, and further screening at age 61-65 was not associated 
      with statistically significant decreases of cervical cancer risk up to age 80,
      but with fewer cancer cases of advanced stages at age 61-65. Adjustment for
      potential lifestyle confounders was limited. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, cervical
      screening with cytology at age 61-65 was associated with a statistically
      significant reduction of subsequent cervical cancer risk for women who were
      unscreened, or screened with abnormalities, in their 50s. In women screened with 
      normal results in their 50s, the risk for future cancer was not sizeable, and the
      risk reduction associated with continued screening appeared limited. These
      findings should inform the current debate regarding age and criteria to
      discontinue cervical screening.

TI  - A novel electronic algorithm using host biomarker point-of-care tests for the
      management of febrile illnesses in Tanzanian children (e-POCT): A randomized,
      controlled non-inferiority trial.
PG  - e1002411
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of childhood infections remains inadequate in
      resource-limited countries, resulting in high mortality and irrational use of
      antimicrobials. Current disease management tools, such as the Integrated
      Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithm, rely solely on clinical signs
      and have not made use of available point-of-care tests (POCTs) that can help to
      identify children with severe infections and children in need of antibiotic
      treatment. e-POCT is a novel electronic algorithm based on current evidence; it
      guides clinicians through the entire consultation and recommends treatment based 
      on a few clinical signs and POCT results, some performed in all patients (malaria
      rapid diagnostic test, hemoglobin, oximeter) and others in selected subgroups
      only (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, glucometer). The objective of this trial
      was to determine whether the clinical outcome of febrile children managed by the 
      e-POCT tool was non-inferior to that of febrile children managed by a validated
      electronic algorithm derived from IMCI (ALMANACH), while reducing the proportion 
      with antibiotic prescription. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a randomized (at
      patient level, blocks of 4), controlled non-inferiority study among children aged
      2-59 months presenting with acute febrile illness to 9 outpatient clinics in Dar 
      es Salaam, Tanzania. In parallel, routine care was documented in 2 health
      centers. The primary outcome was the proportion of clinical failures (development
      of severe symptoms, clinical pneumonia on/after day 3, or persistent symptoms at 
      day 7) by day 7 of follow-up. Non-inferiority would be declared if the proportion
      of clinical failures with e-POCT was no worse than the proportion of clinical
      failures with ALMANACH, within statistical variability, by a margin of 3%. The
      secondary outcomes included the proportion with antibiotics prescribed on day 0, 
      primary referrals, and severe adverse events by day 30 (secondary
      hospitalizations and deaths). We enrolled 3,192 patients between December 2014
      and February 2016 into the randomized study; 3,169 patients (e-POCT: 1,586;
      control [ALMANACH]: 1,583) completed the intervention and day 7 follow-up. Using 
      e-POCT, in the per-protocol population, the absolute proportion of clinical
      failures was 2.3% (37/1,586), as compared with 4.1% (65/1,583) in the ALMANACH
      arm (risk difference of clinical failure -1.7, 95% CI -3.0, -0.5), meeting the
      prespecified criterion for non-inferiority. In a non-prespecified superiority
      analysis, we observed a 43% reduction in the relative risk of clinical failure
      when using e-POCT compared to ALMANACH (risk ratio [RR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.38, 0.85, 
      p = 0.005). The proportion of severe adverse events was 0.6% in the e-POCT arm
      compared with 1.5% in the ALMANACH arm (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20, 0.87, p = 0.02).
      The proportion of antibiotic prescriptions was substantially lower, 11.5%
      compared to 29.7% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33, 0.45, p < 0.001). Using e-POCT, the most
      common indication for antibiotic prescription was severe disease (57%, 103/182
      prescriptions), while it was non-severe respiratory infections using the control 
      algorithm (ALMANACH) (70%, 330/470 prescriptions). The proportion of clinical
      failures among the 544 children in the routine care cohort was 4.6% (25/544);
      94.9% (516/544) of patients received antibiotics on day 0, and 1.1% (6/544)
      experienced severe adverse events. e-POCT achieved a 49% reduction in the
      relative risk of clinical failure compared to routine care (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31,
      0.84, p = 0.007) and lowered antibiotic prescriptions to 11.5% from 94.9% (p <
      0.001). Though this safety study was an important first step to evaluate e-POCT, 
      its true utility should be evaluated through future implementation studies since 
      adherence to the algorithm will be an important factor in making use of e-POCT's 
      advantages in terms of clinical outcome and antibiotic prescription. CONCLUSIONS:
      e-POCT, an innovative electronic algorithm using host biomarker POCTs, including 
      C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, has the potential to improve the clinical
      outcome of children with febrile illnesses while reducing antibiotic use through 
      improved identification of children with severe infections, and better targeting 
      of children in need of antibiotic prescription. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Elevated blood pressure and risk of mitral regurgitation: A longitudinal cohort
      study of 5.5 million United Kingdom adults.
PG  - e1002404
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation in people without prior cardiac disease is
      considered a degenerative disease with no established risk factors for its
      prevention. We aimed to test the hypothesis that elevated systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) across its usual spectrum is associated with higher risk of mitral
      regurgitation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used linked electronic health records
      from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1 January
      1990 to 31 December 2015. CPRD covers approximately 7% of the current UK
      population and is broadly representative of the population by age, sex, and
      ethnicity. About 5.5 million UK patients with no known cardiovascular or valve
      disease at baseline were included in this cohort study. We investigated the
      relationship between blood pressure (BP) and risk of mitral regurgitation using
      Cox regression models. Our primary exposure variable was SBP and our primary
      outcome was incident reports of mitral regurgitation, which were identified from 
      hospital discharge reports or primary care records. Of the 5,553,984 patients in 
      the CPRD that met our inclusion criteria, during the 10-year follow-up period,
      28,655 (0.52%) were diagnosed with mitral regurgitation and a further 1,262
      (0.02%) were diagnosed with mitral stenosis. SBP was continuously related to the 
      risk of mitral regurgitation with no evidence of a nadir down to 115 mmHg (p <
      0.001). Each 20 mmHg increment in SBP was associated with a 26% higher risk of
      mitral regurgitation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26; CI 1.23, 1.29). The observed
      association was partially mediated by diseases affecting the left ventricle
      during follow-up (myocardial infarction [MI], ischaemic heart disease [IHD],
      cardiomyopathy, and heart failure). However, the percentage of excess risk
      mediated (PERM) by these proximate causes of secondary mitral regurgitation was
      only 13% (CI 6.1%, 20%), and accounting for them had little effect on the
      long-term association between SBP and mitral regurgitation (mediator-adjusted HR 
      1.22; CI 1.20, 1.25; p < 0.001). Associations were similar for each 10 mmHg
      increment in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p < 0.001) or each 15 mmHg increment
      in pulse pressure (PP) (p < 0.001). By contrast, there was no association between
      SBP and risk of mitral stenosis (HR per 20 mmHg higher SBP 1.03; CI 0.93, 1.14; p
      = 0.58). These analyses are based on routinely collected data from health records
      which may be sensitive to measurement errors, and the observed associations may
      not be generalizable to less severe and subclinical cases of mitral
      regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to elevated BP across its whole
      spectrum is associated with an increased risk of primary and secondary mitral
      regurgitation. These findings suggest that BP control may be of importance in the
      prevention of mitral regurgitation.

TI  - Benefit and harm of intensive blood pressure treatment: Derivation and validation
      of risk models using data from the SPRINT and ACCORD trials.
PG  - e1002410
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002410 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment can avert cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) events but can cause some serious adverse events. We sought to
      develop and validate risk models for predicting absolute risk difference
      (increased risk or decreased risk) for CVD events and serious adverse events from
      intensive BP therapy. A secondary aim was to test if the statistical method of
      elastic net regularization would improve the estimation of risk models for
      predicting absolute risk difference, as compared to a traditional backwards
      variable selection approach. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cox models were derived from
      SPRINT trial data and validated on ACCORD-BP trial data to estimate risk of CVD
      events and serious adverse events; the models included terms for intensive BP
      treatment and heterogeneous response to intensive treatment. The Cox models were 
      then used to estimate the absolute reduction in probability of CVD events
      (benefit) and absolute increase in probability of serious adverse events (harm)
      for each individual from intensive treatment. We compared the method of elastic
      net regularization, which uses repeated internal cross-validation to select
      variables and estimate coefficients in the presence of collinearity, to a
      traditional backwards variable selection approach. Data from 9,069 SPRINT
      participants with complete data on covariates were utilized for model
      development, and data from 4,498 ACCORD-BP participants with complete data were
      utilized for model validation. Participants were exposed to intensive (goal
      systolic pressure < 120 mm Hg) versus standard (<140 mm Hg) treatment. Two
      composite primary outcome measures were evaluated: (i) CVD events/deaths
      (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, congestive heart
      failure, or CVD death), and (ii) serious adverse events (hypotension, syncope,
      electrolyte abnormalities, bradycardia, or acute kidney injury/failure). The
      model for CVD chosen through elastic net regularization included interaction
      terms suggesting that older age, black race, higher diastolic BP, and higher
      lipids were associated with greater CVD risk reduction benefits from intensive
      treatment, while current smoking was associated with fewer benefits. The model
      for serious adverse events chosen through elastic net regularization suggested
      that male sex, current smoking, statin use, elevated creatinine, and higher
      lipids were associated with greater risk of serious adverse events from intensive
      treatment. SPRINT participants in the highest predicted benefit subgroup had a
      number needed to treat (NNT) of 24 to prevent 1 CVD event/death over 5 years
      (absolute risk reduction [ARR] = 0.042, 95% CI: 0.018, 0.066; P = 0.001), those
      in the middle predicted benefit subgroup had a NNT of 76 (ARR = 0.013, 95% CI:
      -0.0001, 0.026; P = 0.053), and those in the lowest subgroup had no significant
      risk reduction (ARR = 0.006, 95% CI: -0.007, 0.018; P = 0.71). Those in the
      highest predicted harm subgroup had a number needed to harm (NNH) of 27 to induce
      1 serious adverse event (absolute risk increase [ARI] = 0.038, 95% CI: 0.014,
      0.061; P = 0.002), those in the middle predicted harm subgroup had a NNH of 41
      (ARI = 0.025, 95% CI: 0.012, 0.038; P < 0.001), and those in the lowest subgroup 
      had no significant risk increase (ARI = -0.007, 95% CI: -0.043, 0.030; P = 0.72).
      In ACCORD-BP, participants in the highest subgroup of predicted benefit had
      significant absolute CVD risk reduction, but the overall ACCORD-BP participant
      sample was skewed towards participants with less predicted benefit and more
      predicted risk than in SPRINT. The models chosen through traditional backwards
      selection had similar ability to identify absolute risk difference for CVD as the
      elastic net models, but poorer ability to correctly identify absolute risk
      difference for serious adverse events. A key limitation of the analysis is the
      limited sample size of the ACCORD-BP trial, which expanded confidence intervals
      for ARI among persons with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, it is not possible to
      mechanistically explain the physiological relationships explaining the
      heterogeneous treatment effects captured by the models, since the study was an
      observational secondary data analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We found that predictive
      models could help identify subgroups of participants in both SPRINT and ACCORD-BP
      who had lower versus higher ARRs in CVD events/deaths with intensive BP
      treatment, and participants who had lower versus higher ARIs in serious adverse
      events.

TI  - Tuberculosis detection and the challenges of integrated care in rural China: A
      cross-sectional standardized patient study.
PG  - e1002405
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002405 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recent reductions in prevalence, China still faces a
      substantial tuberculosis (TB) burden, with future progress dependent on the
      ability of rural providers to appropriately detect and refer TB patients for
      further care. This study (a) provides a baseline assessment of the ability of
      rural providers to correctly manage presumptive TB cases; (b) measures the gap
      between provider knowledge and practice and; (c) evaluates how ongoing reforms of
      China's health system-characterized by a movement toward "integrated care" and
      promotion of initial contact with grassroots providers-will affect the care of TB
      patients. METHODS/FINDINGS: Unannounced standardized patients (SPs) presenting
      with classic pulmonary TB symptoms were deployed in 3 provinces of China in July 
      2015. The SPs successfully completed 274 interactions across all 3 tiers of
      China's rural health system, interacting with providers in 46 village clinics,
      207 township health centers, and 21 county hospitals. Interactions between
      providers and standardized patients were assessed against international and
      national standards of TB care. Using a lenient definition of correct management
      as at least a referral, chest X-ray or sputum test, 41% (111 of 274) SPs were
      correctly managed. Although there were no cases of empirical anti-TB treatment,
      antibiotics unrelated to the treatment of TB were prescribed in 168 of 274
      interactions or 61.3% (95% CI: 55%-67%). Correct management proportions
      significantly higher at county hospitals compared to township health centers (OR 
      0.06, 95% CI: 0.01-0.25, p < 0.001) and village clinics (OR 0.02, 95% CI:
      0.0-0.17, p < 0.001). Correct management in tests of knowledge administered to
      the same 274 physicians for the same case was 45 percentage points (95% CI:
      37%-53%) higher with 24 percentage points (95% CI: -33% to -15%) fewer antibiotic
      prescriptions. Relative to the current system, where patients can choose to
      bypass any level of care, simulations suggest that a system of managed referral
      with gatekeeping at the level of village clinics would reduce proportions of
      correct management from 41% to 16%, while gatekeeping at the level of the
      township hospital would retain correct management close to current levels at 37%.
      The main limitations of the study are 2-fold. First, we evaluate the management
      of a one-time new patient presenting with presumptive TB, which may not reflect
      how providers manage repeat patients or more complicated TB presentations.
      Second, simulations under alternate policies require behavioral and statistical
      assumptions that should be addressed in future applications of this method.
      CONCLUSIONS: There were significant quality deficits among village clinics and
      township health centers in the management of a classic case of presumptive TB,
      with higher proportions of correct case management in county hospitals. Poor
      clinical performance does not arise only from a lack of knowledge, a phenomenon
      known as the "know-do" gap. Given significant deficits in quality of care,
      reforms encouraging first contact with lower tiers of the health system can
      improve efficiency only with concomitant improvements in appropriate management
      of presumptive TB patients in village clinics and township health centers.

TI  - A combination of plasma phospholipid fatty acids and its association with
      incidence of type 2 diabetes: The EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study.
PG  - e1002409
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combinations of multiple fatty acids may influence cardiometabolic
      risk more than single fatty acids. The association of a combination of fatty
      acids with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been evaluated. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We measured plasma phospholipid fatty acids by gas chromatography in
      27,296 adults, including 12,132 incident cases of T2D, over the follow-up period 
      between baseline (1991-1998) and 31 December 2007 in 8 European countries in
      EPIC-InterAct, a nested case-cohort study. The first principal component derived 
      by principal component analysis of 27 individual fatty acids (mole percentage)
      was the main exposure (subsequently called the fatty acid pattern score
      [FA-pattern score]). The FA-pattern score was partly characterised by high
      concentrations of linoleic acid, stearic acid, odd-chain fatty acids, and
      very-long-chain saturated fatty acids and low concentrations of gamma-linolenic
      acid, palmitic acid, and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids, and it explained
      16.1% of the overall variability of the 27 fatty acids. Based on country-specific
      Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analysis, the FA-pattern
      score was associated with lower incident T2D. Comparing the top to the bottom
      fifth of the score, the hazard ratio of incident T2D was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19-0.29) 
      adjusted for potential confounders and 0.37 (95% CI 0.27-0.50) further adjusted
      for metabolic risk factors. The association changed little after adjustment for
      individual fatty acids or fatty acid subclasses. In cross-sectional analyses
      relating the FA-pattern score to metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors, the
      FA-pattern score was inversely associated with adiposity, triglycerides, liver
      enzymes, C-reactive protein, a genetic score representing insulin resistance, and
      dietary intakes of soft drinks and alcohol and was positively associated with
      high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and intakes of polyunsaturated fat, dietary 
      fibre, and coffee (p < 0.05 each). Limitations include potential measurement
      error in the fatty acids and other model covariates and possible residual
      confounding. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of individual fatty acids, characterised 
      by high concentrations of linoleic acid, odd-chain fatty acids, and very
      long-chain fatty acids, was associated with lower incidence of T2D. The specific 
      fatty acid pattern may be influenced by metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors.

TI  - Quantifying underreporting of law-enforcement-related deaths in United States
      vital statistics and news-media-based data sources: A capture-recapture analysis.
PG  - e1002399
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002399 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research suggests that United States governmental sources
      documenting the number of law-enforcement-related deaths (i.e., fatalities due to
      injuries inflicted by law enforcement officers) undercount these incidents. The
      National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), administered by the federal government
      and based on state death certificate data, identifies such deaths by assigning
      them diagnostic codes corresponding to "legal intervention" in accordance with
      the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10). Newer,
      nongovernmental databases track law-enforcement-related deaths by compiling news 
      media reports and provide an opportunity to assess the magnitude and determinants
      of suspected NVSS underreporting. Our a priori hypotheses were that
      underreporting by the NVSS would exceed that by the news media sources, and that 
      underreporting rates would be higher for decedents of color versus white,
      decedents in lower versus higher income counties, decedents killed by non-firearm
      (e.g., Taser) versus firearm mechanisms, and deaths recorded by a medical
      examiner versus coroner. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a new US-wide dataset
      by matching cases reported in a nongovernmental, news-media-based dataset
      produced by the newspaper The Guardian, The Counted, to identifiable NVSS
      mortality records for 2015. We conducted 2 main analyses for this cross-sectional
      study: (1) an estimate of the total number of deaths and the proportion
      unreported by each source using capture-recapture analysis and (2) an assessment 
      of correlates of underreporting of law-enforcement-related deaths (demographic
      characteristics of the decedent, mechanism of death, death investigator type
      [medical examiner versus coroner], county median income, and county urbanicity)
      in the NVSS using multilevel logistic regression. We estimated that the total
      number of law-enforcement-related deaths in 2015 was 1,166 (95% CI: 1,153,
      1,184). There were 599 deaths reported in The Counted only, 36 reported in the
      NVSS only, 487 reported in both lists, and an estimated 44 (95% CI: 31, 62) not
      reported in either source. The NVSS documented 44.9% (95% CI: 44.2%, 45.4%) of
      the total number of deaths, and The Counted documented 93.1% (95% CI: 91.7%,
      94.2%). In a multivariable mixed-effects logistic model that controlled for all
      individual- and county-level covariates, decedents injured by non-firearm
      mechanisms had higher odds of underreporting in the NVSS than those injured by
      firearms (odds ratio [OR]: 68.2; 95% CI: 15.7, 297.5; p < 0.01), and
      underreporting was also more likely outside of the highest-income-quintile
      counties (OR for the lowest versus highest income quintile: 10.1; 95% CI: 2.4,
      42.8; p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of
      underreporting in the NVSS for deaths certified by coroners compared to medical
      examiners, and the odds of underreporting did not vary by race/ethnicity. One
      limitation of our analyses is that we were unable to examine the characteristics 
      of cases that were unreported in The Counted. CONCLUSIONS: The media-based
      source, The Counted, reported a considerably higher proportion of
      law-enforcement-related deaths than the NVSS, which failed to report a majority
      of these incidents. For the NVSS, rates of underreporting were higher in lower
      income counties and for decedents killed by non-firearm mechanisms. There was no 
      evidence suggesting that underreporting varied by death investigator type
      (medical examiner versus coroner) or race/ethnicity.

TI  - The clinical utility and cost impact of cystatin C measurement in the diagnosis
      and management of chronic kidney disease: A primary care cohort study.
PG  - e1002400
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To reduce over-diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) resulting
      from the inaccuracy of creatinine-based estimates of glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR), UK and international guidelines recommend that cystatin-C-based estimates 
      of GFR be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis in people with GFR 45-59
      ml/min/1.73 m2 and no albuminuria (CKD G3aA1). Whilst there is good evidence for 
      cystatin C being a marker of GFR and risk in people with CKD, its use to define
      CKD in this manner has not been evaluated in primary care, the setting in which
      most people with GFR in this range are managed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 
      1,741 people with CKD G3a or G3b defined by 2 estimated GFR (eGFR) values more
      than 90 days apart were recruited to the Renal Risk in Derby study between June
      2008 and March 2010. Using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
      (CKD-EPI) equations, we compared GFR estimated from creatinine (eGFRcreat),
      cystatin C (eGFRcys), and both (eGFRcreat-cys) at baseline and over 5 years of
      follow-up. We analysed the proportion of participants with CKD G3aA1 reclassified
      to 'no CKD' or more advanced CKD with the latter two equations. We further
      assessed the impact of using cystatin-C-based eGFR in risk prediction equations
      for CKD progression and all-cause mortality and investigated non-GFR determinants
      of eGFRcys. Finally, we estimated the cost implications of implementing National 
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance to use eGFRcys to
      confirm the diagnosis in people classified as CKD G3aA1 by eGFRcreat. Mean
      eGFRcys was significantly lower than mean eGFRcreat (45.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI 
      44.4 to 45.9, versus 53.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI 53.0 to 54.1, P < 0.001).
      eGFRcys reclassified 7.7% (50 of 653) of those with CKD G3aA1 by eGFRcreat to
      eGFR >/= 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. However, a much greater proportion (59.0%, 385 of
      653) were classified to an eGFR category indicating more severe CKD. A similar
      pattern was seen using eGFRcreat-cys, but lower proportions were reclassified.
      Change in eGFRcreat and eGFRcys over 5 years were weakly correlated (r = 0.33, P 
      < 0.001), but eGFRcys identified more people as having CKD progression (18.2%
      versus 10.5%). Multivariable analysis using eGFRcreat as an independent variable 
      identified age, smoking status, body mass index, haemoglobin, serum uric acid,
      serum albumin, albuminuria, and C reactive protein as non-GFR determinants of
      eGFRcys. Use of eGFRcys or eGFRcreat-cys did not improve discrimination in risk
      prediction models for CKD progression and all-cause mortality compared to similar
      models with eGFRcreat. Application of the NICE guidance, which assumed cost
      savings, to participants with CKD G3aA1 increased the cost of monitoring by
      pound23 per patient, which if extrapolated to be applied throughout England would
      increase the cost of testing and monitoring CKD by approximately pound31 million 
      per year. Limitations of this study include the lack of a measured GFR and the
      potential lack of ethnic diversity in the study cohort. CONCLUSIONS:
      Implementation of current guidelines on eGFRcys testing in our study population
      of older people in primary care resulted in only a small reduction in diagnosed
      CKD but classified a greater proportion as having more advanced CKD than
      eGFRcreat. Use of eGFRcys did not improve risk prediction in this population and 
      was associated with increased cost. Our data therefore do not support
      implementation of these recommendations in primary care. Further studies are
      warranted to define the most appropriate clinical application of eGFRcys and
      eGFRcreat-cys.

TI  - Associations between an IgG3 polymorphism in the binding domain for FcRn,
      transplacental transfer of malaria-specific IgG3, and protection against
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria during infancy: A birth cohort study in Benin.
PG  - e1002403
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002403 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transplacental transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the
      fetus helps to protect against malaria and other infections in infancy. Recent
      studies have emphasized the important role of malaria-specific IgG3 in malaria
      immunity, and its transfer may reduce the risk of malaria in infancy. Human IgGs 
      are actively transferred across the placenta by binding the neonatal Fc receptor 
      (FcRn) expressed within the endosomes of the syncytiotrophoblastic membrane.
      Histidine at position 435 (H435) provides for optimal Fc-IgG binding. In contrast
      to other IgG subclasses, IgG3 is highly polymorphic and usually contains an
      arginine at position 435, which reduces its binding affinity to FcRn in vitro.
      The reduced binding to FcRn is associated with reduced transplacental transfer
      and reduced half-life of IgG3 in vivo. Some haplotypes of IgG3 have histidine at 
      position 435. This study examines the hypotheses that the IgG3-H435 variant
      promotes increased transplacental transfer of malaria-specific antibodies and a
      prolonged IgG3 half-life in infants and that its presence correlates with
      protection against clinical malaria during infancy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In
      Benin, 497 mother-infant pairs were included in a longitudinal birth cohort. Both
      maternal and cord serum samples were assayed for levels of IgG1 and IgG3 specific
      for MSP119, MSP2 (both allelic families, 3D7 and FC27), MSP3, GLURP (both
      regions, R0 and R2), and AMA1 antigens of Plasmodium falciparum. Cord:maternal
      ratios were calculated. The maternal IgG3 gene was sequenced to identify the
      IgG3-H435 polymorphism. A multivariate logistic regression was used to examine
      the association between maternal IgG3-H435 polymorphism and transplacental
      transfer of IgG3, adjusting for hypergammaglobulinemia, maternal malaria, and
      infant malaria exposure. Twenty-four percent of Beninese women living in an area 
      highly endemic for malaria had the IgG3-H435 allele (377 women homozygous for the
      IgG3-R435 allele, 117 women heterozygous for the IgG3-R/H alleles, and 3 women
      homozygous for the IgG3-H435 allele). Women with the IgG3-H435 allele had a 78%
      (95% CI 17%, 170%, p = 0.007) increased transplacental transfer of GLURP-R2 IgG3 
      compared to those without the IgG3-H435 allele. Furthermore, in infants born to
      mothers with the IgG3-H435 variant, a 28% longer IgG3 half-life was noted (95% CI
      4%, 59%, p = 0.02) compared to infants born to mothers homozygous for the
      IgG3-R435 allele. Similar findings were observed for AMA1, MSP2-3D7, MSP3,
      GLURP-R0, and GLURP-R2 but not for MSP119 and MSP2-FC27. Infants born to women
      with IgG3-H435 had a 32% lower risk of symptomatic malaria during infancy
      (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.68 [95% CI 0.51, 0.91], p = 0.01) compared to
      infants born to mothers homozygous for IgG3-R435. We did not find a lower risk of
      asymptomatic malaria in infants born to women with or without IgG3-H435.
      Limitations of the study were the inability to determine (i) the actual amount of
      IgG3-H435 relative to IgG-R435 in serum samples and (ii) the proportion of
      malaria-specific IgG produced by infants versus acquired from their mothers.
      CONCLUSIONS: An arginine-to-histidine replacement at residue 435 in the binding
      domain of IgG3 to FcRn increases the transplacental transfer and half-life of
      malaria-specific IgG3 in young infants and is associated with reduced risk of
      clinical malaria during infancy. The IgG3-H435 allele may be under positive
      selection, given its relatively high frequency in malaria endemic areas.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine in adults and
      children in Lambarene, Gabon: A phase I randomised trial.
PG  - e1002402
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine prevented Ebola virus disease when
      used at 2 x 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) in a trial in Guinea. This study
      provides further safety and immunogenicity data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A
      randomised, open-label phase I trial in Lambarene, Gabon, studied 5 single
      intramuscular vaccine doses of 3 x 103, 3 x 104, 3 x 105, 3 x 106, or 2 x 107 PFU
      in 115 adults and a dose of 2 x 107 PFU in 20 adolescents and 20 children. The
      primary objective was safety and tolerability 28 days post-injection.
      Immunogenicity, viraemia, and shedding post-vaccination were evaluated as
      secondary objectives. In adults, mild-to-moderate adverse events were frequent,
      but there were no serious or severe adverse events related to vaccination. Before
      vaccination, Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV)-glycoprotein (GP)-specific and ZEBOV
      antibodies were detected in 11% and 27% of adults, respectively. In adults,
      74%-100% of individuals who received a dose 3 x 104, 3 x 105, 3 x 106, or 2 x 107
      PFU had a >/=4.0-fold increase in geometric mean titres (GMTs) of
      ZEBOV-GP-specific antibodies at day 28, reaching GMTs of 489 (95% CI: 264-908),
      556 (95% CI: 280-1,101), 1,245 (95% CI: 899-1,724), and 1,503 (95% CI:
      931-2,426), respectively. Twenty-two percent of adults had a >/=4-fold increase
      of ZEBOV antibodies, with GMTs at day 28 of 1,015 (647-1,591), 1,887
      (1,154-3,085), 1,445 (1,013-2,062), and 3,958 (2,249-6,967) for the same doses,
      respectively. These antibodies persisted up to day 180 for doses >/=3 x 105 PFU. 
      Adults with antibodies before vaccination had higher GMTs throughout.
      Neutralising antibodies were detected in more than 50% of participants at doses
      >/=3 x 105 PFU. As in adults, no serious or severe adverse events related to
      vaccine occurred in adolescents or children. At day 2, vaccine RNA titres were
      higher for adolescents and children than adults. At day 7, 78% of adolescents and
      35% of children had recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus RNA detectable in
      saliva. The vaccine induced high GMTs of ZEBOV-GP-specific antibodies at day 28
      in adolescents, 1,428 (95% CI: 1,025-1,989), and children, 1,620 (95% CI:
      806-3,259), and in both groups antibody titres increased up to day 180. The
      absence of a control group, lack of stratification for baseline antibody status, 
      and imbalances in male/female ratio are the main limitations of this study.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile of
      the 2 x 107 PFU dose in adults and support consideration of lower doses for
      paediatric populations and those who request boosting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pan
      African Clinical Trials Registry PACTR201411000919191.

TI  - Assessing the neuroprotective benefits for babies of antenatal magnesium
      sulphate: An individual participant data meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002398
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002398 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Babies born preterm are at an increased risk of dying in the first
      weeks of life, and those who survive have a higher rate of cerebral palsy (CP)
      compared with babies born at term. The aim of this individual participant data
      (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) was to assess the effects of antenatal magnesium
      sulphate, compared with no magnesium treatment, given to women at risk of preterm
      birth on important maternal and fetal outcomes, including survival free of CP,
      and whether effects differed by participant or treatment characteristics such as 
      the reason the woman was at risk of preterm birth, why treatment was given, the
      gestational age at which magnesium sulphate treatment was received, or the dose
      and timing of the administration of magnesium sulphate. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Trials in which women considered at risk of preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation) 
      were randomised to magnesium sulphate or control treatment and where neurologic
      outcomes for the baby were reported were eligible for inclusion. The primary
      outcomes were infant death or CP and severe maternal outcome potentially related 
      to treatment. Studies were identified based on the Cochrane Pregnancy and
      Childbirth search strategy using the terms [antenatal or prenatal] and
      [magnesium] and [preterm or premature or neuroprotection or 'cerebral palsy'].
      The date of the last search was 28 February 2017. IPD were sought from
      investigators with eligible trials. Risk of bias was assessed using criteria from
      the Cochrane Collaboration. For each prespecified outcome, IPD were analysed
      using a 1-stage approach. All 5 trials identified were included, with 5,493 women
      and 6,131 babies. Overall, there was no clear effect of magnesium sulphate
      treatment compared with no treatment on the primary infant composite outcome of
      death or CP (relative risk [RR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.05, 
      6,131 babies, 5 trials, p = 0.07 for heterogeneity of treatment effect across
      trials). In the prespecified sensitivity analysis restricted to data from the 4
      trials in which the intent of treatment was fetal neuroprotection, there was a
      significant reduction in the risk of death or CP with magnesium sulphate
      treatment compared with no treatment (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99, 4,448 babies,
      4 trials), with no significant heterogeneity (p = 0.28). The number needed to
      treat (NNT) to benefit was 41 women/babies to prevent 1 baby from either dying or
      having CP. For the primary outcome of severe maternal outcome potentially related
      to magnesium sulphate treatment, no events were recorded from the 2 trials
      providing data. When the individual components of the composite infant outcome
      were assessed, no effect was seen for death overall (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to
      1.17, 6,131 babies, 5 trials) or in the analysis of death using only data from
      trials with the intent of fetal neuroprotection (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13,
      4,448 babies, 4 trials). For cerebral palsy in survivors, magnesium sulphate
      treatment had a strong protective effect in both the overall analysis (RR 0.68,
      95% CI 0.54 to 0.87, 4,601 babies, 5 trials, NNT to benefit 46) and the
      neuroprotective intent analysis (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.87, 3,988 babies, 4
      trials, NNT to benefit 42). No statistically significant differences were seen
      for any of the other secondary outcomes. The treatment effect varied little by
      the reason the woman was at risk of preterm birth, the gestational age at which
      magnesium sulphate treatment was given, the total dose received, or whether
      maintenance therapy was used. A limitation of the study was that not all trials
      could provide the data required for the planned analyses so that combined with
      low event rates for some important clinical events, the power to find a
      difference was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal magnesium sulphate given prior to 
      preterm birth for fetal neuroprotection prevents CP and reduces the combined risk
      of fetal/infant death or CP. Benefit is seen regardless of the reason for preterm
      birth, with similar effects across a range of preterm gestational ages and
      different treatment regimens. Widespread adoption worldwide of this relatively
      inexpensive, easy-to-administer treatment would lead to important global health
      benefits for infants born preterm.

TI  - Gabapentin, opioids, and the risk of opioid-related death: A population-based
      nested case-control study.
PG  - e1002396
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002396 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prescription opioid use is highly associated with risk of
      opioid-related death, with 1 of every 550 chronic opioid users dying within
      approximately 2.5 years of their first opioid prescription. Although gabapentin
      is widely perceived as safe, drug-induced respiratory depression has been
      described when gabapentin is used alone or in combination with other medications.
      Because gabapentin and opioids are both commonly prescribed for pain, the
      likelihood of co-prescription is high. However, no published studies have
      examined whether concomitant gabapentin therapy is associated with an increased
      risk of accidental opioid-related death in patients receiving opioids. The
      objective of this study was to investigate whether co-prescription of opioids and
      gabapentin is associated with an increased risk of accidental opioid-related
      mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based nested
      case-control study among opioid users who were residents of Ontario, Canada,
      between August 1, 1997, and December 31, 2013, using administrative databases.
      Cases, defined as opioid users who died of an opioid-related cause, were matched 
      with up to 4 controls who also used opioids on age, sex, year of index date,
      history of chronic kidney disease, and a disease risk index. After matching, we
      included 1,256 cases and 4,619 controls. The primary exposure was concomitant
      gabapentin use in the 120 days preceding the index date. A secondary analysis
      characterized gabapentin dose as low (<900 mg daily), moderate (900 to 1,799 mg
      daily), or high (>/=1,800 mg daily). A sensitivity analysis examined the effect
      of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in the preceding
      120 days. Overall, 12.3% of cases (155 of 1,256) and 6.8% of controls (313 of
      4,619) were prescribed gabapentin in the prior 120 days. After multivariable
      adjustment, co-prescription of opioids and gabapentin was associated with a
      significantly increased odds of opioid-related death (odds ratio [OR] 1.99, 95%
      CI 1.61 to 2.47, p < 0.001; adjusted OR [aOR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88, p <
      0.001) compared to opioid prescription alone. In the dose-response analysis,
      moderate-dose (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.87, p < 0.001; aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 
      2.28, p = 0.024) and high-dose (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.08, p < 0.001; aOR
      1.58, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.27, p = 0.015) gabapentin use was associated with a nearly
      60% increase in the odds of opioid-related death relative to no concomitant
      gabapentin use. As expected, we found no significant association between
      co-prescription of opioids and NSAIDs and opioid-related death (OR 1.11, 95% CI
      0.98 to 1.27, p = 0.113; aOR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.32, p = 0.083). In an
      exploratory analysis of patients at risk of combined opioid and gabapentin use,
      we found that 46.0% (45,173 of 98,288) of gabapentin users in calendar year 2013 
      received at least 1 concomitant prescription for an opioid. This study was
      limited to individuals eligible for public drug coverage in Ontario, we were only
      able to identify prescriptions reimbursed by the government and dispensed from
      retail pharmacies, and information on indication for gabapentin use was not
      available. Furthermore, as with all observational studies, confounding due to
      unmeasured variables is a potential source of bias. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we
      found that among patients receiving prescription opioids, concomitant treatment
      with gabapentin was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of
      opioid-related death. Clinicians should consider carefully whether to continue
      prescribing this combination of products and, when the combination is deemed
      necessary, should closely monitor their patients and adjust opioid dose
      accordingly. Future research should investigate whether a similar interaction
      exists between pregabalin and opioids.

TI  - Chronic disease concordance within Indian households: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - e1002395
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002395 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The household is a potentially important but understudied unit of
      analysis and intervention in chronic disease research. We sought to estimate the 
      association between living with someone with a chronic condition and one's own
      chronic condition status. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional
      analysis of population-based household- and individual-level data collected in 4 
      socioculturally and geographically diverse settings across rural and urban India 
      in 2013 and 2014. Of 10,703 adults ages 18 years and older with coresiding
      household members surveyed, data from 7,522 adults (mean age 39 years) in 2,574
      households with complete covariate information were analyzed. The main outcome
      measures were diabetes (fasting plasma glucose >/= 126 mg/dL or taking
      medication), common mental disorder (General Health Questionnaire score >/= 12), 
      hypertension (blood pressure >/= 140/90 mmHg or taking medication), obesity (body
      mass index >/= 30 kg/m2), and high cholesterol (total blood cholesterol >/= 240
      mg/dL or taking medication). Logistic regression with generalized estimating
      equations was used to model associations with adjustment for a participant's age,
      sex, education, marital status, religion, and study site. Inverse probability
      weighting was applied to account for missing data. We found that 44% of adults
      had 1 or more of the chronic conditions examined. Irrespective of familial
      relationship, adults who resided with another adult with any chronic condition
      had 29% higher adjusted relative odds of having 1 or more chronic conditions
      themselves (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
      1.10-1.50). We also observed positive statistically significant associations of
      diabetes, common mental disorder, and hypertension with any chronic condition
      (aORs ranging from 1.19 to 1.61) in the analysis of all coresiding household
      members. Associations, however, were stronger for concordance of certain chronic 
      conditions among coresiding household members. Specifically, we observed positive
      statistically significant associations between living with another adult with
      diabetes (aOR = 1.60; 95% CI 1.23-2.07), common mental disorder (aOR = 2.69; 95% 
      CI 2.12-3.42), or obesity (aOR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.33-2.50) and having the same
      condition. Among separate analyses of dyads of parents and their adult children
      and dyads of spouses, the concordance between the chronic disease status was
      striking. The associations between common mental disorder, hypertension, obesity,
      and high cholesterol in parents and those same conditions in their adult children
      were aOR = 2.20 (95% CI 1.28-3.77), 1.58 (95% CI 1.15-2.16), 4.99 (95% CI
      2.71-9.20), and 2.57 (95% CI 1.15-5.73), respectively. The associations between
      diabetes and common mental disorder in husbands and those same conditions in
      their wives were aORs = 2.28 (95% CI 1.52-3.42) and 3.01 (95% CI 2.01-4.52),
      respectively. Relative odds were raised even across different chronic condition
      phenotypes; specifically, we observed positive statistically significant
      associations between hypertension and obesity in the total sample of all
      coresiding adults (aOR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.02-1.52), high cholesterol and diabetes
      in the adult-parent sample (aOR = 2.02; 95% CI 1.08-3.78), and hypertension and
      diabetes in the spousal sample (aOR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.05-2.17). Of all
      associations examined, only the relationship between hypertension and diabetes in
      the adult-parent dyads was statistically significantly negative (aOR = 0.62; 95% 
      CI 0.40-0.94). Relatively small samples in the dyadic analysis and site-specific 
      analysis call for caution in interpreting qualitative differences between
      associations among different dyad types and geographical locations. Because of
      the cross-sectional nature of the analysis, the findings do not provide
      information on the etiology of incident chronic conditions among household
      members. CONCLUSIONS: We observed strong concordance of chronic conditions within
      coresiding adults across diverse settings in India. These data provide early
      evidence that a household-based approach to chronic disease research may advance 
      public health strategies to prevent and control chronic conditions. TRIAL

TI  - Vaginal progesterone pessaries for pregnant women with a previous preterm birth
      to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (the PROGRESS Study): A
      multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - e1002390
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, as a consequence of preterm
      birth, is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity. The withdrawal of
      progesterone, either actual or functional, is thought to be an antecedent to the 
      onset of labour. There remains limited information on clinically relevant health 
      outcomes as to whether vaginal progesterone may be of benefit for pregnant women 
      with a history of a previous preterm birth, who are at high risk of a recurrence.
      Our primary aim was to assess whether the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries
      in women with a history of previous spontaneous preterm birth reduced the risk
      and severity of respiratory distress syndrome in their infants, with secondary
      aims of examining the effects on other neonatal morbidities and maternal health
      and assessing the adverse effects of treatment. METHODS: Women with a live
      singleton or twin pregnancy between 18 to <24 weeks' gestation and a history of
      prior preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation in the preceding pregnancy, 
      where labour occurred spontaneously or in association with cervical incompetence 
      or following preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were eligible. Women
      were recruited from 39 Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian maternity hospitals 
      and assigned by randomisation to vaginal progesterone pessaries (equivalent to
      100 mg vaginal progesterone) (n = 398) or placebo (n = 389). Participants and
      investigators were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was
      respiratory distress syndrome and severity. Secondary outcomes were other
      respiratory morbidities; other adverse neonatal outcomes; adverse outcomes for
      the woman, especially related to preterm birth; and side effects of progesterone 
      treatment. Data were analysed for all the 787 women (100%) randomised and their
      799 infants. FINDINGS: Most women used their allocated study treatment (740
      women, 94.0%), with median use similar for both study groups (51.0 days,
      interquartile range [IQR] 28.0-69.0, in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days, 
      IQR 27.0-76.0, in the placebo group). The incidence of respiratory distress
      syndrome was similar in both study groups-10.5% (42/402) in the progesterone
      group and 10.6% (41/388) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk [RR] 0.98, 
      95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-1.49, p = 0.912)-as was the severity of any
      neonatal respiratory disease (adjusted treatment effect 1.02, 95% CI 0.69-1.53, p
      = 0.905). No differences were seen between study groups for other respiratory
      morbidities and adverse infant outcomes, including serious infant composite
      outcome (155/406 [38.2%] in the progesterone group and 152/393 [38.7%] in the
      placebo group, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82-1.17, p = 0.798). The proportion of 
      infants born before 37 weeks' gestation was similar in both study groups (148/406
      [36.5%] in the progesterone group and 146/393 [37.2%] in the placebo group,
      adjusted RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.17, p = 0.765). A similar proportion of women in 
      both study groups had maternal morbidities, especially those related to preterm
      birth, or experienced side effects of treatment. In 9.9% (39/394) of the women in
      the progesterone group and 7.3% (28/382) of the women in the placebo group,
      treatment was stopped because of side effects (adjusted RR 1.35, 95% CI
      0.85-2.15, p = 0.204). The main limitation of the study was that almost 9% of the
      women did not start the medication or forgot to use it 3 or more times a week.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries
      in women with a history of a previous spontaneous preterm birth to reduce the
      risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or other neonatal and maternal
      morbidities related to preterm birth. Individual participant data meta-analysis
      of the relevant trials may identify specific women for whom vaginal progesterone 
      might be of benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Clinical Trials ISRCTN20269066.

TI  - Risk, treatment duration, and recurrence risk of postpartum affective disorder in
      women with no prior psychiatric history: A population-based cohort study.
PG  - e1002392
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002392 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some 5%-15% of all women experience postpartum depression (PPD),
      which for many is their first psychiatric disorder. The purpose of this study was
      to estimate the incidence of postpartum affective disorder (AD), duration of
      treatment, and rate of subsequent postpartum AD and other affective episodes in a
      nationwide cohort of women with no prior psychiatric history. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Linking information from several Danish national registers, we
      constructed a cohort of 457,317 primiparous mothers with first birth (and
      subsequent births) from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2013 (a total of 789,068
      births) and no prior psychiatric hospital contacts and/or use of antidepressants.
      These women were followed from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2014. Postpartum AD 
      was defined as use of antidepressants and/or hospital contact for PPD within 6
      months after childbirth. The main outcome measures were risk of postpartum AD,
      duration of treatment, and recurrence risk. We observed 4,550 (0.6%) postpartum
      episodes of AD. The analyses of treatment duration showed that 1 year after the
      initiation of treatment for their first episode, 27.9% of women were still in
      treatment; after 4 years, 5.4%. The recurrence risk of postpartum AD for women
      with a PPD hospital contact after first birth was 55.4 per 100 person-years; for 
      women with postpartum antidepressant medication after first birth, it was 35.0
      per 100 person-years. The rate of postpartum AD after second birth for women with
      no history of postpartum AD was 1.2 per 100 person-years. After adjusting for
      year of birth and mother's age, women with PPD hospital contact after first birth
      had a 46.4 times higher rate (95% CI 31.5-68.4) and women with postpartum
      antidepressant medication after their first birth had a 26.9 times higher rate
      (95% CI 21.9-33.2) of a recurrent postpartum episode after their second birth
      compared to women with no postpartum AD history. Limitations include the use of
      registry data to identify cases and limited confounder control. CONCLUSIONS: In
      this study, an episode of postpartum AD was observed for 0.6% of childbirths
      among women with no prior psychiatric history. The observed episodes were
      characterized by a relatively short treatment duration, yet the women had a
      notably high rate of later AD and recurrent episodes of postpartum AD. The
      recurrence risk of postpartum AD was markedly higher among women with PPD
      hospital contact after first birth compared to women with postpartum
      antidepressant medication after first birth. Our results underline the necessity 
      of measures targeted at specific vulnerable groups, such as women who experience 
      PPD as a first psychiatric episode.

TI  - Cervical screening with primary HPV testing or cytology in a population of women 
      in which those aged 33 years or younger had previously been offered HPV
      vaccination: Results of the Compass pilot randomised trial.
PG  - e1002388
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical
      screening increases detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic
      lesions and invasive cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ [CIN2+])
      compared to cytology, but no evaluation has been conducted in a population
      previously offered HPV vaccination. We aimed to assess colposcopy referral and
      CIN2+ detection rates for HPV-screened versus cytology-screened women in
      Australia's HPV-vaccinated population (by 2014, resident women </=33 years had
      been age-eligible for HPV vaccination, with 3-dose uptake across age cohorts
      being about 50%-77%). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Compass is an open-label randomised
      trial of 5-yearly HPV screening versus 2.5-yearly liquid-based cytology (LBC)
      screening. In the first phase, consenting women aged 25-64 years presenting for
      routine screening at 47 primary practices in Victoria, Australia, provided a
      cervical sample and were randomised at a central laboratory at a 1:2:2 allocation
      to (i) image-read LBC screening with HPV triage of low-grade cytology ('LBC
      screening'), (ii) HPV screening with those HPV16/18 positive referred to
      colposcopy and with LBC triage for other oncogenic (OHR) types ('HPV+LBC
      triage'), or (iii) HPV screening with those HPV16/18 positive referred to
      colposcopy and with dual-stained cytology triage for OHR types ('HPV+DS triage').
      A total of 5,006 eligible women were recruited from 29 October 2013 to 7 November
      2014 (recruitment rate 58%); of these, 22% were in the group age-eligible for
      vaccination. Data on 4,995 participants were analysed after 11 withdrawals; 998
      were assigned to, and 995 analysed (99.7%) in, the LBC-screened group; 1,996
      assigned to and 1,992 analysed (99.8%) in the HPV+LBC triage group; and 2,012
      assigned to and 2,008 analysed (99.8%) in the HPV+DS triage group. No serious
      trial-related adverse events were reported. The main outcomes were colposcopy
      referral and detected CIN2+ rates at baseline screening, assessed on an
      intention-to-treat basis after follow-up of the subgroup of triage-negative women
      in each arm referred to 12 months of surveillance, and after a further 6 months
      of follow-up for histological outcomes (dataset closed 31 August 2016). Analysis 
      was adjusted for whether women had been age-eligible for HPV vaccination or not. 
      For the LBC-screened group, the overall referral and detected CIN2+ rates were
      27/995 (2.7% [95% CI 1.8%-3.9%]) and 1/995 (0.1% [95% CI 0.0%-0.6%]),
      respectively; for HPV+LBC triage, these were 75/1,992 (3.8% [95% CI 3.0%-4.7%])
      and 20/1,992 (1.0% [95% CI 0.6%-1.5%]); and for HPV+DS triage, these were
      79/2,008 (3.9% [95% CI 3.1%-4.9%]) and 24/2,008 (1.2% [95% CI 0.8%-1.6%]) (p =
      0.09 for difference in referral rate in LBC versus all HPV-screened women; p =
      0.003 for difference in CIN2+ detection rate in LBC versus all HPV-screened
      women, with p = 0.62 between HPV screening groups). Limitations include that the 
      study population involved a relatively low risk group in a previously
      well-screened and treated population, that individual women's vaccination status 
      was unknown, and that long-term follow-up data on disease detection in
      screen-negative women are not yet available. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, primary 
      HPV screening was associated with significantly increased detection of high-grade
      precancerous cervical lesions compared to cytology, in a population where high
      vaccine uptake was reported in women aged 33 years or younger who were offered
      vaccination. It had been predicted that increased disease detection might be
      associated with a transient increase in colposcopy referral rates in the first
      round of HPV screening, possibly dampened by HPV vaccine effect; in this study,
      although the point estimates for referral rates in women in each HPV-screened
      group were 41%-44% higher than in cytology-screened women, the difference in
      referral rate between cytology- and HPV-screened women was not significant. These
      findings provide initial support for the implementation of primary HPV screening 
      in vaccinated populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical

TI  - Self-monitoring of blood pressure in hypertension: A systematic review and
      individual patient data meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002389
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002389 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood pressure (BP) appears to reduce BP in
      hypertension but important questions remain regarding effective implementation
      and which groups may benefit most. This individual patient data (IPD)
      meta-analysis was performed to better understand the effectiveness of BP
      self-monitoring to lower BP and control hypertension. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised trials
      comparing self-monitoring to no self-monitoring in hypertensive patients (June
      2016). Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and the
      authors of eligible trials were approached requesting IPD. Of 2,846 articles in
      the initial search, 36 were eligible. IPD were provided from 25 trials, including
      1 unpublished study. Data for the primary outcomes-change in mean clinic or
      ambulatory BP and proportion controlled below target at 12 months-were available 
      from 15/19 possible studies (7,138/8,292 [86%] of randomised participants).
      Overall, self-monitoring was associated with reduced clinic systolic blood
      pressure (sBP) compared to usual care at 12 months (-3.2 mmHg, [95% CI -4.9, -1.6
      mmHg]). However, this effect was strongly influenced by the intensity of
      co-intervention ranging from no effect with self-monitoring alone (-1.0 mmHg
      [-3.3, 1.2]), to a 6.1 mmHg (-9.0, -3.2) reduction when monitoring was combined
      with intensive support. Self-monitoring was most effective in those with fewer
      antihypertensive medications and higher baseline sBP up to 170 mmHg. No
      differences in efficacy were seen by sex or by most comorbidities. Ambulatory BP 
      data at 12 months were available from 4 trials (1,478 patients), which assessed
      self-monitoring with little or no co-intervention. There was no association
      between self-monitoring and either lower clinic or ambulatory sBP in this group
      (clinic -0.2 mmHg [-2.2, 1.8]; ambulatory 1.1 mmHg [-0.3, 2.5]). Results for
      diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were similar. The main limitation of this work was
      that significant heterogeneity remained. This was at least in part due to
      different inclusion criteria, self-monitoring regimes, and target BPs in included
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: Self-monitoring alone is not associated with lower BP or
      better control, but in conjunction with co-interventions (including systematic
      medication titration by doctors, pharmacists, or patients; education; or
      lifestyle counselling) leads to clinically significant BP reduction which
      persists for at least 12 months. The implementation of self-monitoring in
      hypertension should be accompanied by such co-interventions.

TI  - Sustained effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Healthy Activity Programme,
      a brief psychological treatment for depression delivered by lay counsellors in
      primary care: 12-month follow-up of a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e1002385
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Healthy Activity Programme (HAP), a brief behavioural
      intervention delivered by lay counsellors, enhanced remission over 3 months among
      primary care attendees with depression in peri-urban and rural settings in India.
      We evaluated the sustainability of the effects after treatment termination, the
      cost-effectiveness of HAP over 12 months, and the effects of the hypothesized
      mediator of activation on clinical outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Primary care
      attendees aged 18-65 years screened with moderately severe to severe depression
      on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) were randomised to either HAP plus 
      enhanced usual care (EUC) (n = 247) or EUC alone (n = 248), of whom 95% completed
      assessments at 3 months, and 91% at 12 months. Primary outcomes were severity on 
      the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and remission on the PHQ-9. HAP
      participants maintained the gains they showed at the end of treatment through the
      12-month follow-up (difference in mean BDI-II score between 3 and 12 months =
      -0.34; 95% CI -2.37, 1.69; p = 0.74), with lower symptom severity scores than
      participants who received EUC alone (adjusted mean difference in BDI-II score =
      -4.45; 95% CI -7.26, -1.63; p = 0.002) and higher rates of remission (adjusted
      prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.36; 95% CI 1.15, 1.61; p < 0.009). They also fared
      better on most secondary outcomes, including recovery (aPR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.29,
      3.03; p = 0.002), any response over time (aPR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.27, 1.66; p <
      0.001), higher likelihood of reporting a minimal clinically important difference 
      (aPR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.17, 1.71; p < 0.001), and lower likelihood of reporting
      suicidal behaviour (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.51, 1.01; p = 0.06). HAP plus EUC also
      had a marginal effect on WHO Disability Assessment Schedule score at 12 months
      (aPR = -1.58; 95% CI -3.33, 0.17; p = 0.08); other outcomes (days unable to work,
      intimate partner violence toward females) did not statistically significantly
      differ between the two arms. Economic analyses indicated that HAP plus EUC was
      dominant over EUC alone, with lower costs and better outcomes; uncertainty
      analysis showed that from this health system perspective there was a 95% chance
      of HAP being cost-effective, given a willingness to pay threshold of
      Intl$16,060-equivalent to GDP per capita in Goa-per quality-adjusted life year
      gained. Patient-reported behavioural activation level at 3 months mediated the
      effect of the HAP intervention on the 12-month depression score (beta = -2.62;
      95% CI -3.28, -1.97; p < 0.001). Serious adverse events were infrequent, and
      prevalence was similar by arm. We were unable to assess possible episodes of
      remission and relapse that may have occurred between our outcome assessment time 
      points of 3 and 12 months after randomisation. We did not account for or evaluate
      the effect of mediators other than behavioural activation. CONCLUSIONS: HAP's
      superiority over EUC at the end of treatment was largely stable over time and was
      mediated by patient activation. HAP provides better outcomes at lower costs from 
      a perspective covering publicly funded healthcare services and productivity
      impacts on patients and their families. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry

TI  - Impact of common genetic determinants of Hemoglobin A1c on type 2 diabetes risk
      and diagnosis in ancestrally diverse populations: A transethnic genome-wide
      meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002383
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002383 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is used to diagnose type 2 diabetes (T2D)
      and assess glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Previous genome-wide
      association studies (GWAS) have identified 18 HbA1c-associated genetic variants. 
      These variants proved to be classifiable by their likely biological action as
      erythrocytic (also associated with erythrocyte traits) or glycemic (associated
      with other glucose-related traits). In this study, we tested the hypotheses that,
      in a very large scale GWAS, we would identify more genetic variants associated
      with HbA1c and that HbA1c variants implicated in erythrocytic biology would
      affect the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c. We therefore expanded the number of
      HbA1c-associated loci and tested the effect of genetic risk-scores comprised of
      erythrocytic or glycemic variants on incident diabetes prediction and on
      prevalent diabetes screening performance. Throughout this multiancestry study, we
      kept a focus on interancestry differences in HbA1c genetics performance that
      might influence race-ancestry differences in health outcomes. METHODS & FINDINGS:
      Using genome-wide association meta-analyses in up to 159,940 individuals from 82 
      cohorts of European, African, East Asian, and South Asian ancestry, we identified
      60 common genetic variants associated with HbA1c. We classified variants as
      implicated in glycemic, erythrocytic, or unclassified biology and tested whether 
      additive genetic scores of erythrocytic variants (GS-E) or glycemic variants
      (GS-G) were associated with higher T2D incidence in multiethnic longitudinal
      cohorts (N = 33,241). Nineteen glycemic and 22 erythrocytic variants were
      associated with HbA1c at genome-wide significance. GS-G was associated with
      higher T2D risk (incidence OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.06, per HbA1c-raising allele,
      p = 3 x 10-29); whereas GS-E was not (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01, p = 0.60). In 
      Europeans and Asians, erythrocytic variants in aggregate had only modest effects 
      on the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c. Yet, in African Americans, the X-linked G6PD
      G202A variant (T-allele frequency 11%) was associated with an absolute decrease
      in HbA1c of 0.81%-units (95% CI 0.66-0.96) per allele in hemizygous men, and
      0.68%-units (95% CI 0.38-0.97) in homozygous women. The G6PD variant may cause
      approximately 2% (N = 0.65 million, 95% CI 0.55-0.74) of African American adults 
      with T2D to remain undiagnosed when screened with HbA1c. Limitations include the 
      smaller sample sizes for non-European ancestries and the inability to classify
      approximately one-third of the variants. Further studies in large multiethnic
      cohorts with HbA1c, glycemic, and erythrocytic traits are required to better
      determine the biological action of the unclassified variants. CONCLUSIONS: As
      G6PD deficiency can be clinically silent until illness strikes, we recommend
      investigation of the possible benefits of screening for the G6PD genotype along
      with using HbA1c to diagnose T2D in populations of African ancestry or groups
      where G6PD deficiency is common. Screening with direct glucose measurements, or
      genetically-informed HbA1c diagnostic thresholds in people with G6PD deficiency, 
      may be required to avoid missed or delayed diagnoses.

TI  - Sustained effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Counselling for Alcohol
      Problems, a brief psychological treatment for harmful drinking in men, delivered 
      by lay counsellors in primary care: 12-month follow-up of a randomised controlled
      trial.
PG  - e1002386
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Counselling for Alcohol Problems (CAP), a brief intervention
      delivered by lay counsellors, enhanced remission and abstinence over 3 months
      among male primary care attendees with harmful drinking in a setting in India. We
      evaluated the sustainability of the effects after treatment termination, the
      cost-effectiveness of CAP over 12 months, and the effects of the hypothesized
      mediator 'readiness to change' on clinical outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Male
      primary care attendees aged 18-65 years screening with harmful drinking on the
      Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were randomised to either CAP
      plus enhanced usual care (EUC) (n = 188) or EUC alone (n = 189), of whom 89%
      completed assessments at 3 months, and 84% at 12 months. Primary outcomes were
      remission and mean standard ethanol consumed in the past 14 days, and the
      proposed mediating variable was readiness to change at 3 months. CAP participants
      maintained the gains they showed at the end of treatment through the 12-month
      follow-up, with the proportion with remission (AUDIT score < 8: 54.3% versus
      31.9%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.71 [95% CI 1.32, 2.22]; p < 0.001) and
      abstinence in the past 14 days (45.1% versus 26.4%; adjusted odds ratio 1.92 [95%
      CI 1.19, 3.10]; p = 0.008) being significantly higher in the CAP plus EUC arm
      than in the EUC alone arm. CAP participants also fared better on secondary
      outcomes including recovery (AUDIT score < 8 at 3 and 12 months: 27.4% versus
      15.1%; aPR 1.90 [95% CI 1.21, 3.00]; p = 0.006) and percent of days abstinent
      (mean percent [SD] 71.0% [38.2] versus 55.0% [39.8]; adjusted mean difference
      16.1 [95% CI 7.1, 25.0]; p = 0.001). The intervention effect for remission was
      higher at 12 months than at 3 months (aPR 1.50 [95% CI 1.09, 2.07]). There was no
      evidence of an intervention effect on Patient Health Questionnaire 9 score,
      suicidal behaviour, percentage of days of heavy drinking, Short Inventory of
      Problems score, WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 score, days unable to
      work, or perpetration of intimate partner violence. Economic analyses indicated
      that CAP plus EUC was dominant over EUC alone, with lower costs and better
      outcomes; uncertainty analysis showed a 99% chance of CAP being cost-effective
      per remission achieved from a health system perspective, using a willingness to
      pay threshold equivalent to 1 month's wages for an unskilled manual worker in
      Goa. Readiness to change level at 3 months mediated the effect of CAP on mean
      standard ethanol consumption at 12 months (indirect effect -6.014 [95% CI -13.99,
      -0.046]). Serious adverse events were infrequent, and prevalence was similar by
      arm. The methodological limitations of this trial are the susceptibility of
      self-reported drinking to social desirability bias, the modest participation
      rates of eligible patients, and the examination of mediation effects of only 1
      mediator and in only half of our sample. CONCLUSIONS: CAP's superiority over EUC 
      at the end of treatment was largely stable over time and was mediated by
      readiness to change. CAP provides better outcomes at lower costs from a societal 
      perspective. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN76465238.

TI  - Effectiveness of food supplements in increasing fat-free tissue accretion in
      children with moderate acute malnutrition: A randomised 2 x 2 x 3 factorial trial
      in Burkina Faso.
PG  - e1002387
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) are treated with
      lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) or corn-soy blend (CSB). We assessed the
      effectiveness of (a) matrix, i.e., LNS or CSB, (b) soy quality, i.e., soy isolate
      (SI) or dehulled soy (DS), and (c) percentage of total protein from dry skimmed
      milk, i.e., 0%, 20%, or 50%, in increasing fat-free tissue accretion. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Between September 9, 2013, and August 29, 2014, a randomised 2 x 2 x 3 
      factorial trial recruited 6- to 23-month-old children with MAM in Burkina Faso.
      The intervention comprised 12 weeks of food supplementation providing 500
      kcal/day as LNS or CSB, each containing SI or DS, and 0%, 20%, or 50% of protein 
      from milk. Fat-free mass (FFM) was assessed by deuterium dilution technique. By
      dividing FFM by length squared, the primary outcome was expressed independent of 
      length as FFM index (FFMI) accretion over 12 weeks. Other outcomes comprised
      recovery rate and additional anthropometric measures. Of 1,609 children, 4 died, 
      61 were lost to follow-up, and 119 were transferred out due to supplementation
      being switched to non-experimental products. No children developed allergic
      reaction. At inclusion, 95% were breastfed, mean (SD) weight was 6.91 kg (0.93), 
      with 83.5% (5.5) FFM. In the whole cohort, weight increased 0.90 kg (95% CI 0.88,
      0.93; p < 0.01) comprising 93.5% (95% CI 89.5, 97.3) FFM. As compared to children
      who received CSB, FFMI accretion was increased by 0.083 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.003,
      0.163; p = 0.042) in those who received LNS. In contrast, SI did not increase
      FFMI compared to DS (mean difference 0.038 kg/m2; 95% CI -0.041, 0.118; p =
      0.35), irrespective of matrix. Having 20% milk protein was associated with 0.097 
      kg/m2 (95% CI -0.002, 0.196) greater FFMI accretion than having 0% milk protein, 
      although this difference was not significant (p = 0.055), and there was no effect
      of 50% milk protein (0.049 kg/m2; 95% CI -0.047, 0.146; p = 0.32). There was no
      effect modification by season, admission criteria, or baseline FFMI, stunting,
      inflammation, or breastfeeding (p > 0.05). LNS compared to CSB resulted in 128 g 
      (95% CI 67, 190; p < 0.01) greater weight gain if both contained SI, but there
      was no difference between LNS and CSB if both contained DS (mean difference 22 g;
      95% CI -40, 84; p = 0.49) (interaction p = 0.017). Accordingly, SI compared to DS
      increased weight by 89 g (95% CI 27, 150; p = 0.005) when combined with LNS, but 
      not when combined with CSB. A limitation of this and other food supplementation
      trials is that it is not possible to collect reliable data on individual
      adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, children with MAM mainly gain
      fat-free tissue when rehabilitated. Nevertheless, LNS yields more fat-free tissue
      and higher recovery rates than CSB. Moreover, current LNSs with DS may be
      improved by shifting to SI. The role of milk relative to soy merits further
      research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN42569496.

TI  - Oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine for non-cytotoxic epigenetic gene
      regulation in sickle cell disease: A randomized phase 1 study.
PG  - e1002382
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002382 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), a congenital hemolytic anemia that exacts 
      terrible global morbidity and mortality, is driven by polymerization of mutated
      sickle hemoglobin (HbS) in red blood cells (RBCs). Fetal hemoglobin (HbF)
      interferes with this polymerization, but HbF is epigenetically silenced from
      infancy onward by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). METHODS AND FINDINGS: To
      pharmacologically re-induce HbF by DNMT1 inhibition, this first-in-human clinical
      trial (NCT01685515) combined 2 small molecules-decitabine to deplete DNMT1 and
      tetrahydrouridine (THU) to inhibit cytidine deaminase (CDA), the enzyme that
      otherwise rapidly deaminates/inactivates decitabine, severely limiting its
      half-life, tissue distribution, and oral bioavailability. Oral decitabine doses, 
      administered after oral THU 10 mg/kg, were escalated from a very low starting
      level (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, or 0.16 mg/kg) to identify minimal doses active in
      depleting DNMT1 without cytotoxicity. Patients were SCD adults at risk of early
      death despite standard-of-care, randomized 3:2 to THU-decitabine versus placebo
      in 5 cohorts of 5 patients treated 2X/week for 8 weeks, with 4 weeks of
      follow-up. The primary endpoint was >/= grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity. This
      endpoint was not triggered, and adverse events (AEs) were not significantly
      different in THU-decitabine-versus placebo-treated patients. At the decitabine
      0.16 mg/kg dose, plasma concentrations peaked at approximately 50 nM (Cmax) and
      remained elevated for several hours. This dose decreased DNMT1 protein in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells by >75% and repetitive element CpG methylation
      by approximately 10%, and increased HbF by 4%-9% (P < 0.001), doubling fetal
      hemoglobin-enriched red blood cells (F-cells) up to approximately 80% of total
      RBCs. Total hemoglobin increased by 1.2-1.9 g/dL (P = 0.01) as reticulocytes
      simultaneously decreased; that is, better quality and efficiency of HbF-enriched 
      erythropoiesis elevated hemoglobin using fewer reticulocytes. Also indicating
      better RBC quality, biomarkers of hemolysis, thrombophilia, and inflammation
      (LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein [CRP]) improved. As expected with
      non-cytotoxic DNMT1-depletion, platelets increased and neutrophils concurrently
      decreased, but not to an extent requiring treatment holds. As an early phase
      study, limitations include small patient numbers at each dose level and narrow
      capacity to evaluate clinical benefits. CONCLUSION: Administration of oral
      THU-decitabine to patients with SCD was safe in this study and, by targeting
      DNMT1, upregulated HbF in RBCs. Further studies should investigate clinical
      benefits and potential harms not identified to date. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01685515.

TI  - Women's and men's reports of past-year prevalence of intimate partner violence
      and rape and women's risk factors for intimate partner violence: A multicountry
      cross-sectional study in Asia and the Pacific.
PG  - e1002381
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the past-year prevalence of male-perpetrated intimate
      partner violence (IPV) and risk factors is essential for building evidence-based 
      prevention and monitoring progress to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5.2, but
      so far, population-based research on this remains very limited. The objective of 
      this study is to compare the population prevalence rates of past-year
      male-perpetrated IPV and nonpartner rape from women's and men's reports across 4 
      countries in Asia and the Pacific. A further objective is to describe the risk
      factors associated with women's experience of past-year physical or sexual IPV
      from women's reports and factors driving women's past-year experience of partner 
      violence. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This paper presents findings from the United
      Nations Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific. In the
      course of this study, in population-based cross-sectional surveys, 5,206 men and 
      3,106 women aged 18-49 years were interviewed from 4 countries: Cambodia, China, 
      Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Sri Lanka. To measure risk factors, we use logistic
      regression and structural equation modelling to show pathways and mediators. The 
      analysis was not based on a written plan, and following a reviewer's comments,
      some material was moved to supplementary files and the regression was performed
      without variable elimination. Men reported more lifetime perpetration of IPV
      (physical or sexual IPV range 32.5%-80%) than women did experience (physical or
      sexual IPV range 27.5%-67.4%), but women's reports of past-year experience
      (physical or sexual IPV range 8.2%-32.1%) were not very clearly different from
      men's (physical or sexual IPV range 10.1%-34.0%). Women reported much more
      emotional/economic abuse (past-year ranges 1.4%-5.7% for men and 4.1%-27.7% for
      women). Reports of nonpartner rape were similar for men (range 0.8%-1.9% in the
      past year) and women (range 0.4%-2.3% in past year), except in Bougainville,
      where they were higher for men (11.7% versus 5.7%). The risk factor modelling
      shows 4 groups of variables to be important in experience of past-year sexual
      and/or physical IPV: (1) poverty, (2) all childhood trauma, (3) quarrelling and
      women's limited control in relationships, and (4) partner factors (substance
      abuse, unemployment, and infidelity). The population attributable fraction (PAF) 
      was largest for quarrelling often, but the second greatest PAF was for the group 
      related to exposure to violence in childhood. The relationship control variable
      group had the third highest PAF, followed by other partner factors. Currently
      married women were also more at risk. In the structural model, a resilience
      pathway showed less poverty, higher education, and more gender-equitable ideas
      were connected and conveyed protection from IPV. These are all amenable risk
      factors. This research was cross-sectional, so we cannot be sure of the temporal 
      sequence of exposure, but the outcome being a past-year measure to some extent
      mitigates this problem. CONCLUSIONS: Past-year IPV indicators based on women's
      reported experience that were developed to track SDG 5 are probably reasonably
      reliable but will not always give the same prevalence as may be reported by men. 
      Report validity requires further research. Interviews with men to track past-year
      nonpartner rape perpetration are feasible and important. The findings suggest a
      range of factors are associated with past-year physical and/or sexual IPV
      exposure; of particular interest is the resilience pathway suggested by the
      structural model, which is highly amenable to intervention and explains why
      combining economic empowerment of women and gender empowerment/relationship
      skills training has been successful. This study provides additional rationale for
      scaling up violence prevention interventions that combine economic and gender
      empowerment/relationship skills building of women, as well as the value of
      investing in girls' education with a view to long-term violence reduction.

TI  - Unsupervised primaquine for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria relapses in
      southern Papua: A hospital-based cohort study.
PG  - e1002379
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002379 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primaquine is the only licensed drug for eradicating Plasmodium vivax
      hypnozoites and, therefore, preventing relapses of vivax malaria. It is a vital
      component of global malaria elimination efforts. Primaquine is efficacious when
      supervised in clinical trials, but its effectiveness in real-world settings is
      unknown. We aimed to determine whether unsupervised primaquine was effective for 
      preventing re-presentation to hospital with vivax malaria in southern Papua,
      Indonesia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Routinely-collected hospital surveillance data
      were used to undertake a pragmatic comparison of the risk of re-presentation to
      hospital with vivax malaria in patients prescribed dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      (DHP) combined with primaquine versus those patients prescribed DHP alone. The
      omission of primaquine was predominantly due to 3 stock outages. Individual
      clinical, pharmacy, and laboratory data were merged using individual hospital
      identification numbers and the date of presentation to hospital. Between April
      2004 and December 2013, there were 86,797 documented episodes of vivax malaria,
      of which 62,492 (72.0%) were included in the analysis. The risk of
      re-presentation with vivax malaria within 1 year was 33.8% (95% confidence
      Interval [CI] 33.1%-34.5%) after initial monoinfection with P. vivax and 29.2%
      (95% CI 28.1%-30.4%) after mixed-species infection. The risk of re-presentation
      with P. vivax malaria was higher in children 1 to <5 years of age (49.6% [95% CI 
      48.4%-50.9%]) compared to patients 15 years of age or older (24.2% [95% CI
      23.4-24.9%]); Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) = 2.23 (95% CI 2.15-2.31), p < 0.001.
      Overall, the risk of re-presentation was 37.2% (95% CI 35.6%-38.8%) in patients
      who were prescribed no primaquine compared to 31.6% (95% CI 30.9%-32.3%) in those
      prescribed either a low (>/=1.5 mg/kg and <5 mg/kg) or high (>/=5 mg/kg) dose of 
      primaquine (AHR = 0.90 [95% CI 0.86-0.95, p < 0.001]). Limiting the comparison to
      high dose versus no primaquine in the period during and 12 months before and
      after a large stock outage resulted in minimal change in the estimated clinical
      effectiveness of primaquine (AHR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97, p = 0.003). Our
      pragmatic study avoided the clinical influences associated with prospective study
      involvement but was subject to attrition bias caused by passive follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised primaquine for vivax malaria, prescribed according to
      the current World Health Organization guidelines, was associated with a minimal
      reduction in the risk of clinical recurrence within 1 year in Papua, Indonesia.
      New strategies for the effective radical cure of vivax malaria are needed in
      resource-poor settings.

TI  - Association of pre-pregnancy body mass index with offspring metabolic profile:
      Analyses of 3 European prospective birth cohorts.
PG  - e1002376
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002376 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high proportion of women start pregnancy overweight or obese.
      According to the developmental overnutrition hypothesis, this could lead
      offspring to have metabolic disruption throughout their lives and thus perpetuate
      the obesity epidemic across generations. Concerns about this hypothesis are
      influencing antenatal care. However, it is unknown whether maternal pregnancy
      adiposity is associated with long-term risk of adverse metabolic profiles in
      offspring, and if so, whether this association is causal, via intrauterine
      mechanisms, or explained by shared familial (genetic, lifestyle, socioeconomic)
      characteristics. We aimed to determine if associations between maternal body mass
      index (BMI) and offspring systemic cardio-metabolic profile are causal, via
      intrauterine mechanisms, or due to shared familial factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      We used 1- and 2-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis, and a
      negative-control (paternal BMI) to examine the association between maternal
      pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring serum metabolome from 3 European birth cohorts
      (offspring age at blood collection: 16, 17, and 31 years). Circulating metabolic 
      traits were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance
      metabolomics. Results from 1-stage IPD meta-analysis (N = 5327 to 5377
      mother-father-offspring trios) showed that increasing maternal and paternal BMI
      was associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic profile in offspring. We observed
      strong positive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein
      (VLDL)-lipoproteins, VLDL-cholesterol (C), VLDL-triglycerides, VLDL-diameter,
      branched/aromatic amino acids, glycoprotein acetyls, and triglycerides, and
      strong negative associations with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), HDL-diameter,
      HDL-C, HDL2-C, and HDL3-C (all P < 0.003). Slightly stronger magnitudes of
      associations were present for maternal compared with paternal BMI across these
      associations; however, there was no strong statistical evidence for heterogeneity
      between them (all bootstrap P > 0.003, equivalent to P > 0.05 after accounting
      for multiple testing). Results were similar in each individual cohort, and in the
      2-stage analysis. Offspring BMI showed similar patterns of cross-sectional
      association with metabolic profile as for parental pre-pregnancy BMI associations
      but with greater magnitudes. Adjustment of parental BMI-offspring metabolic
      traits associations for offspring BMI suggested the parental associations were
      largely due to the association of parental BMI with offspring BMI. Limitations of
      this study are that inferences cannot be drawn about the role of circulating
      maternal fetal fuels (i.e., glucose, lipids, fatty acids, and amino acids) on
      later offspring metabolic profile. In addition, BMI may not reflect potential
      effects of maternal pregnancy fat distribution. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 
      that maternal BMI-offspring metabolome associations are likely to be largely due 
      to shared genetic or familial lifestyle confounding rather than to intrauterine
      mechanisms.

TI  - Benefits and safety of gabapentinoids in chronic low back pain: A systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - e1002369
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is very common, with a
      lifetime prevalence between 51% and 80%. In majority, it is nonspecific in nature
      and multifactorial in etiology. Pregabalin (PG) and Gabapentin (GB) are
      gabapentinoids that have demonstrated benefit in neuropathic pain conditions.
      Despite no clear rationale, they are increasingly used for nonspecific CLBP. They
      necessitate prolonged use and are associated with adverse effects and increased
      cost. Recent guidelines from the National Health Service (NHS), England,
      expressed concerns on their off-label use, in addition to the risk of misuse. We 
      aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of gabapentinoids in adult CLBP
      patients. METHODS: Electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane were
      searched from their inception until December 20th, 2016. We included randomized
      control trials reporting the use of gabapentinoids for the treatment of CLBP of
      >3 months duration, in adult patients. Study selection and data extraction was
      performed independently by paired reviewers. Outcomes were guided by Initiative
      on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials guidelines, with
      pain relief and safety as the primary outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed for 
      outcomes reported in 3 or more studies. Outcomes were reported as mean
      differences (MDs) or risk ratios (RRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs), and I2 in percentage representing the percentage variability in 
      effect estimates that could be explained by heterogeneity. GRADE (Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to assess the
      quality of evidence. RESULTS: Out of 1,385 citations, eight studies were
      included. Based on the interventions and comparators, studies were analyzed in 3 
      different groups. GB compared with placebo (3 studies, n = 185) showed minimal
      improvement of pain (MD = 0.22 units, 95% CI [-0.5 to 0.07] I2 = 0%; GRADE: very 
      low). Three studies compared PG with other types of analgesic medication (n =
      332) and showed greater improvement in the other analgesic group (MD = 0.42
      units, 95% CI [0.20 to 0.64] I2 = 0; GRADE: very low). Studies using PG as an
      adjuvant (n = 423) were not pooled due to heterogeneity, but the largest of them 
      showed no benefit of adding PG to tapentadol. There were no deaths or
      hospitalizations reported. Compared with placebo, the following adverse events
      were more commonly reported with GB: dizziness-(RR = 1.99, 95% CI [1.17 to 3.37],
      I2 = 49); fatigue (RR = 1.85, 95% CI [1.12 to 3.05], I2 = 0); difficulties with
      mentation (RR = 3.34, 95% CI [1.54 to 7.25], I2 = 0); and visual disturbances (RR
      = 5.72, 95% CI [1.94 to 16.91], I2 = 0). The number needed to harm with 95% CI
      for dizziness, fatigue, difficulties with mentation, and visual disturbances were
      7 (4 to 30), 8 (4 to 44), 6 (4 to 15), and 6 (4 to 13) respectively. The GRADE
      evidence quality was noted to be very low for dizziness and fatigue, low for
      difficulties with mentation, and moderate for visual disturbances. Functional and
      emotional improvements were reported by few studies and showed no significant
      improvements. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Existing evidence on the use of
      gabapentinoids in CLBP is limited and demonstrates significant risk of adverse
      effects without any demonstrated benefit. Given the lack of efficacy, risks, and 
      costs associated, the use of gabapentinoids for CLBP merits caution. There is
      need for large high-quality trials to more definitively inform this issue. TRIAL

TI  - Effectiveness of a brief behavioural intervention on psychological distress among
      women with a history of gender-based violence in urban Kenya: A randomised
      clinical trial.
PG  - e1002371
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gender-based violence (GBV) represents a major cause of psychological
      morbidity worldwide, and particularly in low- and middle-income countries
      (LMICs). Although there are effective treatments for common mental disorders
      associated with GBV, they typically require lengthy treatment programs that may
      limit scaling up in LMICs. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of
      a new 5-session behavioural treatment called Problem Management Plus (PM+) that
      lay community workers can be taught to deliver. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this
      single-blind, parallel, randomised controlled trial, adult women who had
      experienced GBV were identified through community screening for psychological
      distress and impaired functioning in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants were randomly
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio either to PM+ delivered in the community by lay
      community health workers provided with 8 days of training or to facility-based
      enhanced usual care (EUC) provided by community nurses. Participants were aware
      of treatment allocation, but research assessors were blinded. The primary outcome
      was psychological distress as measured by the total score on the 12-item General 
      Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) assessed at 3 months after treatment. Secondary
      outcomes were impaired functioning (measured by the WHO Disability Adjustment
      Schedule [WHODAS]), symptoms of posttraumatic stress (measured by the
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [PCL]), personally identified problems
      (measured by Psychological Outcome Profiles [PSYCHLOPS]), stressful life events
      (measured by the Life Events Checklist [LEC]), and health service utilisation.
      Between 15 April 2015 and 20 August 2015, 1,393 women were screened for
      eligibility on the basis of psychological distress and impaired functioning. Of
      these, 518 women (37%) screened positive, of whom 421 (81%) were women who had
      experienced GBV. Of these 421 women, 209 were assigned to PM+ and 212 to EUC.
      Follow-up assessments were completed on 16 January 2016. The primary analysis was
      intention to treat and included 53 women in PM+ (25%) and 49 women in EUC (23%)
      lost to follow-up. The difference between PM+ and EUC in the change from baseline
      to 3 months on the GHQ-12 was 3.33 (95% CI 1.86-4.79, P = 0.001) in favour of
      PM+. In terms of secondary outcomes, for WHODAS the difference between PM+ and
      EUC in the change from baseline to 3-month follow-up was 1.96 (95% CI 0.21-3.71, 
      P = 0.03), for PCL it was 3.95 (95% CI 0.06-7.83, P = 0.05), and for PSYCHLOPS it
      was 2.15 (95% CI 0.98-3.32, P = 0.001), all in favour of PM+. These estimated
      differences correspond to moderate effect sizes in favour of PM+ for GHQ-12 score
      (0.57, 95% CI 0.32-0.83) and PSYCHLOPS (0.67, 95% CI 0.31-1.03), and small effect
      sizes for WHODAS (0.26, 95% CI 0.02-0.50) and PCL (0.21, 95% CI 0.00-0.41).
      Twelve adverse events were reported, all of which were suicidal risks detected
      during screening. No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the
      trial. Limitations of the study include no long-term follow-up, reliance on
      self-report rather than structured interview data, and lack of an attention
      control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Among a community sample of women in urban Kenya 
      with a history of GBV, a brief, lay-administered behavioural intervention,
      compared with EUC, resulted in moderate reductions in psychological distress at
      3-month follow-up. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials

TI  - Impact of fortified versus unfortified lipid-based supplements on morbidity and
      nutritional status: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial in ill
      Gambian children.
PG  - e1002377
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002377 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are commonly prescribed in pediatric
      primary healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa to improve nutritional status and
      appetite without evidence for their effectiveness or international clinical
      guidelines. Community-wide MMN supplementation has shown limited and
      heterogeneous impact on growth and morbidity. Short-term ready-to-use therapeutic
      foods in acutely sick children in a hospital setting also had limited efficacy
      regarding subsequent growth. The effectiveness of MMN in improving morbidity or
      growth in sick children presenting for primary care has not been assessed.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook a double-blind randomised controlled trial of 
      small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) fortified with 23
      micronutrients in children aged 6 months (mo) to 5 years (y) presenting with an
      illness at a rural primary healthcare centre in The Gambia. Primary outcomes were
      repeat clinic presentations and growth over 24 wk. Participants were randomly
      assigned to receive 1 of 3 interventions: (1) supplementation with
      micronutrient-fortified SQ-LNS for 12 wk (MMN-12), (2) supplementation with
      micronutrient-fortified SQ-LNS for 6 wk followed by unfortified SQ-LNS for 6 wk
      (MMN-6), or (3) supplementation with unfortified SQ-LNS for 12 wk (MMN-0) to be
      consumed in daily portions. Treatment masking used 16 letters per 6-wk block in
      the randomisation process. Blinded intention-to-treat analysis based on a
      prespecified statistical analysis plan included all participants eligible and
      correctly enrolled. Between December 2009 and June 2011, 1,101 children (age 6-60
      mo, mean 25.5 mo) were enrolled, and 1,085 were assessed (MMN-0 = 361, MMN-6 =
      362, MMN-12 = 362). MMN supplementation was associated with a small increase in
      height-for-age z-scores 24 wk after recruitment (effect size for MMN groups
      combined: 0.084 SD/24 wk, 95% CI: 0.005, 0.168; p = 0.037; equivalent to 2-5 mm
      depending on age). No significant difference in frequency of morbidity measured
      by the number of visits to the clinic within 24 wk follow-up was detected with
      0.09 presentations per wk for all groups (MMN-0 versus MMN-6: adjusted incidence 
      rate ratio [IRR] 1.03, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.16; MMN-0 versus MMN-12: 1.05, 95% CI:
      0.93, 1.18). In post hoc analysis, clinic visits significantly increased by 43%
      over the first 3 wk of fortified versus unfortified SQ-LNS (adjusted IRR 1.43;
      95% CI: 1.07, 1.92; p = 0.016), with respiratory presentations increasing by 52% 
      with fortified SQ-LNS (adjusted IRR 1.52; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.30; p = 0.046). The
      number of severe adverse events during supplementation were similar between
      groups (MMN-0 = 20 [1 death]; MMN-6 = 21 [1 death]; MMN-12 = 20 [0 death]). No
      participant withdrew due to adverse effects. Study limitations included the lack 
      of supervision of daily supplementation. CONCLUSION: Prescribing
      micronutrient-fortified SQ-LNS to ill children presenting for primary care in
      rural Gambia had a very small effect on linear growth and did not reduce
      morbidity compared to unfortified SQ-LNS. An early increase in repeat visits
      indicates a need for the establishment of evidence-based guidelines and caution
      with systematic prescribing of MMN. Future research should be directed at
      understanding the mechanisms behind the lack of effect of MMN supplementation on 
      morbidity measures and limited effect on growth. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN

TI  - Assessing the impact of healthcare research: A systematic review of
      methodological frameworks.
PG  - e1002370
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly, researchers need to demonstrate the impact of their
      research to their sponsors, funders, and fellow academics. However, the most
      appropriate way of measuring the impact of healthcare research is subject to
      debate. We aimed to identify the existing methodological frameworks used to
      measure healthcare research impact and to summarise the common themes and metrics
      in an impact matrix. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two independent investigators
      systematically searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System
      Online (MEDLINE), the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Cumulative Index to 
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL+), the Health Management Information
      Consortium, and the Journal of Research Evaluation from inception until May 2017 
      for publications that presented a methodological framework for research impact.
      We then summarised the common concepts and themes across methodological
      frameworks and identified the metrics used to evaluate differing forms of impact.
      Twenty-four unique methodological frameworks were identified, addressing 5 broad 
      categories of impact: (1) 'primary research-related impact', (2) 'influence on
      policy making', (3) 'health and health systems impact', (4) 'health-related and
      societal impact', and (5) 'broader economic impact'. These categories were
      subdivided into 16 common impact subgroups. Authors of the included publications 
      proposed 80 different metrics aimed at measuring impact in these areas. The main 
      limitation of the study was the potential exclusion of relevant articles, as a
      consequence of the poor indexing of the databases searched. CONCLUSIONS: The
      measurement of research impact is an essential exercise to help direct the
      allocation of limited research resources, to maximise research benefit, and to
      help minimise research waste. This review provides a collective summary of
      existing methodological frameworks for research impact, which funders may use to 
      inform the measurement of research impact and researchers may use to inform study
      design decisions aimed at maximising the short-, medium-, and long-term impact of
      their research.

TI  - Harmonization of community health worker programs for HIV: A four-country
      qualitative study in Southern Africa.
PG  - e1002374
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002374 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community health worker (CHW) programs are believed to be poorly
      coordinated, poorly integrated into national health systems, and lacking
      long-term support. Duplication of services, fragmentation, and resource
      limitations may have impeded the potential impact of CHWs for achieving HIV
      goals. This study assesses mediators of a more harmonized approach to
      implementing large-scale CHW programs for HIV in the context of complex health
      systems and multiple donors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook four country case
      studies in Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, and Swaziland between August 2015
      and May 2016. We conducted 60 semistructured interviews with donors, government
      officials, and expert observers involved in CHW programs delivering HIV services.
      Interviews were triangulated with published literature, country reports, national
      health plans, and policies. Data were analyzed based on 3 priority areas of
      harmonization (coordination, integration, and sustainability) and 5 components of
      a conceptual framework (the health issue, intervention, stakeholders, health
      system, and context) to assess facilitators and barriers to harmonization of CHW 
      programs. CHWs supporting HIV programs were found to be highly fragmented and
      poorly integrated into national health systems. Stakeholders generally supported 
      increasing harmonization, although they recognized several challenges and
      disadvantages to harmonization. Key facilitators to harmonization included (i) a 
      large existing national CHW program and recognition of nongovernmental CHW
      programs, (ii) use of common incentives and training processes for CHWs, (iii)
      existence of an organizational structure dedicated to community health
      initiatives, and (iv) involvement of community leaders in decision-making. Key
      barriers included a wide range of stakeholders and lack of ownership and
      accountability of non-governmental CHW programs. Limitations of our study include
      subjectively selected case studies, our focus on decision-makers, and limited
      generalizability beyond the countries analyzed. CONCLUSION: CHW programs for HIV 
      in Southern Africa are fragmented, poorly integrated, and lack long-term support.
      We provide 5 policy recommendations to harmonize CHW programs in order to
      strengthen and sustain the role of CHWs in HIV service delivery.

TI  - Malaria, malnutrition, and birthweight: A meta-analysis using individual
      participant data.
PG  - e1002373
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Four studies previously indicated that the effect of malaria
      infection during pregnancy on the risk of low birthweight (LBW; <2,500 g) may
      depend upon maternal nutritional status. We investigated this dependence further 
      using a large, diverse study population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated the
      interaction between maternal malaria infection and maternal anthropometric status
      on the risk of LBW using pooled data from 14,633 pregnancies from 13 studies (6
      cohort studies and 7 randomized controlled trials) conducted in Africa and the
      Western Pacific from 1996-2015. Studies were identified by the Maternal Malaria
      and Malnutrition (M3) initiative using a convenience sampling approach and were
      eligible for pooling given adequate ethical approval and availability of
      essential variables. Study-specific adjusted effect estimates were calculated
      using inverse probability of treatment-weighted linear and log-binomial
      regression models and pooled using a random-effects model. The adjusted risk of
      delivering a baby with LBW was 8.8% among women with malaria infection at
      antenatal enrollment compared to 7.7% among uninfected women (adjusted risk ratio
      [aRR] 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 1.42]; N = 13,613), 10.5% among
      women with malaria infection at delivery compared to 7.9% among uninfected women 
      (aRR 1.32 [95% CI: 1.08, 1.62]; N = 11,826), and 15.3% among women with low
      mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC <23 cm) at enrollment compared to 9.5% among
      women with MUAC >/= 23 cm (aRR 1.60 [95% CI: 1.36, 1.87]; N = 9,008). The risk of
      delivering a baby with LBW was 17.8% among women with both malaria infection and 
      low MUAC at enrollment compared to 8.4% among uninfected women with MUAC >/= 23
      cm (joint aRR 2.13 [95% CI: 1.21, 3.73]; N = 8,152). There was no evidence of
      synergism (i.e., excess risk due to interaction) between malaria infection and
      MUAC on the multiplicative (p = 0.5) or additive scale (p = 0.9). Results were
      similar using body mass index (BMI) as an anthropometric indicator of nutritional
      status. Meta-regression results indicated that there may be multiplicative
      interaction between malaria infection at enrollment and low MUAC within studies
      conducted in Africa; however, this finding was not consistent on the additive
      scale, when accounting for multiple comparisons, or when using other definitions 
      of malaria and malnutrition. The major limitations of the study included
      availability of only 2 cross-sectional measurements of malaria and the limited
      availability of ultrasound-based pregnancy dating to assess impacts on preterm
      birth and fetal growth in all studies. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with
      malnutrition and malaria infection are at increased risk of LBW compared to women
      with only 1 risk factor or none, but malaria and malnutrition do not act
      synergistically.

PG  - e1002368
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major contributor to morbidity and 
      mortality. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the brain is essential for
      diagnostic screening of intracranial injuries in need of neurosurgical
      intervention, but may also provide information concerning patient prognosis and
      enable baseline risk stratification in clinical trials. Novel CT scoring systems 
      have been developed to improve current prognostic models, including the Stockholm
      and Helsinki CT scores, but so far have not been extensively validated. The
      primary aim of this study was to evaluate the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores
      for predicting functional outcome, in comparison with the Rotterdam CT score and 
      Marshall CT classification. The secondary aims were to assess which individual
      components of the CT scores best predict outcome and what additional prognostic
      value the CT scoring systems contribute to a clinical prognostic model. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: TBI patients requiring neuro-intensive care and not included in the
      initial creation of the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scoring systems were
      retrospectively included from prospectively collected data at the Karolinska
      University Hospital (n = 720 from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014) and
      Helsinki University Hospital (n = 395 from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014),
      totaling 1,115 patients. The Marshall CT classification and the Rotterdam,
      Stockholm, and Helsinki CT scores were assessed using the admission CT scans.
      Known outcome predictors at admission were acquired (age, pupil responsiveness,
      admission Glasgow Coma Scale, glucose level, and hemoglobin level) and used in
      univariate, and multivariable, regression models to predict long-term functional 
      outcome (dichotomizations of the Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]). In total, 478
      patients (43%) had an unfavorable outcome (GOS 1-3). In the combined cohort,
      overall prognostic performance was more accurate for the Stockholm CT score
      (Nagelkerke's pseudo-R2 range 0.24-0.28) and the Helsinki CT score (0.18-0.22)
      than for the Rotterdam CT score (0.13-0.15) and Marshall CT classification
      (0.03-0.05). Moreover, the Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores added the most
      independent prognostic value in the presence of other known clinical outcome
      predictors in TBI (6% and 4%, respectively). The aggregate traumatic subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (tSAH) component of the Stockholm CT score was the strongest predictor
      of unfavorable outcome. The main limitations were the retrospective nature of the
      study, missing patient information, and the varying follow-up time between the
      centers. CONCLUSIONS: The Stockholm and Helsinki CT scores provide more
      information on the damage sustained, and give a more accurate outcome prediction,
      than earlier classification systems. The strong independent predictive value of
      tSAH may reflect an underrated component of TBI pathophysiology. A change to
      these newer CT scoring systems may be warranted.

TI  - Identification of factors associated with stillbirth in the Indian state of Bihar
      using verbal autopsy: A population-based study.
PG  - e1002363
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: India was estimated to have the largest numbers of stillbirths
      globally in 2015, and the Indian government has adopted a target of <10
      stillbirths per 1,000 births by 2030 through the India Newborn Action Plan
      (INAP). The objective of this study was to use verbal autopsy interviews to
      examine factors associated with stillbirth in the Indian state of Bihar and make 
      recommendations for the INAP to better inform the setting of priorities and
      actions to reduce stillbirths. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Verbal autopsy interviews
      were conducted for deaths including stillbirths that occurred from January 2011
      to March 2014 in a sample of 109,689 households (87.1% participation) in 1,017
      clusters representative of the state of Bihar. The Population Health Metrics
      Research Consortium shortened verbal autopsy questionnaire was used for each
      interview, and cause of death was assigned using the SmartVA automated algorithm.
      A stillbirth was defined as a foetal death with a gestation period of >/=28 weeks
      wherein the foetus did not show any sign of life. We report on the stillbirth
      epidemiology and present case studies from the qualitative data on the health
      provider interface that can be used to improve success of improved, skilled care 
      at birth and delivery interventions. The annualised stillbirth incidence was 21.2
      (95% CI 19.7 to 22.6) per 1,000 births, with it being higher in the rural areas. 
      A total of 1,132 stillbirths were identified; 686 (62.2%) were boys, 327 (29.7%) 
      were firstborn, and 760 (68.9%) were delivered at a health facility. Of all the
      stillbirths, 54.5% were estimated to be antepartum. Only 6,161 (55.9%) of the
      women reported at least 1 antenatal care visit, and 33% of the women reported not
      consuming the iron folic acid tablets during pregnancy. Significant differences
      were seen in delivery-related variables and associated maternal conditions based 
      on the place of delivery and type of stillbirth. Only 6.1% of the women reported 
      having undergone a test to rule out syphilis. For 34.2% of the stillbirths, the
      possible risk factor for stillbirth was unexplained. For the remaining 65.8% of
      the women who reported at least 1 complication during the last 3 months of
      pregnancy, maternal conditions including anaemia, fever during labour, and
      hypertension accounted for most of the complications. Of importance to note is
      that the maternal conditions overlapped quite significantly with the other
      possible underlying risk factors for stillbirth. Obstetrics complications and
      excessive bleeding during delivery contributed to nearly 30% of the cases as a
      possible risk factor for stillbirth, highlighting the need for better skilled
      care during delivery. Of the 5 major themes identified in open narratives, 3 were
      related to healthcare providers-lack of timely attention, poor skills (knowledge 
      or implementation), and reluctance to deliver a dead baby. The case studies
      document the circumstances that highlight breakdowns in clinical care around the 
      delivery or missed opportunities that can be used for improving the provision of 
      quality skilled care. The main limitation of these data is that stillbirth is
      defined based on the gestation period and not based on birth weight; however,
      this is done in several studies from developing country settings in which
      birthweight is either not available or accurate. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge,
      this study is among the few large, population-based assessments of stillbirths
      using verbal autopsy at the state level in India. These findings provide detailed
      insight into investigating the possible risk factors for stillbirths, as well as 
      insight into the ground-level changes that are needed within the health system to
      design and implement effective preventive and intervention policies to reduce the
      burden of stillbirths. As most of the stillbirths are preventable with
      high-quality, evidence-based interventions delivered before and during pregnancy 
      and during labour and childbirth, it is imperative that with INAP in place, India
      aspires to document stillbirths in a systematic and standardised manner to bridge
      the knowledge gap for appropriate actions to reduce stillbirths. We have made
      several recommendations based on our study that could further strengthen the INAP
      approach to improve the quality and quantity of stillbirth data to avoid this
      needless loss of lives.

TI  - Gestational diabetes mellitus and interpregnancy weight change: A
      population-based cohort study.
PG  - e1002367
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002367 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Being overweight is an important risk factor for Gestational Diabetes
      Mellitus (GDM), but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Weight change
      between pregnancies has been suggested to be an independent mechanism behind GDM.
      We assessed the risk for GDM in second pregnancy by change in Body Mass Index
      (BMI) from first to second pregnancy and whether BMI and gestational weight gain 
      modified the risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this observational cohort, we
      included 24,198 mothers and their 2 first pregnancies in data from the Medical
      Birth Registry of Norway (2006-2014). Weight change, defined as prepregnant BMI
      in second pregnancy minus prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy, was divided into 6 
      categories by units BMI (kilo/square meter). Relative risk (RR) estimates were
      obtained by general linear models for the binary family and adjusted for maternal
      age at second delivery, country of birth, education, smoking in pregnancy,
      interpregnancy interval, and year of second birth. Analyses were stratified by
      BMI (first pregnancy) and gestational weight gain (second pregnancy). Compared to
      women with stable BMI (-1 to 1), women who gained weight between pregnancies had 
      higher risk of GDM-gaining 1 to 2 units: adjusted RR 2.0 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.7), 2
      to 4 units: RR 2.6 (2.0 to 3.5), and >/=4 units: RR 5.4 (4.0 to 7.4). Risk
      increased significantly both for women with BMI below and above 25 at first
      pregnancy, although it increased more for the former group. A limitation in our
      study was the limited data on BMI in 2 pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of GDM 
      increased with increasing weight gain from first to second pregnancy, and more
      strongly among women with BMI < 25 in first pregnancy. Our results suggest weight
      change as a metabolic mechanism behind the increased risk of GDM, thus weight
      change should be acknowledged as an independent factor for screening GDM in
      clinical guidelines. Promoting healthy weight from preconception through the
      postpartum period should be a target.

TI  - Childhood adiposity and risk of type 1 diabetes: A Mendelian randomization study.
PG  - e1002362
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002362 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing globally. One
      hypothesis is that increasing childhood obesity rates may explain part of this
      increase, but, as T1D is rare, intervention studies are challenging to perform.
      The aim of this study was to assess this hypothesis with a Mendelian
      randomization approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to
      test for causal associations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a genetic
      instrument of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with childhood
      adiposity in children aged 2-10 years. Summary-level association results for
      these 23 SNPs with childhood-onset (<17 years) T1D were extracted from a
      meta-analysis of genome-wide association study with 5,913 T1D cases and 8,828
      reference samples. Using inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization
      analysis, we found support for an effect of childhood adiposity on T1D risk (odds
      ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.06-1.64 per standard deviation score in body mass index
      [SDS-BMI]). A sensitivity analysis provided evidence of horizontal pleiotropy
      bias (p = 0.04) diluting the estimates towards the null. We therefore applied
      Egger regression and multivariable Mendelian randomization methods to control for
      this type of bias and found evidence in support of a role of childhood adiposity 
      in T1D (odds ratio in Egger regression, 2.76, 95% CI 1.40-5.44). Limitations of
      our study include that underlying genes and their mechanisms for most of the
      genetic variants included in the score are not known. Mendelian randomization
      requires large sample sizes, and power was limited to provide precise estimates. 
      This research has been conducted using data from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) 
      Consortium, the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT)
      Consortium, the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) Consortium, and the Social Science
      Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC), as well as meta-analysis results from a
      T1D genome-wide association study. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides genetic
      support for a link between childhood adiposity and T1D risk. Together with
      evidence from observational studies, our findings further emphasize the
      importance of measures to reduce the global epidemic of childhood obesity and
      encourage mechanistic studies.

TI  - Same-day HIV testing with initiation of antiretroviral therapy versus standard
      care for persons living with HIV: A randomized unblinded trial.
PG  - e1002357
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attrition during the period from HIV testing to antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) initiation is high worldwide. We assessed whether same-day HIV
      testing and ART initiation improves retention and virologic suppression. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: We conducted an unblinded, randomized trial of standard ART
      initiation versus same-day HIV testing and ART initiation among eligible adults
      >/=18 years old with World Health Organization Stage 1 or 2 disease and CD4 count
      </=500 cells/mm3. The study was conducted among outpatients at the Haitian Group 
      for the Study of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic infections (GHESKIO) Clinic
      in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard
      ART initiation or same-day HIV testing and ART initiation. The standard group
      initiated ART 3 weeks after HIV testing, and the same-day group initiated ART on 
      the day of testing. The primary study endpoint was retention in care 12 months
      after HIV testing with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml. We assessed the impact of
      treatment arm with a modified intention-to-treat analysis, using multivariable
      logistic regression controlling for potential confounders. Between August 2013
      and October 2015, 762 participants were enrolled; 59 participants transferred to 
      other clinics during the study period, and were excluded as per protocol, leaving
      356 in the standard and 347 in the same-day ART groups. In the standard ART
      group, 156 (44%) participants were retained in care with 12-month HIV-1 RNA <50
      copies, and 184 (52%) had <1,000 copies/ml; 20 participants (6%) died. In the
      same-day ART group, 184 (53%) participants were retained with HIV-1 RNA <50
      copies/ml, and 212 (61%) had <1,000 copies/ml; 10 (3%) participants died. The
      unadjusted risk ratio (RR) of being retained at 12 months with HIV-1 RNA <50
      copies/ml was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.38; p = 0.015) for the same-day ART group
      compared to the standard ART group, and the unadjusted RR for being retained with
      HIV-1 RNA <1,000 copies was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.31; p = 0.012). The main
      limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single urban clinic, and
      the generalizability to other settings is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Same-day HIV
      testing and ART initiation is feasible and beneficial in this setting, as it
      improves retention in care with virologic suppression among patients with early
      clinical HIV disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01900080.

TI  - Ultrasound non-invasive measurement of intracranial pressure in neurointensive
      care: A prospective observational study.
PG  - e1002356
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The invasive nature of the current methods for monitoring of
      intracranial pressure (ICP) has prevented their use in many clinical situations. 
      Several attempts have been made to develop methods to monitor ICP non-invasively.
      The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between ultrasound-based
      non-invasive ICP (nICP) and invasive ICP measurement in neurocritical care
      patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a prospective, single-cohort
      observational study of patients admitted to a tertiary neurocritical care unit.
      Patients with brain injury requiring invasive ICP monitoring were considered for 
      inclusion. nICP was assessed using optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), venous
      transcranial Doppler (vTCD) of straight sinus systolic flow velocity (FVsv), and 
      methods derived from arterial transcranial Doppler (aTCD) on the middle cerebral 
      artery (MCA): MCA pulsatility index (PIa) and an estimator based on diastolic
      flow velocity (FVd). A total of 445 ultrasound examinations from 64 patients
      performed from 1 January to 1 November 2016 were included. The median age of the 
      patients was 53 years (range 37-64). Median Glasgow Coma Scale at admission was 7
      (range 3-14), and median Glasgow Outcome Scale was 3 (range 1-5). The mortality
      rate was 20%. ONSD and FVsv demonstrated the strongest correlation with ICP (R = 
      0.76 for ONSD versus ICP; R = 0.72 for FVsv versus ICP), whereas PIa and the
      estimator based on FVd did not correlate with ICP significantly. Combining the 2 
      strongest nICP predictors (ONSD and FVsv) resulted in an even stronger
      correlation with ICP (R = 0.80). The ability to detect intracranial hypertension 
      (ICP >/= 20 mm Hg) was highest for ONSD (area under the curve [AUC] 0.91, 95% CI 
      0.88-0.95). The combination of ONSD and FVsv methods showed a statistically
      significant improvement of AUC values compared with the ONSD method alone (0.93, 
      95% CI 0.90-0.97, p = 0.01). Major limitations are the heterogeneity and small
      number of patients included in this study, the need for specialised training to
      perform and interpret the ultrasound tests, and the variability in performance
      among different ultrasound operators. CONCLUSIONS: Of the studied ultrasound nICP
      methods, ONSD is the best estimator of ICP. The novel combination of ONSD
      ultrasonography and vTCD of the straight sinus is a promising and easily
      available technique for identifying critically ill patients with intracranial
      hypertension.

TI  - Community burden of undiagnosed HIV infection among adolescents in Zimbabwe
      following primary healthcare-based provider-initiated HIV testing and
      counselling: A cross-sectional survey.
PG  - e1002360
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children living with HIV who are not diagnosed in infancy often
      remain undiagnosed until they present with advanced disease. Provider-initiated
      testing and counselling (PITC) in health facilities is recommended for
      high-HIV-prevalence settings, but it is unclear whether this approach is
      sufficient to achieve universal coverage of HIV testing. We aimed to investigate 
      the change in community burden of undiagnosed HIV infection among older children 
      and adolescents following implementation of PITC in Harare, Zimbabwe. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Over the course of 2 years (January 2013-January 2015), 7 primary
      health clinics (PHCs) in southwestern Harare implemented optimised, opt-out PITC 
      for all attendees aged 6-15 years. In February 2015-December 2015, we conducted a
      representative cross-sectional survey of 8-17-year-olds living in the 7
      communities served by the study PHCs, who would have had 2 years of exposure to
      PITC. Knowledge of HIV status was ascertained through a caregiver questionnaire, 
      and anonymised HIV testing was carried out using oral mucosal transudate (OMT)
      tests. After 1 participant taking antiretroviral therapy was observed to have a
      false negative OMT result, from July 2015 urine samples were obtained from all
      participants providing OMTs and tested for antiretroviral drugs to confirm HIV
      status. Children who tested positive through PITC were identified from among
      survey participants using gender, birthdate, and location. Of 7,146 children in
      4,251 eligible households, 5,486 (76.8%) children in 3,397 households agreed to
      participate in the survey, and 141 were HIV positive. HIV prevalence was 2.6%
      (95% CI 2.2%-3.1%), and over a third of participants with HIV were undiagnosed
      (37.7%; 95% CI 29.8%-46.2%). Similarly, among the subsample of 2,643 (48.2%)
      participants with a urine test result, 34.7% of those living with HIV were
      undiagnosed (95% CI 23.5%-47.9%). Based on extrapolation from the survey sample
      to the community, we estimated that PITC over 2 years identified between 18% and 
      42% of previously undiagnosed children in the community. The main limitation is
      that prevalence of undiagnosed HIV was defined using a combination of 3 measures 
      (OMT, self-report, and urine test), none of which were perfect. CONCLUSIONS:
      Facility-based approaches are inadequate in achieving universal coverage of HIV
      testing among older children and adolescents. Alternative, community-based
      approaches are required to meet the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
      (UNAIDS) target of diagnosing 90% of those living with HIV by 2020 in this age
      group.

TI  - Temporal profile of intracranial pressure and cerebrovascular reactivity in
      severe traumatic brain injury and association with fatal outcome: An
      observational study.
PG  - e1002353
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002353 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both intracranial pressure (ICP) and the cerebrovascular pressure
      reactivity represent the dysregulation of pathways directly involved in traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) pathogenesis and have been used to inform clinical management.
      However, how these parameters evolve over time following injury and whether this 
      evolution has any prognostic importance have not been studied. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We analysed the temporal profile of ICP and pressure reactivity index
      (PRx), examined their relation to TBI-specific mortality, and determined if the
      prognostic relevance of these parameters was affected by their temporal profile
      using mixed models for repeated measures of ICP and PRx for the first 240 hours
      from the time of injury. A total of 601 adults with TBI, admitted between
      September 2002 to January 2016, and with high-resolution continuous monitoring
      from a single centre, were studied. At 6 months postinjury, 133 (19%) patients
      had a fatal outcome; of those, 88 (78%) died from nonsurvivable TBI or brain
      death. The difference in mean ICP between those with a fatal outcome and
      functional survivors was only significant for the first 168 hours after injury
      (all p < 0.05). For PRx, those patients with a fatal outcome also had a higher
      (more impaired) PRx throughout the first 120 hours after injury (all p < 0.05).
      The separation of ICP and PRx was greatest in the first 72 hours after injury.
      Mixed models demonstrated that the explanatory power of the PRx decreases over
      time; therefore, the prognostic weight assigned to PRx should similarly decrease.
      However, the ability of ICP to predict a fatal outcome remained relatively stable
      over time. As control of ICP is the central purpose of TBI management, it is
      likely that some of the information that is reflected in the natural history of
      ICP changes is no longer apparent because of therapeutic intervention.
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the temporal evolution of ICP and PRx and their
      relationship with fatal outcome, indicating a potential early prognostic and
      therapeutic window. The combination of dynamic monitoring variables and their
      time profile improved prediction of outcome. Therefore, time-driven dynamic
      modelling of outcome in patients with severe TBI may allow for more accurate and 
      clinically useful prediction models. Further research is needed to confirm and
      expand on these findings.

TI  - IL33-mediated ILC2 activation and neutrophil IL5 production in the lung response 
      after severe trauma: A reverse translation study from a human cohort to a mouse
      trauma model.
PG  - e1002365
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The immunosuppression and immune dysregulation that follows severe
      injury includes type 2 immune responses manifested by elevations in interleukin
      (IL) 4, IL5, and IL13 early after injury. We hypothesized that IL33, an alarmin
      released early after tissue injury and a known regulator of type 2 immunity,
      contributes to the early type 2 immune responses after systemic injury. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: Blunt trauma patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit of
      a level I trauma center were enrolled in an observational study that included
      frequent blood sampling. Dynamic changes in IL33 and soluble suppression of
      tumorigenicity 2 (sST2) levels were measured in the plasma and correlated with
      levels of the type 2 cytokines and nosocomial infection. Based on the
      observations in humans, mechanistic experiments were designed in a mouse model of
      resuscitated hemorrhagic shock and tissue trauma (HS/T). These experiments
      utilized wild-type C57BL/6 mice, IL33-/- mice, B6.C3(Cg)-Rorasg/sg mice deficient
      in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and C57BL/6 wild-type mice treated with 
      anti-IL5 antibody. Severely injured human blunt trauma patients (n = 472, average
      injury severity score [ISS] = 20.2) exhibited elevations in plasma IL33 levels
      upon admission and over time that correlated positively with increases in IL4,
      IL5, and IL13 (P < 0.0001). sST2 levels also increased after injury but in a
      delayed manner compared with IL33. The increases in IL33 and sST2 were
      significantly greater in patients that developed nosocomial infection and organ
      dysfunction than similarly injured patients that did not (P < 0.05). Mechanistic 
      studies were carried out in a mouse model of HS/T that recapitulated the early
      increase in IL33 and delayed increase in sST2 in the plasma (P < 0.005). These
      studies identified a pathway where IL33 induces ILC2 activation in the lung
      within hours of HS/T. ILC2 IL5 up-regulation induces further IL5 expression by
      CXCR2+ lung neutrophils, culminating in early lung injury. The major limitations 
      of this study are the descriptive nature of the human study component and the
      impact of the potential differences between human and mouse immune responses to
      polytrauma. Also, the studies performed did not permit us to make conclusions
      about the impact of IL33 on pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      suggest that IL33 may initiate early detrimental type 2 immune responses after
      trauma through ILC2 regulation of neutrophil IL5 production. This
      IL33-ILC2-IL5-neutrophil axis defines a novel regulatory role for ILC2 in acute
      lung injury that could be targeted in trauma patients prone to early lung
      dysfunction.

TI  - Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity monitoring using wavelet analysis in
      traumatic brain injury patients: A retrospective study.
PG  - e1002348
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002348 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After traumatic brain injury (TBI), the ability of cerebral vessels
      to appropriately react to changes in arterial blood pressure (pressure
      reactivity) is impaired, leaving patients vulnerable to cerebral hypo- or
      hyperperfusion. Although, the traditional pressure reactivity index (PRx) has
      demonstrated that impaired pressure reactivity is associated with poor patient
      outcome, PRx is sometimes erratic and may not be reliable in various clinical
      circumstances. Here, we introduce a more robust transform-based wavelet pressure 
      reactivity index (wPRx) and compare its performance with the widely used
      traditional PRx across 3 areas: its stability and reliability in time, its
      ability to give an optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) recommendation,
      and its relationship with patient outcome. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Five hundred and
      fifteen patients with TBI admitted in Addenbrooke's Hospital, United Kingdom
      (March 23rd, 2003 through December 9th, 2014), with continuous monitoring of
      arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP), were
      retrospectively analyzed to calculate the traditional PRx and a novel wavelet
      transform-based wPRx. wPRx was calculated by taking the cosine of the wavelet
      transform phase-shift between ABP and ICP. A time trend of CPPopt was calculated 
      using an automated curve-fitting method that determined the cerebral perfusion
      pressure (CPP) at which the pressure reactivity (PRx or wPRx) was most efficient 
      (CPPopt_PRx and CPPopt_wPRx, respectively). There was a significantly positive
      relationship between PRx and wPRx (r = 0.73), and wavelet wPRx was more reliable 
      in time (ratio of between-hour variance to total variance, wPRx 0.957 +/- 0.0032 
      versus PRx and 0.949 +/- 0.047 for PRx, p = 0.002). The 2-hour interval standard 
      deviation of wPRx (0.19 +/- 0.07) was smaller than that of PRx (0.30 +/- 0.13, p 
      < 0.001). wPRx performed better in distinguishing between mortality and survival 
      (the area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUROC] for
      wPRx was 0.73 versus 0.66 for PRx, p = 0.003). The mean difference between the
      patients' CPP and their CPPopt was related to outcome for both calculation
      methods. There was a good relationship between the 2 CPPopts (r = 0.814, p <
      0.001). CPPopt_wPRx was more stable than CPPopt_PRx (within patient standard
      deviation 7.05 +/- 3.78 versus 8.45 +/- 2.90; p < 0.001). Key limitations include
      that this study is a retrospective analysis and only compared wPRx with PRx in
      the cohort of patients with TBI. Prior prospective validation is required to
      better assess clinical utility of this approach. CONCLUSIONS: wPRx offers several
      advantages to the traditional PRx: it is more stable in time, it yields a more
      consistent CPPopt recommendation, and, importantly, it has a stronger
      relationship with patient outcome. The clinical utility of wPRx should be
      explored in prospective studies of critically injured neurological patients.

TI  - A comparison of Selective Aortic Arch Perfusion and Resuscitative Endovascular
      Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta for the management of hemorrhage-induced traumatic
      cardiac arrest: A translational model in large swine.
PG  - e1002349
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002349 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival rates remain low after hemorrhage-induced traumatic cardiac 
      arrest (TCA). Noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH) is a major cause of
      potentially survivable trauma death. Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion
      of the Aorta (REBOA) at the thoracic aorta (Zone 1) can limit subdiaphragmatic
      blood loss and allow for IV fluid resuscitation when intrinsic cardiac activity
      is still present. Selective Aortic Arch Perfusion (SAAP) combines thoracic aortic
      balloon hemorrhage control with intra-aortic oxygenated perfusion to achieve
      return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) when cardiac arrest has occurred.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Male Yorkshire Landrace cross swine (80.0 +/- 6.0 kg)
      underwent anesthesia, instrumentation for monitoring, and splenectomy. TCA was
      induced by laparoscopic liver lobe resection combined with arterial catheter
      blood withdrawal to achieve a sustained systolic blood pressure <10 mmHg, cardiac
      arrest. After 3 min of arrest, swine were allocated to one of three
      interventions: (1) REBOA plus 4 units of IV fresh whole blood (FWB), (2) SAAP
      with oxygenated lactated Ringer's (LR), 1,600 mL/2 min, or (3) SAAP with
      oxygenated FWB 1,600 mL/2 min. Primary endpoint was survival to the end of 60 min
      of resuscitation, a simulated prehospital phase. Thirty animals were allocated to
      3 groups (10 per group)-5 protocol exclusions resulted in a total of 35 animals
      being used. Baseline measurements and time to cardiac arrest were not different
      amongst groups. ROSC was achieved in 0/10 (0%, 95% CI 0.00-30.9) REBOA, 6/10
      (60%, 95% CI 26.2-87.8) SAAP-LR and 10/10 (100%, 95% CI 69.2-100.0) SAAP-FWB
      animals, p < 0.001. Survival to end of simulated 60-minute prehospital
      resuscitation was 0/10 (0%, 95% CI 0.00-30.9) for REBOA, 1/10 (10%, 95% CI
      0.25-44.5) for SAAP-LR and 9/10 (90%, 95% CI 55.5-99.7) for SAAP-FWB, p < 0.001. 
      Total FWB infusion volume was similar for REBOA (2,452 +/- 0 mL) and SAAP-FWB
      (2,250 +/- 594 mL). This study was undertaken in laboratory conditions, and as
      such may have practical limitations when applied clinically. Cardiac arrest in
      this study was defined by intra-aortic pressure monitoring that is not feasible
      in clinical practice, and as such limits the generalizability of findings.
      Clinical trials are needed to determine if the beneficial effects of SAAP-FWB
      observed in this laboratory study will translate into improved survival in
      clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: SAAP conferred a superior short-term survival
      over REBOA in this large animal model of hemorrhage-induced traumatic cardiac
      arrest with NCTH. SAAP using an oxygen-carrying perfusate was more effective in
      this study than non-oxygen carrying solutions in TCA. SAAP can effect ROSC from
      hemorrhage-induced electrocardiographic asystole in large swine.

TI  - Prescription medicine use by pedestrians and the risk of injurious road traffic
      crashes: A case-crossover study.
PG  - e1002347
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002347 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While some medicinal drugs have been found to affect driving ability,
      no study has investigated whether a relationship exists between these medicines
      and crashes involving pedestrians. The aim of this study was to explore the
      association between the use of medicinal drugs and the risk of being involved in 
      a road traffic crash as a pedestrian. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from 3 French
      nationwide databases were matched. We used the case-crossover design to control
      for time-invariant factors by using each case as its own control. To perform
      multivariable analysis and limit false-positive results, we implemented a
      bootstrap version of Lasso. To avoid the effect of unmeasured time-varying
      factors, we varied the length of the washout period from 30 to 119 days before
      the crash. The matching procedure led to the inclusion of 16,458 pedestrians
      involved in an injurious road traffic crash from 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2011.
      We found 48 medicine classes with a positive association with the risk of crash, 
      with median odds ratios ranging from 1.12 to 2.98. Among these, benzodiazepines
      and benzodiazepine-related drugs, antihistamines, and anti-inflammatory and
      antirheumatic drugs were among the 10 medicines most consumed by the 16,458
      pedestrians. Study limitations included slight overrepresentation of pedestrians 
      injured in more severe crashes, lack of information about self-medication and the
      use of over-the-counter drugs, and lack of data on amount of walking.
      CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic classes already identified as impacting the ability to
      drive, such as benzodiazepines and antihistamines, are also associated with an
      increased risk of pedestrians being involved in a road traffic crash. This study 
      on pedestrians highlights the necessity of improving awareness of the effect of
      these medicines on this category of road user.

TI  - Prehospital immune responses and development of multiple organ dysfunction
      syndrome following traumatic injury: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - e1002338
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almost all studies that have investigated the immune response to
      trauma have analysed blood samples acquired post-hospital admission. Thus, we
      know little of the immune status of patients in the immediate postinjury phase
      and how this might influence patient outcomes. The objective of this study was
      therefore to comprehensively assess the ultra-early, within 1-hour, immune
      response to trauma and perform an exploratory analysis of its relationship with
      the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: The immune and inflammatory response to trauma was analysed in 89 adult
      trauma patients (mean age 41 years, range 18-90 years, 75 males) with a mean
      injury severity score (ISS) of 24 (range 9-66), from whom blood samples were
      acquired within 1 hour of injury (mean time to sample 42 minutes, range 17-60
      minutes). Within minutes of trauma, a comprehensive leukocytosis, elevated serum 
      pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and evidence of innate cell activation that
      included neutrophil extracellular trap generation and elevated surface expression
      of toll-like receptor 2 and CD11b on monocytes and neutrophils, respectively,
      were observed. Features consistent with immune compromise were also detected,
      notably elevated numbers of immune suppressive CD16BRIGHT CD62LDIM neutrophils
      (82.07 x 106/l +/- 18.94 control versus 1,092 x 106/l +/- 165 trauma, p < 0.0005)
      and CD14+HLA-DRlow/- monocytes (34.96 x 106/l +/- 4.48 control versus 95.72 x
      106/l +/- 8.0 trauma, p < 0.05) and reduced leukocyte cytokine secretion in
      response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Exploratory analysis via binary
      logistic regression found a potential association between absolute natural killer
      T (NKT) cell numbers and the subsequent development of MODS. Study limitations
      include the relatively small sample size and the absence of data relating to
      adaptive immune cell function. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted the dynamic and
      complex nature of the immune response to trauma, with immune alterations
      consistent with both activation and suppression evident within 1 hour of injury. 
      The relationship of these changes, especially in NKT cell numbers, to patient
      outcomes such as MODS warrants further investigation.

TI  - Signatures of inflammation and impending multiple organ dysfunction in the
      hyperacute phase of trauma: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - e1002352
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002352 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe trauma induces a widespread response of the immune system.
      This "genomic storm" can lead to poor outcomes, including Multiple Organ
      Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). MODS carries a high mortality and morbidity rate and
      adversely affects long-term health outcomes. Contemporary management of MODS is
      entirely supportive, and no specific therapeutics have been shown to be effective
      in reducing incidence or severity. The pathogenesis of MODS remains unclear, and 
      several models are proposed, such as excessive inflammation, a second-hit insult,
      or an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. We postulated that
      the hyperacute window after trauma may hold the key to understanding how the
      genomic storm is initiated and may lead to a new understanding of the
      pathogenesis of MODS. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole blood
      transcriptome and flow cytometry analyses on a total of 70 critically injured
      patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] >/= 25) at The Royal London Hospital in the
      hyperacute time period within 2 hours of injury. We compared transcriptome
      findings in 36 critically injured patients with those of 6 patients with minor
      injuries (ISS </= 4). We then performed flow cytometry analyses in 34 critically 
      injured patients and compared findings with those of 9 healthy volunteers.
      Immediately after injury, only 1,239 gene transcripts (4%) were differentially
      expressed in critically injured patients. By 24 hours after injury, 6,294
      transcripts (21%) were differentially expressed compared to the hyperacute
      window. Only 202 (16%) genes differentially expressed in the hyperacute window
      were still expressed in the same direction at 24 hours postinjury. Pathway
      analysis showed principally up-regulation of pattern recognition and innate
      inflammatory pathways, with down-regulation of adaptive responses. Immune
      deconvolution, flow cytometry, and modular analysis suggested a central role for 
      neutrophils and Natural Killer (NK) cells, with underexpression of T- and B cell 
      responses. In the transcriptome cohort, 20 critically injured patients later
      developed MODS. Compared with the 16 patients who did not develop MODS (NoMODS), 
      maximal differential expression was seen within the hyperacute window. In MODS
      versus NoMODS, 363 genes were differentially expressed on admission, compared to 
      only 33 at 24 hours postinjury. MODS transcripts differentially expressed in the 
      hyperacute window showed enrichment among diseases and biological functions
      associated with cell survival and organismal death rather than inflammatory
      pathways. There was differential up-regulation of NK cell signalling pathways and
      markers in patients who would later develop MODS, with down-regulation of
      neutrophil deconvolution markers. This study is limited by its sample size,
      precluding more detailed analyses of drivers of the hyperacute response and
      different MODS phenotypes, and requires validation in other critically injured
      cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed how the hyperacute postinjury time
      window contained a focused, specific signature of the response to critical injury
      that led to widespread genomic activation. A transcriptomic signature for later
      development of MODS was present in this hyperacute window; it showed a strong
      signal for cell death and survival pathways and implicated NK cells and
      neutrophil populations in this differential response.

TI  - Trends in traumatic brain injury mortality in China, 2006-2013: A
      population-based longitudinal study.
PG  - e1002332
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002332 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant global public health
      problem, but has received minimal attention from researchers and policy-makers in
      low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Epidemiological evidence of TBI
      morbidity and mortality is absent at the national level for most LMICs, including
      China. Using data from China's Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs) system, we
      conducted a population-based longitudinal analysis to examine TBI mortality, and 
      mortality differences by sex, age group, location (urban/rural), and external
      cause of injury, from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013 in China. METHOD AND
      FINDINGS: Mortality data came from the national DSPs system of China, which has
      coded deaths using the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision
      (ICD-10) since 2004. Crude and age-standardized mortality with 95% CIs were
      estimated using the census population in 2010 as a reference population. The
      Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to examine the significance of trends in
      mortality from 2006 to 2013. Negative binomial models were used to examine the
      associations of TBI mortality with location, sex, and age group. Subgroup
      analysis was performed by external cause of TBI. We found the following: (1)
      Age-adjusted TBI mortality increased from 13.23 per 100,000 population in 2006 to
      17.06 per 100,000 population in 2008 and then began to fall slightly. In 2013,
      age-adjusted TBI mortality was 12.99 per 100,000 population (SE = 0.13). (2)
      Compared to females and urban residents, males and rural residents had higher TBI
      mortality risk, with adjusted mortality rate ratios of 2.57 and 1.71,
      respectively. TBI mortality increased substantially with older age. (3) Motor
      vehicle crashes and falls were the 2 leading causes of TBI mortality between 2006
      and 2013. TBI deaths from motor vehicle crashes in children aged 0-14 years and
      adults aged 65 years and older were most often in pedestrians, and motorcyclists 
      were the first or second leading category of road user for the other age groups. 
      (4) TBI mortality attributed to motor vehicle crashes increased for pedestrians
      and motorcyclists in all 7 age groups from 2006 to 2013. Our analysis was limited
      by the availability and quality of data in the DSPs dataset, including lack of
      injury-related socio-economic factors, policy factors, and individual and
      behavioral factors. The dataset also may be incomplete in TBI death recording or 
      contain misclassification of mortality data. CONCLUSIONS: TBI constitutes a
      serious public health threat in China. Further studies should explore the reasons
      for the particularly high risk of TBI mortality among particular populations, as 
      well as the reasons for recent increases in certain subgroups, and should develop
      solutions to address these challenges. Interventions proven to work in other
      cultures should be introduced and implemented nationwide. Examples of these in
      the domain of motor vehicle crashes include policy change and enforcement of laws
      concerning helmet use for motorcyclists and bicyclists, car seat and booster seat
      use for child motor vehicle passengers, speed limit and drunk driving laws, and
      alcohol ignition interlock use. Examples to prevent falls, especially among
      elderly individuals, include exercise programs, home modification to reduce fall 
      risk, and multifaceted interventions to prevent falls in all age groups.

TI  - Years of life lost due to traumatic brain injury in Europe: A cross-sectional
      analysis of 16 countries.
PG  - e1002331
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002331 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a major public health, medical,
      and societal challenge globally. They present a substantial burden to victims,
      their families, and the society as a whole. Although indicators such as incidence
      or death rates provide insight into the occurrence and outcome of TBIs in various
      populations, they fail to quantify the full extent of their public health and
      societal impact. Measures such as years of life lost (YLLs), which quantifies the
      number of years of life lost because the person dies prematurely due to a disease
      or injury, should be employed to better quantify the population impact. The aim
      of this study was to provide an in-depth analysis of the burden of deaths due to 
      TBI by calculating TBI-specific YLLs in 16 European countries, analyzing their
      main causes and demographic patterns, using data extracted from death
      certificates under unified guidelines and collected in a standardized manner.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-wide, cross-sectional epidemiological study
      was conducted in 16 European countries to estimate TBI YLLs for the year 2013.
      The data used for all analyses in this study were acquired from the statistical
      office of the European Union (Eurostat). A specifically tailored dataset of
      micro-level data was provided that listed the external cause of death
      (International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision [ICD-10] codes V01-Y98), 
      the specific nature of injury (ICD-10 codes S00-T98), the age at death, and sex
      for each death. Overall number of TBI YLLs, crude and age-standardized TBI YLL
      rates, and TBI YLLs per case were calculated stratified for country, sex, and
      age. Pooled analyses were performed in order to estimate summary age-standardized
      rates of TBI YLLs. In order to evaluate the relative importance of TBI in the
      context of all injuries, proportions of TBI YLLs out of overall injury YLLs were 
      calculated. The total number of TBI YLLs was estimated by extrapolating the
      pooled crude rate of TBI YLLs in the 16 analyzed countries to the total
      population of the 28 member states of the EU (EU-28). We found that a total of
      17,049 TBI deaths occurred in 2013 in the 16 analyzed countries. These translated
      into a total of 374,636 YLLs. The pooled age-standardized rate of YLLs per
      100,000 people per year was 259.1 (95% CI: 205.8 to 312.3) overall, 427.5 (95%
      CI: 290.0 to 564.9) in males, and 105.4 (95% CI: 89.1 to 121.6) in females. Males
      contributed substantially more to TBI YLLs than females (282,870 YLLs, 76% of all
      TBI YLLs), which translated into a rate ratio of 3.24 (95% CI: 3.22 to 3.27).
      Each TBI death was on average associated with 24.3 (95% CI: 22.0 to 26.6) YLLs
      overall, 25.6 (95% CI: 23.4 to 27.8) in males and 20.9 (17.9 to 24.0) in females.
      Falls and traffic crashes were the most common external causes of TBI YLLs. TBI
      contributed on average 41% (44% in males and 34% in females) to overall injury
      YLLs. Extrapolating our findings, about 1.3 million YLLs were attributable to TBI
      in the EU-28 in 2013 overall, 1.1 million in males and 271,000 in females. This
      study is based on administratively collected data from 16 countries, and despite 
      the efforts to harmonize them to the greatest possible extent, there may be
      differences in coding practices or reporting between countries. If present, these
      would be inherited into our findings without our ability to control for them. The
      extrapolation of the pooled rates from the 16 countries to the EU-28 should be
      interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that TBI-related deaths
      and YLLs have a substantial impact at the individual and population level in
      Europe and present an important societal and economic burden that must not be
      overlooked. We provide information valuable for policy-makers, enabling them to
      evaluate and plan preventive activities and resource allocation, and to formulate
      and implement strategic decisions. In addition, our results can serve as a basis 
      for analyzing the overall burden of TBI in the population.

TI  - Community and health system intervention to reduce disrespect and abuse during
      childbirth in Tanga Region, Tanzania: A comparative before-and-after study.
PG  - e1002341
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002341 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abusive treatment of women during childbirth has been documented in
      low-resource countries and is a deterrent to facility utilization for delivery.
      Evidence for interventions to address women's poor experience is scant. We
      assessed a participatory community and health system intervention to reduce the
      prevalence of disrespect and abuse during childbirth in Tanzania. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We used a comparative before-and-after evaluation design to test the
      combined intervention to reduce disrespect and abuse. Two hospitals in Tanga
      Region, Tanzania were included in the study, 1 randomly assigned to receive the
      intervention. Women who delivered at the study facilities were eligible to
      participate and were recruited upon discharge. Surveys were conducted at baseline
      (December 2011 through May 2012) and after the intervention (March through
      September 2015). The intervention consisted of a client service charter and a
      facility-based, quality-improvement process aimed to redefine norms and practices
      for respectful maternity care. The primary outcome was any self-reported
      experiences of disrespect and abuse during childbirth. We used multivariable
      logistic regression to estimate a difference-in-difference model. At baseline,
      2,085 women at the 2 study hospitals who had been discharged from the maternity
      ward after delivery were invited to participate in the survey. Of these, 1,388
      (66.57%) agreed to participate. At endline, 1,680 women participated in the
      survey (72.29% of those approached). The intervention was associated with a 66%
      reduced odds of a woman experiencing disrespect and abuse during childbirth (odds
      ratio [OR]: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21-0.58, p < 0.0001). The biggest reductions were for
      physical abuse (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.97, p = 0.045) and neglect (OR: 0.36,
      95% CI: 0.19-0.71, p = 0.003). The study involved only 2 hospitals in Tanzania
      and is thus a proof-of-concept study. Future, larger-scale research should be
      undertaken to evaluate the applicability of this approach to other settings.
      CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of the combined intervention, the likelihood of
      women's reports of disrespectful treatment during childbirth was substantially
      reduced. These results were observed nearly 1 year after the end of the project's
      facilitation of implementation, indicating the potential for sustainability. The 
      results indicate that a participatory community and health system intervention
      designed to tackle disrespect and abuse by changing the norms and standards of
      care is a potential strategy to improve the treatment of women during childbirth 
      at health facilities. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN
      48258486. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN 48258486.

TI  - Validation of the sensitivity of the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization
      Study (NEXUS) Head computed tomographic (CT) decision instrument for selective
      imaging of blunt head injury patients: An observational study.
PG  - e1002313
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002313 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians, afraid of missing intracranial injuries, liberally obtain
      computed tomographic (CT) head imaging in blunt trauma patients. Prior work
      suggests that clinical criteria (National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization
      Study [NEXUS] Head CT decision instrument [DI]) can reliably identify patients
      with important injuries, while excluding injury, and the need for imaging in many
      patients. Validating this DI requires confirmation of the hypothesis that the
      lower 95% confidence limit for its sensitivity in detecting serious injury
      exceeds 99.0%. A secondary goal of the study was to complete an independent
      validation and comparison of the Canadian and NEXUS Head CT rules among the
      subgroup of patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective observational study of the NEXUS Head CT DI 
      in 4 hospital emergency departments between April 2006 and December 2015.
      Implementation of the rule requires that patients satisfy 8 criteria to achieve
      "low-risk" classification. Patients are excluded from "low-risk" classification
      and assigned "high-risk" status if they fail to meet 1 or more criteria. We
      examined the instrument's performance in assigning "high-risk" status to patients
      requiring neurosurgical intervention among a cohort of 11,770 blunt head injury
      patients. The NEXUS Head CT DI assigned high-risk status to 420 of 420 patients
      requiring neurosurgical intervention (sensitivity, 100.0% [95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 99.1%-100.0%]). The instrument assigned low-risk status to 2,823
      of 11,350 patients who did not require neurosurgical intervention (specificity,
      24.9% [95% CI: 24.1%-25.7%]). None of the 2,823 low-risk patients required
      neurosurgical intervention (negative predictive value [NPV], 100.0% [95% CI:
      99.9%-100.0%]). The DI assigned high-risk status to 759 of 767 patients with
      significant intracranial injuries (sensitivity, 99.0% [95% CI: 98.0%-99.6%]). The
      instrument assigned low-risk status to 2,815 of 11,003 patients who did not have 
      significant injuries (specificity, 25.6% [95% CI: 24.8%-26.4%]). Significant
      injuries were absent in 2,815 of the 2,823 patients assigned low-risk status
      (NPV, 99.7% [95% CI: 99.4%-99.9%]). Of our patients, 7,759 (65.9%) met the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria of the Canadian Head CT rule, including 111
      patients (1.43%) who required neurosurgical intervention and 306 (3.94%) who had 
      significant intracranial injuries. In our study, the Canadian criteria for
      neurosurgical intervention identified 108 of 111 patients requiring neurosurgical
      intervention to yield a sensitivity of 97.3% (95% CI: 92.3%-99.4%) and exhibited 
      a specificity of 58.8% (95% CI: 57.7%-59.9%). The NEXUS rule, when applied to
      this same cohort, identified all 111 patients requiring neurosurgical
      intervention, yielding a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 96.7%-100.0%) with a
      specificity of 32.6% (95% CI: 31.5%-33.6%). Our study found that the Canadian
      medium-risk factors identified 301 of 306 patients with significant injuries
      (sensitivity = 98.4%; 95% CI: 96.2%-99.5%), while the NEXUS rule identified 299
      of these patients (sensitivity = 97.7%; 95% CI: 95.3%-99.1%). In our study, the
      Canadian medium-risk rule exhibited a specificity of 12.3% (95% CI: 11.6%-13.1%),
      while the NEXUS rule exhibited a specificity of 33.3% (95% CI: 32.3%-34.4%).
      Limitations of the study may arise from application of the rule by different
      clinicians in different environments. Clinicians may vary in their interpretation
      and application of the instrument's criteria and risk assignment and may also
      vary in deciding which patients require intervention. The instrument's
      specificity is also subject to spectrum bias and may change with variations in
      the proportion of "low-risk" patients seen in other centers. CONCLUSIONS: The
      NEXUS Head CT DI reliably identifies blunt trauma patients who require head CT
      imaging and could significantly reduce the use of CT imaging.

TI  - Risk of surgical site infection, acute kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile
      infection following antibiotic prophylaxis with vancomycin plus a beta-lactam
      versus either drug alone: A national propensity-score-adjusted retrospective
      cohort study.
PG  - e1002340
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal regimen for perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is
      controversial. Use of combination prophylaxis with a beta-lactam plus vancomycin 
      is increasing; however, the relative risks and benefits associated with this
      strategy are unknown. Thus, we sought to compare postoperative outcomes following
      administration of 2 antimicrobials versus a single agent for the prevention of
      surgical site infections (SSIs). Potential harms associated with combination
      regimens, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and Clostridium difficile infection
      (CDI), were also considered. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a multicenter, national 
      Veterans Affairs (VA) cohort, all patients who underwent cardiac, orthopedic
      joint replacement, vascular, colorectal, and hysterectomy procedures during the
      period from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2013 and who received planned manual
      review of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis regimen and manual review for
      the 30-day incidence of SSI were included. Using a propensity-adjusted
      log-binomial regression model stratified by type of surgical procedure, the
      association between receipt of 2 antimicrobials (vancomycin plus a beta-lactam)
      versus either single agent alone (vancomycin or a beta-lactam) and SSI was
      evaluated. Measures of association were adjusted for age, diabetes, smoking,
      American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) status, and receipt of mupirocin. The 7-day
      incidence of postoperative AKI and 90-day incidence of CDI were also measured. In
      all, 70,101 procedures (52,504 beta-lactam only, 5,089 vancomycin only, and
      12,508 combination) with 2,466 (3.5%) SSIs from 109 medical centers were
      included. Among cardiac surgery patients, combination prophylaxis was associated 
      with a lower incidence of SSI (66/6,953, 0.95%) than single-agent prophylaxis
      (190/12,834, 1.48%; crude risk ratio [RR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.49, 0.85; adjusted RR
      0.61, 95% CI 0.46, 0.83). After adjusting for SSI risk, no association between
      receipt of combination prophylaxis and SSI was found for the other types of
      surgeries evaluated, including orthopedic joint replacement procedures. In
      MRSA-colonized patients undergoing cardiac surgery, SSI occurred in 8/346 (2.3%) 
      patients who received combination prophylaxis versus 4/100 (4.0%) patients who
      received vancomycin alone (crude RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.18, 1.88). Among MRSA-negative
      and -unknown cardiac surgery patients, SSIs occurred in 58/6,607 (0.9%) patients 
      receiving combination prophylaxis versus 146/10,215 (1.4%) patients who received 
      a beta-lactam alone (crude RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45, 0.83). Based on these
      associations, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 SSI in MRSA-colonized
      patients is estimated to be 53, compared to 176 in non-MRSA patients. CDI
      incidence was similar in both exposure groups. Across all types of surgical
      procedures, risk of AKI was increased in the combination antimicrobial
      prophylaxis group (2,971/12,508 [23.8%] receiving combination versus 1,058/5,089 
      [20.8%] receiving vancomycin alone versus 7,314/52,504 [13.9%] receiving
      beta-lactam alone). We found a significant association between absolute risk of
      AKI and receipt of combination regimens across all types of procedures. If the
      observed association is causal, the number needed to harm for severe AKI
      following cardiac surgery would be 167. The major limitation of our investigation
      is that it is an observational study in a predominantly male population, which
      may limit generalizability and lead to unmeasured confounding. CONCLUSIONS: There
      are benefits but also unintended consequences of antimicrobial and infection
      prevention strategies aimed at "getting to zero" healthcare-associated
      infections. In our study, combination prophylaxis was associated with both
      benefits (reduction in SSIs following cardiac surgical procedures) and harms
      (increase in postoperative AKI). In cardiac surgery patients, the difference in
      risk-benefit profile by MRSA status suggests that MRSA-screening-directed
      prophylaxis may optimize benefits while minimizing harms in this selected
      population. More information about long-term outcomes and patient and societal
      preferences regarding risk of SSI versus risk of AKI is needed to improve
      clinical decision-making.

TI  - Patient-reported outcomes and survival in multiple sclerosis: A 10-year
      retrospective cohort study using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29.
PG  - e1002346
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing emphasis on using patient-reported outcomes
      (PROs) to complement traditional clinical outcomes in medical research, including
      in multiple sclerosis (MS). Research, particularly in oncology and heart failure,
      has shown that PROs can be prognostic of hard clinical endpoints such as survival
      time (time from study entry until death). However, unlike in oncology or
      cardiology, it is unknown whether PROs are associated with survival time in
      neurological diseases. The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) is a PRO 
      sensitive to short-term change in MS, with questions covering both physical and
      psychological quality of life. This study aimed to investigate whether MSIS-29
      scores can be prognostic for survival time in MS, using a large observational
      cohort of people with MS. METHODS AND FINDINGS: From 15 July 2004 onwards,
      MSIS-29 questionnaires were completed by people with MS registered with the MS
      Society Tissue Bank (n = 2,126, repeated 1 year later with n = 872 of the
      original respondents). By 2014, 264 participants (12.4%) had died. Higher
      baseline MSIS-29 physical (MSIS-29-PHYS) score was associated with reduced
      survival time (subgroup with highest scores versus subgroup with lowest scores:
      hazard ratio [HR] 5.7, 95% CI 3.1-10.5, p < 0.001). Higher baseline MSIS-29
      psychological score was also associated with reduced survival time (subgroup with
      highest scores versus subgroup with lowest scores: HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.8-4.4, p <
      0.001). In those with high baseline MSIS-29 scores, mortality risk was even
      greater if the MSIS-29 score worsened over 1 year (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.4, p =
      0.02). MSIS-29-PHYS scores were associated with survival time independent of age,
      sex, and patient-reported Expanded Disability Status Scale score in a Cox
      regression analysis (per 1-SD increase in MSIS-29-PHYS score: HR 1.8, 95% CI
      1.1-2.9, p = 0.03). A limitation of the study is that this cohort had high
      baseline age and disability levels; the prognostic value of MSIS-29 for survival 
      time at earlier disease stages requires further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study reports that PROs can be prognostic for hard clinical outcomes in
      neurological disease, and supports PROs as a meaningful clinical outcome for use 
      in research and clinical settings.

TI  - Community health promotion and medical provision for neonatal health-CHAMPION
      cluster randomised trial in Nagarkurnool district, Telangana (formerly Andhra
      Pradesh), India.
PG  - e1002324
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the mid-2000s, neonatal mortality accounted for almost 40% of
      deaths of children under 5 years worldwide, and constituted 65% of infant deaths 
      in India. The neonatal mortality rate in Andhra Pradesh was 44 per 1,000 live
      births, and was higher in the rural areas and tribal regions, such as the
      Nagarkurnool division of Mahabubnagar district (which became Nagarkurnool
      district in Telangana in 2014). The aim of the CHAMPION trial was to investigate 
      whether a package of interventions comprising community health promotion and
      provision of health services (including outreach and facility-based care) could
      lead to a reduction of the order of 25% in neonatal mortality. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: The design was a trial in which villages (clusters) in Nagarkurnool
      with a population < 2,500 were randomised to the CHAMPION package of health
      interventions or to the control arm (in which children aged 6-9 years were
      provided with educational interventions-the STRIPES trial). A woman was eligible 
      for the CHAMPION package if she was married and <50 years old, neither she nor
      her husband had had a family planning operation, and she resided in a trial
      village at the time of a baseline survey before randomisation or married into the
      village after randomisation. The CHAMPION intervention package comprised
      community health promotion (including health education via village health
      worker-led participatory discussion groups) and provision of health services
      (including outreach, with mobile teams providing antenatal check-ups, and
      facility-based care, with subsidised access to non-public health centres
      [NPHCs]). Villages were stratified by travel time to the nearest NPHC and tribal 
      status, and randomised (1:1) within strata. The primary outcome was neonatal
      mortality. Secondary outcomes included maternal mortality, causes of death,
      health knowledge, health practices including health service usage, satisfaction
      with care, and costs. The baseline survey (enumeration) was carried out between
      August and November 2007. After randomisation on 18 February 2008, participants, 
      data collectors, and data analysts were not masked to allocation. The
      intervention was initiated on 1 August 2008. After an inception period, the
      assessment start date was 1 December 2008. The intervention ended on 31 May 2011,
      and data collection was completed on 30 November 2011. Primary analyses followed 
      the intention to treat principle. In all, 14,137 women were enrolled in 232
      control villages, and 15,532 in 232 intervention villages. Of these, 4,885
      control women had 5,474 eligible pregnancies and gave birth to 4,998 eligible
      children. The corresponding numbers in intervention villages were 5,664 women,
      6,351 pregnancies, and 5,798 children. Of the live-born babies, 343 (6.9%) in the
      control arm and 303 (5.2%) in the intervention arm died in their first 28 days of
      life (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.90, p = 0.0018; risk difference -1.59%,
      95% CI -2.63% to -0.54%), suggesting that there were 92 fewer deaths (95% CI 31
      to 152) as a result of the intervention. There were 9 (0.16%) maternal deaths in 
      the control arm compared to 13 (0.20%) in the intervention arm (risk ratio 1.24, 
      95% CI 0.53 to 2.90, p = 0.6176; 1 death was reported as a serious adverse
      event). There was evidence of improved health knowledge and health practices
      including health service usage in the intervention arm compared to the control
      arm. Women in the intervention arm were more likely to rate their delivery and
      postnatal care as good or very good. The total cost of the CHAMPION interventions
      was US$1,084,955 ($11,769 per life saved, 95% CI $7,115 to $34,653). The main
      limitations of the study included that it could not be masked post-randomisation 
      and that fetal losses were not divided into stillbirths and miscarriages because 
      gestational age was not reliably reported. CONCLUSIONS: The CHAMPION trial showed
      that a package of interventions addressing health knowledge and health seeking
      behaviour, buttressing existing health services, and contracting out important
      areas of maternal and child healthcare led to a reduction in neonatal mortality
      of almost the hypothesized 25% in small villages in an Indian state with high
      mortality rates. The intervention can be strongly justified in much of rural
      India, and is of potential use in other similar settings. Ongoing changes in
      maternal and child health programmes make it imperative that a similar
      intervention that establishes ties between the community and health facilities is
      tested in different settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN24104646.

TI  - Long-term health status and trajectories of seriously injured patients: A
      population-based longitudinal study.
PG  - e1002322
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of the quality of survival of patients is
      crucial in evaluating trauma care, understanding recovery patterns and
      timeframes, and informing healthcare, social, and disability service provision.
      We aimed to describe the longer-term health status of seriously injured patients,
      identify predictors of outcome, and establish recovery trajectories by population
      characteristics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-based, prospective cohort
      study using the Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR) was undertaken. We
      followed up 2,757 adult patients, injured between July 2011 and June 2012,
      through deaths registry linkage and telephone interview at 6-, 12-, 24-, and
      36-months postinjury. The 3-level EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L)
      was collected, and mixed-effects regression modelling was used to identify
      predictors of outcome, and recovery trajectories, for the EQ-5D-3L items and
      summary score. Mean (SD) age of participants was 50.8 (21.6) years, and 72% were 
      male. Twelve percent (n = 333) died during their hospital stay, 8.1% (n = 222) of
      patients died postdischarge, and 155 (7.0%) were known to have survived to
      36-months postinjury but were lost to follow-up at all time points. The
      prevalence of reporting problems at 36-months postinjury was 37% for mobility,
      21% for self-care, 47% for usual activities, 50% for pain/discomfort, and 41% for
      anxiety/depression. Continued improvement to 36-months postinjury was only
      present for the usual activities item; the adjusted relative risk (ARR) of
      reporting problems decreased from 6 to 12 (ARR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83-0.90), 12 to 24
      (ARR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.98), and 24 to 36 months (ARR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99).
      The risk of reporting problems with pain or discomfort increased from 24- to
      36-months postinjury (ARR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12). While loss to follow-up was 
      low, there was responder bias with patients injured in intentional events,
      younger, and less seriously injured patients less likely to participate;
      therefore, these patient subgroups were underrepresented in the study findings.
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ongoing problems at 3-years postinjury is high,
      confirming that serious injury is frequently a chronic disorder. These findings
      have implications for trauma system design. Investment in interventions to reduce
      the longer-term impact of injuries is needed, and greater investment in primary
      prevention is needed.

PG  - e1002310
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early revascularization of ischemic organs is key to improving
      outcomes, yet consequent reperfusion injury may be harmful. Reperfusion injury is
      largely attributed to excess mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS). Sulfide inhibits mitochondria and reduces ROS production. Ammonium
      tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM), a copper chelator, releases sulfide in a controlled
      and novel manner, and may offer potential therapeutic utility. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: In vitro, ATTM releases sulfide in a time-, pH-, temperature-, and
      thiol-dependent manner. Controlled sulfide release from ATTM reduces metabolism
      (measured as oxygen consumption) both in vivo in awake rats and ex vivo in
      skeletal muscle tissue, with a superior safety profile compared to standard
      sulfide generators. Given intravenously at reperfusion/resuscitation to rats,
      ATTM significantly reduced infarct size following either myocardial or cerebral
      ischemia, and conferred survival benefit following severe hemorrhage. Mechanistic
      studies (in vitro anoxia/reoxygenation) demonstrated a mitochondrial site of
      action (decreased MitoSOX fluorescence), where the majority of damaging ROS is
      produced. CONCLUSIONS: The inorganic thiometallate ATTM represents a new class of
      sulfide-releasing drugs. Our findings provide impetus for further investigation
      of this compound as a novel adjunct therapy for reperfusion injury.

TI  - Timing of femoral shaft fracture fixation following major trauma: A retrospective
      cohort study of United States trauma centers.
PG  - e1002336
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002336 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Femoral shaft fractures are common in major trauma. Early definitive 
      fixation, within 24 hours, is feasible in most patients and is associated with
      improved outcomes. Nonetheless, variability might exist between trauma centers in
      timeliness of fixation. Such variability could impact outcomes and would
      therefore represent a target for quality improvement. We evaluated variability in
      delayed fixation (>/=24 hours) between trauma centers participating in the
      American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) and 
      measured the resultant association with important clinical outcomes at the
      hospital level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective cohort study was performed 
      using data derived from the ACS TQIP database. Adults with severe injury who
      underwent definitive fixation of a femoral shaft fracture at a level I or II
      trauma center participating in ACS TQIP (2012-2015) were included. Patient
      baseline and injury characteristics that might affect timing of fixation were
      considered. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to identify
      predictors of delayed fixation. Hospital variability in delayed fixation was
      measured using 2 approaches. First, the random effects output of the hierarchical
      model was used to identify outlier hospitals where the odds of delayed fixation
      were significantly higher or lower than average. Second, the median odds ratio
      (MOR) was calculated to quantify heterogeneity in delayed fixation between
      hospitals. Finally, complications (pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis,
      acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, decubitus ulcer, and death) and
      hospital length of stay were compared across quartiles of risk-adjusted delayed
      fixation. We identified 17,993 patients who underwent definitive fixation at 216 
      trauma centers. The median injury severity score (ISS) was 13 (interquartile
      range [IQR] 9-22). Median time to fixation was 15 hours (IQR 7-24 hours) and
      delayed fixation was performed in 26% of patients. After adjusting for patient
      characteristics, 57 hospitals (26%) were identified as outliers, reflecting
      significant practice variation unexplained by patient case mix. The MOR was 1.84,
      reflecting heterogeneity in delayed fixation across centers. Compared to
      hospitals in the lowest quartile of delayed fixation, patients treated at
      hospitals in the highest quartile of delayed fixation suffered 2-fold higher
      rates of pulmonary embolism (2.6% versus 1.3%; rate ratio [RR] 2.0; 95% CI
      1.2-3.2; P = 0.005) and required greater length of stay (7 versus 6 days; RR
      1.15; 95% CI 1.1-1.19; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference with
      respect to mortality (1.3% versus 0.8%; RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P = 0.066). The
      main limitations of this study include the inability to classify fractures by
      severity, challenges related to the heterogeneity of the study population, and
      the potential for residual confounding due to unmeasured factors. CONCLUSIONS: In
      this large cohort study of 216 trauma centers, significant practice variability
      was observed in delayed fixation of femoral shaft fractures, which could not be
      explained by differences in patient case mix. Patients treated at centers where
      delayed fixation was most common were at significantly greater risk of pulmonary 
      embolism and required longer hospital stay. Trauma centers should strive to
      minimize delays in fixation, and quality improvement initiatives should emphasize
      this recommendation in best practice guidelines.

TI  - Risk of hospitalization with neurodegenerative disease after moderate-to-severe
      traumatic brain injury in the working-age population: A retrospective cohort
      study using the Finnish national health registries.
PG  - e1002316
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies suggest that working-aged persons
      with a history of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have an
      increased risk for developing neurodegenerative disease (NDD) while persons with 
      a history of mild TBI do not. In this comprehensive nationwide study in Finland, 
      we assessed the risk of NDD and history of moderate-to-severe TBI in the
      working-age population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a population-based
      follow-up study using the Finnish Care Register for Health Care to identify all
      persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years hospitalized during 1987-2014 due to 
      TBI who did not have a baseline NDD diagnosis. We compared the risk of
      hospitalization with NDD between persons hospitalized due to moderate-to-severe
      TBI (intracranial lesions) and persons hospitalized due to mild TBI (no
      intracranial lesions). Follow-up NDD diagnoses were recorded from 1 year
      following the TBI to the end of 2014. NDD diagnoses included dementia, Parkinson 
      disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We used a Cox proportional hazards
      model, adjusting for age, sex, education, and socioeconomic group, to assess the 
      association between TBI and NDD. In total, 19,936 and 20,703 persons with a
      history of moderate-to-severe TBI and mild TBI, respectively, were included. The 
      overall time at risk was 453,079 person-years (median 10 years per person). In
      total, 3.5% (N = 696) persons in the moderate-to-severe TBI group developed NDD
      compared to 1.6% (N = 326) in the mild TBI group. After adjusting for covariates,
      moderate-to-severe TBI was associated with an increased risk for NDD, with a
      hazard ratio (HR) of 1.8 (95% CI 1.6-2.1) compared to mild TBI. Of the NDD
      subtypes, only moderate-to-severe TBI was associated with an increased risk for
      dementia (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.2). Yet, this large-scale epidemiological study
      does not prove that there is a causal relationship between moderate-to-severe TBI
      and NDD. Further, the Care Register for Health Care includes only hospitalized
      persons; thus, patients diagnosed with NDD in the outpatient setting may have
      been missed. Additional limitations include the potential for miscoding and
      unmeasured confounds. CONCLUSIONS: In working-aged persons, a history of
      moderate-to-severe TBI is associated with an increased risk for future dementia
      but not for Parkinson disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Mammographic density and ageing: A collaborative pooled analysis of
      cross-sectional data from 22 countries worldwide.
PG  - e1002335
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mammographic density (MD) is one of the strongest breast cancer risk 
      factors. Its age-related characteristics have been studied in women in western
      countries, but whether these associations apply to women worldwide is not known. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined cross-sectional differences in MD by age and
      menopausal status in over 11,000 breast-cancer-free women aged 35-85 years, from 
      40 ethnicity- and location-specific population groups across 22 countries in the 
      International Consortium on Mammographic Density (ICMD). MD was read centrally
      using a quantitative method (Cumulus) and its square-root metrics were analysed
      using meta-analysis of group-level estimates and linear regression models of
      pooled data, adjusted for body mass index, reproductive factors, mammogram view, 
      image type, and reader. In all, 4,534 women were premenopausal, and 6,481
      postmenopausal, at the time of mammography. A large age-adjusted difference in
      percent MD (PD) between post- and premenopausal women was apparent (-0.46 cm [95%
      CI: -0.53, -0.39]) and appeared greater in women with lower breast cancer risk
      profiles; variation across population groups due to heterogeneity (I2) was 16.5%.
      Among premenopausal women, the radicalPD difference per 10-year increase in age
      was -0.24 cm (95% CI: -0.34, -0.14; I2 = 30%), reflecting a compositional change 
      (lower dense area and higher non-dense area, with no difference in breast area). 
      In postmenopausal women, the corresponding difference in radicalPD (-0.38 cm [95%
      CI: -0.44, -0.33]; I2 = 30%) was additionally driven by increasing breast area.
      The study is limited by different mammography systems and its cross-sectional
      rather than longitudinal nature. CONCLUSIONS: Declines in MD with increasing age 
      are present premenopausally, continue postmenopausally, and are most pronounced
      over the menopausal transition. These effects were highly consistent across
      diverse groups of women worldwide, suggesting that they result from an intrinsic 
      biological, likely hormonal, mechanism common to women. If cumulative breast
      density is a key determinant of breast cancer risk, younger ages may be the more 
      critical periods for lifestyle modifications aimed at breast density and breast
      cancer risk reduction.

TI  - Modelled health benefits of a sugar-sweetened beverage tax across different
      socioeconomic groups in Australia: A cost-effectiveness and equity analysis.
PG  - e1002326
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002326 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax in Mexico has been effective in 
      reducing consumption of SSBs, with larger decreases for low-income households.
      The health and financial effects across socioeconomic groups are important
      considerations for policy-makers. From a societal perspective, we assessed the
      potential cost-effectiveness, health gains, and financial impacts by
      socioeconomic position (SEP) of a 20% SSB tax for Australia. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Australia-specific price elasticities were used to predict decreases in
      SSB consumption for each Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) quintile.
      Changes in body mass index (BMI) were based on SSB consumption, BMI from the
      Australian Health Survey 2011-12, and energy balance equations. Markov cohort
      models were used to estimate the health impact for the Australian population,
      taking into account obesity-related diseases. Health-adjusted life years (HALYs) 
      gained, healthcare costs saved, and out-of-pocket costs were estimated for each
      SEIFA quintile. Loss of economic welfare was calculated as the amount of
      deadweight loss in excess of taxation revenue. A 20% SSB tax would lead to HALY
      gains of 175,300 (95% CI: 68,700; 277,800) and healthcare cost savings of
      AU$1,733 million (m) (95% CI: $650m; $2,744m) over the lifetime of the
      population, with 49.5% of the total health gains accruing to the 2 lowest
      quintiles. We estimated the increase in annual expenditure on SSBs to be
      AU$35.40/capita (0.54% of expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks) in the
      lowest SEIFA quintile, a difference of AU$3.80/capita (0.32%) compared to the
      highest quintile. Annual tax revenue was estimated at AU$642.9m (95% CI: $348.2m;
      $1,117.2m). The main limitations of this study, as with all simulation models, is
      that the results represent only the best estimate of a potential effect in the
      absence of stronger direct evidence. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that
      from a 20% tax on SSBs, the most HALYs gained and healthcare costs saved would
      accrue to the most disadvantaged quintiles in Australia. Whilst those in more
      disadvantaged areas would pay more SSB tax, the difference between areas is
      small. The equity of the tax could be further improved if the tax revenue were
      used to fund initiatives benefiting those with greater disadvantage.

TI  - Low-intensity cognitive-behaviour therapy interventions for obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder compared to waiting list for therapist-led cognitive-behaviour therapy: 
      3-arm randomised controlled trial of clinical effectiveness.
PG  - e1002337
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002337 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is prevalent and without adequate
      treatment usually follows a chronic course. "High-intensity" cognitive-behaviour 
      therapy (CBT) from a specialist therapist is current "best practice." However,
      access is difficult because of limited numbers of therapists and because of the
      disabling effects of OCD symptoms. There is a potential role for "low-intensity" 
      interventions as part of a stepped care model. Low-intensity interventions
      (written or web-based materials with limited therapist support) can be provided
      remotely, which has the potential to increase access. However, current evidence
      concerning low-intensity interventions is insufficient. We aimed to determine the
      clinical effectiveness of 2 forms of low-intensity CBT prior to high-intensity
      CBT, in adults meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for OCD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was
      approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West-Lancaster
      (reference number 11/NW/0276). All participants provided informed consent to take
      part in the trial. We conducted a 3-arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial 
      in primary- and secondary-care United Kingdom mental health services. All
      patients were on a waiting list for therapist-led CBT (treatment as usual). Four 
      hundred and seventy-three eligible patients were recruited and randomised.
      Patients had a median age of 33 years, and 60% were female. The majority were
      experiencing severe OCD. Patients received 1 of 2 low-intensity interventions:
      computerised CBT (cCBT; web-based CBT materials and limited telephone support)
      through "OCFighter" or guided self-help (written CBT materials with limited
      telephone or face-to-face support). Primary comparisons concerned OCD symptoms,
      measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Observer-Rated
      (Y-BOCS-OR) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included health-related
      quality of life, depression, anxiety, and functioning. At 3 months, guided
      self-help demonstrated modest benefits over the waiting list in reducing OCD
      symptoms (adjusted mean difference = -1.91, 95% CI -3.27 to -0.55). These effects
      did not reach a prespecified level of "clinically significant benefit." cCBT did 
      not demonstrate significant benefit (adjusted mean difference = -0.71, 95% CI
      -2.12 to 0.70). At 12 months, neither guided self-help nor cCBT led to
      differences in OCD symptoms. Early access to low-intensity interventions led to
      significant reductions in uptake of high-intensity CBT over 12 months; 86% of the
      patients allocated to the waiting list for high-intensity CBT started treatment
      by the end of the trial, compared to 62% in supported cCBT and 57% in guided
      self-help. These reductions did not compromise longer-term patient outcomes. Data
      suggested small differences in satisfaction at 3 months, with patients more
      satisfied with guided self-help than supported cCBT. A significant issue in the
      interpretation of the results concerns the level of access to high-intensity CBT 
      before the primary outcome assessment. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that
      providing low-intensity interventions does not lead to clinically significant
      benefits but may reduce uptake of therapist-led CBT. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Contribution of cognitive performance and cognitive decline to associations
      between socioeconomic factors and dementia: A cohort study.
PG  - e1002334
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002334 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic disadvantage is a risk factor for dementia, but
      longitudinal studies suggest that it does not affect the rate of cognitive
      decline. Our objective is to understand the manner in which socioeconomic
      disadvantage shapes dementia risk by examining its associations with midlife
      cognitive performance and cognitive decline from midlife to old age, including
      cognitive decline trajectories in those with dementia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data
      are drawn from the Whitehall II study (N = 10,308 at study recruitment in 1985), 
      with cognitive function assessed at 4 waves (1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012).
      Sociodemographic, behavioural, and cardiometabolic risk factors from 1985 and
      chronic conditions until the end of follow-up in 2015 (N dementia/total =
      320/9,938) allowed the use of inverse probability weighting to take into account 
      data missing because of loss to follow-up between the study recruitment in 1985
      and the introduction of cognitive tests to the study in 1997. Generalized
      estimating equations and Cox regression were used to assess associations of
      socioeconomic markers (height, education, and midlife occupation categorized as
      low, intermediate, and high to represent hierarchy in the socioeconomic marker)
      with cognitive performance, cognitive decline, and dementia (N dementia/total =
      195/7,499). In those with dementia, we examined whether retrospective
      trajectories of cognitive decline (backward timescale) over 18 years prior to
      diagnosis differed as a function of socioeconomic markers. Socioeconomic
      disadvantage was associated with poorer cognitive performance (all p < 0.001).
      Using point estimates for the effect of age, the differences between the high and
      low socioeconomic groups corresponded to an age effect of 4, 15, and 26 years,
      for height, education, and midlife occupation, respectively. There was no
      evidence of faster cognitive decline in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.
      Low occupation, but not height or education, was associated with risk of dementia
      (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-3.36]) in an
      analysis adjusted for sociodemographic factors; the excess risk was unchanged
      after adjustment for cognitive decline but was completely attenuated after
      adjustment for cognitive performance. In further analyses restricted to those
      with dementia, retrospective cognitive trajectories over 18 years prior to
      dementia diagnosis showed faster cognitive decline in the high education (p =
      0.006) and occupation (p = 0.001) groups such that large differences in cognitive
      performance in midlife were attenuated at dementia diagnosis. A major limitation 
      of our study is the use of electronic health records rather than comprehensive
      dementia ascertainment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the passive or threshold
      cognitive reserve hypothesis, in that high cognitive reserve is associated with
      lower risk for dementia because of its association with cognitive performance,
      which provides a buffer against clinical expression of dementia.

TI  - Validity of a minimally invasive autopsy tool for cause of death determination in
      pediatric deaths in Mozambique: An observational study.
PG  - e1002317
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002317 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent decades, the world has witnessed unprecedented progress in 
      child survival. However, our knowledge of what is killing nearly 6 million
      children annually in low- and middle-income countries remains poor, partly
      because of the inadequacy and reduced precision of the methods currently utilized
      in these settings to investigate causes of death (CoDs). The study objective was 
      to validate the use of a minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) approach as an adequate
      and more acceptable substitute for the complete diagnostic autopsy (CDA) for
      pediatric CoD investigation in a poor setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this
      observational study, the validity of the MIA approach in determining the CoD was 
      assessed in 54 post-neonatal pediatric deaths (age range: >/=1 mo to 15 y) in a
      referral hospital of Mozambique by comparing the results of the MIA with those of
      the CDA. Concordance in the category of disease obtained by the two methods was
      evaluated by the Kappa statistic, and the sensitivity, specificity, and positive 
      and negative predictive values of the MIA diagnoses were calculated. A CoD was
      identified in all cases in the CDA and in 52/54 (96%) of the cases in the MIA,
      with infections and malignant tumors accounting for the majority of diagnoses.
      The MIA categorization of disease showed a substantial concordance with the CDA
      categorization (Kappa = 0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.92), and sensitivity, specificity,
      and overall accuracy were high. The ICD-10 diagnoses were coincident in up to 75%
      (36/48) of the cases. The MIA allowed the identification of the specific pathogen
      deemed responsible for the death in two-thirds (21/32; 66%) of all deaths of
      infectious origin. Discrepancies between the MIA and the CDA in individual
      diagnoses could be minimized with the addition of some basic clinical information
      such as those ascertainable through a verbal autopsy or clinical record. The main
      limitation of the analysis is that both the MIA and the CDA include some degree
      of expert subjective interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The MIA showed substantial
      concordance with CDA for CoD identification in this series of pediatric deaths in
      Mozambique. This minimally invasive approach, simpler and more readily acceptable
      than the more invasive CDA, could provide robust data for CoD surveillance,
      especially in resource-limited settings, which could be helpful for guiding child
      survival strategies in the future.

TI  - Validity of a minimally invasive autopsy for cause of death determination in
      stillborn babies and neonates in Mozambique: An observational study.
PG  - e1002318
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 5 million stillbirths and neonatal deaths occur annually.
      Limited and imprecise information on the cause of these deaths hampers progress
      in achieving global health targets. Complete diagnostic autopsies (CDAs)-the gold
      standard for cause of death determination-are difficult to perform in most
      high-burden settings. Therefore, validation of simpler and more feasible methods 
      is needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this observational study, the validity of a
      minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) method in determining the cause of death was
      assessed in 18 stillbirths and 41 neonatal deaths by comparing the results of the
      MIA with those of the CDA. Concordance between the categories of diseases
      obtained by the 2 methods was assessed by the Kappa statistic, and the
      sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of the MIA
      diagnoses were calculated. A cause of death was identified in 16/18 (89%) and
      15/18 (83%) stillborn babies in the CDA and the MIA, respectively. Fetal growth
      restriction accounted for 39%, infectious diseases for 22%, intrapartum hypoxia
      for 17%, and intrauterine hypoxia for 11% of stillborn babies. Overall, the MIA
      showed in this group a substantial concordance with the CDA (Kappa = 0.78, 95% CI
      [0.56-0.99]). A cause of death was identified in all (100%) and 35/41 (85%)
      neonatal deaths in the CDA and the MIA, respectively. In this group, the majority
      of deaths were due to infectious diseases (66%). The overall concordance of the
      MIA with the CDA in neonates was moderate (Kappa = 0.40, 95% CI [0.18-0.63]). A
      high percentage of accuracy was observed for the MIA in all the diagnostic
      categories in both stillbirths and neonates (>75%). The main limitation of this
      study is that some degree of subjective interpretation is inherent to
      cause-of-death attribution in both the MIA and the CDA; this is especially so in 
      stillbirths and in relation to fetal growth restriction. CONCLUSIONS: The MIA
      could be a useful tool for cause-of-death determination in stillbirths and
      neonatal deaths. These findings may help to accelerate progress towards meeting
      global health targets by obtaining more accurate information on the causes of
      death in these age groups, which is essential in guiding the design of new
      interventions and increasing the effectiveness of those already implemented.

TI  - Population-level impact of an accelerated HIV response plan to reach the UNAIDS
      90-90-90 target in Cote d'Ivoire: Insights from mathematical modeling.
PG  - e1002321
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: National responses will need to be markedly accelerated to achieve
      the ambitious target of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). 
      This target aims for 90% of HIV-positive individuals to be aware of their status,
      for 90% of those aware to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), and for 90% of
      those on treatment to have a suppressed viral load by 2020, with each individual 
      target reaching 95% by 2030. We aimed to estimate the impact of various
      treatment-as-prevention scenarios in Cote d'Ivoire, one of the countries with the
      highest HIV incidence in West Africa, with unmet HIV prevention and treatment
      needs, and where key populations are important to the broader HIV epidemic.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: An age-stratified dynamic model was developed and
      calibrated to epidemiological and programmatic data using a Bayesian framework.
      The model represents sexual and vertical HIV transmission in the general
      population, female sex workers (FSW), and men who have sex with men (MSM). We
      estimated the impact of scaling up interventions to reach the UNAIDS targets, as 
      well as the impact of 8 other scenarios, on HIV transmission in adults and
      children, compared to our baseline scenario that maintains 2015 rates of testing,
      ART initiation, ART discontinuation, treatment failure, and levels of condom use.
      In 2015, we estimated that 52% (95% credible intervals: 46%-58%) of HIV-positive 
      individuals were aware of their status, 72% (57%-82%) of those aware were on ART,
      and 77% (74%-79%) of those on ART were virologically suppressed. Reaching the
      UNAIDS targets on time would avert 50% (42%-60%) of new HIV infections over
      2015-2030 compared to 30% (25%-36%) if the 90-90-90 target is reached in 2025.
      Attaining the UNAIDS targets in FSW, their clients, and MSM (but not in the rest 
      of the population) would avert a similar fraction of new infections (30%;
      21%-39%). A 25-percentage-point drop in condom use from the 2015 levels among FSW
      and MSM would reduce the impact of reaching the UNAIDS targets, with 38%
      (26%-51%) of infections averted. The study's main limitation is that homogenous
      spatial coverage of interventions was assumed, and future lines of inquiry should
      examine how geographical prioritization could affect HIV transmission.
      CONCLUSIONS: Maximizing the impact of the UNAIDS targets will require rapid
      scale-up of interventions, particularly testing, ART initiation, and limiting ART
      discontinuation. Reaching clients of FSW, as well as key populations, can
      efficiently reduce transmission. Sustaining the high condom-use levels among key 
      populations should remain an important prevention pillar.

TI  - Estimating the causal influence of body mass index on risk of Parkinson disease: 
      A Mendelian randomisation study.
PG  - e1002314
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both positive and negative associations between higher body mass
      index (BMI) and Parkinson disease (PD) have been reported in observational
      studies, but it has been difficult to establish causality because of the
      possibility of residual confounding or reverse causation. To our knowledge,
      Mendelian randomisation (MR)-the use of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) to
      explore causal effects-has not previously been used to test the effect of BMI on 
      PD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide
      association (GWA) study data. The associations between the genetic instruments
      and BMI were obtained from the GIANT consortium and consisted of the per-allele
      difference in mean BMI for 77 independent variants that reached genome-wide
      significance. The per-allele difference in log-odds of PD for each of these
      variants was estimated from a recent meta-analysis, which included 13,708 cases
      of PD and 95,282 controls. The inverse-variance weighted method was used to
      estimate a pooled odds ratio (OR) for the effect of a 5-kg/m2 higher BMI on PD.
      Evidence of directional pleiotropy averaged across all variants was sought using 
      MR-Egger regression. Frailty simulations were used to assess whether causal
      associations were affected by mortality selection. A combined genetic IV expected
      to confer a lifetime exposure of 5-kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a lower
      risk of PD (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98). MR-Egger regression gave similar results,
      suggesting that directional pleiotropy was unlikely to be biasing the result
      (intercept 0.002; p = 0.654). However, the apparent protective influence of
      higher BMI could be at least partially induced by survival bias in the PD GWA
      study, as demonstrated by frailty simulations. Other important limitations of
      this application of MR include the inability to analyse non-linear associations, 
      to undertake subgroup analyses, and to gain mechanistic insights. CONCLUSIONS: In
      this large study using two-sample MR, we found that variants known to influence
      BMI had effects on PD in a manner consistent with higher BMI leading to lower
      risk of PD. The mechanism underlying this apparent protective effect warrants
      further study.

TI  - The US President's Malaria Initiative and under-5 child mortality in sub-Saharan 
      Africa: A difference-in-differences analysis.
PG  - e1002319
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite substantial financial contributions by the United States
      President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) since 2006, no studies have carefully
      assessed how this program may have affected important population-level health
      outcomes. We utilized multiple publicly available data sources to evaluate the
      association between introduction of PMI and child mortality rates in sub-Saharan 
      Africa (SSA). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used difference-in-differences analyses to
      compare trends in the primary outcome of under-5 mortality rates and secondary
      outcomes reflecting population coverage of malaria interventions in 19
      PMI-recipient and 13 non-recipient countries between 1995 and 2014. The analyses 
      controlled for presence and intensity of other large funding sources, individual 
      and household characteristics, and country and year fixed effects. PMI program
      implementation was associated with a significant reduction in the annual risk of 
      under-5 child mortality (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96). Each
      dollar of per-capita PMI expenditures in a country, a measure of PMI intensity,
      was also associated with a reduction in child mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI
      0.78-0.93). We estimated that the under-5 mortality rate in PMI countries was
      reduced from 28.9 to 24.3 per 1,000 person-years. Population coverage of
      insecticide-treated nets increased by 8.34 percentage points (95% CI 0.86-15.83) 
      and coverage of indoor residual spraying increased by 6.63 percentage points (95%
      CI 0.79-12.47) after PMI implementation. Per-capita PMI spending was also
      associated with a modest increase in artemisinin-based combination therapy
      coverage (3.56 percentage point increase, 95% CI -0.07-7.19), though this
      association was only marginally significant (p = 0.054). Our results were robust 
      to several sensitivity analyses. Because our study design leaves open the
      possibility of unmeasured confounding, we cannot definitively interpret these
      results as causal. CONCLUSIONS: PMI may have significantly contributed to
      reducing the burden of malaria in SSA and reducing the number of child deaths in 
      the region. Introduction of PMI was associated with increased coverage of malaria
      prevention technologies, which are important mechanisms through which child
      mortality can be reduced. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the
      association between PMI and all-cause child mortality in SSA with the use of
      appropriate comparison groups and adjustments for regional trends in child
      mortality.

TI  - Risk factors and short-term projections for serotype-1 poliomyelitis incidence in
      Pakistan: A spatiotemporal analysis.
PG  - e1002323
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002323 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pakistan currently provides a substantial challenge to global polio
      eradication, having contributed to 73% of reported poliomyelitis in 2015 and 54% 
      in 2016. A better understanding of the risk factors and movement patterns that
      contribute to poliovirus transmission across Pakistan would support
      evidence-based planning for mass vaccination campaigns. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We 
      fit mixed-effects logistic regression models to routine surveillance data
      recording the presence of poliomyelitis associated with wild-type 1 poliovirus in
      districts of Pakistan over 6-month intervals between 2010 to 2016. To accurately 
      capture the force of infection (FOI) between districts, we compared 6 models of
      population movement (adjacency, gravity, radiation, radiation based on population
      density, radiation based on travel times, and mobile-phone based). We used the
      best-fitting model (based on the Akaike Information Criterion [AIC]) to produce
      6-month forecasts of poliomyelitis incidence. The odds of observing poliomyelitis
      decreased with improved routine or supplementary (campaign) immunisation coverage
      (multivariable odds ratio [OR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.84;
      and OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.85, respectively, for each 10% increase in coverage)
      and increased with a higher rate of reporting non-polio acute flaccid paralysis
      (AFP) (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.26 for a 1-unit increase in non-polio AFP per
      100,000 persons aged <15 years). Estimated movement of poliovirus-infected
      individuals was associated with the incidence of poliomyelitis, with the
      radiation model of movement providing the best fit to the data. Six-month
      forecasts of poliomyelitis incidence by district for 2013-2016 showed good
      predictive ability (area under the curve range: 0.76-0.98). However, although the
      best-fitting movement model (radiation) was a significant determinant of
      poliomyelitis incidence, it did not improve the predictive ability of the
      multivariable model. Overall, in Pakistan the risk of polio cases was predicted
      to reduce between July-December 2016 and January-June 2017. The accuracy of the
      model may be limited by the small number of AFP cases in some districts.
      CONCLUSIONS: Spatiotemporal variation in immunization performance and population 
      movement patterns are important determinants of historical poliomyelitis
      incidence in Pakistan; however, movement dynamics were less influential in
      predicting future cases, at a time when the polio map is shrinking. Results from 
      the regression models we present are being used to help plan vaccination
      campaigns and transit vaccination strategies in Pakistan.

TI  - Reducing US cardiovascular disease burden and disparities through national and
      targeted dietary policies: A modelling study.
PG  - e1002311
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large socio-economic disparities exist in US dietary habits and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. While economic incentives have
      demonstrated success in improving dietary choices, the quantitative impact of
      different dietary policies on CVD disparities is not well established. We aimed
      to quantify and compare the potential effects on total CVD mortality and
      disparities of specific dietary policies to increase fruit and vegetable (F&V)
      consumption and reduce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in the US.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the US IMPACT Food Policy Model and probabilistic
      sensitivity analyses, we estimated and compared the reductions in CVD mortality
      and socio-economic disparities in the US population potentially achievable from
      2015 to 2030 with specific dietary policy scenarios: (a) a national mass media
      campaign (MMC) aimed to increase consumption of F&Vs and reduce consumption of
      SSBs, (b) a national fiscal policy to tax SSBs to increase prices by 10%, (c) a
      national fiscal policy to subsidise F&Vs to reduce prices by 10%, and (d) a
      targeted policy to subsidise F&Vs to reduce prices by 30% among Supplemental
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants only. We also evaluated a
      combined policy approach, combining all of the above policies. Data sources
      included the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, National Vital 
      Statistics System, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and
      published meta-analyses. Among the individual policy scenarios, a national 10%
      F&V subsidy was projected to be most beneficial, potentially resulting in
      approximately 150,500 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 141,400-158,500) CVD deaths 
      prevented or postponed (DPPs) by 2030 in the US. This far exceeds the
      approximately 35,100 (95% UI 31,700-37,500) DPPs potentially attributable to a
      30% F&V subsidy targeting SNAP participants, the approximately 25,800 (95% UI
      24,300-28,500) DPPs for a 1-y MMC, or the approximately 31,000 (95% UI
      26,800-35,300) DPPs for a 10% SSB tax. Neither the MMC nor the individual
      national economic policies would significantly reduce CVD socio-economic
      disparities. However, the SNAP-targeted intervention might potentially reduce CVD
      disparities between SNAP participants and SNAP-ineligible individuals, by
      approximately 8% (10 DPPs per 100,000 population). The combined policy approach
      might save more lives than any single policy studied (approximately 230,000 DPPs 
      by 2030) while also significantly reducing disparities, by approximately 6% (7
      DPPs per 100,000 population). Limitations include our effect estimates in the
      model; these estimates use interventional and prospective observational studies
      (not exclusively randomised controlled trials). They are thus imperfect and
      should be interpreted as the best available evidence. Another key limitation is
      that we considered only CVD outcomes; the policies we explored would undoubtedly 
      have additional beneficial effects upon other diseases. Further, we did not model
      or compare the cost-effectiveness of each proposed policy. CONCLUSIONS: Fiscal
      strategies targeting diet might substantially reduce CVD burdens. A national 10% 
      F&V subsidy would save by far the most lives, while a 30% F&V subsidy targeting
      SNAP participants would most reduce socio-economic disparities. A combined policy
      would have the greatest overall impact on both mortality and socio-economic
      disparities.

TI  - Maternal age and severe maternal morbidity: A population-based retrospective
      cohort study.
PG  - e1002307
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals of 2000 was
      to reduce maternal mortality by 75% in 15 y; however, this challenge was not met 
      by many industrialized countries. As average maternal age continues to rise in
      these countries, associated potentially life-threatening severe maternal
      morbidity has been understudied. Our primary objective was to examine the
      associations between maternal age and severe maternal morbidities. The secondary 
      objective was to compare these associations with those for adverse fetal/infant
      outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a population-based retrospective cohort 
      study, including all singleton births to women residing in Washington State, US, 
      1 January 2003-31 December 2013 (n = 828,269). We compared age-specific rates of 
      maternal mortality/severe morbidity (e.g., obstetric shock) and adverse
      fetal/infant outcomes (e.g., perinatal death). Logistic regression was used to
      adjust for parity, body mass index, assisted conception, and other potential
      confounders. We compared crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs (AORs) and risk
      differences and their 95% CIs. Severe maternal morbidity was significantly higher
      among teenage mothers than among those 25-29 y (crude OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.5-1.6)
      and increased exponentially with maternal age over 39 y, from OR = 1.2 (95% CI
      1.2-1.3) among women aged 35-39 y to OR = 5.4 (95% CI 2.4-12.5) among women aged 
      >/=50 y. The elevated risk of severe morbidity among teen mothers disappeared
      after adjustment for confounders, except for maternal sepsis (AOR = 1.2, 95% CI
      1.1-1.4). Adjusted rates of severe morbidity remained increased among mothers
      >/=35 y, namely, the rates of amniotic fluid embolism (AOR = 8.0, 95% CI
      2.7-23.7) and obstetric shock (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.6) among mothers >/=40 y, 
      and renal failure (AOR = 15.9, 95% CI 4.8-52.0), complications of obstetric
      interventions (AOR = 4.7, 95% CI 2.3-9.5), and intensive care unit (ICU)
      admission (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI 2.0-11.9) among those 45-49 y. The adjusted risk
      difference in severe maternal morbidity compared to mothers 25-29 y was 0.9% (95%
      CI 0.7%-1.2%) for mothers 40-44 y, 1.6% (95% CI 0.7%-2.8%) for mothers 45-49 y,
      and 6.4% for mothers >/=50 y (95% CI 1.7%-18.2%). Similar associations were
      observed for fetal and infant outcomes; neonatal mortality was elevated in teen
      mothers (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.7), while mothers over 29 y had higher risk of
      stillbirth. The rate of severe maternal morbidity among women over 49 y was
      higher than the rate of mortality/serious morbidity of their offspring. Despite
      the large sample size, statistical power was insufficient to examine the
      association between maternal age and maternal death or very rare severe
      morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal age-specific incidence of severe morbidity
      varied by outcome. Older women (>/=40 y) had significantly elevated rates of some
      of the most severe, potentially life-threatening morbidities, including renal
      failure, shock, acute cardiac morbidity, serious complications of obstetric
      interventions, and ICU admission. These results should improve counselling to
      women who contemplate delaying childbirth until their forties and provide useful 
      information to their health care providers. This information is also useful for
      preventive strategies to lower maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity
      in developed countries.

TI  - Association between expansion of primary healthcare and racial inequalities in
      mortality amenable to primary care in Brazil: A national longitudinal analysis.
PG  - e1002306
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Universal health coverage (UHC) can play an important role in
      achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10, which addresses reducing
      inequalities, but little supporting evidence is available from low- and
      middle-income countries. Brazil's Estrategia de Saude da Familia (ESF) (family
      health strategy) is a community-based primary healthcare (PHC) programme that has
      been expanding since the 1990s and is the main platform for delivering UHC in the
      country. We evaluated whether expansion of the ESF was associated with
      differential reductions in mortality amenable to PHC between racial groups.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Municipality-level longitudinal fixed-effects panel
      regressions were used to examine associations between ESF coverage and mortality 
      from ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) in black/pardo (mixed race) and
      white individuals over the period 2000-2013. Models were adjusted for
      socio-economic development and wider health system variables. Over the period
      2000-2013, there were 281,877 and 318,030 ACSC deaths (after age standardisation)
      in the black/pardo and white groups, respectively, in the 1,622 municipalities
      studied. Age-standardised ACSC mortality fell from 93.3 to 57.9 per 100,000
      population in the black/pardo group and from 75.7 to 49.2 per 100,000 population 
      in the white group. ESF expansion (from 0% to 100%) was associated with a 15.4%
      (rate ratio [RR]: 0.846; 95% CI: 0.796-0.899) reduction in ACSC mortality in the 
      black/pardo group compared with a 6.8% (RR: 0.932; 95% CI: 0.892-0.974) reduction
      in the white group (coefficients significantly different, p = 0.012). These
      differential benefits were driven by greater reductions in mortality from
      infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies and anaemia, diabetes, and
      cardiovascular disease in the black/pardo group. Although the analysis is
      ecological, sensitivity analyses suggest that over 30% of black/pardo deaths
      would have to be incorrectly coded for the results to be invalid. This study is
      limited by the use of municipal-aggregate data, which precludes individual-level 
      inference. Omitted variable bias, where factors associated with ESF expansion are
      also associated with changes in mortality rates, may have influenced our
      findings, although sensitivity analyses show the robustness of the findings to
      pre-ESF trends and the inclusion of other municipal-level factors that could be
      associated with coverage. CONCLUSIONS: PHC expansion is associated with
      reductions in racial group inequalities in mortality in Brazil. These findings
      highlight the importance of investment in PHC to achieve the SDGs aimed at
      improving health and reducing inequalities.

TI  - Contribution of systemic and somatic factors to clinical response and resistance 
      to PD-L1 blockade in urothelial cancer: An exploratory multi-omic analysis.
PG  - e1002309
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhibition of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with atezolizumab can
      induce durable clinical benefit (DCB) in patients with metastatic urothelial
      cancers, including complete remissions in patients with chemotherapy refractory
      disease. Although mutation load and PD-L1 immune cell (IC) staining have been
      associated with response, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for
      clinical use. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the peripheral blood immune
      environment and to conduct detailed analyses of mutation load, predicted
      neoantigens, and immune cellular infiltration in tumors to enhance our
      understanding of the biologic underpinnings of response and resistance. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: The goals of this study were to (1) evaluate the association of
      mutation load and predicted neoantigen load with therapeutic benefit and (2)
      determine whether intratumoral and peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR)
      clonality inform clinical outcomes in urothelial carcinoma treated with
      atezolizumab. We hypothesized that an elevated mutation load in combination with 
      T cell clonal dominance among intratumoral lymphocytes prior to treatment or
      among peripheral T cells after treatment would be associated with effective tumor
      control upon treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy. We performed whole exome
      sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and T cell receptor sequencing
      (TCR-seq) of pretreatment tumor samples as well as TCR-seq of matched, serially
      collected peripheral blood, collected before and after treatment with
      atezolizumab. These parameters were assessed for correlation with DCB (defined as
      progression-free survival [PFS] >6 months), PFS, and overall survival (OS), both 
      alone and in the context of clinical and intratumoral parameters known to be
      predictive of survival in this disease state. Patients with DCB displayed a
      higher proportion of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) (n = 24, Mann-Whitney
      p = 0.047). Pretreatment peripheral blood TCR clonality below the median was
      associated with improved PFS (n = 29, log-rank p = 0.048) and OS (n = 29,
      log-rank p = 0.011). Patients with DCB also demonstrated more substantial
      expansion of tumor-associated TCR clones in the peripheral blood 3 weeks after
      starting treatment (n = 22, Mann-Whitney p = 0.022). The combination of high
      pretreatment peripheral blood TCR clonality with elevated PD-L1 IC staining in
      tumor tissue was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes (n = 10, hazard 
      ratio (HR) (mean) = 89.88, HR (median) = 23.41, 95% CI [2.43, 506.94], p(HR > 1) 
      = 0.0014). Marked variations in mutation loads were seen with different somatic
      variant calling methodologies, which, in turn, impacted associations with
      clinical outcomes. Missense mutation load, predicted neoantigen load, and
      expressed neoantigen load did not demonstrate significant association with DCB (n
      = 25, Mann-Whitney p = 0.22, n = 25, Mann-Whitney p = 0.55, and n = 25,
      Mann-Whitney p = 0.29, respectively). Instead, we found evidence of time-varying 
      effects of somatic mutation load on PFS in this cohort (n = 25, p = 0.044). A
      limitation of our study is its small sample size (n = 29), a subset of the
      patients treated on IMvigor 210 (NCT02108652). Given the number of exploratory
      analyses performed, we intend for these results to be hypothesis-generating.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the complex nature of immune response to
      checkpoint blockade and the compelling need for greater interrogation and data
      integration of both host and tumor factors. Incorporating these variables in
      prospective studies will facilitate identification and treatment of resistant
      patients.

TI  - Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention portfolios for people who 
      inject drugs in the United States: A model-based analysis.
PG  - e1002312
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risks of HIV transmission associated with the opioid epidemic
      make cost-effective programs for people who inject drugs (PWID) a public health
      priority. Some of these programs have benefits beyond prevention of HIV-a
      critical consideration given that injection drug use is increasing across most
      United States demographic groups. To identify high-value HIV prevention program
      portfolios for US PWID, we consider combinations of four interventions with
      demonstrated efficacy: opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe programs 
      (NSPs), HIV testing and treatment (Test & Treat), and oral HIV pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We adapted an empirically calibrated
      dynamic compartmental model and used it to assess the discounted costs (in 2015
      US dollars), health outcomes (HIV infections averted, change in HIV prevalence,
      and discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), and incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the four prevention programs, considered
      singly and in combination over a 20-y time horizon. We obtained epidemiologic,
      economic, and health utility parameter estimates from the literature, previously 
      published models, and expert opinion. We estimate that expansions of OAT, NSPs,
      and Test & Treat implemented singly up to 50% coverage levels can be
      cost-effective relative to the next highest coverage level (low, medium, and high
      at 40%, 45%, and 50%, respectively) and that OAT, which we assume to have
      immediate and direct health benefits for the individual, has the potential to be 
      the highest value investment, even under scenarios where it prevents fewer
      infections than other programs. Although a model-based analysis can provide only 
      estimates of health outcomes, we project that, over 20 y, 50% coverage with OAT
      could avert up to 22,000 (95% CI: 5,200, 46,000) infections and cost US$18,000
      (95% CI: US$14,000, US$24,000) per QALY gained, 50% NSP coverage could avert up
      to 35,000 (95% CI: 8,900, 43,000) infections and cost US$25,000 (95% CI:
      US$7,000, US$76,000) per QALY gained, 50% Test & Treat coverage could avert up to
      6,700 (95% CI: 1,200, 16,000) infections and cost US$27,000 (95% CI: US$15,000,
      US$48,000) per QALY gained, and 50% PrEP coverage could avert up to 37,000
      (22,000, 58,000) infections and cost US$300,000 (95% CI: US$162,000, US$667,000) 
      per QALY gained. When coverage expansions are allowed to include combined
      investment with other programs and are compared to the next best intervention,
      the model projects that scaling OAT coverage up to 50%, then scaling NSP coverage
      to 50%, then scaling Test & Treat coverage to 50% can be cost-effective, with
      each coverage expansion having the potential to cost less than US$50,000 per QALY
      gained relative to the next best portfolio. In probabilistic sensitivity
      analyses, 59% of portfolios prioritized the addition of OAT and 41% prioritized
      the addition of NSPs, while PrEP was not likely to be a priority nor a
      cost-effective addition. Our findings are intended to be illustrative, as data on
      achievable coverage are limited and, in practice, the expansion scenarios
      considered may exceed feasible levels. We assumed independence of interventions
      and constant returns to scale. Extensive sensitivity analyses allowed us to
      assess parameter sensitivity, but the use of a dynamic compartmental model
      limited the exploration of structural sensitivities. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate
      that OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat, implemented singly or in combination, have the 
      potential to effectively and cost-effectively prevent HIV in US PWID. PrEP is not
      likely to be cost-effective in this population, based on the scenarios we
      evaluated. While local budgets or policy may constrain feasible coverage levels
      for the various interventions, our findings suggest that investments in combined 
      prevention programs can substantially reduce HIV transmission and improve health 
      outcomes among PWID.

TI  - Impact evaluation of different cash-based intervention modalities on child and
      maternal nutritional status in Sindh Province, Pakistan, at 6 mo and at 1 y: A
      cluster randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e1002305
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cash-based interventions (CBIs), offer an interesting opportunity to 
      prevent increases in wasting in humanitarian aid settings. However, questions
      remain as to the impact of CBIs on nutritional status and, therefore, how to
      incorporate them into emergency programmes to maximise their success in terms of 
      improved nutritional outcomes. This study evaluated the effects of three
      different CBI modalities on nutritional outcomes in children under 5 y of age at 
      6 mo and at 1 y. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a four-arm parallel
      longitudinal cluster randomised controlled trial in 114 villages in Dadu
      District, Pakistan. The study included poor and very poor households (n = 2,496) 
      with one or more children aged 6-48 mo (n = 3,584) at baseline. All four arms had
      equal access to an Action Against Hunger-supported programme. The three
      intervention arms were as follows: standard cash (SC), a cash transfer of 1,500
      Pakistani rupees (PKR) (approximately US$14; 1 PKR = US$0.009543); double cash
      (DC), a cash transfer of 3,000 PKR; or a fresh food voucher (FFV) of 1,500 PKR;
      the cash or voucher amount was given every month over six consecutive months. The
      control group (CG) received no specific cash-related interventions. The median
      total household income for the study sample was 8,075 PKR (approximately US$77)
      at baseline. We hypothesized that, compared to the CG in each case, FFVs would be
      more effective than SC, and that DC would be more effective than SC-both at 6 mo 
      and at 1 y-for reducing the risk of child wasting. Primary outcomes of interest
      were prevalence of being wasted (weight-for-height z-score [WHZ] < -2) and mean
      WHZ at 6 mo and at 1 y. The odds of a child being wasted were significantly lower
      in the DC arm after 6 mo (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52; 95% CI 0.29, 0.92; p = 0.02)
      compared to the CG. Mean WHZ significantly improved in both the FFV and DC arms
      at 6 mo (FFV: z-score = 0.16; 95% CI 0.05, 0.26; p = 0.004; DC: z-score = 0.11;
      95% CI 0.00, 0.21; p = 0.05) compared to the CG. Significant differences on the
      primary outcome were seen only at 6 mo. All three intervention groups showed
      similar significantly lower odds of being stunted (height-for-age z-score [HAZ] <
      -2) at 6 mo (DC: OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.24, 0.64; p < 0.001; FFV: OR = 0.41; 95% CI 
      0.25, 0.67; p < 0.001; SC: OR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.22, 0.59; p < 0.001) and at 1 y
      (DC: OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.35, 0.82; p = 0.004; FFV: OR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.31, 0.73; 
      p = 0.001; SC: OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.36, 0.81; p = 0.003) compared to the CG.
      Significant improvements in height-for-age outcomes were also seen for severe
      stunting (HAZ < -3) and mean HAZ. An unintended outcome was observed in the FFV
      arm: a negative intervention effect on mean haemoglobin (Hb) status (-2.6 g/l;
      95% CI -4.5, -0.8; p = 0.005). Limitations of this study included the inability
      to mask participants or data collectors to the different interventions, the
      potentially restrictive nature of the FFVs, not being able to measure a threshold
      effect for the two different cash amounts or compare the different quantities of 
      food consumed, and data collection challenges given the difficult environment in 
      which this study was set. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, the amount of cash given 
      was important. The larger cash transfer had the greatest effect on wasting, but
      only at 6 mo. Impacts at both 6 mo and at 1 y were seen for height-based growth
      variables regardless of the intervention modality, indicating a trend toward
      nutrition resilience. Purchasing restrictions applied to food-based voucher
      transfers could have unintended effects, and their use needs to be carefully
      planned to avoid this. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN10761532.

TI  - Measuring personal beliefs and perceived norms about intimate partner violence:
      Population-based survey experiment in rural Uganda.
PG  - e1002303
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002303 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted throughout sub-Saharan
      Africa indicate there is widespread acceptance of intimate partner violence,
      contributing to an adverse health risk environment for women. While qualitative
      studies suggest important limitations in the accuracy of the DHS methods used to 
      elicit attitudes toward intimate partner violence, to date there has been little 
      experimental evidence from sub-Saharan Africa that can be brought to bear on this
      issue. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We embedded a randomized survey experiment in a
      population-based survey of 1,334 adult men and women living in Nyakabare Parish, 
      Mbarara, Uganda. The primary outcomes were participants' personal beliefs about
      the acceptability of intimate partner violence and perceived norms about intimate
      partner violence in the community. To elicit participants' personal beliefs and
      perceived norms, we asked about the acceptability of intimate partner violence in
      five different vignettes. Study participants were randomly assigned to one of
      three survey instruments, each of which contained varying levels of detail about 
      the extent to which the wife depicted in the vignette intentionally or
      unintentionally violated gendered standards of behavior. For the questions about 
      personal beliefs, the mean (standard deviation) number of items where intimate
      partner violence was endorsed as acceptable was 1.26 (1.58) among participants
      assigned to the DHS-style survey variant (which contained little contextual
      detail about the wife's intentions), 2.74 (1.81) among participants assigned to
      the survey variant depicting the wife as intentionally violating gendered
      standards of behavior, and 0.77 (1.19) among participants assigned to the survey 
      variant depicting the wife as unintentionally violating these standards. In a
      partial proportional odds regression model adjusting for sex and village of
      residence, with participants assigned to the DHS-style survey variant as the
      referent group, participants assigned the survey variant that depicted the wife
      as intentionally violating gendered standards of behavior were more likely to
      condone intimate partner violence in a greater number of vignettes (adjusted odds
      ratios [AORs] ranged from 3.87 to 5.74, with all p < 0.001), while participants
      assigned the survey variant that depicted the wife as unintentionally violating
      these standards were less likely to condone intimate partner violence (AORs
      ranged from 0.29 to 0.70, with p-values ranging from <0.001 to 0.07). The
      analysis of perceived norms displayed similar patterns, but the effects were
      slightly smaller in magnitude: participants assigned to the "intentional" survey 
      variant were more likely to perceive intimate partner violence as normative (AORs
      ranged from 2.05 to 3.51, with all p < 0.001), while participants assigned to the
      "unintentional" survey variant were less likely to perceive intimate partner
      violence as normative (AORs ranged from 0.49 to 0.65, with p-values ranging from 
      <0.001 to 0.14). The primary limitations of this study are that our assessments
      of personal beliefs and perceived norms could have been measured with error and
      that our findings may not generalize beyond rural Uganda. CONCLUSIONS: Contextual
      information about the circumstances under which women in hypothetical vignettes
      were perceived to violate gendered standards of behavior had a significant
      influence on the extent to which study participants endorsed the acceptability of
      intimate partner violence. Researchers aiming to assess personal beliefs or
      perceived norms about intimate partner violence should attempt to eliminate, as
      much as possible, ambiguities in vignettes and questions administered to study
      participants. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02202824.

TI  - Ebola exposure, illness experience, and Ebola antibody prevalence in
      international responders to the West African Ebola epidemic 2014-2016: A
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - e1002300
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare and other front-line workers are at particular risk of
      infection with Ebola virus (EBOV). Despite the large-scale deployment of
      international responders, few cases of Ebola virus disease have been diagnosed in
      this group. Since asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection has been described,
      it is plausible that infections have occurred in healthcare workers but have
      escaped being diagnosed. We aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic or
      pauci-symptomatic infection, and of exposure events, among returned responders to
      the West African Ebola epidemic 2014-2016. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used snowball
      sampling to identify responders who had returned to the UK or Ireland, and used
      an online consent and questionnaire to determine their exposure to EBOV and their
      experience of illness. Oral fluid collection devices were sent and returned by
      post, and samples were tested using an EBOV IgG capture assay that detects IgG to
      Ebola glycoprotein. Blood was collected from returnees with reactive samples for 
      further testing. Unexposed UK controls were also recruited. In all, 300
      individuals consented, of whom 268 (89.3%) returned an oral fluid sample (OFS).
      The majority had worked in Sierra Leone in clinical, laboratory, research, and
      other roles. Fifty-three UK controls consented and provided samples using the
      same method. Of the returnees, 47 (17.5%) reported that they had had a possible
      EBOV exposure. Based on their free-text descriptions, using a published risk
      assessment method, we classified 43 (16%) as having had incidents with risk of
      Ebola transmission, including five intermediate-risk and one high-risk exposure. 
      Of the returnees, 57 (21%) reported a febrile or diarrhoeal illness in West
      Africa or within 1 mo of return, of whom 40 (70%) were not tested at the time for
      EBOV infection. Of the 268 OFSs, 266 were unreactive. Two returnees, who did not 
      experience an illness in West Africa or on return, had OFSs that were reactive on
      the EBOV IgG capture assay, with similar results on plasma. One individual had no
      further positive test results; the other had a positive result on a
      double-antigen bridging assay but not on a competitive assay or on an indirect
      EBOV IgG ELISA. All 53 controls had non-reactive OFSs. While the participants
      were not a random sample of returnees, the number participating was high.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study, to our knowledge, of the prevalence of EBOV
      infection in international responders. More than 99% had clear negative results. 
      Sera from two individuals had discordant results on the different assays; both
      were negative on the competitive assay, suggesting that prior infection was
      unlikely. The finding that a significant proportion experienced "near miss"
      exposure events, and that most of those who experienced symptoms did not get
      tested for EBOV at the time, suggests a need to review and standardise protocols 
      for the management of possible exposure to EBOV, and for the management of
      illness, across organisations that deploy staff to outbreaks.

TI  - Comparison of artemether-lumefantrine and chloroquine with and without primaquine
      for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Ethiopia: A randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - e1002299
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent efforts in malaria control have resulted in great gains in
      reducing the burden of Plasmodium falciparum, but P. vivax has been more
      refractory. Its ability to form dormant liver stages confounds control and
      elimination efforts. To compare the efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens
      for radical cure, we undertook a randomized controlled trial in Ethiopia. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: Patients with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase status with 
      symptomatic P. vivax mono-infection were enrolled and randomly assigned to
      receive either chloroquine (CQ) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL), alone or in
      combination with 14 d of semi-supervised primaquine (PQ) (3.5 mg/kg total). A
      total of 398 patients (n = 104 in the CQ arm, n = 100 in the AL arm, n = 102 in
      the CQ+PQ arm, and n = 92 in the AL+PQ arm) were followed for 1 y, and recurrent 
      episodes were treated with the same treatment allocated at enrolment. The primary
      endpoints were the risk of P. vivax recurrence at day 28 and at day 42. The risk 
      of recurrent P. vivax infection at day 28 was 4.0% (95% CI 1.5%-10.4%) after CQ
      treatment and 0% (95% CI 0%-4.0%) after CQ+PQ. The corresponding risks were 12.0%
      (95% CI 6.8%-20.6%) following AL alone and 2.3% (95% CI 0.6%-9.0%) following
      AL+PQ. On day 42, the risk was 18.7% (95% CI 12.2%-28.0%) after CQ, 1.2% (95% CI 
      0.2%-8.0%) after CQ+PQ, 29.9% (95% CI 21.6%-40.5%) after AL, and 5.9% (95% CI
      2.4%-13.5%) after AL+PQ (overall p < 0.001). In those not prescribed PQ, the risk
      of recurrence by day 42 appeared greater following AL treatment than CQ treatment
      (HR = 1.8 [95% CI 1.0-3.2]; p = 0.059). At the end of follow-up, the incidence
      rate of P. vivax was 2.2 episodes/person-year for patients treated with CQ
      compared to 0.4 for patients treated with CQ+PQ (rate ratio: 5.1 [95% CI
      2.9-9.1]; p < 0.001) and 2.3 episodes/person-year for AL compared to 0.5 for
      AL+PQ (rate ratio: 6.4 [95% CI 3.6-11.3]; p < 0.001). There was no difference in 
      the occurrence of adverse events between treatment arms. The main limitations of 
      the study were the early termination of the trial and the omission of haemoglobin
      measurement after day 42, resulting in an inability to estimate the cumulative
      risk of anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite evidence of CQ-resistant P. vivax, the risk
      of recurrence in this study was greater following treatment with AL unless it was
      combined with a supervised course of PQ. PQ combined with either CQ or AL was
      well tolerated and reduced recurrence of vivax malaria by 5-fold at 1 y. TRIAL

TI  - Long-term inpatient disease burden in the Adult Life after Childhood Cancer in
      Scandinavia (ALiCCS) study: A cohort study of 21,297 childhood cancer survivors.
PG  - e1002296
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002296 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for a wide range 
      of late effects. However, no large population-based studies have included the
      whole range of somatic diagnoses including subgroup diagnoses and all main types 
      of childhood cancers. Therefore, we aimed to provide the most detailed overview
      of the long-term risk of hospitalisation in survivors of childhood cancer.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: From the national cancer registers of Denmark, Finland,
      Iceland, and Sweden, we identified 21,297 5-year survivors of childhood cancer
      diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20 years in the periods 1943-2008 in
      Denmark, 1971-2008 in Finland, 1955-2008 in Iceland, and 1958-2008 in Sweden. We 
      randomly selected 152,231 population comparison individuals matched by age, sex, 
      year, and country (or municipality in Sweden) from the national population
      registers. Using a cohort design, study participants were followed in the
      national hospital registers in Denmark, 1977-2010; Finland, 1975-2012; Iceland,
      1999-2008; and Sweden, 1968-2009. Disease-specific hospitalisation rates in
      survivors and comparison individuals were used to calculate survivors'
      standardised hospitalisation rate ratios (RRs), absolute excess risks (AERs), and
      standardised bed day ratios (SBDRs) based on length of stay in hospital. We
      adjusted for sex, age, and year by indirect standardisation. During 336,554
      person-years of follow-up (mean: 16 years; range: 0-42 years), childhood cancer
      survivors experienced 21,325 first hospitalisations for diseases in one or more
      of 120 disease categories (cancer recurrence not included), when 10,999 were
      expected, yielding an overall RR of 1.94 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]
      1.91-1.97). The AER was 3,068 (2,980-3,156) per 100,000 person-years, meaning
      that for each additional year of follow-up, an average of 3 of 100 survivors were
      hospitalised for a new excess disease beyond the background rates. Approximately 
      50% of the excess hospitalisations were for diseases of the nervous system (19.1%
      of all excess hospitalisations), endocrine system (11.1%), digestive organs
      (10.5%), and respiratory system (10.0%). Survivors of all types of childhood
      cancer were at increased, persistent risk for subsequent hospitalisation, the
      highest risks being those of survivors of neuroblastoma (RR: 2.6 [2.4-2.8]; n =
      876), hepatic tumours (RR: 2.5 [2.0-3.1]; n = 92), central nervous system tumours
      (RR: 2.4 [2.3-2.5]; n = 6,175), and Hodgkin lymphoma (RR: 2.4 [2.3-2.5]; n =
      2,027). Survivors spent on average five times as many days in hospital as
      comparison individuals (SBDR: 4.96 [4.94-4.98]; n = 422,218). The analyses of bed
      days in hospital included new primary cancers and recurrences. Of the total
      422,218 days survivors spent in hospital, 47% (197,596 bed days) were for new
      primary cancers and recurrences. Our study is likely to underestimate the
      absolute overall disease burden experienced by survivors, as less severe late
      effects are missed if they are treated sufficiently in the outpatient setting or 
      in the primary health care system. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors were
      at increased long-term risk for diseases requiring inpatient treatment even
      decades after their initial cancer. Health care providers who do not work in the 
      area of late effects, especially those in primary health care, should be aware of
      this highly challenged group of patients in order to avoid or postpone
      hospitalisations by prevention, early detection, and appropriate treatments.

TI  - Mortality and kidnapping estimates for the Yazidi population in the area of Mount
      Sinjar, Iraq, in August 2014: A retrospective household survey.
PG  - e1002297
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002297 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In August 2014, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) 
      attacked the Yazidi religious minority living in the area of Mount Sinjar in
      Nineveh governorate, Iraq. We conducted a retrospective household survey to
      estimate the number and demographic profile of Yazidis killed and kidnapped.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The survey covered the displaced Yazidi population from
      Sinjar residing in camps in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Fieldwork took place
      between 4 November and 25 December, 2015. A systematic random sample of 1,300
      in-camp households were interviewed about the current household composition and
      any killings and kidnappings of household members by ISIS. Of the 1,300
      interviewed households, 988 were Yazidi from Sinjar. Yazidi households contained 
      6,572 living residents at the time of the survey; 43 killings and 83 kidnappings 
      of household members were reported. We calculated the probability of being killed
      and kidnapped by dividing the number of reported killings and kidnappings by the 
      number of sampled Yazidis at risk, adjusting for sampling design. To obtain the
      overall toll of killings and kidnappings, those probabilities were multiplied by 
      the total Yazidi population living in Sinjar at the time of the ISIS attack,
      estimated at roughly 400,000 by the United Nations and Kurdish officials. The
      demographic profile of those killed and kidnapped was examined, distinguishing
      between children and adults and females and males. We estimated that 2.5% of the 
      Yazidi population was either killed or kidnapped over the course of a few days in
      August 2014, amounting to 9,900 (95% CI 7,000-13,900) people in total. An
      estimated 3,100 (95% CI 2,100-4,400) Yazidis were killed, with nearly half of
      them executed-either shot, beheaded, or burned alive-while the rest died on Mount
      Sinjar from starvation, dehydration, or injuries during the ISIS siege. The
      estimated number kidnapped is 6,800 (95% CI 4,200-10,800). Escapees recounted the
      abuses they had suffered, including forced religious conversion, torture, and sex
      slavery. Over one-third of those reported kidnapped were still missing at the
      time of the survey. All Yazidis were targeted regardless of age and sex, but
      children were disproportionately affected. They were as likely as adults to be
      executed but constituted 93.0% (95% CI 71.9-98.6) of those who died on Mount
      Sinjar. Moreover, children only accounted for 18.8% (95% CI 8.4-36.9) of those
      who managed to escape captivity. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the actual 
      toll of killings and kidnappings may be underestimated in our data because of
      survival bias. The uncertainty associated with inference from a small sample of
      in-camp households and the reliance on a rough figure of 400,000 for
      extrapolation to the total Yazidi population of Sinjar at the time of the ISIS
      attack are the main limitations of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other
      existing evidence, our data provide a clear indication of the severity of the
      ISIS attack against the Yazidis in terms of both the number and demographic
      profile of those targeted.

TI  - Vitamin D levels and susceptibility to asthma, elevated immunoglobulin E levels, 
      and atopic dermatitis: A Mendelian randomization study.
PG  - e1002294
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002294 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low circulating vitamin D levels have been associated with risk of
      asthma, atopic dermatitis, and elevated total immunoglobulin E (IgE). These
      epidemiological associations, if true, would have public health importance, since
      vitamin D insufficiency is common and correctable. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We aimed
      to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with risk of
      asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated serum IgE levels, using Mendelian
      randomization (MR) methodology to control bias owing to confounding and reverse
      causation. The study employed data from the UK Biobank resource and from the
      SUNLIGHT, GABRIEL and EAGLE eczema consortia. Using four single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels 
      in 33,996 individuals, we conducted MR studies to estimate the effect of lowered 
      25OHD on the risk of asthma (n = 146,761), childhood onset asthma (n = 15,008),
      atopic dermatitis (n = 40,835), and elevated IgE level (n = 12,853) and tested MR
      assumptions in sensitivity analyses. None of the four 25OHD-lowering alleles were
      associated with asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated IgE levels (p >/= 0.2).
      The MR odds ratio per standard deviation decrease in log-transformed 25OHD was
      1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.19, p = 0.63) for asthma, 0.95 (95% CI 
      0.69-1.31, p = 0.76) for childhood-onset asthma, and 1.12 (95% CI 0.92-1.37, p = 
      0.27) for atopic dermatitis, and the effect size on log-transformed IgE levels
      was -0.40 (95% CI -1.65 to 0.85, p = 0.54). These results persisted in
      sensitivity analyses assessing population stratification and pleiotropy and
      vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathways. The main limitations of this study
      are that the findings do not exclude an association between the studied outcomes 
      and 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, the study was
      underpowered to detect effects smaller than an OR of 1.33 for childhood asthma,
      and the analyses were restricted to white populations of European ancestry. This 
      research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource and data from the
      SUNLIGHT, GABRIEL and EAGLE Eczema consortia. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we
      found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25OHD levels conferred
      an increased risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated total serum IgE,
      suggesting that efforts to increase vitamin D are unlikely to reduce risks of
      atopic disease.

TI  - A universal testing and treatment intervention to improve HIV control: One-year
      results from intervention communities in Zambia in the HPTN 071 (PopART)
      cluster-randomised trial.
PG  - e1002292
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002292 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90
      targets require that, by 2020, 90% of those living with HIV know their status,
      90% of known HIV-positive individuals receive sustained antiretroviral therapy
      (ART), and 90% of individuals on ART have durable viral suppression. The HPTN 071
      (PopART) trial is measuring the impact of a universal testing and treatment
      intervention on population-level HIV incidence in 21 urban communities in Zambia 
      and South Africa. We report observational data from four communities in Zambia to
      assess progress towards the UNAIDS targets after 1 y of the PopART intervention. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The PopART intervention comprises annual rounds of
      home-based HIV testing delivered by community HIV-care providers (CHiPs) who also
      support linkage to care, ART retention, and other services. Data from four
      communities in Zambia receiving the full intervention (including immediate ART
      for all individuals with HIV) were used to determine proportions of participants 
      who knew their HIV status after the CHiP visit; proportions linking to care and
      initiating ART following referral; and overall proportions of HIV-infected
      individuals who knew their status (first 90 target) and the proportion of these
      on ART (second 90 target), pre- and post-intervention. We are not able to assess 
      progress towards the third 90 target at this stage of the study. Overall, 121,130
      adults (59,283 men and 61,847 women) were enumerated in 46,714 households during 
      the first annual round (December 2013 to June 2015). Of the 45,399 (77%) men and 
      55,703 (90%) women consenting to the intervention, 80% of men and 85% of women
      knew their HIV status after the CHiP visit. Of 6,197 HIV-positive adults referred
      by CHiPs, 42% (95% CI: 40%-43%) initiated ART within 6 mo and 53% (95% CI:
      52%-55%) within 12 mo. In the entire population, the estimated proportion of
      HIV-positive adults who knew their status increased from 52% to 78% for men and
      from 56% to 87% for women. The estimated proportion of known HIV-positive
      individuals on ART increased overall from 54% after the CHiP visit to 74% by the 
      end of the round for men and from 53% to 73% for women. The estimated overall
      proportion of HIV-positive adults on ART, irrespective of whether they knew their
      status, increased from 44% to 61%, compared with the 81% target (the product of
      the first two 90 targets). Coverage was lower among young men and women than in
      older age groups. The main limitation of the study was the need for assumptions
      concerning knowledge of HIV status and ART coverage among adults not consenting
      to the intervention or HIV testing, although our conclusions were robust in
      sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, acceptance of HIV testing
      among those consenting to the intervention was high, although linkage to care and
      ART initiation took longer than expected. Knowledge of HIV-positive status
      increased steeply after 1 y, almost attaining the first 90 target in women and
      approaching it in men. The second 90 target was more challenging, with
      approximately three-quarters of known HIV-positive individuals on ART by the end 
      of the annual round. Achieving higher test uptake in men and more rapid linkage
      to care will be key objectives during the second annual round of the
      intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01900977.

TI  - First-trimester artemisinin derivatives and quinine treatments and the risk of
      adverse pregnancy outcomes in Africa and Asia: A meta-analysis of observational
      studies.
PG  - e1002290
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal embryotoxicity data, and the scarcity of safety data in human 
      pregnancies, have prevented artemisinin derivatives from being recommended for
      malaria treatment in the first trimester except in lifesaving circumstances. We
      conducted a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies comparing the risk
      of miscarriage, stillbirth, and major congenital anomaly (primary outcomes) among
      first-trimester pregnancies treated with artemisinin derivatives versus quinine
      or no antimalarial treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Electronic databases
      including Medline, Embase, and Malaria in Pregnancy Library were searched, and
      investigators contacted. Five studies involving 30,618 pregnancies were included;
      four from sub-Saharan Africa (n = 6,666 pregnancies, six sites) and one from
      Thailand (n = 23,952). Antimalarial exposures were ascertained by self-report or 
      active detection and confirmed by prescriptions, clinic cards, and outpatient
      registers. Cox proportional hazards models, accounting for time under observation
      and gestational age at enrollment, were used to calculate hazard ratios.
      Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis was used to combine the African
      studies, and the results were then combined with those from Thailand using
      aggregated data meta-analysis with a random effects model. There was no
      difference in the risk of miscarriage associated with the use of artemisinins
      anytime during the first trimester (n = 37/671) compared with quinine (n =
      96/945; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.73 [95% CI 0.44, 1.21], I2 = 0%, p =
      0.228), in the risk of stillbirth (artemisinins, n = 10/654; quinine, n = 11/615;
      aHR = 0.29 [95% CI 0.08-1.02], p = 0.053), or in the risk of miscarriage and
      stillbirth combined (pregnancy loss) (aHR = 0.58 [95% CI 0.36-1.02], p = 0.099). 
      The corresponding risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, and pregnancy loss in a
      sensitivity analysis restricted to artemisinin exposures during the embryo
      sensitive period (6-12 wk gestation) were as follows: aHR = 1.04 (95% CI
      0.54-2.01), I2 = 0%, p = 0.910; aHR = 0.73 (95% CI 0.26-2.06), p = 0.551; and aHR
      = 0.98 (95% CI 0.52-2.04), p = 0.603. The prevalence of major congenital
      anomalies was similar for first-trimester artemisinin (1.5% [95% CI 0.6%-3.5%])
      and quinine exposures (1.2% [95% CI 0.6%-2.4%]). Key limitations of the study
      include the inability to control for confounding by indication in the African
      studies, the paucity of data on potential confounders, the limited statistical
      power to detect differences in congenital anomalies, and the lack of assessment
      of cardiovascular defects in newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to quinine,
      artemisinin treatment in the first trimester was not associated with an increased
      risk of miscarriage or stillbirth. While the data are limited, they indicate no
      difference in the prevalence of major congenital anomalies between treatment
      groups. The benefits of 3-d artemisinin combination therapy regimens to treat
      malaria in early pregnancy are likely to outweigh the adverse outcomes of
      partially treated malaria, which can occur with oral quinine because of the known
      poor adherence to 7-d regimens. REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42015032371.

TI  - Identification of genes associated with dissociation of cognitive performance and
      neuropathological burden: Multistep analysis of genetic, epigenetic, and
      transcriptional data.
PG  - e1002287
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002287 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The molecular underpinnings of the dissociation of cognitive
      performance and neuropathological burden are poorly understood, and there are
      currently no known genetic or epigenetic determinants of the dissociation.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: "Residual cognition" was quantified by regressing out the
      effects of cerebral pathologies and demographic characteristics on global
      cognitive performance proximate to death. To identify genes influencing residual 
      cognition, we leveraged neuropathological, genetic, epigenetic, and
      transcriptional data available for deceased participants of the Religious Orders 
      Study (n = 492) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 487). Given that our
      sample size was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, we applied a
      multistep approach to identify genes influencing residual cognition, based on our
      prior observation that independent genetic and epigenetic risk factors can
      converge on the same locus. In the first step (n = 979), we performed a
      genome-wide association study with a predefined suggestive p < 10-5, and nine
      independent loci met this threshold in eight distinct chromosomal regions. Three 
      of the six genes within 100 kb of the lead SNP are expressed in the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC): UNC5C, ENC1, and TMEM106B. In the second step, in the 
      subset of participants with DLPFC DNA methylation data (n = 648), we found that
      residual cognition was related to differential DNA methylation of UNC5C and ENC1 
      (false discovery rate < 0.05). In the third step, in the subset of participants
      with DLPFC RNA sequencing data (n = 469), brain transcription levels of UNC5C and
      ENC1 were evaluated for their association with residual cognition: RNA levels of 
      both UNC5C (estimated effect = -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.10, p = 0.0089) and ENC1
      (estimated effect = 0.0064, 95% CI 0.0033 to 0.0096, p = 5.7 x 10-5) were
      associated with residual cognition. In secondary analyses, we explored the
      mechanism of these associations and found that ENC1 may be related to the
      previously documented effect of depression on cognitive decline, while UNC5C may 
      alter the composition of presynaptic terminals. Of note, the TMEM106B allele
      identified in the first step as being associated with better residual cognition
      is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1990622A (r2 = 0.66), a previously
      identified protective allele for TDP-43 proteinopathy. Limitations include the
      small sample size for the genetic analysis, which was underpowered to detect
      genome-wide significance, the evaluation being limited to a single cortical
      region for epigenetic and transcriptomic data, and the use of categorical
      measures for certain non-amyloid-plaque, non-neurofibrillary-tangle
      neuropathologies. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multistep analysis of cognitive,
      neuropathological, genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, we identified
      ENC1 and UNC5C as genes with convergent genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic
      evidence supporting a potential role in the dissociation of cognition and
      neuropathology in an aging population, and we expanded our understanding of the
      TMEM106B haplotype that is protective against TDP-43 proteinopathy.

TI  - Graft-derived cell-free DNA, a noninvasive early rejection and graft damage
      marker in liver transplantation: A prospective, observational, multicenter cohort
      study.
PG  - e1002286
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Graft-derived cell-free DNA (GcfDNA), which is released into the
      blood stream by necrotic and apoptotic cells, is a promising noninvasive organ
      integrity biomarker. In liver transplantation (LTx), neither conventional liver
      function tests (LTFs) nor immunosuppressive drug monitoring are very effective
      for rejection monitoring. We therefore hypothesized that the quantitative
      measurement of donor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) would have independent value
      for the assessment of graft integrity, including damage from acute rejection.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Traditional LFTs were performed and plasma GcfDNA was
      monitored in 115 adults post-LTx at three German transplant centers as part of a 
      prospective, observational, multicenter cohort trial. GcfDNA percentage (graft
      cfDNA/total cfDNA) was measured using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), based on a
      limited number of predefined single nucleotide polymorphisms, enabling same-day
      turn-around. The same method was used to quantify blood microchimerism. GcfDNA
      was increased >50% on day 1 post-LTx, presumably from ischemia/reperfusion
      damage, but rapidly declined in patients without graft injury within 7 to 10 d to
      a median <10%, where it remained for the 1-y observation period. Of 115 patients,
      107 provided samples that met preestablished criteria. In 31 samples taken from
      17 patients during biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes, the percentage of
      GcfDNA was elevated substantially (median 29.6%, 95% CI 23.6%-41.0%) compared
      with that in 282 samples from 88 patients during stable periods (median 3.3%, 95%
      CI 2.9%-3.7%; p < 0.001). Only slightly higher values (median 5.9%, 95% CI
      4.4%-10.3%) were found in 68 samples from 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive,
      rejection-free patients. LFTs had low overall correlations (r = 0.28-0.62) with
      GcfDNA and showed greater overlap between patient subgroups, especially between
      acute rejection and HCV+ patients. Multivariable logistic regression modeling
      demonstrated that GcfDNA provided additional LFT-independent information on graft
      integrity. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 90.3% (95% CI 74.2%-98.0%)
      and 92.9% (95% CI 89.3%-95.6%), respectively, for GcfDNA at a threshold value of 
      10%. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was higher for
      GcfDNA (97.1%, 95% CI 93.4%-100%) than for same-day conventional LFTs (AST:
      95.7%; ALT: 95.2%; gamma-GT: 94.5%; bilirubin: 82.6%). An evaluation of
      microchimerism revealed that the maximum donor DNA in circulating white blood
      cells was only 0.068%. GcfDNA percentage can be influenced by major changes in
      host cfDNA (e.g., due to leukopenia or leukocytosis). One limitation of our study
      is that exact time-matched GcfDNA and LFT samples were not available for all
      patient visits. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, determination of GcfDNA in plasma by 
      ddPCR allowed for earlier and more sensitive discrimination of acute rejection in
      LTx patients as compared with conventional LFTs. Potential blood microchimerism
      was quantitatively low and had no significant influence on GcfDNA value. Further 
      research, which should ideally include protocol biopsies, will be needed to
      establish the practical value of GcfDNA measurements in the management of LTx
      patients.

TI  - Changes in prices, sales, consumer spending, and beverage consumption one year
      after a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in Berkeley, California, US: A
      before-and-after study.
PG  - e1002283
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) meant to improve health and
      raise revenue are being adopted, yet evaluation is scarce. This study examines
      the association of the first penny per ounce SSB excise tax in the United States,
      in Berkeley, California, with beverage prices, sales, store revenue/consumer
      spending, and usual beverage intake. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Methods included
      comparison of pre-taxation (before 1 January 2015) and first-year post-taxation
      (1 March 2015-29 February 2016) measures of (1) beverage prices at 26 Berkeley
      stores; (2) point-of-sale scanner data on 15.5 million checkouts for beverage
      prices, sales, and store revenue for two supermarket chains covering three
      Berkeley and six control non-Berkeley large supermarkets in adjacent cities; and 
      (3) a representative telephone survey (17.4% cooperation rate) of 957 adult
      Berkeley residents. Key hypotheses were that (1) the tax would be passed through 
      to the prices of taxed beverages among the chain stores in which Berkeley
      implemented the tax in 2015; (2) sales of taxed beverages would decline, and
      sales of untaxed beverages would rise, in Berkeley stores more than in comparison
      non-Berkeley stores; (3) consumer spending per transaction (checkout episode)
      would not increase in Berkeley stores; and (4) self-reported consumption of taxed
      beverages would decline. Main outcomes and measures included changes in
      inflation-adjusted prices (cents/ounce), beverage sales (ounces), consumers'
      spending measured as store revenue (inflation-adjusted dollars per transaction)
      in two large chains, and usual beverage intake (grams/day and kilocalories/day). 
      Tax pass-through (changes in the price after imposition of the tax) for SSBs
      varied in degree and timing by store type and beverage type. Pass-through was
      complete in large chain supermarkets (+1.07 cent/oz, p = 0.001) and small chain
      supermarkets and chain gas stations (1.31 cent/oz, p = 0.004), partial in
      pharmacies (+0.45 cent/oz, p = 0.03), and negative in independent corner stores
      and independent gas stations (-0.64 cent/oz, p = 0.004). Sales-unweighted mean
      price change from scanner data was +0.67 cent/oz (p = 0.00) (sales-weighted,
      +0.65 cent/oz, p = 0.003), with +1.09 cent/oz (p < 0.001) for sodas and energy
      drinks, but a lower change in other categories. Post-tax year 1 scanner data SSB 
      sales (ounces/transaction) in Berkeley stores declined 9.6% (p < 0.001) compared 
      to estimates if the tax were not in place, but rose 6.9% (p < 0.001) for
      non-Berkeley stores. Sales of untaxed beverages in Berkeley stores rose by 3.5%
      versus 0.5% (both p < 0.001) for non-Berkeley stores. Overall beverage sales also
      rose across stores. In Berkeley, sales of water rose by 15.6% (p < 0.001)
      (exceeding the decline in SSB sales in ounces); untaxed fruit, vegetable, and tea
      drinks, by 4.37% (p < 0.001); and plain milk, by 0.63% (p = 0.01). Scanner data
      mean store revenue/consumer spending (dollars per transaction) fell 18 cent less 
      in Berkeley (-$0.36, p < 0.001) than in comparison stores (-$0.54, p < 0.001).
      Baseline and post-tax Berkeley SSB sales and usual dietary intake were markedly
      low compared to national levels (at baseline, National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey SSB intake nationally was 131 kcal/d and in Berkeley was 45
      kcal/d). Reductions in self-reported mean daily SSB intake in grams (-19.8%, p = 
      0.49) and in mean per capita SSB caloric intake (-13.3%, p = 0.56) from baseline 
      to post-tax were not statistically significant. Limitations of the study include 
      inability to establish causal links due to observational design, and the absence 
      of health outcomes. Analysis of consumption was limited by the small effect size 
      in relation to high standard error and Berkeley's low baseline consumption.
      CONCLUSIONS: One year following implementation of the nation's first large SSB
      tax, prices of SSBs increased in many, but not all, settings, SSB sales declined,
      and sales of untaxed beverages (especially water) and overall study beverages
      rose in Berkeley; overall consumer spending per transaction in the stores studied
      did not rise. Price increases for SSBs in two distinct data sources, their
      timing, and the patterns of change in taxed and untaxed beverage sales suggest
      that the observed changes may be attributable to the tax. Post-tax self-reported 
      SSB intake did not change significantly compared to baseline. Significant
      declines in SSB sales, even in this relatively affluent community, accompanied by
      revenue used for prevention suggest promise for this policy. Evaluation of
      taxation in jurisdictions with more typical SSB consumption, with controls, is
      needed to assess broader dietary and potential health impacts.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccines are now globally recommended by the World Health
      Organization (WHO), but in early 2009 WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts
      on Immunization reviewed available data and concluded that there was no evidence 
      for the efficacy or effectiveness of a two-dose schedule of the human rotavirus
      vaccine (HRV; Rotarix) given early at 6 and 10 wk of age. Additionally, the
      effectiveness of programmatic rotavirus vaccination, including possible indirect 
      effects, has not been assessed in low-resource populations in Asia. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: In Bangladesh, we cluster-randomized (1:1) 142 villages of the Matlab
      Health and Demographic Surveillance System to include two doses of HRV with the
      standard infant vaccines at 6 and 10 wk of age or to provide standard infant
      vaccines without HRV. The study was initiated November 1, 2008, and surveillance 
      was conducted concurrently at Matlab Diarrhoea Hospital and two community
      treatment centers to identify children less than 2 y of age presenting with acute
      rotavirus diarrhea (ARD) through March 31, 2011. Laboratory confirmation was made
      by enzyme immunoassay detection of rotavirus antigen in stool specimens. Overall 
      effectiveness of the HRV vaccination program (primary objective) was measured by 
      comparing the incidence rate of ARD among all children age-eligible for
      vaccination in villages where HRV was introduced to that among such children in
      villages where HRV was not introduced. Total effectiveness among vaccinees and
      indirect effectiveness were also evaluated. In all, 6,527 infants were
      age-eligible for vaccination in 71 HRV villages, and 5,791 in 71 non-HRV
      villages. In HRV villages, 4,808 (73.7%) infants received at least one dose of
      HRV. The incidence rate of ARD was 4.10 cases per 100 person-years in non-HRV
      villages compared to 2.8 per 100 person-years in HRV villages, indicating an
      overall effectiveness of 29.0% (95% CI, 11.3% to 43.1%). The total effectiveness 
      of HRV against ARD among vaccinees was 41.4% (95% CI, 23.2% to 55.2%). The point 
      estimate for total effectiveness was higher against ARD during the first year of 
      life than during the second (45.2% versus 28.9%), but estimates for the second
      year of life lacked precision and did not reach statistical significance.
      Indirect effects were not detected. To check for bias in presentation to
      treatment facilities, we evaluated the effectiveness of HRV against acute
      diarrhea associated with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli; it was 4.0% (95% CI,
      -46.5% to 37.1%), indicating that bias likely was not introduced. Thirteen
      serious adverse events were identified among recipients of HRV, but none were
      considered related to receipt of study vaccine. The main limitation of this study
      is that it was an open-label study with an observed-only control group (no
      placebo). CONCLUSIONS: The two-dose HRV rotavirus vaccination program
      significantly reduced medically attended ARD in this low-resource population in
      Asia. Protection among vaccinees was similar to that in other low-resource
      settings. In low-resource populations with high rotavirus incidence, large-scale 
      vaccination across a wide population may be required to obtain the full benefit
      of rotavirus vaccination, including indirect effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Silk garments plus standard care compared with standard care for treating eczema 
      in children: A randomised, controlled, observer-blind, pragmatic trial (CLOTHES
      Trial).
PG  - e1002280
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002280 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of clothing in the management of eczema (also called atopic 
      dermatitis or atopic eczema) is poorly understood. This trial evaluated the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of silk garments (in addition to standard
      care) for the management of eczema in children with moderate to severe disease.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a parallel-group, randomised, controlled,
      observer-blind trial. Children aged 1 to 15 y with moderate to severe eczema were
      recruited from secondary care and the community at five UK medical centres.
      Participants were allocated using online randomisation (1:1) to standard care or 
      to standard care plus silk garments, stratified by age and recruiting centre.
      Silk garments were worn for 6 mo. Primary outcome (eczema severity) was assessed 
      at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo, by nurses blinded to treatment allocation, using the
      Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), which was log-transformed for analysis
      (intention-to-treat analysis). A safety outcome was number of skin infections.
      Three hundred children were randomised (26 November 2013 to 5 May 2015): 42%
      girls, 79% white, mean age 5 y. Primary analysis included 282/300 (94%) children 
      (n = 141 in each group). The garments were worn more often at night than in the
      day (median of 81% of nights [25th to 75th centile 57% to 96%] and 34% of days
      [25th to 75th centile 10% to 76%]). Geometric mean EASI scores at baseline, 2, 4,
      and 6 mo were, respectively, 9.2, 6.4, 5.8, and 5.4 for silk clothing and 8.4,
      6.6, 6.0, and 5.4 for standard care. There was no evidence of any difference
      between the groups in EASI score averaged over all follow-up visits adjusted for 
      baseline EASI score, age, and centre: adjusted ratio of geometric means 0.95, 95%
      CI 0.85 to 1.07, (p = 0.43). This confidence interval is equivalent to a
      difference of -1.5 to 0.5 in the original EASI units, which is not clinically
      important. Skin infections occurred in 36/142 (25%) and 39/141 (28%) of children 
      in the silk clothing and standard care groups, respectively. Even if the small
      observed treatment effect was genuine, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
      life year was pound56,811 in the base case analysis from a National Health
      Service perspective, suggesting that silk garments are unlikely to be
      cost-effective using currently accepted thresholds. The main limitation of the
      study is that use of an objective primary outcome, whilst minimising detection
      bias, may have underestimated treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: Silk clothing is
      unlikely to provide additional benefit over standard care in children with
      moderate to severe eczema. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials

TI  - The effects of implementing a point-of-care electronic template to prompt routine
      anxiety and depression screening in patients consulting for osteoarthritis (the
      Primary Care Osteoarthritis Trial): A cluster randomised trial in primary care.
PG  - e1002273
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002273 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate whether prompting general practitioners 
      (GPs) to routinely assess and manage anxiety and depression in patients
      consulting with osteoarthritis (OA) improves pain outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 45 English general
      practices. In intervention practices, patients aged >/=45 y consulting with OA
      received point-of-care anxiety and depression screening by the GP, prompted by an
      automated electronic template comprising five questions (a two-item Patient
      Health Questionnaire-2 for depression, a two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 
      questionnaire for anxiety, and a question about current pain intensity [0-10
      numerical rating scale]). The template signposted GPs to follow National
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guidelines for anxiety,
      depression, and OA and was supported by a brief training package. The template in
      control practices prompted GPs to ask the pain intensity question only. The
      primary outcome was patient-reported current pain intensity post-consultation and
      at 3-, 6-, and 12-mo follow-up. Secondary outcomes included pain-related
      disability, anxiety, depression, and general health. During the trial period,
      7,279 patients aged >/=45 y consulted with a relevant OA-related code, and 4,240 
      patients were deemed potentially eligible by participating GPs. Templates were
      completed for 2,042 patients (1,339 [31.6%] in the control arm and 703 [23.1%] in
      the intervention arm). Of these 2,042 patients, 1,412 returned questionnaires
      (501 [71.3%] from 20 intervention practices, 911 [68.0%] from 24 control
      practices). Follow-up rates were similar in both arms, totalling 1,093 (77.4%) at
      3 mo, 1,064 (75.4%) at 6 mo, and 1,017 (72.0%) at 12 mo. For the primary
      endpoint, multilevel modelling yielded significantly higher average pain
      intensity across follow-up to 12 mo in the intervention group than the control
      group (adjusted mean difference 0.31; 95% CI 0.04, 0.59). Secondary outcomes were
      consistent with the primary outcome measure in reflecting better outcomes as a
      whole for the control group than the intervention group. Anxiety and depression
      scores did not reduce following the intervention. The main limitations of this
      study are two potential sources of bias: an imbalance in cluster size (mean
      practice size 7,397 [intervention] versus 5,850 [control]) and a difference in
      the proportion of patients for whom the GP deactivated the template (33.6%
      [intervention] versus 27.8% [control]). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed
      no beneficial effect on pain outcomes of prompting GPs to routinely screen for
      and manage comorbid anxiety and depression in patients presenting with symptoms
      due to OA, with those in the intervention group reporting statistically
      significantly higher average pain scores over the four follow-up time points than
      those in the control group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN40721988.

TI  - Fresh fruit consumption in relation to incident diabetes and diabetic vascular
      complications: A 7-y prospective study of 0.5 million Chinese adults.
PG  - e1002279
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002279 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the well-recognised health benefits of fresh fruit
      consumption, substantial uncertainties remain about its potential effects on
      incident diabetes and, among those with diabetes, on risks of death and major
      vascular complications. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between June 2004 and July 2008,
      the nationwide China Kadoorie Biobank study recruited 0.5 million adults aged
      30-79 (mean 51) y from ten diverse localities across China. During ~7 y of
      follow-up, 9,504 new diabetes cases were recorded among 482,591 participants
      without prevalent (previously diagnosed or screen-detected) diabetes at baseline,
      with an overall incidence rate of 2.8 per 1,000 person-years. Among 30,300 (5.9%)
      participants who had diabetes at baseline, 3,389 deaths occurred (overall
      mortality rate 16.5 per 1,000), along with 9,746 cases of macrovascular disease
      and 1,345 cases of microvascular disease. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard 
      ratios (HRs) associating each disease outcome with self-reported fresh fruit
      consumption, adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, region,
      socio-economic status, other lifestyle factors, body mass index, and family
      history of diabetes. Overall, 18.8% of participants reported consuming fresh
      fruit daily, and 6.4% never/rarely (non-consumers), with the proportion of
      non-consumers about three times higher in individuals with previously diagnosed
      diabetes (18.9%) than in those with screen-detected diabetes (6.7%) or no
      diabetes (6.0%). Among those without diabetes at baseline, higher fruit
      consumption was associated with significantly lower risk of developing diabetes
      (adjusted HR = 0.88 [95% CI 0.83-0.93] for daily versus non-consumers, p < 0.001,
      corresponding to a 0.2% difference in 5-y absolute risk), with a clear
      dose-response relationship. Among those with baseline diabetes, higher fruit
      consumption was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR =
      0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93] per 100 g/d) and microvascular (0.72 [0.61-0.87]) and
      macrovascular (0.87 [0.82-0.93]) complications (p < 0.001), with similar HRs in
      individuals with previously diagnosed and screen-detected diabetes; estimated
      differences in 5-y absolute risk between daily and non-consumers were 1.9%, 1.1%,
      and 5.4%, respectively. The main limitation of this study was that, owing to its 
      observational nature, we could not fully exclude the effects of residual
      confounding. CONCLUSION: In this large epidemiological study in Chinese adults,
      higher fresh fruit consumption was associated with significantly lower risk of
      diabetes and, among diabetic individuals, lower risks of death and development of
      major vascular complications.

TI  - Risk prediction models for selection of lung cancer screening candidates: A
      retrospective validation study.
PG  - e1002277
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002277 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selection of candidates for lung cancer screening based on individual
      risk has been proposed as an alternative to criteria based on age and cumulative 
      smoking exposure (pack-years). Nine previously established risk models were
      assessed for their ability to identify those most likely to develop or die from
      lung cancer. All models considered age and various aspects of smoking exposure
      (smoking status, smoking duration, cigarettes per day, pack-years smoked, time
      since smoking cessation) as risk predictors. In addition, some models considered 
      factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, education, body mass index, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, personal history of cancer, personal
      history of pneumonia, and family history of lung cancer. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Retrospective analyses were performed on 53,452 National Lung Screening Trial
      (NLST) participants (1,925 lung cancer cases and 884 lung cancer deaths) and
      80,672 Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO)
      ever-smoking participants (1,463 lung cancer cases and 915 lung cancer deaths).
      Six-year lung cancer incidence and mortality risk predictions were assessed for
      (1) calibration (graphically) by comparing the agreement between the predicted
      and the observed risks, (2) discrimination (area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve [AUC]) between individuals with and without lung cancer
      (death), and (3) clinical usefulness (net benefit in decision curve analysis) by 
      identifying risk thresholds at which applying risk-based eligibility would
      improve lung cancer screening efficacy. To further assess performance, risk model
      sensitivities and specificities in the PLCO were compared to those based on the
      NLST eligibility criteria. Calibration was satisfactory, but discrimination
      ranged widely (AUCs from 0.61 to 0.81). The models outperformed the NLST
      eligibility criteria over a substantial range of risk thresholds in decision
      curve analysis, with a higher sensitivity for all models and a slightly higher
      specificity for some models. The PLCOm2012, Bach, and Two-Stage Clonal Expansion 
      incidence models had the best overall performance, with AUCs >0.68 in the NLST
      and >0.77 in the PLCO. These three models had the highest sensitivity and
      specificity for predicting 6-y lung cancer incidence in the PLCO chest
      radiography arm, with sensitivities >79.8% and specificities >62.3%. In contrast,
      the NLST eligibility criteria yielded a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of
      62.2%. Limitations of this study include the lack of identification of optimal
      risk thresholds, as this requires additional information on the long-term
      benefits (e.g., life-years gained and mortality reduction) and harms (e.g.,
      overdiagnosis) of risk-based screening strategies using these models. In
      addition, information on some predictor variables included in the risk prediction
      models was not available. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of individuals for lung cancer
      screening using individual risk is superior to selection criteria based on age
      and pack-years alone. The benefits, harms, and feasibility of implementing lung
      cancer screening policies based on risk prediction models should be assessed and 
      compared with those of current recommendations.

TI  - Status and methodology of publicly available national HIV care continua and
      90-90-90 targets: A systematic review.
PG  - e1002253
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2014, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) issued
      treatment goals for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The 90-90-90 target
      specifies that by 2020, 90% of individuals living with HIV will know their HIV
      status, 90% of people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive antiretroviral
      treatment (ART), and 90% of those taking ART will be virally suppressed.
      Consistent methods and routine reporting in the public domain will be necessary
      for tracking progress towards the 90-90-90 target. METHODS AND FINDINGS: For the 
      period 2010-2016, we searched PubMed, UNAIDS country progress reports, World
      Health Organization (WHO), UNAIDS reports, national surveillance and program
      reports, United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)
      Country Operational Plans, and conference presentations and/or abstracts for the 
      latest available national HIV care continuum in the public domain. Continua of
      care included the number and proportion of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are
      diagnosed, on ART, and virally suppressed out of the estimated number of PLHIV.
      We ranked the described methods for indicators to derive high-, medium-, and
      low-quality continuum. For 2010-2016, we identified 53 national care continua
      with viral suppression estimates representing 19.7 million (54%) of the 2015
      global estimate of PLHIV. Of the 53, 6 (with 2% of global burden) were high
      quality, using standard surveillance methods to derive an overall denominator and
      program data from national cohorts for estimating steps in the continuum. Only
      nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa had care continua with viral suppression
      estimates. Of the 53 countries, the average proportion of the aggregate of PLHIV 
      from all countries on ART was 48%, and the proportion of PLHIV who were virally
      suppressed was 40%. Seven countries (Sweden, Cambodia, United Kingdom,
      Switzerland, Denmark, Rwanda, and Namibia) were within 12% and 10% of achieving
      the 90-90-90 target for "on ART" and for "viral suppression," respectively. The
      limitations to consider when interpreting the results include significant
      variation in methods used to determine national continua and the possibility that
      complete continua were not available through our comprehensive search of the
      public domain. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively few complete national continua of care are
      available in the public domain, and there is considerable variation in the
      methods for determining progress towards the 90-90-90 target. Despite bearing the
      highest HIV burden, national care continua from sub-Saharan Africa were less
      likely to be in the public domain. A standardized monitoring and evaluation
      approach could improve the use of scarce resources to achieve 90-90-90 through
      improved transparency, accountability, and efficiency.

TI  - Demographic transition and the dynamics of measles in six provinces in China: A
      modeling study.
PG  - e1002255
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Industrialization and demographic transition generate nonstationary
      dynamics in human populations that can affect the transmission and persistence of
      infectious diseases. Decades of increasing vaccination and development have led
      to dramatic declines in the global burden of measles, but the virus remains
      persistent in much of the world. Here we show that a combination of demographic
      transition, as a result of declining birth rates, and reduced measles prevalence,
      due to improved vaccination, has shifted the age distribution of susceptibility
      to measles throughout China. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We fit a novel time-varying
      catalytic model to three decades of age-specific measles case reporting in six
      provinces in China to quantify the change in the age-specific force of infection 
      for measles virus over time. We further quantified the impact of supplemental
      vaccination campaigns on the reduction of susceptible individuals. The force of
      infection of measles has declined dramatically (90%-97% reduction in transmission
      rate) in three industrialized eastern provinces during the last decade, driving a
      concomitant increase in both the relative proportion and absolute number of adult
      cases, while three central and western provinces exhibited dynamics consistent
      with endemic persistence (24%-73% reduction in transmission rate). The reduction 
      in susceptible individuals due to supplemental vaccination campaigns is
      frequently below the nominal campaign coverage, likely because campaigns
      necessarily vaccinate those who may already be immune. The impact of these
      campaigns has significantly improved over time: campaigns prior to 2005 were
      estimated to have achieved less than 50% reductions in the proportion susceptible
      in the target age classes, but campaigns from 2005 onwards reduced the
      susceptible proportion by 32%-87%. A limitation of this study is that it relies
      on case surveillance, and thus inference may be biased by age-specific variation 
      in measles reporting. CONCLUSIONS: The age distribution of measles cases changes 
      in response to both demographic and vaccination processes. Combining both
      processes in a novel catalytic model, we illustrate that age-specific incidence
      patterns reveal regional differences in the progress to measles elimination and
      the impact of vaccination controls in China. The shift in the age distribution of
      measles susceptibility in response to demographic and vaccination processes
      emphasizes the importance of progressive control strategies and measures to
      evaluate program success that anticipate and react to this transition in observed
      incidence.

TI  - Neuropathological diagnoses and clinical correlates in older adults in Brazil: A 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - e1002267
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicopathological studies are important in determining the brain
      lesions underlying dementia. Although almost 60% of individuals with dementia
      live in developing countries, few clinicopathological studies focus on these
      individuals. We investigated the frequency of neurodegenerative and
      vascular-related neuropathological lesions in 1,092 Brazilian admixed older
      adults, their correlation with cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the
      accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this
      cross-sectional study, we describe clinical and neuropathological variables
      related to cognitive impairment in 1,092 participants (mean age = 74 y, 49% male,
      69% white, and mean education = 4 y). Cognitive function was investigated using
      the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive
      Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE); neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated using
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Associations between neuropathological
      lesions and cognitive impairment were investigated using ordinal logistic
      regression. We developed a neuropathological comorbidity (NPC) score and compared
      it to CDR, IQCODE, and NPI scores. We also described and compared the frequency
      of neuropathological diagnosis to clinical diagnosis of dementia subtype.
      Forty-four percent of the sample met criteria for neuropathological diagnosis.
      Among these participants, 50% had neuropathological diagnoses of Alzheimer
      disease (AD), and 35% of vascular dementia (VaD). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs),
      hippocampal sclerosis, lacunar infarcts, hyaline atherosclerosis,
      siderocalcinosis, and Lewy body disease were independently associated with
      cognitive impairment. Higher NPC scores were associated with worse scores in the 
      CDR sum of boxes (beta = 1.33, 95% CI 1.20-1.46), IQCODE (beta = 0.14, 95% CI
      0.13-0.16), and NPI (beta = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.33-2.16). Compared to
      neuropathological diagnoses, clinical diagnosis had high sensitivity to AD and
      high specificity to dementia with Lewy body/Parkinson dementia. The major
      limitation of our study is the lack of clinical follow-up of participants during 
      life. CONCLUSIONS: NFT deposition, vascular lesions, and high NPC scorewere
      associated with cognitive impairment in a unique Brazilian sample with low
      education. Our results confirm the high prevalence of neuropathological diagnosis
      in older adults and the mismatch between clinical and neuropathological
      diagnoses.

TI  - Differential associations of plasma lipids with incident dementia and dementia
      subtypes in the 3C Study: A longitudinal, population-based prospective cohort
      study.
PG  - e1002265
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002265 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular risk factors have been proposed as important targets for the
      prevention of dementia. As lipid fractions represent easily modifiable targets,
      we examined the longitudinal relationship of baseline lipid fractions with 13-y
      incident dementia and its subtypes (Alzheimer disease [AD] and mixed or vascular 
      dementia) in older community-dwelling persons. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Non-institutionalized persons aged 65+ y (n = 9,294) were recruited for the
      Three-City Study (3C Study), a population-based cohort study from the electoral
      rolls of the cities of Dijon, Bordeaux, and Montpellier, France, between March
      1999 and March 2001. Follow-up examinations were performed every 2 y after the
      baseline assessment. The final study sample comprised 7,470 participants from the
      3C Study (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 73.8 +/- 5.3 y, 61.0% women) who
      were prospectively followed up for up to 13 y. Fasting lipid fractions
      (triglycerides [TGs], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], total cholesterol [TC]) were studied as
      continuous variables, and results are reported per SD increase of each lipid
      fraction. Incident dementia and its subtypes were studied as censored variables
      using Cox models with age as time scale. Analyses were adjusted for sex, study
      center, and educational level, as well as vascular risk factors and
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 genotype. We corrected for multiple testing,
      yielding a significance threshold of 0.0169. p-Values above the significance
      threshold but less than 0.05 were considered nominally significant. During a mean
      (+/- SD) follow-up period of 7.9 +/- 3.6 y, 779 participants developed incident
      dementia (n = 532 AD and n = 154 mixed or vascular dementia). Higher LDL-C and TC
      concentrations at baseline were associated with an increased risk of AD (hazard
      ratio [HR] per SD increase = 1.13 [95% CI 1.04-1.22], p = 0.0045, and HR = 1.12
      [1.03-1.22], p = 0.0072, respectively). These associations were largely unchanged
      after adjustment for vascular risk factors and were attenuated after adjustment
      for APOEepsilon4 (HR per SD increase = 1.12 [1.03-1.23], p = 0.0110, and HR =
      1.12 [1.02-1.23], p = 0.0171, respectively). Higher TG concentrations at baseline
      were associated with an increased risk of all dementia (HR per SD increase = 1.11
      [1.03-1.19], p = 0.0044) and mixed or vascular dementia (HR = 1.21 [1.04-1.41], p
      = 0.0163). However, these associations disappeared after adjusting for vascular
      risk factors (HR = 1.07 [0.98-1.17], p = 0.1374, and HR = 1.17 [0.96-1.42], p =
      0.1206, respectively). Main limitations of the study include interval censoring
      of incident dementia cases, potential selective survival bias, and the fact that 
      variation in lipid concentrations during follow-up could not be accounted for in 
      the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In a large population-based sample of older
      community-dwelling persons with up to 13 y of follow-up, we observed that higher 
      LDL-C and TC concentrations were associated with an increased risk of AD. This
      result was independent of vascular risk factors and was attenuated after
      adjustment for APOEepsilon4 carrier status. TG and HDL-C concentrations were not 
      associated with risk of incident dementia or its subtypes after accounting for
      vascular risk factors.

TI  - APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations in early-onset Alzheimer disease: A genetic
      screening study of familial and sporadic cases.
PG  - e1002270
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and
      presenilin-2 (PSEN2) mutations cause autosomal dominant forms of early-onset
      Alzheimer disease (AD-EOAD). Although these genes were identified in the 1990s,
      variant classification remains a challenge, highlighting the need to colligate
      mutations from large series. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We report here a novel update 
      (2012-2016) of the genetic screening of the large AD-EOAD series ascertained
      across 28 French hospitals from 1993 onwards, bringing the total number of
      families with identified mutations to n = 170. Families were included when at
      least two first-degree relatives suffered from early-onset Alzheimer disease
      (EOAD) with an age of onset (AOO) </=65 y in two generations. Furthermore, we
      also screened 129 sporadic cases of Alzheimer disease with an AOO below age 51
      (44% males, mean AOO = 45 +/- 2 y). APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 mutations were
      identified in 53 novel AD-EOAD families. Of the 129 sporadic cases screened, 17
      carried a PSEN1 mutation and 1 carried an APP duplication (13%). Parental DNA was
      available for 10 sporadic mutation carriers, allowing us to show that the
      mutation had occurred de novo in each case. Thirteen mutations (12 in PSEN1 and 1
      in PSEN2) identified either in familial or in sporadic cases were previously
      unreported. Of the 53 mutation carriers with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      biomarkers, 46 (87%) had all three CSF biomarkers-total tau protein (Tau),
      phospho-tau protein (P-Tau), and amyloid beta (Abeta)42-in abnormal ranges. No
      mutation carrier had the three biomarkers in normal ranges. One limitation of
      this study is the absence of functional assessment of the possibly and probably
      pathogenic variants, which should help their classification. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      findings suggest that a nonnegligible fraction of PSEN1 mutations occurs de novo,
      which is of high importance for genetic counseling, as PSEN1 mutational screening
      is currently performed in familial cases only. Among the 90 distinct mutations
      found in the whole sample of families and isolated cases, definite pathogenicity 
      is currently established for only 77%, emphasizing the need to pursue the effort 
      to classify variants.

TI  - The impact of individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (iCST) on cognition,
      quality of life, caregiver health, and family relationships in dementia: A
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e1002269
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a well-established group
      psychosocial intervention for people with dementia. There is evidence that
      home-based programmes of cognitive stimulation delivered by family caregivers may
      benefit both the person and the caregiver. However, no previous studies have
      evaluated caregiver-delivered CST. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness
      of a home-based, caregiver-led individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST)
      program in (i) improving cognition and quality of life (QoL) for the person with 
      dementia and (ii) mental and physical health (well-being) for the caregiver.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: A single-blind, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT)
      was conducted at eight study sites across the United Kingdom. The intervention
      and blinded assessment of outcomes were conducted in participants' homes. Three
      hundred fifty-six people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers were
      recruited from memory services and community mental health teams (CMHTs).
      Participants were randomly assigned to iCST (75, 30-min sessions) or treatment as
      usual (TAU) control over 25 wk. iCST sessions consisted of themed activities
      designed to be mentally stimulating and enjoyable. Caregivers delivering iCST
      received training and support from an unblind researcher. Primary outcomes were
      cognition (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive [ADAS-Cog]) and
      self-reported QoL (Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease [QoL-AD]) for the person
      with dementia and general health status (Short Form-12 health survey [SF-12]) for
      the caregiver. Secondary outcomes included quality of the caregiving relationship
      from the perspectives of the person and of the caregiver (Quality of the Carer
      Patient Relationship Scale) and health-related QoL (European Quality of Life-5
      Dimensions [EQ-5D]) for the caregiver. Intention to treat (ITT) analyses were
      conducted. At the post-test (26 wk), there were no differences between the iCST
      and TAU groups in the outcomes of cognition (mean difference [MD] = -0.55, 95% CI
      -2.00-0.90; p = 0.45) and self-reported QoL (MD = -0.02, 95% CI -1.22-0.82; p =
      0.97) for people with dementia, or caregivers' general health status (MD = 0.13, 
      95% CI -1.65-1.91; p = 0.89). However, people with dementia receiving iCST rated 
      the relationship with their caregiver more positively (MD = 1.77, 95% CI
      0.26-3.28; p = 0.02), and iCST improved QoL for caregivers (EQ-5D, MD = 0.06, 95%
      CI 0.02-0.10; p = 0.01). Forty percent (72/180) of dyads allocated to iCST
      completed at least two sessions per week, with 22% (39/180) completing no
      sessions at all. Study limitations include low adherence to the intervention.
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that iCST has an effect on cognition or QoL
      for people with dementia. However, participating in iCST appeared to enhance the 
      quality of the caregiving relationship and caregivers' QoL. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      The iCST trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (identified ISRCTN
      65945963, URL: DOI 10.1186/ISRCTN65945963).

TI  - Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen locus as a risk factor for Alzheimer 
      disease: A case-control study.
PG  - e1002272
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002272 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive disorder that affects
      cognitive function. There is increasing support for the role of neuroinflammation
      and aberrant immune regulation in the pathophysiology of AD. The immunoregulatory
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex has been linked to susceptibility for a
      number of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD; however, studies to date have
      failed to consistently identify a risk HLA haplotype for AD. Contributing to this
      difficulty are the complex genetic organization of the HLA region, differences in
      sequencing and allelic imputation methods, and diversity across ethnic
      populations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Building on prior work linking the HLA to AD, 
      we used a robust imputation method on two separate case-control cohorts to
      examine the relationship between HLA haplotypes and AD risk in 309 individuals
      (191 AD, 118 cognitively normal [CN] controls) from the San Francisco-based
      University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center (collected
      between 1999-2015) and 11,381 individuals (5,728 AD, 5,653 CN controls) from the 
      Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), a National Institute on Aging
      (NIA)-funded national data repository (reflecting samples collected between
      1984-2012). We also examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker measures for
      patients seen between 2005-2007 and longitudinal cognitive data from the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 346, mean follow-up 3.15 +/-
      2.04 y in AD individuals) to assess the clinical relevance of identified risk
      haplotypes. The strongest association with AD risk occurred with major
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype
      A*03:01~B*07:02~DRB1*15:01~DQA1*01:02~DQB1*06:02 (p = 9.6 x 10-4, odds ratio [OR]
      [95% confidence interval] = 1.21 [1.08-1.37]) in the combined UCSF + ADGC cohort.
      Secondary analysis suggested that this effect may be driven primarily by
      individuals who are negative for the established AD genetic risk factor,
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) varepsilon4. Separate analyses of class I and II
      haplotypes further supported the role of class I haplotype A*03:01~B*07:02 (p =
      0.03, OR = 1.11 [1.01-1.23]) and class II haplotype DRB1*15:01- DQA1*01:02-
      DQB1*06:02 (DR15) (p = 0.03, OR = 1.08 [1.01-1.15]) as risk factors for AD. We
      followed up these findings in the clinical dataset representing the spectrum of
      cognitively normal controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and
      individuals with AD to assess their relevance to disease. Carrying
      A*03:01~B*07:02 was associated with higher CSF amyloid levels (p = 0.03, beta +/-
      standard error = 47.19 +/- 21.78). We also found a dose-dependent association
      between the DR15 haplotype and greater rates of cognitive decline (greater
      impairment on the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale
      [ADAS11] over time [p = 0.03, beta +/- standard error = 0.7 +/- 0.3]; worse
      forgetting score on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) over time [p = 
      0.02, beta +/- standard error = -0.2 +/- 0.06]). In a subset of the same cohort, 
      dose of DR15 was also associated with higher baseline levels of chemokine CC-4, a
      biomarker of inflammation (p = 0.005, beta +/- standard error = 0.08 +/- 0.03).
      The main study limitations are that the results represent only individuals of
      European-ancestry and clinically diagnosed individuals, and that our study used
      imputed genotypes for a subset of HLA genes. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence
      that variation in the HLA locus-including risk haplotype DR15-contributes to AD
      risk. DR15 has also been associated with multiple sclerosis, and its component
      alleles have been implicated in Parkinson disease and narcolepsy. Our findings
      thus raise the possibility that DR15-associated mechanisms may contribute to
      pan-neuronal disease vulnerability.

TI  - Association between delirium superimposed on dementia and mortality in
      hospitalized older adults: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - e1002264
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002264 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitalized older adults with preexisting dementia have increased
      risk of having delirium, but little is known regarding the effect of delirium
      superimposed on dementia (DSD) on the outcomes of these patients. Our aim was to 
      investigate the association between DSD and hospital mortality and 12-mo
      mortality in hospitalized older adults. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a
      prospective cohort study completed in the geriatric ward of a university hospital
      in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We included 1,409 hospitalizations of acutely ill patients 
      aged 60 y and over from January 2009 to June 2015. Main variables and measures
      included dementia and dementia severity (Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive
      Decline in the Elderly, Clinical Dementia Rating) and delirium (Confusion
      Assessment Method). Primary outcomes were time to death in the hospital and time 
      to death in 12 mo (for the discharged sample). Comprehensive geriatric assessment
      was performed at admission, and additional clinical data were documented upon
      death or discharge. Cases were categorized into four groups (no delirium or
      dementia, dementia alone, delirium alone, and DSD). The no delirium/dementia
      group was defined as the referent category for comparisons, and multivariate
      analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for
      possible confounders (sociodemographic information, medical history and physical 
      examination data, functional and nutritional status, polypharmacy, and laboratory
      covariates). Overall, 61% were women and 39% had dementia, with a mean age of 80 
      y. Dementia alone was observed in 13% of the cases, with delirium alone in 21%
      and DSD in 26% of the cases. In-hospital mortality was 8% for patients without
      delirium or dementia, 12% for patients with dementia alone, 29% for patients with
      delirium alone, and 32% for DSD patients (Pearson Chi-square = 112, p < 0.001).
      DSD and delirium alone were independently associated with in-hospital mortality, 
      with respective hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.14 (95% CI = 1.33-3.45, p = 0.002) and
      2.72 (95% CI = 1.77-4.18, p < 0.001). Dementia alone did not have a significant
      statistical association with in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.69, 95% CI =
      0.72-2.30, p = 0.385). Finally, while 24% of the patients died after discharge,
      12-mo mortality was not associated with dementia or delirium in any of the
      diagnostic groups (DSD: HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.79-1.68, p = 0.463; delirium alone:
      HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.71-1.54, p = 0.810; dementia alone: HR = 1.19, 95% CI =
      0.79-1.78, p = 0.399). Limitations to this study include not exploring the
      effects of the duration and severity of delirium on the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:
      DSD and delirium alone were independently associated with a worse prognosis in
      hospitalized older adults. Health care professionals should recognize the
      importance of delirium as a predictor of hospital mortality regardless of the
      coexistence with dementia.

TI  - Age-related cognitive decline and associations with sex, education and
      apolipoprotein E genotype across ethnocultural groups and geographic regions: a
      collaborative cohort study.
PG  - e1002261
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia varies around the world, potentially
      contributed to by international differences in rates of age-related cognitive
      decline. Our primary goal was to investigate how rates of age-related decline in 
      cognitive test performance varied among international cohort studies of cognitive
      aging. We also determined the extent to which sex, educational attainment, and
      apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (APOE*4) carrier status were associated with
      decline. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We harmonized longitudinal data for 14 cohorts
      from 12 countries (Australia, Brazil, France, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan,
      Singapore, Spain, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States), for a total of
      42,170 individuals aged 54-105 y (42% male), including 3.3% with dementia at
      baseline. The studies began between 1989 and 2011, with all but three ongoing,
      and each had 2-16 assessment waves (median = 3) and a follow-up duration of 2-15 
      y. We analyzed standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and memory,
      processing speed, language, and executive functioning test scores using linear
      mixed models, adjusted for sex and education, and meta-analytic techniques.
      Performance on all cognitive measures declined with age, with the most rapid rate
      of change pooled across cohorts a moderate -0.26 standard deviations per decade
      (SD/decade) (95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.35, -0.16], p < 0.001) for
      processing speed. Rates of decline accelerated slightly with age, with executive 
      functioning showing the largest additional rate of decline with every further
      decade of age (-0.07 SD/decade, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.03], p = 0.002). There was a
      considerable degree of heterogeneity in the associations across cohorts,
      including a slightly faster decline (p = 0.021) on the MMSE for Asians (-0.20
      SD/decade, 95% CI [-0.28, -0.12], p < 0.001) than for whites (-0.09 SD/decade,
      95% CI [-0.16, -0.02], p = 0.009). Males declined on the MMSE at a slightly
      slower rate than females (difference = 0.023 SD/decade, 95% CI [0.011, 0.035], p 
      < 0.001), and every additional year of education was associated with a rate of
      decline slightly slower for the MMSE (0.004 SD/decade less, 95% CI [0.002,
      0.006], p = 0.001), but slightly faster for language (-0.007 SD/decade more, 95% 
      CI [-0.011, -0.003], p = 0.001). APOE*4 carriers declined slightly more rapidly
      than non-carriers on most cognitive measures, with processing speed showing the
      greatest difference (-0.08 SD/decade, 95% CI [-0.15, -0.01], p = 0.019). The same
      overall pattern of results was found when analyses were repeated with baseline
      dementia cases excluded. We used only one test to represent cognitive domains,
      and though a prototypical one, we nevertheless urge caution in generalizing the
      results to domains rather than viewing them as test-specific associations. This
      study lacked cohorts from Africa, India, and mainland China. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cognitive performance declined with age, and more rapidly with increasing age,
      across samples from diverse ethnocultural groups and geographical regions.
      Associations varied across cohorts, suggesting that different rates of cognitive 
      decline might contribute to the global variation in dementia prevalence. However,
      the many similarities and consistent associations with education and APOE
      genotype indicate a need to explore how international differences in associations
      with other risk factors such as genetics, cardiovascular health, and lifestyle
      are involved. Future studies should attempt to use multiple tests for each
      cognitive domain and feature populations from ethnocultural groups and
      geographical regions for which we lacked data.

TI  - Genetic assessment of age-associated Alzheimer disease risk: Development and
      validation of a polygenic hazard score.
PG  - e1002258
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002258 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD)
      is of utmost importance. Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated
      SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an
      epidemiological framework for risk prediction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using
      genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International
      Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs 
      (at p < 10-5). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox
      proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients 
      and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics
      Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant.
      By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for
      each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD,
      based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts
      (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], 
      and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within
      the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at 
      a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE
      epsilon3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10
      y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.62-4.24, p 
      = 1.0 x 10-22). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age 
      of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 x 10-26) and longitudinal
      progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p =
      1.5 x 10-10), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of
      neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 x 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry
      for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 x 10-6) and in vivo
      markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, 
      p = 6.3 x 10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 x 10-5). Additional prospective
      validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based
      cohorts is necessary before clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS
      for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD.
      Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role
      in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With thorough validation, quantification of
      inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an
      enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials.

PG  - e1002259
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Potentially modifiable lifestyle factors may influence cognitive
      health in later life and offer potential to reduce the risk of cognitive decline 
      and dementia. The concept of cognitive reserve has been proposed as a mechanism
      to explain individual differences in rates of cognitive decline, but its
      potential role as a mediating pathway has seldom been explored using data from
      large epidemiological studies. We explored the mediating effect of cognitive
      reserve on the cross-sectional association between lifestyle factors and
      cognitive function in later life using data from a population-based cohort of
      healthy older people. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed data from 2,315
      cognitively healthy participants aged 65 y and over in the Cognitive Function and
      Ageing Study Wales (CFAS-Wales) cohort collected in 2011-2013. Linear regression 
      modelling was used to investigate the overall associations between five lifestyle
      factors-cognitive and social activity, physical activity, diet, alcohol
      consumption, and smoking-and cognition, adjusting for demographic factors and
      chronic conditions. Mediation analysis tested for indirect effects of the
      lifestyle factors on cognition via cognitive reserve. After controlling for age, 
      gender, and the presence of chronic conditions, cognitive and social activity,
      physical activity, healthy diet, and light-to-moderate alcohol consumption were
      positively associated with cognitive function, together accounting for 20% (95%
      CI 17%-23%) of variance in cognitive test scores. Cognitive reserve was an
      important mediator of this association, with indirect effects via cognitive
      reserve contributing 21% (95% CI 15%-27%) of the overall effect on cognition. The
      main limitations of the study derive from the cross-sectional nature of the data 
      and the challenges of accurately measuring the latent construct of cognitive
      reserve. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sectional associations support the view that
      enhancing cognitive reserve may benefit cognition, and maintenance of cognitive
      health may be supported by a healthy and active lifestyle, in later life.

TI  - APOE-related risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia for prevention
      trials: An analysis of four cohorts.
PG  - e1002254
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the onset of prevention trials for individuals at high risk for 
      Alzheimer disease, there is increasing need for accurate risk prediction to
      inform study design and enrollment, but available risk estimates are limited. We 
      developed risk estimates for the incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or 
      dementia among cognitively unimpaired individuals by APOE-e4 dose for the genetic
      disclosure process of the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Generation Study, a
      prevention trial in cognitively unimpaired APOE-e4/e4 homozygote individuals.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 60-75
      y, consistent with Generation Study eligibility criteria, from the National
      Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) (n = 5,073, 158 APOE-e4/e4), the Rotterdam
      Study (n = 6,399, 156 APOE-e4/e4), the Framingham Heart Study (n = 4,078, 67
      APOE-e4/e4), and the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA) (n = 1,294, 11
      APOE-e4/e4). We computed stratified cumulative incidence curves by age (60-64,
      65-69, 70-75 y) and APOE-e4 dose, adjusting for the competing risk of mortality, 
      and determined risk of MCI and/or dementia by genotype and baseline age. We also 
      used subdistribution hazard regression to model relative hazard based on age,
      APOE genotype, sex, education, family history of dementia, vascular risk,
      subjective memory concerns, and baseline cognitive performance. The four cohorts 
      varied considerably in age, education, ethnicity/race, and APOE-e4 allele
      frequency. Overall, cumulative incidence was uniformly higher in NACC than in the
      population-based cohorts. Among APOE-e4/e4 individuals, 5-y cumulative incidence 
      was as follows: in the 60-64-y age stratum, it ranged from 0% to 5.88% in the
      three population-based cohorts versus 23.06% in NACC; in the 65-69-y age stratum,
      from 9.42% to 10.39% versus 34.62%; and in the 70-75-y age stratum, from 18.64%
      to 33.33% versus 38.34%. Five-year incidence of dementia was negligible except
      for APOE-e4/e4 individuals and those over 70 y. Lifetime incidence (to age 80-85 
      y) of MCI or dementia for the APOE-e4/e4 individuals in the long-term Framingham 
      and Rotterdam cohorts was 34.69%-38.45% at age 60-64 y, 30.76%-40.26% at 65-69 y,
      and 33.3%-35.17% at 70-75 y. Confidence limits for these estimates are often
      wide, particularly for APOE-e4/e4 individuals and for the dementia outcome at 5
      y. In regression models, APOE-e4 dose and age both consistently increased risk,
      as did lower education, subjective memory concerns, poorer baseline cognitive
      performance, and family history of dementia. We discuss several limitations of
      the study, including the small numbers of APOE-e4/e4 individuals, missing data
      and differential dropout, limited ethnic and racial diversity, and differences in
      definitions of exposure and outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the
      absolute risk of MCI or dementia, particularly over short time intervals, are
      sensitive to sampling and a variety of methodological factors. Nonetheless, such 
      estimates were fairly consistent across the population-based cohorts, and lower
      than those from a convenience cohort and those estimated in prior studies-with
      implications for informed consent and design for clinical trials targeting
      high-risk individuals.

TI  - Association between fatty acid metabolism in the brain and Alzheimer disease
      neuropathology and cognitive performance: A nontargeted metabolomic study.
PG  - e1002266
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The metabolic basis of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and
      expression of AD symptoms is poorly understood. Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids have
      previously been linked to both protective and pathogenic effects in AD. However, 
      to date little is known about how the abundance of these species is affected by
      differing levels of disease pathology in the brain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      performed metabolic profiling on brain tissue samples from 43 individuals ranging
      in age from 57 to 95 y old who were stratified into three groups: AD (N = 14),
      controls (N = 14) and "asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease" (ASYMAD), i.e.,
      individuals with significant AD neuropathology at death but without evidence for 
      cognitive impairment during life (N = 15) from the autopsy sample of the
      Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We measured 4,897 metabolite
      features in regions both vulnerable in the middle frontal and inferior temporal
      gyri (MFG and ITG) and resistant (cerebellum) to classical AD pathology. The
      levels of six unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in whole brain were compared in
      controls versus AD, and the differences were as follows: linoleic acid (p = 8.8 x
      10-8, FC = 0.52, q = 1.03 x 10-6), linolenic acid (p = 2.5 x 10-4, FC = 0.84, q =
      4.03 x 10-4), docosahexaenoic acid (p = 1.7 x 10-7, FC = 1.45, q = 1.24 x 10-6), 
      eicosapentaenoic acid (p = 4.4 x 10-4, FC = 0.16, q = 6.48 x 10-4), oleic acid (p
      = 3.3 x 10-7, FC = 0.34, q = 1.46 x 10-6), and arachidonic acid (p = 2.98 x 10-5,
      FC = 0.75, q = 7.95 x 10-5). These fatty acids were strongly associated with AD
      when comparing the groups in the MFG and ITG, respectively: linoleic acid (p <
      0.0001, p = 0.0006), linolenic acid (p < 0.0001, p = 0.002), docosahexaenoic acid
      (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0024), eicosapentaenoic acid (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0008), oleic
      acid (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0003), and arachidonic acid (p = 0.0001, p = 0.001).
      Significant associations were also observed between the abundance of these UFAs
      with neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden as well as domain-specific
      cognitive performance assessed during life. Based on the regional pattern of
      differences in brain tissue levels of these metabolites, we propose that
      alterations in UFA metabolism represent both global metabolic perturbations in AD
      as well as those related to specific features of AD pathology. Within the middle 
      frontal gyrus, decrements in linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid 
      (control>ASYMAD>AD) and increases in docosahexanoic acid (AD>ASYMAD>control) may 
      represent regionally specific threshold levels of these metabolites beyond which 
      the accumulation of AD pathology triggers the expression of clinical symptoms.
      The main limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size. There are 
      few cohorts with extensive longitudinal cognitive assessments during life and
      detailed neuropathological assessments at death, such as the BLSA. CONCLUSIONS:
      The findings of this study suggest that unsaturated fatty acid metabolism is
      significantly dysregulated in the brains of patients with varying degrees of
      Alzheimer pathology.

TI  - Early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia through basic and 
      instrumental activities of daily living: Development of a new evaluation tool.
PG  - e1002250
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002250 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) is paramount to
      determine impairment in everyday functioning and to ensure accurate early
      diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders. Unfortunately, most common ADL tools are
      limited in their use in a diagnostic process. This study developed a new
      evaluation by adopting the items of the Katz Index (basic [b-] ADL) and Lawton
      Scale (instrumental [i-] ADL), defining them with the terminology of the
      International Classification of Human Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF),
      adding the scoring system of the ICF, and adding the possibility to identify
      underlying causes of limitations in ADL. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The construct
      validity, interrater reliability, and discriminative validity of this new
      evaluation were determined. From 2015 until 2016, older persons (65-93 y) with
      normal cognitive ageing (healthy comparison [HC]) (n = 79), mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) (n = 73), and Alzheimer disease (AD) (n = 71) underwent a
      diagnostic procedure for neurocognitive disorders at the geriatric day hospital
      of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (Brussels, Belgium). Additionally, the
      ICF-based evaluation for b- and i-ADL was carried out. A global disability index 
      (DI), a cognitive DI (CDI), and a physical DI (PDI) were calculated. The
      i-ADL-CDI showed high accuracy and higher discriminative power than the Lawton
      Scale in differentiating HC and MCI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.895, 95% CI
      .840-.950, p = .002), MCI and AD (AUC = 0.805, 95% CI .805-.734, p = .010), and
      HC and AD (AUC = 0.990, 95% CI .978-1.000, p < .001). The b-ADL-DI showed
      significantly better discriminative accuracy than the Katz Index in
      differentiating HC and AD (AUC = 0.828, 95% CI .759-.897, p = .039). This study
      was conducted in a clinically relevant sample. However, heterogeneity between HC,
      MCI, and AD and the use of different methods of reporting ADL might limit this
      study. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation of b- and i-ADL can contribute to the
      diagnostic differentiation between cognitively healthy ageing and neurocognitive 
      disorders in older age. This evaluation provides more clarity and nuance in
      assessing everyday functioning by using an ICF-based terminology and scoring
      system. Also, the possibility to take underlying causes of limitations into
      account seems to be valuable since it is crucial to determine the extent to which
      cognitive decline is responsible for functional impairment in diagnosing
      neurocognitive disorders. Though further prospective validation is still
      required, the i-ADL-CDI might be useful in clinical practice since it identifies 
      impairment in i-ADL exclusively because of cognitive limitations.

TI  - Association of lifelong exposure to cognitive reserve-enhancing factors with
      dementia risk: A community-based cohort study.
PG  - e1002251
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variation in the clinical manifestation of dementia has been
      associated with differences in cognitive reserve, although less is known about
      the cumulative effects of exposure to cognitive reserve factors over the life
      course. We examined the association of cognitive reserve-related factors over the
      lifespan with the risk of dementia in a community-based cohort of older adults.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Information on early-life education, socioeconomic status, 
      work complexity at age 20, midlife occupation attainment, and late-life leisure
      activities was collected in a cohort of dementia-free community dwellers aged 75+
      y residing in the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm, Sweden, in 1987-1989. The
      cohort was followed up to 9 y (until 1996) to detect incident dementia cases. To 
      exclude preclinical phases of disease, participants who developed dementia at the
      first follow-up examination 3 y after the baseline were excluded (n = 602 after
      exclusions). Structural equation modelling was used to generate latent factors of
      cognitive reserve from three periods over the life course: early (before 20 y),
      adulthood (around 30-55 y), and late life (75 y and older). The correlation
      between early- and adult-life latent factors was strong (gamma = 0.9), whereas
      early-late (gamma = 0.27) and adult-late (gamma = 0.16) latent factor
      correlations were weak. One hundred forty-eight participants developed dementia
      during follow-up, and 454 remained dementia-free. The relative risk (RR) of
      dementia was estimated using Cox models with life-course cognitive
      reserve-enhancing factors modelled separately and simultaneously to assess direct
      and indirect effects. The analysis was repeated among carriers and noncarriers of
      the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele. A reduced risk of dementia was
      associated with early- (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.36-0.90), adult- (RR 0.60; 95% CI
      0.42-0.87), and late-life (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.37-0.73) reserve-enhancing latent
      factors in separate multivariable Cox models. In a mutually adjusted model, which
      may have been imprecisely estimated because of strong correlation between early- 
      and adult-life factors, the late-life factor preserved its association (RR 0.65; 
      95% CI 0.45-0.94), whereas the effect of midlife (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50-1.06) and 
      early-life factors (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.47-1.23) on the risk of dementia was
      attenuated. The risk declined progressively with cumulative exposure to
      reserve-enhancing latent factors, and having high scores on cognitive
      reserve-enhancing composite factors in all three periods over the life course was
      associated with the lowest risk of dementia (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.20-0.81). Similar 
      associations were detected among APOE epsilon4 allele carriers and noncarriers.
      Limitations include measurement error and nonresponse, with both biases likely
      favouring the null. Strong correlation between early- and adult-life latent
      factors may have led to a loss in precision when estimating mutually adjusted
      effects of all periods. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, cumulative exposure to
      reserve-enhancing factors over the lifespan was associated with reduced risk of
      dementia in late life, even among individuals with genetic predisposition.

TI  - Effectiveness of an intervention to facilitate prompt referral to memory clinics 
      in the United Kingdom: Cluster randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e1002252
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most people with dementia do not receive timely diagnosis, preventing
      them from making informed plans about their future and accessing services. Many
      countries have a policy to increase timely diagnosis, but trials aimed at
      changing general practitioner (GP) practice have been unsuccessful. We aimed to
      assess whether a GP's personal letter, with an evidence-based leaflet about
      overcoming barriers to accessing help for memory problems-aimed at empowering
      patients and families-increases timely dementia diagnosis and patient
      presentation to general practice. METHODS AND FINDING: Multicentre,
      cluster-randomised controlled trial with raters masked to an online
      computer-generated randomisation system assessing 1 y outcome. We recruited 22
      general practices (August 2013-September 2014) and 13 corresponding secondary
      care memory services in London, Hertfordshire, and Essex, United Kingdom.
      Eligible patients were aged >/=70 y, without a known diagnosis of dementia,
      living in their own homes. There were 6,387 such patients in 11 intervention
      practices and 8,171 in the control practices. The primary outcome was cognitive
      severity on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Main secondary outcomes were
      proportion of patients consulting their GP with suspected memory disorders and
      proportion of those referred to memory clinics. There was no between-group
      difference in cognitive severity at diagnosis (99 intervention, mean MMSE =
      22.04, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 20.95 to 23.13; 124 control, mean MMSE = 
      22.59, 95% CI = 21.58 to 23.6; p = 0.48). GP consultations with patients with
      suspected memory disorders increased in intervention versus control group (odds
      ratio = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.28, 1.54). There was no between-group difference in the 
      proportions of patients referred to memory clinics (166, 2.5%; 220, 2.7%; p =
      .077 respectively). The study was limited as we do not know whether the
      additional patients presenting to GPs had objective as well as subjective memory 
      problems and therefore should have been referred. In addition, we aimed to
      empower patients but did not do anything to change GP practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      intervention to access timely dementia diagnosis resulted in more patients
      presenting to GPs with memory problems, but no diagnoses increase. We are
      uncertain as to the reason for this and do not know whether empowering the public
      and targeting GPs would have resulted in a successful intervention. Future
      interventions should be targeted at both patients and GPs. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Multimorbidity and healthcare utilization among home care clients with dementia
      in Ontario, Canada: A retrospective analysis of a population-based cohort.
PG  - e1002249
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For community-dwelling older persons with dementia, the presence of
      multimorbidity can create complex clinical challenges for both individuals and
      their physicians, and can contribute to poor outcomes. We quantified the
      associations between level of multimorbidity (chronic disease burden) and risk of
      hospitalization and risk of emergency department (ED) visit in a home care cohort
      with dementia and explored the role of continuity of physician care (COC) in
      modifying these relationships. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective cohort study
      using linked administrative and clinical data from Ontario, Canada, was conducted
      among 30,112 long-stay home care clients (mean age 83.0 +/- 7.7 y) with dementia 
      in 2012. Multivariable Fine-Gray regression models were used to determine
      associations between level of multimorbidity and 1-y risk of hospitalization and 
      1-y risk of ED visit, accounting for multiple competing risks (death and
      long-term care placement). Interaction terms were used to assess potential effect
      modification by COC. Multimorbidity was highly prevalent, with 35% (n = 10,568)
      of the cohort having five or more chronic conditions. In multivariable analyses, 
      risk of hospitalization and risk of ED visit increased monotonically with level
      of multimorbidity: sub-hazards were 88% greater (sub-hazard ratio [sHR] = 1.88,
      95% CI: 1.72-2.05, p < 0.001) and 63% greater (sHR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.51-1.77, p <
      0.001), respectively, among those with five or more conditions, relative to those
      with dementia alone or with dementia and one other condition. Low (versus high)
      COC was associated with an increased risk of both hospitalization and ED visit in
      age- and sex-adjusted analyses only (sHR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07-1.16, p < 0.001,
      for hospitalization; sHR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11, p = 0.001, for ED visit) but 
      did not modify associations between multimorbidity and outcomes (Wald test for
      interaction, p = 0.566 for hospitalization and p = 0.637 for ED visit). The main 
      limitations of this study include use of fixed (versus time-varying) covariates
      and focus on all-cause rather than cause-specific hospitalizations and ED visits,
      which could potentially inform interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with
      dementia and multimorbidity pose a particular challenge for health systems.
      Findings from this study highlight the need to reshape models of care for this
      complex population, and to further investigate health system and other factors
      that may modify patients' risk of health outcomes.

      care data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested declining age-specific incidence rates 
      of dementia in high-income countries over time. Improved education and
      cardiovascular health in early age have been suggested to be bringing about this 
      effect. The aim of this study was to estimate the age-specific dementia incidence
      trend in primary care records from a large population in the Netherlands. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: A dynamic cohort representative of the Dutch population was
      composed using primary care records from general practice registration networks
      (GPRNs) across the country. Data regarding dementia incidence were obtained using
      general-practitioner-recorded diagnosis of dementia within the electronic health 
      records. Age-specific dementia incidence rates were calculated for all persons
      aged 60 y and over; negative binomial regression analysis was used to estimate
      the time trend. Nine out of eleven GPRNs provided data on more than 800,000 older
      people for the years 1992 to 2014, corresponding to over 4 million person-years
      and 23,186 incident dementia cases. The annual growth in dementia incidence rate 
      was estimated to be 2.1% (95% CI 0.5% to 3.8%), and incidence rates were 1.08
      (95% CI 1.04 to 1.13) times higher for women compared to men. Despite their
      relatively low numbers of person-years, the highest age groups contributed most
      to the increasing trend. There was no significant overall change in incidence
      rates since the start of a national dementia program in 2003 (-0.025; 95% CI
      -0.062 to 0.011). Increased awareness of dementia by patients and doctors in more
      recent years may have influenced dementia diagnosis by general practitioners in
      electronic health records, and needs to be taken into account when interpreting
      the data. CONCLUSIONS: Within the clinical records of a large, representative
      sample of the Dutch population, we found no evidence for a declining incidence
      trend of dementia in the Netherlands. This could indicate true stability in
      incidence rates, or a balance between increased detection and a true reduction.
      Irrespective of the exact rates and mechanisms underlying these findings, they
      illustrate that the burden of work for physicians and nurses in general practice 
      associated with newly diagnosed dementia has not been subject to substantial
      change in the past two decades. Hence, with the ageing of Western societies, we
      still need to anticipate a dramatic absolute increase in dementia occurrence over
      the years to come.

TI  - Subjective and objective cognitive function among older adults with a history of 
      traumatic brain injury: A population-based cohort study.
PG  - e1002246
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002246 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is extremely common across the lifespan 
      and is an established risk factor for dementia. The cognitive profile of the
      large and growing population of older adults with prior TBI who do not have a
      diagnosis of dementia, however, has not been well described. Our aim was to
      describe the cognitive profile associated with prior TBI exposure among
      community-dwelling older adults without dementia-an understudied but potentially 
      vulnerable population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this population-based cohort
      study, we studied 984 community-dwelling older adults (age 51 y and older and
      their spouses) without dementia who had been randomly selected from respondents
      to the 2014 wave of the Health and Retirement Study to participate in a
      comprehensive TBI survey and who either reported no prior TBI (n = 737) or prior 
      symptomatic TBI resulting in treatment in a hospital (n = 247). Mean time since
      first TBI was 38 +/- 19 y. Outcomes assessed included measures of global
      cognitive function, verbal episodic memory, semantic fluency, and calculation as 
      well as a measure of subjective memory ("How would you rate your memory at the
      present time?"). We compared outcomes between the two TBI groups using regression
      models adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidities, and depression.
      Sensitivity analyses were performed stratified by TBI severity (no TBI, TBI
      without loss of consciousness [LOC], and TBI with LOC). Respondents with TBI were
      younger (mean age 64 +/- 10 y versus 68 +/- 11 y), were less likely to be female,
      and had higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and depression than
      respondents without TBI. Respondents with TBI did not perform significantly
      differently from respondents without TBI on any measure of objective cognitive
      function in either raw or adjusted models (fully adjusted: global cognitive
      function score 15.4 versus 15.2, p = 0.68; verbal episodic memory score 4.4
      versus 4.3, p = 0.79; semantic fluency score 15.7 versus 14.0, p = 0.21;
      calculation impairment 22% versus 26%, risk ratio [RR] [95% CI] = 0.86
      [0.67-1.11], p = 0.24). Sensitivity analyses stratified by TBI severity produced 
      similar results. TBI was associated with significantly increased risk for
      subjective memory impairment in models adjusted for demographics and medical
      comorbidities (29% versus 24%; RR [95% CI]: 1.26 [1.02-1.57], p = 0.036). After
      further adjustment for active depression, however, risk for subjective memory
      impairment was no longer significant (RR [95% CI]: 1.18 [0.95-1.47], p = 0.13).
      Sensitivity analyses revealed that risk of subjective memory impairment was
      increased only among respondents with TBI with LOC and not among those with TBI
      without LOC. Furthermore, the risk of subjective memory impairment was
      significantly greater among those with TBI with LOC versus those without TBI even
      after adjustment for depression (RR [95% CI]: partially adjusted, 1.38
      [1.09-1.74], p = 0.008; fully adjusted, 1.28 [1.01-1.61], p = 0.039).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of community-dwelling older adults
      without dementia, those with prior TBI with LOC were more likely to report
      subjective memory impairment compared to those without TBI even after adjustment 
      for demographics, medical comorbidities, and active depression. Lack of greater
      objective cognitive impairment among those with versus without TBI may be due to 
      poor sensitivity of the cognitive battery or survival bias, or may suggest that
      post-TBI cognitive impairment primarily affects executive function and processing
      speed, which were not rigorously assessed in this study. Our findings show that
      among community-dwelling non-demented older adults, history of TBI is common but 
      may not preferentially impact cognitive domains of episodic memory, attention,
      working memory, verbal semantic fluency, or calculation.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) polymorphism and susceptibility to a
      home-visiting maternal-infant attachment intervention delivered by community
      health workers in South Africa: Reanalysis of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e1002237
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clear recognition of the damaging effects of poverty on early
      childhood development has fueled an interest in interventions aimed at mitigating
      these harmful consequences. Psychosocial interventions aimed at alleviating the
      negative impacts of poverty on children are frequently shown to be of benefit,
      but effect sizes are typically small to moderate. However, averaging outcomes
      over an entire sample, as is typically done, could underestimate efficacy because
      weaker effects on less susceptible individuals would dilute estimation of effects
      on those more disposed to respond. This study investigates whether a genetic
      polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene moderates susceptibility to a
      psychosocial intervention. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reanalyzed data from a
      randomized controlled trial of a home-visiting program delivered by community
      health workers in a black, isiXhosa-speaking population in Khayelitsha, South
      Africa. The intervention, designed to enhance maternal-infant attachment, began
      in the third trimester and continued until 6 mo postpartum. Implemented between
      April 1999 and February 2003, the intervention comprised 16 home visits delivered
      to 220 mother-infant dyads by specially trained community health workers. A
      control group of 229 mother-infant dyads did not receive the intervention.
      Security of maternal-infant attachment was the main outcome measured at infant
      age 18 mo. Compared to controls, infants in the intervention group were
      significantly more likely to be securely attached to their primary caregiver
      (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, p = 0.029, 95% CI [1.06, 2.76], d = 0.29). After the
      trial, 162 intervention and 172 control group children were reenrolled in a
      follow-up study at 13 y of age (December 2012-June 2014). At this time, DNA
      collected from 279 children (134 intervention and 145 control) was genotyped for 
      a common serotonin transporter polymorphism. There were both genetic data and
      attachment security data for 220 children (110 intervention and 110 control), of 
      whom 40% (44 intervention and 45 control) carried at least one short allele of
      the serotonin transporter gene. For these 220 individuals, carrying at least one 
      short allele of the serotonin transporter gene was associated with a 26% higher
      rate of attachment security relative to controls (OR = 3.86, p = 0.008, 95% CI
      [1.42, 10.51], d = 0.75), whereas there was a negligible (1%) difference in
      security between intervention and control group individuals carrying only the
      long allele (OR = 0.95, p = 0.89, 95% CI [0.45, 2.01], d = 0.03). Expressed in
      terms of absolute risk, for those with the short allele, the probability of
      secure attachment being observed in the intervention group was 84% (95% CI [73%, 
      95%]), compared to 58% (95% CI [43%, 72%]) in the control group. For those with
      two copies of the long allele, 70% (95% CI [59%, 81%]) were secure in the
      intervention group, compared to 71% (95% CI [60%, 82%]) of infants in the control
      group. Controlling for sex, maternal genotype, and indices of socioeconomic
      adversity (housing, employment, education, electricity, water) did not change
      these results. A limitation of this study is that we were only able to reenroll
      49% of the original sample randomized to the intervention and control conditions.
      Attribution of the primary outcome to causal effects of intervention in the
      present subsample should therefore be treated with caution. CONCLUSIONS: When
      infant genotype for serotonin transporter polymorphism was taken into account,
      the effect size of a maternal-infant attachment intervention targeting
      impoverished pregnant women increased more than 2.5-fold when only short allele
      carriers were considered (from d = 0.29 for all individuals irrespective of
      genotype to d = 0.75) and decreased 10-fold when only those carrying two copies
      of the long allele were considered (from d = 0.29 for all individuals to d =
      0.03). Genetic differential susceptibility means that averaging across all
      participants is a misleading index of efficacy. The study raises questions about 
      how policy-makers deal with the challenge of balancing equity (equal treatment
      for all) and efficacy (treating only those whose genes render them likely to
      benefit) when implementing psychosocial interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Estimated impact on birth weight of scaling up intermittent preventive treatment 
      of malaria in pregnancy given sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Africa: A 
      mathematical model.
PG  - e1002243
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002243 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission has declined substantially in the 21st century, 
      but pregnant women in areas of sustained transmission still require protection to
      prevent the adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes associated with malaria in
      pregnancy (MiP). A recent call to action has been issued to address the
      continuing low coverage of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in
      pregnancy (IPTp). This call has, however, been questioned by some, in part due to
      concerns about resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), the only drug
      currently recommended for IPTp. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using an existing
      mathematical model of MiP, we combined estimates of the changing endemicity of
      malaria across Africa with maps of SP resistance mutations and current coverage
      of antenatal access and IPTp with SP (IPTp-SP) across Africa. Using estimates of 
      the relationship between SP resistance mutations and the parasitological efficacy
      of SP during pregnancy, we estimated the varying impact of IPTp-SP across Africa 
      and the incremental value of enhancing IPTp-SP uptake to match current antenatal 
      care (ANC) coverage. The risks of MiP and malaria-attributable low birthweight
      (mLBW) in unprotected pregnancies (i.e., those not using insecticide-treated nets
      [ITNs]) leading to live births fell by 37% (33%-41% 95% credible interval [crI]) 
      and 31% (27%-34% 95% crI), respectively, from 2000 to 2015 across endemic areas
      in sub-Saharan Africa. However, these gains are fragile, and coverage is far from
      optimal. In 2015, 9.5 million (8.3 million-10.4 million 95% crI) of 30.6 million 
      pregnancies in these areas would still have been infected with Plasmodium
      falciparum without intervention, leading to 750,000 (390,000-1.1 million 95% crI)
      mLBW deliveries. In all, 6.6 million (5.6 million-7.3 million 95% crI) of these
      9.5 million (69.3%) pregnancies at risk of infection (and 53.4% [16.3
      million/30.6 million] of all pregnancies) occurred in settings with near-perfect 
      SP curative efficacy (>99%) based on the most recent estimates of resistance.
      Forty-four percent of these pregnancies (23% of all pregnancies) were not
      receiving any IPTp-SP despite making >/=3 ANC visits, representing 160,000
      (94,000-236,000 95% crI) preventable low birthweight (LBW) deliveries. Only 4%
      (1.4 million) of pregnancies occurred in settings with >10% prevalence of the
      sextuple haplotype associated with compromised SP effectiveness. Forty-two
      percent of all pregnancies occurred in settings where the quintuple dhfr/dhps
      haplotype had become established but where in vivo efficacy data suggest SP
      maintains the majority of its effectiveness in clearing infections. Not
      accounting for protection from the use of ITNs during pregnancy, expanding
      IPTp-SP to all women with >/=3 ANC visits in Africa could prevent an additional
      215,000 (128,000-318,000 95% crI) LBW deliveries. In 26 countries with sufficient
      recent data to estimate ITN impact (population-based ITN usage data that can be
      stratified by gravidity), we estimate that, due primarily to low ITN use by
      primigravidae, only 16.5% of the potential LBW births prevented by scaling up
      IPTp-SP would in fact have already have been prevented through ITN use. Our
      analysis also highlights the difficulties associated with estimating the
      relationship between the effectiveness of interventions against parasitological
      endpoints such as placental infection at delivery and health outcomes including
      birthweight, which is also determined by a wide range of unrelated factors. We
      also did not capture other aspects of malaria burden such as clinical malaria,
      maternal and neonatal anaemia, and miscarriage, all of which increase the overall
      importance of effective preventative strategies but have their own relationship
      with transmission intensity, parity, and SP resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
      recent declines in malaria transmission in Africa, the burden of MiP in the
      absence of adequate prevention remains substantial. Even accounting for SP
      resistance, extending IPTp-SP to all women attending ANC, as well as long-lasting
      insecticidal net distribution targeted towards first-time mothers, would have a
      sizeable impact upon maternal and infant health in almost all malaria-endemic
      settings in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Serelaxin as a potential treatment for renal dysfunction in cirrhosis:
      Preclinical evaluation and results of a randomized phase 2 trial.
PG  - e1002248
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002248 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic liver scarring from any cause leads to cirrhosis, portal
      hypertension, and a progressive decline in renal blood flow and renal function.
      Extreme renal vasoconstriction characterizes hepatorenal syndrome, a functional
      and potentially reversible form of acute kidney injury in patients with advanced 
      cirrhosis, but current therapy with systemic vasoconstrictors is ineffective in a
      substantial proportion of patients and is limited by ischemic adverse events.
      Serelaxin (recombinant human relaxin-2) is a peptide molecule with anti-fibrotic 
      and vasoprotective properties that binds to relaxin family peptide receptor-1
      (RXFP1) and has been shown to increase renal perfusion in healthy human
      volunteers. We hypothesized that serelaxin could ameliorate renal
      vasoconstriction and renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and portal
      hypertension. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To establish preclinical proof of concept, we
      developed two independent rat models of cirrhosis that were characterized by
      progressive reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and
      showed evidence of renal endothelial dysfunction. We then set out to further
      explore and validate our hypothesis in a phase 2 randomized open-label
      parallel-group study in male and female patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis
      and portal hypertension. Forty patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with
      serelaxin intravenous (i.v.) infusion (for 60 min at 80 mug/kg/d and then 60 min 
      at 30 mug/kg/d) or terlipressin (single 2-mg i.v. bolus), and the regional
      hemodynamic effects were quantified by phase contrast magnetic resonance
      angiography at baseline and after 120 min. The primary endpoint was the change
      from baseline in total renal artery blood flow. Therapeutic targeting of renal
      vasoconstriction with serelaxin in the rat models increased kidney perfusion,
      oxygenation, and function through reduction in renal vascular resistance,
      reversal of endothelial dysfunction, and increased activation of the AKT/eNOS/NO 
      signaling pathway in the kidney. In the randomized clinical study, infusion of
      serelaxin for 120 min increased total renal arterial blood flow by 65% (95% CI
      40%, 95%; p < 0.001) from baseline. Administration of serelaxin was safe and well
      tolerated, with no detrimental effect on systemic blood pressure or hepatic
      perfusion. The clinical study's main limitations were the relatively small sample
      size and stable, well-compensated population. CONCLUSIONS: Our mechanistic
      findings in rat models and exploratory study in human cirrhosis suggest the
      therapeutic potential of selective renal vasodilation using serelaxin as a new
      treatment for renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, although further validation in
      patients with more advanced cirrhosis and renal dysfunction is required. TRIAL

TI  - Delays and loss to follow-up before treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis
      following implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF in South Africa: A retrospective cohort
      study.
PG  - e1002238
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002238 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa has a large burden of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis 
      (RR-TB), with 18,734 patients diagnosed in 2014. The number of diagnosed patients
      has increased substantially with the introduction of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, used
      for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis for all patients with presumptive TB. Routine
      aggregate data suggest a large treatment gap (pre-treatment loss to follow-up)
      between the numbers of patients with laboratory-confirmed RR-TB and those
      reported to have started second-line treatment. We aimed to assess the impact of 
      Xpert MTB/RIF implementation on the delay to treatment initiation and loss to
      follow-up before second-line treatment for RR-TB across South Africa. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess
      second-line treatment initiation and treatment delay among laboratory-diagnosed
      RR-TB patients. Cohorts, including approximately 300 sequentially diagnosed RR-TB
      patients per South African province, were drawn from the years 2011 and 2013,
      i.e., before and after Xpert implementation. Patients with prior laboratory RR-TB
      diagnoses within 6 mo and currently treated patients were excluded. Treatment
      initiation was determined through data linkage with national and local treatment 
      registers, medical record review, interviews with health care staff, and direct
      contact with patients or household members. Additional laboratory data were used 
      to track cases. National estimates of the percentage of patients who initiated
      treatment and time to treatment were weighted to account for the sampling design.
      There were 2,508 and 2,528 eligible patients in the 2011 and 2013 cohorts,
      respectively; 92% were newly diagnosed with RR-TB (no prior RR-TB diagnoses).
      Nationally, among the 2,340 and 2,311 new RR-TB patients in the 2011 and 2013
      cohorts, 55% (95% CI 53%-57%) and 63% (95% CI 61%-65%), respectively, started
      treatment within 6 mo of laboratory receipt of their diagnostic specimen (p <
      0.001). However, in 2013, there was no difference in the percentage of patients
      who initiated treatment at 6 mo between the 1,368 new RR-TB patients diagnosed by
      Xpert (62%, 95% CI 59%-65%) and the 943 diagnosed by other methods (64%, 95% CI
      61%-67%) (p = 0.39). The median time to treatment decreased from 44 d
      (interquartile range [IQR] 20-69) in 2011 to 22 d (IQR 2-43) in 2013 (p < 0.001).
      In 2013, across the nine provinces, there were substantial variations in both
      treatment initiation (range 51%-73% by 6 mo) and median time to treatment (range 
      15-36 d, n = 1,450), and only 53% of the 1,448 new RR-TB patients who received
      treatment were recorded in the national RR-TB register. This retrospective study 
      is limited by the lack of information to assess reasons for non-initiation of
      treatment, particularly pre-treatment mortality data. Other limitations include
      the use of names and dates of birth to locate patient-level data, potentially
      resulting in missed treatment initiation among some patients. CONCLUSIONS: In
      2013, there was a large treatment gap for RR-TB in South Africa that varied
      significantly across provinces. Xpert implementation, while reducing treatment
      delay, had not contributed substantially to reducing the treatment gap in 2013.
      However, given improved case detection with Xpert, a larger proportion of RR-TB
      patients overall have received treatment, with reduced delays. Nonetheless,
      strategies to further improve linkage to treatment for all diagnosed RR-TB
      patients are urgently required.

TI  - Housing Improvements and Malaria Risk in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Multi-Country
      Analysis of Survey Data.
PG  - e1002234
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvements to housing may contribute to malaria control and
      elimination by reducing house entry by malaria vectors and thus exposure to
      biting. We tested the hypothesis that the odds of malaria infection are lower in 
      modern, improved housing compared to traditional housing in sub-Saharan Africa
      (SSA). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed 15 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) 
      and 14 Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) conducted in 21 countries in SSA between
      2008 and 2015 that measured malaria infection by microscopy or rapid diagnostic
      test (RDT). DHS/MIS surveys record whether houses are built with finished
      materials (e.g., metal) or rudimentary materials (e.g., thatch). This information
      was used to develop a binary housing quality variable where houses built using
      finished wall, roof, and floor materials were classified as "modern", and all
      other houses were classified as "traditional". Conditional logistic regression
      was used to determine the association between housing quality and prevalence of
      malaria infection in children aged 0-5 y, adjusting for age, gender,
      insecticide-treated net (ITN) use, indoor residual spraying, household wealth,
      and geographic cluster. Individual survey odds ratios (ORs) were combined to
      determine a summary OR using a random effects meta-analysis. Of 284,532 total
      children surveyed, 139,318 were tested for malaria infection using microscopy (n 
      = 131,652) or RDT (n = 138,540). Within individual surveys, malaria prevalence
      measured by microscopy ranged from 0.4% (Madagascar 2011) to 45.5% (Burkina Faso 
      2010) among children living in modern houses and from 0.4% (The Gambia 2013) to
      70.6% (Burkina Faso 2010) in traditional houses, and malaria prevalence measured 
      by RDT ranged from 0.3% (Senegal 2013-2014) to 61.2% (Burkina Faso 2010) in
      modern houses and from 1.5% (The Gambia 2013) to 79.8% (Burkina Faso 2010) in
      traditional houses. Across all surveys, modern housing was associated with a 9%
      to 14% reduction in the odds of malaria infection (microscopy: adjusted OR 0.91, 
      95% CI 0.85-0.97, p = 0.003; RDT: adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.92, p < 0.001).
      This association was consistent regardless of ITN usage. As a comparison, the
      odds of malaria infection were 15% to 16% lower among ITN users versus non-users 
      (microscopy: adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.90, p < 0.001; RDT: adjusted OR
      0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90, p < 0.001). The main limitation of this study is that
      residual confounding by household wealth of the observed association between
      housing quality and malaria prevalence is possible, since the wealth index may
      not have fully captured differences in socioeconomic position; however, the use
      of multiple national surveys offers the advantage of a large sample size and the 
      elimination of many biases typically associated with pooling observational data. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Housing quality is an important risk factor for malaria infection
      across the spectrum of malaria endemicity in SSA, with a strength of association 
      between housing quality and malaria similar to that observed between ITN use and 
      malaria. Improved housing should be considered a promising intervention for
      malaria control and elimination and long-term prevention of reintroduction.

TI  - Taxes and Subsidies for Improving Diet and Population Health in Australia: A
      Cost-Effectiveness Modelling Study.
PG  - e1002232
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of countries are implementing taxes on unhealthy
      foods and drinks to address the growing burden of dietary-related disease, but
      the cost-effectiveness of combining taxes on unhealthy foods and subsidies on
      healthy foods is not well understood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a population
      model of dietary-related diseases and health care costs and food price
      elasticities, we simulated the effect of taxes on saturated fat, salt, sugar, and
      sugar-sweetened beverages and a subsidy on fruits and vegetables, over the
      lifetime of the Australian population. The sizes of the taxes and subsidy were
      set such that, when combined as a package, there would be a negligible effect on 
      average weekly expenditure on food (<1% change). We evaluated the
      cost-effectiveness of the interventions individually, then determined the optimal
      combination based on maximising net monetary benefit at a threshold of AU$50,000 
      per disability-adjusted life year (DALY). The simulations suggested that the
      combination of taxes and subsidy might avert as many as 470,000 DALYs (95%
      uncertainty interval [UI]: 420,000 to 510,000) in the Australian population of 22
      million, with a net cost-saving of AU$3.4 billion (95% UI: AU$2.4 billion to
      AU$4.6 billion; US$2.3 billion) to the health sector. Of the taxes evaluated, the
      sugar tax produced the biggest estimates of health gain (270,000 [95% UI: 250,000
      to 290,000] DALYs averted), followed by the salt tax (130,000 [95% UI: 120,000 to
      140,000] DALYs), the saturated fat tax (97,000 [95% UI: 77,000 to 120,000]
      DALYs), and the sugar-sweetened beverage tax (12,000 [95% UI: 2,100 to 21,000]
      DALYs). The fruit and vegetable subsidy (-13,000 [95% UI: -44,000 to 18,000]
      DALYs) was a cost-effective addition to the package of taxes. However, it did not
      necessarily lead to a net health benefit for the population when modelled as an
      intervention on its own, because of the possible adverse cross-price elasticity
      effects on consumption of other foods (e.g., foods high in saturated fat and
      salt). The study suggests that taxes and subsidies on foods and beverages can
      potentially be combined to achieve substantial improvements in population health 
      and cost-savings to the health sector. However, the magnitude of health benefits 
      is sensitive to measures of price elasticity, and further work is needed to
      incorporate potential benefits or harms associated with changes in other foods
      and nutrients that are not currently modelled, such as red and processed meats
      and fibre. CONCLUSIONS: With potentially large health benefits for the Australian
      population and large benefits in reducing health sector spending on the treatment
      of non-communicable diseases, the formulation of a tax and subsidy package should
      be given a more prominent role in Australia's public health nutrition strategy.

      Service.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single gene tests to predict whether cancers respond to specific
      targeted therapies are performed increasingly often. Advances in sequencing
      technology, collectively referred to as next generation sequencing (NGS), mean
      the entire cancer genome or parts of it can now be sequenced at speed with
      increased depth and sensitivity. However, translation of NGS into routine cancer 
      care has been slow. Healthcare stakeholders are unclear about the clinical
      utility of NGS and are concerned it could be an expensive addition to cancer
      diagnostics, rather than an affordable alternative to single gene testing.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We validated a 46-gene hotspot cancer panel assay allowing 
      multiple gene testing from small diagnostic biopsies. From 1 January 2013 to 31
      December 2013, solid tumour samples (including non-small-cell lung carcinoma
      [NSCLC], colorectal carcinoma, and melanoma) were sequenced in the context of the
      UK National Health Service from 351 consecutively submitted prospective cases for
      which treating clinicians thought the patient had potential to benefit from more 
      extensive genetic analysis. Following histological assessment, tumour-rich
      regions of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections underwent
      macrodissection, DNA extraction, NGS, and analysis using a pipeline centred on
      Torrent Suite software. With a median turnaround time of seven working days, an
      integrated clinical report was produced indicating the variants detected,
      including those with potential diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, or clinical
      trial entry implications. Accompanying phenotypic data were collected, and a
      detailed cost analysis of the panel compared with single gene testing was
      undertaken to assess affordability for routine patient care. Panel sequencing was
      successful for 97% (342/351) of tumour samples in the prospective cohort and
      showed 100% concordance with known mutations (detected using cobas assays). At
      least one mutation was identified in 87% (296/342) of tumours. A locally
      actionable mutation (i.e., available targeted treatment or clinical trial) was
      identified in 122/351 patients (35%). Forty patients received targeted treatment,
      in 22/40 (55%) cases solely due to use of the panel. Examination of published
      data on the potential efficacy of targeted therapies showed theoretically
      actionable mutations (i.e., mutations for which targeted treatment was
      potentially appropriate) in 66% (71/107) and 39% (41/105) of melanoma and NSCLC
      patients, respectively. At a cost of pound339 (US$449) per patient, the panel was
      less expensive locally than performing more than two or three single gene tests. 
      Study limitations include the use of FFPE samples, which do not always provide
      high-quality DNA, and the use of "real world" data: submission of cases for
      sequencing did not always follow clinical guidelines, meaning that when mutations
      were detected, patients were not always eligible for targeted treatments on
      clinical grounds. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that more extensive tumour
      sequencing can identify mutations that could improve clinical decision-making in 
      routine cancer care, potentially improving patient outcomes, at an affordable
      level for healthcare providers.

TI  - Performance and Cost-Effectiveness of Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening
      Scenarios in a Population-Based Setting: A Microsimulation Modeling Analysis in
      Ontario, Canada.
PG  - e1002225
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) results indicate that
      computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening for current and former smokers
      with three annual screens can be cost-effective in a trial setting. However, the 
      cost-effectiveness in a population-based setting with >3 screening rounds is
      uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the
      cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening in a population-based setting in
      Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the effects of screening eligibility criteria.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study used microsimulation modeling informed by
      various data sources, including the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), Ontario
      Cancer Registry, smoking behavior surveys, and the NLST. Persons, born between
      1940 and 1969, were examined from a third-party health care payer perspective
      across a lifetime horizon. Starting in 2015, 576 CT screening scenarios were
      examined, varying by age to start and end screening, smoking eligibility
      criteria, and screening interval. Among the examined outcome measures were lung
      cancer deaths averted, life-years gained, percentage ever screened, costs (in
      2015 Canadian dollars), and overdiagnosis. The results of the base-case analysis 
      indicated that annual screening was more cost-effective than biennial screening. 
      Scenarios with eligibility criteria that required as few as 20 pack-years were
      dominated by scenarios that required higher numbers of accumulated pack-years. In
      general, scenarios that applied stringent smoking eligibility criteria (i.e.,
      requiring higher levels of accumulated smoking exposure) were more cost-effective
      than scenarios with less stringent smoking eligibility criteria, with modest
      differences in life-years gained. Annual screening between ages 55-75 for persons
      who smoked >/=40 pack-years and who currently smoke or quit </=10 y ago yielded
      an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $41,136 Canadian dollars ($33,825 in
      May 1, 2015, United States dollars) per life-year gained (compared to annual
      screening between ages 60-75 for persons who smoked >/=40 pack-years and who
      currently smoke or quit </=10 y ago), which was considered optimal at a
      cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 Canadian dollars ($41,114 May 1, 2015, US
      dollars). If 50% lower or higher attributable costs were assumed, the incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was estimated to be $38,240 ($31,444
      May 1, 2015, US dollars) or $48,525 ($39,901 May 1, 2015, US dollars),
      respectively. If 50% lower or higher costs for CT examinations were assumed, the 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was estimated to be $28,630
      ($23,542 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or $73,507 ($60,443 May 1, 2015, US dollars),
      respectively. This scenario would screen 9.56% (499,261 individuals) of the total
      population (ever- and never-smokers) at least once, which would require 4,788,523
      CT examinations, and reduce lung cancer mortality in the total population by
      9.05% (preventing 13,108 lung cancer deaths), while 12.53% of screen-detected
      cancers would be overdiagnosed (4,282 overdiagnosed cases). Sensitivity analyses 
      indicated that the overall results were most sensitive to variations in CT
      examination costs. Quality of life was not incorporated in the analyses, and
      assumptions for follow-up procedures were based on data from the NLST, which may 
      not be generalizable to a population-based setting. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer
      screening with stringent smoking eligibility criteria can be cost-effective in a 
      population-based setting.

TI  - Haemolysis in G6PD Heterozygous Females Treated with Primaquine for Plasmodium
      vivax Malaria: A Nested Cohort in a Trial of Radical Curative Regimens.
PG  - e1002224
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria with 8-aminoquinolines
      (primaquine or tafenoquine) is complicated by haemolysis in individuals with
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD heterozygous females,
      because of individual variation in the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation
      (Lyonisation) in erythroid cells, may have low G6PD activity in the majority of
      their erythrocytes, yet are usually reported as G6PD "normal" by current
      phenotypic screening tests. Their haemolytic risk when treated with
      8-aminoquinolines has not been well characterized. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a
      cohort study nested within a randomised clinical trial that compared different
      treatment regimens for P. vivax malaria, patients with a normal standard NADPH
      fluorescent spot test result ( greater, similar30%-40% of normal G6PD activity)
      were randomised to receive 3 d of chloroquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      in combination with primaquine, either the standard high dose of 0.5 mg
      base/kg/day for 14 d or a higher dose of 1 mg base/kg/d for 7 d. Patterns of
      haemolysis were compared between G6PD wild-type and G6PD heterozygous female
      participants. Between 21 February 2012 and 04 July 2014, 241 female participants 
      were enrolled, of whom 34 were heterozygous for the G6PD Mahidol variant.
      Haemolysis was substantially greater and a larger proportion of participants
      reached the threshold of clinically significant haemolysis (fractional
      haematocrit reduction >25%) in G6PD heterozygotes taking the higher (7 d)
      primaquine dose (9/17 [53%]) compared with G6PD heterozygotes taking the standard
      high (14 d) dose (2/16 [13%]; p = 0.022). In heterozygotes, the mean fractional
      haematocrit reductions were correspondingly greater with the higher primaquine
      dose (7-d regimen): -20.4% (95% CI -26.0% to -14.8%) (nadir on day 5) compared
      with the standard high (14 d) dose: -13.1% (95% CI -17.6% to -8.6%) (nadir day
      6). Two heterozygotes taking the higher (7 d) primaquine dose required blood
      transfusion. In wild-type participants, mean haematocrit reductions were
      clinically insignificant and similar with both doses: -5.8 (95% CI -7.2% to
      -4.4%) (nadir day 3) compared with -5.5% (95% CI -7.4% to -3.7%) (nadir day 4),
      respectively. Limitations to this nested cohort study are that the primary
      objective of the trial was designed to measure efficacy and not haemolysis in
      relation to G6PD genotype and that the heterozygote groups were small.
      CONCLUSION: Higher daily doses of primaquine have the potential to cause
      clinically significant haemolysis in G6PD heterozygous females who are reported
      as phenotypically normal with current point of care tests. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01640574.

TI  - Customised and Noncustomised Birth Weight Centiles and Prediction of Stillbirth
      and Infant Mortality and Morbidity: A Cohort Study of 979,912 Term Singleton
      Pregnancies in Scotland.
PG  - e1002228
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002228 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence to support the use of customised centile
      charts to identify those at risk of stillbirth and infant death at term. We
      sought to determine birth weight thresholds at which mortality and morbidity
      increased and the predictive ability of noncustomised (accounting for gestational
      age and sex) and partially customised centiles (additionally accounting for
      maternal height and parity) to identify fetuses at risk. METHODS: This is a
      population-based linkage study of 979,912 term singleton pregnancies in Scotland,
      United Kingdom, between 1992 and 2010. The main exposures were noncustomised and 
      partially customised birth weight centiles. The primary outcomes were infant
      death, stillbirth, overall mortality (infant and stillbirth), Apgar score <7 at 5
      min, and admission to the neonatal unit. Optimal thresholds that predicted
      outcomes for both non- and partially customised birth weight centiles were
      calculated. Prediction of mortality between non- and partially customised birth
      weight centiles was compared using area under the receiver operator
      characteristic curve (AUROC) and net reclassification index (NRI). FINDINGS:
      Birth weight </=25th centile was associated with higher risk for all mortality
      and morbidity outcomes. For stillbirth, low Apgar score, and neonatal unit
      admission, risk also increased from the 85th centile. Similar patterns and
      magnitude of associations were observed for both non- and partially customised
      birth weight centiles. Partially customised birth weight centiles did not improve
      the discrimination of mortality (AUROC 0.61 [95%CI 0.60, 0.62]) compared with
      noncustomised birth weight centiles (AUROC 0.62 [95%CI 0.60, 0.63]) and slightly 
      underperformed in reclassifying pregnancies to different risk categories for both
      fatal and non-fatal adverse outcomes (NRI -0.027 [95% CI -0.039, -0.016], p <
      0.001). We were unable to fully customise centile charts because we lacked data
      on maternal weight and ethnicity. Additional analyses in an independent UK cohort
      (n = 10,515) suggested that lack of data on ethnicity in this population (in
      which national statistics show 98% are white British) and maternal weight would
      have misclassified ~15% of the large-for-gestation fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: At term,
      birth weight remains strongly associated with the risk of stillbirth and infant
      death and neonatal morbidity. Partial customisation does not improve prediction
      performance. Consideration of early term delivery or closer surveillance for
      those with a predicted birth weight </=25th or >/=85th centile may reduce adverse
      outcomes. Replication of the analysis with fully customised centiles accounting
      for ethnicity is warranted.

TI  - Master Regulators of Oncogenic KRAS Response in Pancreatic Cancer: An Integrative
      Network Biology Analysis.
PG  - e1002223
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: KRAS is the most frequently mutated gene in pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response
      to oncogenic KRAS are still not fully understood. We aimed to uncover
      transcription factors that regulate the transcriptional response of oncogenic
      KRAS in pancreatic cancer and to understand their clinical relevance. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We applied a well-established network biology approach (master
      regulator analysis) to combine a transcriptional signature for oncogenic KRAS
      derived from a murine isogenic cell line with a coexpression network derived by
      integrating 560 human pancreatic cancer cases across seven studies. The datasets 
      included the ICGC cohort (n = 242), the TCGA cohort (n = 178), and five smaller
      studies (n = 17, 25, 26, 36, and 36). 55 transcription factors were coexpressed
      with a significant number of genes in the transcriptional signature (gene set
      enrichment analysis [GSEA] p < 0.01). Community detection in the coexpression
      network identified 27 of the 55 transcription factors contributing to three major
      biological processes: Notch pathway, down-regulated Hedgehog/Wnt pathway, and
      cell cycle. The activities of these processes define three distinct subtypes of
      PDAC, which demonstrate differences in survival and mutational load as well as
      stromal and immune cell composition. The Hedgehog subgroup showed worst survival 
      (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.72, coxPH test p = 0.018) and the Notch
      subgroup the best (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93, coxPH test p = 0.019).
      The cell cycle subtype showed highest mutational burden (ANOVA p < 0.01) and the 
      smallest amount of stromal admixture (ANOVA p < 2.2e-16). This study is limited
      by the information provided in published datasets, not all of which provide
      mutational profiles, survival data, or the specifics of treatment history.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results characterize the regulatory mechanisms underlying the
      transcriptional response to oncogenic KRAS and provide a framework to develop
      strategies for specific subtypes of this disease using current therapeutics and
      by identifying targets for new groups.

TI  - The World Health Organization Fetal Growth Charts: A Multinational Longitudinal
      Study of Ultrasound Biometric Measurements and Estimated Fetal Weight.
PG  - e1002220
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal mortality and morbidity continue to be major global health 
      challenges strongly associated with prematurity and reduced fetal growth, an
      issue of further interest given the mounting evidence that fetal growth in
      general is linked to degrees of risk of common noncommunicable diseases in
      adulthood. Against this background, WHO made it a high priority to provide the
      present fetal growth charts for estimated fetal weight (EFW) and common
      ultrasound biometric measurements intended for worldwide use. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We conducted a multinational prospective observational longitudinal
      study of fetal growth in low-risk singleton pregnancies of women of high or
      middle socioeconomic status and without known environmental constraints on fetal 
      growth. Centers in ten countries (Argentina, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the
      Congo, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Norway, and Thailand) recruited
      participants who had reliable information on last menstrual period and
      gestational age confirmed by crown-rump length measured at 8-13 wk of gestation. 
      Participants had anthropometric and nutritional assessments and seven scheduled
      ultrasound examinations during pregnancy. Fifty-two participants withdrew
      consent, and 1,387 participated in the study. At study entry, median maternal age
      was 28 y (interquartile range [IQR] 25-31), median height was 162 cm (IQR
      157-168), median weight was 61 kg (IQR 55-68), 58% of the women were nulliparous,
      and median daily caloric intake was 1,840 cal (IQR 1,487-2,222). The median
      pregnancy duration was 39 wk (IQR 38-40) although there were significant
      differences between countries, the largest difference being 12 d (95% CI 8-16).
      The median birthweight was 3,300 g (IQR 2,980-3,615). There were differences in
      birthweight between countries, e.g., India had significantly smaller neonates
      than the other countries, even after adjusting for gestational age. Thirty-one
      women had a miscarriage, and three fetuses had intrauterine death. The 8,203 sets
      of ultrasound measurements were scrutinized for outliers and leverage points, and
      those measurements taken at 14 to 40 wk were selected for analysis. A total of
      7,924 sets of ultrasound measurements were analyzed by quantile regression to
      establish longitudinal reference intervals for fetal head circumference,
      biparietal diameter, humerus length, abdominal circumference, femur length and
      its ratio with head circumference and with biparietal diameter, and EFW. There
      was asymmetric distribution of growth of EFW: a slightly wider distribution among
      the lower percentiles during early weeks shifted to a notably expanded
      distribution of the higher percentiles in late pregnancy. Male fetuses were
      larger than female fetuses as measured by EFW, but the disparity was smaller in
      the lower quantiles of the distribution (3.5%) and larger in the upper quantiles 
      (4.5%). Maternal age and maternal height were associated with a positive effect
      on EFW, particularly in the lower tail of the distribution, of the order of 2% to
      3% for each additional 10 y of age of the mother and 1% to 2% for each additional
      10 cm of height. Maternal weight was associated with a small positive effect on
      EFW, especially in the higher tail of the distribution, of the order of 1.0% to
      1.5% for each additional 10 kg of bodyweight of the mother. Parous women had
      heavier fetuses than nulliparous women, with the disparity being greater in the
      lower quantiles of the distribution, of the order of 1% to 1.5%, and diminishing 
      in the upper quantiles. There were also significant differences in growth of EFW 
      between countries. In spite of the multinational nature of the study, sample size
      is a limiting factor for generalization of the charts. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      provides WHO fetal growth charts for EFW and common ultrasound biometric
      measurements, and shows variation between different parts of the world.

TI  - Using Genetic Variation to Explore the Causal Effect of Maternal Pregnancy
      Adiposity on Future Offspring Adiposity: A Mendelian Randomisation Study.
PG  - e1002221
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that greater maternal adiposity during
      pregnancy affects lifelong risk of offspring fatness via intrauterine mechanisms.
      Our aim was to use Mendelian randomisation (MR) to investigate the causal effect 
      of intrauterine exposure to greater maternal body mass index (BMI) on offspring
      BMI and fat mass from childhood to early adulthood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used
      maternal genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to test the causal
      effect of maternal BMI in pregnancy on offspring fatness (BMI and dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] determined fat mass index [FMI]) in a MR approach.
      This was investigated, with repeat measurements, from ages 7 to 18 in the Avon
      Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n = 2,521 to 3,720 for
      different ages). We then sought to replicate findings with results for BMI at age
      6 in Generation R (n = 2,337 for replication sample; n = 6,057 for total pooled
      sample). In confounder-adjusted multivariable regression in ALSPAC, a 1 standard 
      deviation (SD, equivalent of 3.7 kg/m2) increase in maternal BMI was associated
      with a 0.25 SD (95% CI 0.21-0.29) increase in offspring BMI at age 7, with
      similar results at later ages and when FMI was used as the outcome. A weighted
      genetic risk score was generated from 32 genetic variants robustly associated
      with BMI (minimum F-statistic = 45 in ALSPAC). The MR results using this genetic 
      risk score as an IV in ALSPAC were close to the null at all ages (e.g., 0.04 SD
      (95% CI -0.21-0.30) at age 7 and 0.03 SD (95% CI -0.26-0.32) at age 18 per SD
      increase in maternal BMI), which was similar when a 97 variant generic risk score
      was used in ALSPAC. When findings from age 7 in ALSPAC were meta-analysed with
      those from age 6 in Generation R, the pooled confounder-adjusted multivariable
      regression association was 0.22 SD (95% CI 0.19-0.25) per SD increase in maternal
      BMI and the pooled MR effect (pooling the 97 variant score results from ALSPAC
      with the 32 variant score results from Generation R) was 0.05 SD (95%CI
      -0.11-0.21) per SD increase in maternal BMI (p-value for difference between the
      two results = 0.05). A number of sensitivity analyses exploring violation of the 
      MR results supported our main findings. However, power was limited for some of
      the sensitivity tests and further studies with relevant data on maternal,
      offspring, and paternal genotype are required to obtain more precise (and
      unbiased) causal estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide little evidence to 
      support a strong causal intrauterine effect of incrementally greater maternal BMI
      resulting in greater offspring adiposity.

TI  - Evaluating Hospital-Based Surveillance for Outbreak Detection in Bangladesh:
      Analysis of Healthcare Utilization Data.
PG  - e1002218
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002218 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Health Regulations outline core requirements to
      ensure the detection of public health threats of international concern. Assessing
      the capacity of surveillance systems to detect these threats is crucial for
      evaluating a country's ability to meet these requirements. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      We propose a framework to evaluate the sensitivity and representativeness of
      hospital-based surveillance and apply it to severe neurological infectious
      diseases and fatal respiratory infectious diseases in Bangladesh. We identified
      cases in selected communities within surveillance hospital catchment areas using 
      key informant and house-to-house surveys and ascertained where cases had sought
      care. We estimated the probability of surveillance detecting different sized
      outbreaks by distance from the surveillance hospital and compared characteristics
      of cases identified in the community and cases attending surveillance hospitals. 
      We estimated that surveillance detected 26% (95% CI 18%-33%) of severe
      neurological disease cases and 18% (95% CI 16%-21%) of fatal respiratory disease 
      cases residing at 10 km distance from a surveillance hospital. Detection
      probabilities decreased markedly with distance. The probability of detecting
      small outbreaks (three cases) dropped below 50% at distances greater than 26 km
      for severe neurological disease and at distances greater than 7 km for fatal
      respiratory disease. Characteristics of cases attending surveillance hospitals
      were largely representative of all cases; however, neurological disease cases
      aged <5 y or from the lowest socioeconomic group and fatal respiratory disease
      cases aged >/=60 y were underrepresented. Our estimates of outbreak detection
      rely on suspected cases that attend a surveillance hospital receiving laboratory 
      confirmation of disease and being reported to the surveillance system. The extent
      to which this occurs will depend on disease characteristics (e.g., severity and
      symptom specificity) and surveillance resources. CONCLUSION: We present a new
      approach to evaluating the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based
      surveillance, making it possible to predict its ability to detect emerging
      threats.

TI  - Association of Body Mass Index with DNA Methylation and Gene Expression in Blood 
      Cells and Relations to Cardiometabolic Disease: A Mendelian Randomization
      Approach.
PG  - e1002215
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The link between DNA methylation, obesity, and adiposity-related
      diseases in the general population remains uncertain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      conducted an association study of body mass index (BMI) and differential
      methylation for over 400,000 CpGs assayed by microarray in whole-blood-derived
      DNA from 3,743 participants in the Framingham Heart Study and the Lothian Birth
      Cohorts, with independent replication in three external cohorts of 4,055
      participants. We examined variations in whole blood gene expression and conducted
      Mendelian randomization analyses to investigate the functional and clinical
      relevance of the findings. We identified novel and previously reported
      BMI-related differential methylation at 83 CpGs that replicated across cohorts;
      BMI-related differential methylation was associated with concurrent changes in
      the expression of genes in lipid metabolism pathways. Genetic instrumental
      variable analysis of alterations in methylation at one of the 83 replicated CpGs,
      cg11024682 (intronic to sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 
      [SREBF1]), demonstrated links to BMI, adiposity-related traits, and coronary
      artery disease. Independent genetic instruments for expression of SREBF1
      supported the findings linking methylation to adiposity and cardiometabolic
      disease. Methylation at a substantial proportion (16 of 83) of the identified
      loci was found to be secondary to differences in BMI. However, the
      cross-sectional nature of the data limits definitive causal determination.
      CONCLUSIONS: We present robust associations of BMI with differential DNA
      methylation at numerous loci in blood cells. BMI-related DNA methylation and gene
      expression provide mechanistic insights into the relationship between DNA
      methylation, obesity, and adiposity-related diseases.

TI  - Mosquito-Disseminated Insecticide for Citywide Vector Control and Its Potential
      to Block Arbovirus Epidemics: Entomological Observations and Modeling Results
      from Amazonian Brazil.
PG  - e1002213
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002213 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne viruses threaten public health worldwide. When the
      ratio of competent vectors to susceptible humans is low enough, the virus's basic
      reproductive number (R0) falls below 1.0 (each case generating, on average, <1.0 
      additional case) and the infection fades out from the population. Conventional
      mosquito control tactics, however, seldom yield R0 < 1.0. A promising alternative
      uses mosquitoes to disseminate a potent growth-regulator larvicide, pyriproxyfen 
      (PPF), to aquatic larval habitats; this kills most mosquito juveniles and
      substantially reduces adult mosquito emergence. We tested mosquito-disseminated
      PPF in Manacapuru, a 60,000-inhabitant city (~650 ha) in Amazonian Brazil.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We sampled juvenile mosquitoes monthly in 100 dwellings
      over four periods in February 2014-January 2016: 12 baseline months, 5 mo of
      citywide PPF dissemination, 3 mo of focal PPF dissemination around Aedes-infested
      dwellings, and 3 mo after dissemination ended. We caught 19,434 juvenile
      mosquitoes (66% Aedes albopictus, 28% Ae. aegypti) in 8,271 trap-months. Using
      generalized linear mixed models, we estimated intervention effects on juvenile
      catch and adult emergence while adjusting for dwelling-level clustering, unequal 
      sampling effort, and weather-related confounders. Following PPF dissemination,
      Aedes juvenile catch decreased by 79%-92% and juvenile mortality increased from
      2%-7% to 80%-90%. Mean adult Aedes emergence fell from 1,077 per month (range
      653-1,635) at baseline to 50.4 per month during PPF dissemination (range 2-117). 
      Female Aedes emergence dropped by 96%-98%, such that the number of females
      emerging per person decreased to 0.06 females per person-month (range
      0.002-0.129). Deterministic models predict, under plausible
      biological-epidemiological scenarios, that the R0 of typical Aedes-borne viruses 
      would fall from 3-45 at baseline to 0.004-0.06 during PPF dissemination. The main
      limitations of our study were that it was a before-after trial lacking truly
      independent replicates and that we did not measure mosquito-borne virus
      transmission empirically. CONCLUSIONS: Mosquito-disseminated PPF has potential to
      block mosquito-borne virus transmission citywide, even under adverse scenarios.
      Our results signal new avenues for mosquito-borne disease prevention, likely
      including the effective control of Aedes-borne dengue, Zika, and chikungunya
      epidemics. Cluster-randomized controlled trials will help determine whether
      mosquito-disseminated PPF can, as our findings suggest, develop into a major tool
      for improving global public health.

TI  - Patient Safety Incidents Involving Sick Children in Primary Care in England and
      Wales: A Mixed Methods Analysis.
PG  - e1002217
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The UK performs poorly relative to other economically developed
      countries on numerous indicators of care quality for children. The contribution
      of iatrogenic harm to these outcomes is unclear. As primary care is the first
      point of healthcare contact for most children, we sought to investigate the
      safety of care provided to children in this setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      undertook a mixed methods investigation of reports of primary care patient safety
      incidents involving sick children from England and Wales' National Reporting and 
      Learning System between 1 January 2005 and 1 December 2013. Two reviewers
      independently selected relevant incident reports meeting prespecified criteria,
      and then descriptively analyzed these reports to identify the most frequent and
      harmful incident types. This was followed by an in-depth thematic analysis of a
      purposive sample of reports to understand the reasons underpinning incidents. Key
      candidate areas for strengthening primary care provision and reducing the risks
      of systems failures were then identified through multidisciplinary discussions.
      Of 2,191 safety incidents identified from 2,178 reports, 30% (n = 658) were
      harmful, including 12 deaths and 41 cases of severe harm. The children involved
      in these incidents had respiratory conditions (n = 387; 18%), injuries (n = 289; 
      13%), nonspecific signs and symptoms, e.g., fever (n = 281; 13%), and
      gastrointestinal or genitourinary conditions (n = 268; 12%), among others.
      Priority areas for improvement included safer systems for medication provision in
      community pharmacies; triage processes to enable effective and timely assessment,
      diagnosis, and referral of acutely sick children attending out-of-hours services;
      and enhanced communication for robust safety netting between professionals and
      parents. The main limitations of this study result from underreporting of safety 
      incidents and variable data quality. Our findings therefore require further
      exploration in longitudinal studies utilizing case review methods. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study highlights opportunities to reduce iatrogenic harm and avoidable child
      deaths. Globally, healthcare systems with primary-care-led models of delivery
      must now examine their existing practices to determine the prevalence and burden 
      of these priority safety issues, and utilize improvement methods to achieve
      sustainable improvements in care quality.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetic Properties of Piperaquine in Falciparum Malaria: An
      Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e1002212
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of
      the current treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but ACT
      resistance is spreading across Southeast Asia. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is 
      one of the five ACTs currently recommended by the World Health Organization.
      Previous studies suggest that young children (<5 y) with malaria are under-dosed.
      This study utilised a population-based pharmacokinetic approach to optimise the
      antimalarial treatment regimen for piperaquine. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Published
      pharmacokinetic studies on piperaquine were identified through a systematic
      literature review of articles published between 1 January 1960 and 15 February
      2013. Individual plasma piperaquine concentration-time data from 11 clinical
      studies (8,776 samples from 728 individuals) in adults and children with
      uncomplicated malaria and healthy volunteers were collated and standardised by
      the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network. Data were pooled and analysed
      using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Piperaquine pharmacokinetics were
      described successfully by a three-compartment disposition model with flexible
      absorption. Body weight influenced clearance and volume parameters significantly,
      resulting in lower piperaquine exposures in small children (<25 kg) compared to
      larger children and adults (>/=25 kg) after administration of the manufacturers' 
      currently recommended dose regimens. Simulated median (interquartile range) day 7
      plasma concentration was 29.4 (19.3-44.3) ng/ml in small children compared to
      38.1 (25.8-56.3) ng/ml in larger children and adults, with the recommended dose
      regimen. The final model identified a mean (95% confidence interval) increase of 
      23.7% (15.8%-32.5%) in piperaquine bioavailability between each piperaquine dose 
      occasion. The model also described an enzyme maturation function in very young
      children, resulting in 50% maturation at 0.575 (0.413-0.711) y of age. An
      evidence-based optimised dose regimen was constructed that would provide
      piperaquine exposures across all ages comparable to the exposure currently seen
      in a typical adult with standard treatment, without exceeding the concentration
      range observed with the manufacturers' recommended regimen. Limited data were
      available in infants and pregnant women with malaria as well as in healthy
      individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The derived population pharmacokinetic model was used
      to develop a revised dose regimen of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine that is
      expected to provide equivalent piperaquine exposures safely in all patients,
      including in small children with malaria. Use of this dose regimen is expected to
      prolong the useful therapeutic life of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine by
      increasing cure rates and thereby slowing resistance development. This work was
      part of the evidence that informed the World Health Organization technical
      guidelines development group in the development of the recently published
      treatment guidelines (2015).

TI  - Socioeconomic Inequalities in Body Mass Index across Adulthood: Coordinated
      Analyses of Individual Participant Data from Three British Birth Cohort Studies
      Initiated in 1946, 1958 and 1970.
PG  - e1002214
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High body mass index (BMI) is an important contributor to the global 
      burden of ill-health and health inequality. Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) in
      both childhood and adulthood is associated with higher adult BMI, but how these
      associations have changed across time is poorly understood. We used longitudinal 
      data to examine how childhood and adult SEP relates to BMI across adulthood in
      three national British birth cohorts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The sample comprised 
      up to 22,810 participants with 77,115 BMI observations in the 1946 MRC National
      Survey of Health and Development (ages 20 to 60-64), the 1958 National Child
      Development Study (ages 23 to 50), and the 1970 British Cohort Study (ages 26 to 
      42). Harmonized social class-based SEP data (Registrar General's Social Class)
      was ascertained in childhood (father's class at 10/11 y) and adulthood (42/43
      years), and BMI repeatedly across adulthood, spanning 1966 to 2012. Associations 
      between SEP and BMI were examined using linear regression and multilevel models. 
      Lower childhood SEP was associated with higher adult BMI in both genders, and
      differences were typically larger at older ages and similar in magnitude in each 
      cohort. The strength of association between adult SEP and BMI did not vary with
      age in any consistent pattern in these cohorts, but were more evident in women
      than men, and inequalities were larger among women in the 1970 cohort compared
      with earlier-born cohorts. For example, mean differences in BMI at 42/43 y
      amongst women in the lowest compared with highest social class were 2.0 kg/m2
      (95% CI: -0.1, 4.0) in the 1946 NSHD, 2.3 kg/m2 (1.1, 3.4) in the 1958 NCDS, and 
      3.9 kg/m2 (2.3, 5.4) the in the 1970 BCS; mean (SD) BMI in the highest and lowest
      social classes were as follows: 24.9 (0.8) versus 26.8 (0.7) in the 1946 NSHD,
      24.2 (0.4) versus 26.5 (0.4) in the 1958 NCDS, and 24.2 (0.3) versus 28.1 (0.8)
      in the 1970 BCS. Findings did not differ whether using overweight or obesity as
      an outcome. Limitations of this work include the use of social class as the sole 
      indicator of SEP-while it was available in each cohort in both childhood and
      adulthood, trends in BMI inequalities may differ according to other dimensions of
      SEP such as education or income. Although harmonized data were used to aid
      inferences about birth cohort differences in BMI inequality, differences in other
      factors may have also contributed to findings-for example, differences in missing
      data. CONCLUSIONS: Given these persisting inequalities and their public health
      implications, new and effective policies to reduce inequalities in adult BMI that
      tackle inequality with respect to both childhood and adult SEP are urgently
      required.

TI  - Reporting Items for Updated Clinical Guidelines: Checklist for the Reporting of
      Updated Guidelines (CheckUp).
PG  - e1002207
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002207 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientific knowledge is in constant development. Consequently,
      regular review to assure the trustworthiness of clinical guidelines is required. 
      However, there is still a lack of preferred reporting items of the updating
      process in updated clinical guidelines. The present article describes the
      development process of the Checklist for the Reporting of Updated Guidelines
      (CheckUp). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed an initial list of items based on
      an overview of research evidence on clinical guideline updating, the Appraisal of
      Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Instrument, and the advice of
      the CheckUp panel (n = 33 professionals). A multistep process was used to refine 
      this list, including an assessment of ten existing updated clinical guidelines,
      interviews with key informants (response rate: 54.2%; 13/24), a three-round
      Delphi consensus survey with the CheckUp panel (33 participants), and an external
      review with clinical guideline methodologists (response rate: 90%; 53/59) and
      users (response rate: 55.6%; 10/18). CheckUp includes 16 items that address (1)
      the presentation of an updated guideline, (2) editorial independence, and (3) the
      methodology of the updating process. In this article, we present the methodology 
      to develop CheckUp and include as a supplementary file an explanation and
      elaboration document. CONCLUSIONS: CheckUp can be used to evaluate the
      completeness of reporting in updated guidelines and as a tool to inform guideline
      developers about reporting requirements. Editors may request its completion from 
      guideline authors when submitting updated guidelines for publication. Adherence
      to CheckUp will likely enhance the comprehensiveness and transparency of clinical
      guideline updating for the benefit of patients and the public, health care
      professionals, and other relevant stakeholders.

      regimens aim to improve on characteristics such as duration, efficacy, and safety
      profile, but no single regimen is likely to be ideal in all respects. By linking 
      these regimen characteristics to a novel regimen's ability to reduce TB incidence
      and mortality, we sought to prioritize regimen characteristics from a
      population-level perspective. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic
      transmission model of multi-strain TB epidemics in hypothetical populations
      reflective of the epidemiological situations in India (primary analysis), South
      Africa, the Philippines, and Brazil. We modeled the introduction of various novel
      rifampicin-susceptible (RS) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB regimens that
      differed on six characteristics, identified in consultation with a team of global
      experts: (1) efficacy, (2) duration, (3) ease of adherence, (4) medical
      contraindications, (5) barrier to resistance, and (6) baseline prevalence of
      resistance to the novel regimen. We compared scale-up of these regimens to a
      baseline reflective of continued standard of care. For our primary analysis
      situated in India, our model generated baseline TB incidence and mortality of 157
      (95% uncertainty range [UR]: 113-187) and 16 (95% UR: 9-23) per 100,000 per year 
      at the time of novel regimen introduction and RR TB incidence and mortality of 6 
      (95% UR: 4-10) and 0.6 (95% UR: 0.3-1.1) per 100,000 per year. An optimal RS TB
      regimen was projected to reduce 10-y TB incidence and mortality in the India-like
      scenario by 12% (95% UR: 6%-20%) and 11% (95% UR: 6%-20%), respectively, compared
      to current-care projections. An optimal RR TB regimen reduced RR TB incidence by 
      an estimated 32% (95% UR: 18%-46%) and RR TB mortality by 30% (95% UR: 18%-44%). 
      Efficacy was the greatest determinant of impact; compared to a novel regimen
      meeting all minimal targets only, increasing RS TB treatment efficacy from 94% to
      99% reduced TB mortality by 6% (95% UR: 1%-13%, half the impact of a fully
      optimized regimen), and increasing the efficacy against RR TB from 76% to 94%
      lowered RR TB mortality by 13% (95% UR: 6%-23%). Reducing treatment duration or
      improving ease of adherence had smaller but still substantial impact: shortening 
      RS TB treatment duration from 6 to 2 mo lowered TB mortality by 3% (95% UR:
      1%-6%), and shortening RR TB treatment from 20 to 6 mo reduced RR TB mortality by
      8% (95% UR: 4%-13%), while reducing nonadherence to the corresponding regimens by
      50% reduced TB and RR TB mortality by 2% (95% UR: 1%-4%) and 6% (95% UR: 3%-10%),
      respectively. Limitations include sparse data on key model parameters and
      necessary simplifications to model structure and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In
      designing clinical trials of novel TB regimens, investigators should consider
      that even small changes in treatment efficacy may have considerable impact on
      TB-related incidence and mortality. Other regimen improvements may still have
      important benefits for resource allocation and outcomes such as patient quality
      of life.

TI  - Zika Virus Infection as a Cause of Congenital Brain Abnormalities and
      Guillain-Barre Syndrome: Systematic Review.
PG  - e1002203
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) stated in March 2016 that there
      was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the
      neurological disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and of microcephaly and other
      congenital brain abnormalities based on rapid evidence assessments. Decisions
      about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The
      objectives of this study were to update and reassess the evidence for causality
      through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection
      and (a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses
      and offspring of pregnant women and (b) GBS in any population, and to describe
      the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study had three linked components. First, in February
      2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the
      relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes
      in ten dimensions: temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association,
      alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response relationship, animal
      experiments, analogy, specificity, and consistency. Second, we did a systematic
      review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up
      to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any
      causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction,
      and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, WHO
      convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts who assessed the review findings
      and reached consensus statements to update the WHO position on causality. We
      found 1,091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, 
      including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of ten causality
      dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity), we found that
      more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika
      virus infection. For GBS, we included 36 items, of which more than half the
      relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all
      except dose-response relationship, specificity, and animal experimental
      evidence). Articles identified nonsystematically from May 30 to July 29, 2016
      strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that (a) the most
      likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection
      and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a
      cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly, and (b) the most 
      likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection
      and GBS is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of GBS. The expert panel
      recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital
      brain abnormalities or GBS but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to
      recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment
      of the role of dengue virus and other possible cofactors, the small number of
      comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up 
      to date with the pace of publication of new research. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and
      systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed
      both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next
      public health threats that will emerge. This systematic review found sufficient
      evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a
      trigger of GBS.

TI  - Effect of a Primary Care Walking Intervention with and without Nurse Support on
      Physical Activity Levels in 45- to 75-Year-Olds: The Pedometer And Consultation
      Evaluation (PACE-UP) Cluster Randomised Clinical Trial.
PG  - e1002210
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pedometers can increase walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical
      activity (MVPA) levels, but their effectiveness with or without support has not
      been rigorously evaluated. We assessed the effectiveness of a pedometer-based
      walking intervention in predominantly inactive adults, delivered by post or
      through primary care nurse-supported physical activity (PA) consultations.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: A parallel three-arm cluster randomised trial was
      randomised by household, with 12-mo follow-up, in seven London, United Kingdom,
      primary care practices. Eleven thousand fifteen randomly selected patients aged
      45-75 y without PA contraindications were invited. Five hundred forty-eight
      self-reporting achieving PA guidelines were excluded. One thousand twenty-three
      people from 922 households were randomised between 2012-2013 to one of the
      following groups: usual care (n = 338); postal pedometer intervention (n = 339); 
      and nurse-supported pedometer intervention (n = 346). Of these, 956 participants 
      (93%) provided outcome data (usual care n = 323, postal n = 312, nurse-supported 
      n = 321). Both intervention groups received pedometers, 12-wk walking programmes,
      and PA diaries. The nurse group was offered three PA consultations. Primary and
      main secondary outcomes were changes from baseline to 12 mo in average daily
      step-counts and time in MVPA (in >/=10-min bouts), respectively, measured
      objectively by accelerometry. Only statisticians were masked to group. Analysis
      was by intention-to-treat. Average baseline daily step-count was 7,479 (standard 
      deviation [s.d.] 2,671), and average time in MVPA bouts was 94 (s.d. 102) min/wk.
      At 12 mo, mean steps/d, with s.d. in parentheses, were as follows: control 7,246 
      (2,671); postal 8,010 (2,922); and nurse support 8,131 (3,228). PA increased in
      both intervention groups compared with the control group; additional steps/d were
      642 for postal (95% CI 329-955) and 677 for nurse support (95% CI 365-989);
      additional MVPA in bouts (min/wk) were 33 for postal (95% CI 17-49) and 35 for
      nurse support (95% CI 19-51). There were no significant differences between the
      two interventions at 12 mo. The 10% (1,023/10,467) recruitment rate was a study
      limitation. CONCLUSIONS: A primary care pedometer-based walking intervention in
      predominantly inactive 45- to 75-y-olds increased step-counts by about one-tenth 
      and time in MVPA in bouts by about one-third. Nurse and postal delivery achieved 
      similar 12-mo PA outcomes. A primary care pedometer intervention delivered by
      post or with minimal support could help address the public health physical
      inactivity challenge. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: isrctn.com ISRCTN98538934.

TI  - Mutational Profile of Metastatic Breast Cancers: A Retrospective Analysis.
PG  - e1002201
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002201 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major advances have been achieved in the characterization of early
      breast cancer (eBC) genomic profiles. Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is
      associated with poor outcomes, yet limited information is available on the
      genomic profile of this disease. This study aims to decipher mutational profiles 
      of mBC using next-generation sequencing. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Whole-exome
      sequencing was performed on 216 tumor-blood pairs from mBC patients who underwent
      a biopsy in the context of the SAFIR01, SAFIR02, SHIVA, or Molecular Screening
      for Cancer Treatment Optimization (MOSCATO) prospective trials. Mutational
      profiles from 772 primary breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were 
      used as a reference for comparing primary and mBC mutational profiles. Twelve
      genes (TP53, PIK3CA, GATA3, ESR1, MAP3K1, CDH1, AKT1, MAP2K4, RB1, PTEN, CBFB,
      and CDKN2A) were identified as significantly mutated in mBC (false discovery rate
      [FDR] < 0.1). Eight genes (ESR1, FSIP2, FRAS1, OSBPL3, EDC4, PALB2, IGFN1, and
      AGRN) were more frequently mutated in mBC as compared to eBC (FDR < 0.01). ESR1
      was identified both as a driver and as a metastatic gene (n = 22, odds ratio =
      29, 95% CI [9-155], p = 1.2e-12) and also presented with focal amplification (n =
      9) for a total of 31 mBCs with either ESR1 mutation or amplification, including
      27 hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2 negative (HER2-) mBCs (19%).
      HR+/HER2- mBC presented a high prevalence of mutations on genes located on the
      mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (TSC1 and TSC2) as compared to
      HR+/HER2- eBC (respectively 6% and 0.7%, p = 0.0004). Other actionable genes were
      more frequently mutated in HR+ mBC, including ERBB4 (n = 8), NOTCH3 (n = 7), and 
      ALK (n = 7). Analysis of mutational signatures revealed a significant increase in
      APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in HR+/HER2- metastatic tumors as compared to primary
      TCGA samples (p < 2e-16). The main limitations of this study include the absence 
      of bone metastases and the size of the cohort, which might not have allowed the
      identification of rare mutations and their effect on survival. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      work reports the results of the analysis of the first large-scale study on
      mutation profiles of mBC. This study revealed genomic alterations and mutational 
      signatures involved in the resistance to therapies, including actionable
      mutations.

TI  - Genomic Analysis of Uterine Lavage Fluid Detects Early Endometrial Cancers and
      Reveals a Prevalent Landscape of Driver Mutations in Women without
      Histopathologic Evidence of Cancer: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e1002206
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, and its
      incidence and associated mortality are increasing. Despite the immediate need to 
      detect these cancers at an earlier stage, there is no effective screening
      methodology or protocol for endometrial cancer. The comprehensive, genomics-based
      analysis of endometrial cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed many of
      the molecular defects that define this cancer. Based on these cancer genome
      results, and in a prospective study, we hypothesized that the use of ultra-deep, 
      targeted gene sequencing could detect somatic mutations in uterine lavage fluid
      obtained from women undergoing hysteroscopy as a means of molecular screening and
      diagnosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Uterine lavage and paired blood samples were
      collected and analyzed from 107 consecutive patients who were undergoing
      hysteroscopy and curettage for diagnostic evaluation from this single-institution
      study. The lavage fluid was separated into cellular and acellular fractions by
      centrifugation. Cellular and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were isolated from each
      lavage. Two targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels, one composed
      of 56 genes and the other of 12 genes, were used for ultra-deep sequencing. To
      rule out potential NGS-based errors, orthogonal mutation validation was performed
      using digital PCR and Sanger sequencing. Seven patients were diagnosed with
      endometrial cancer based on classic histopathologic analysis. Six of these
      patients had stage IA cancer, and one of these cancers was only detectable as a
      microscopic focus within a polyp. All seven patients were found to have
      significant cancer-associated gene mutations in both cell pellet and cfDNA
      fractions. In the four patients in whom adequate tumor sample was available, all 
      tumor mutations above a specific allele fraction were present in the uterine
      lavage DNA samples. Mutations originally only detected in lavage fluid fractions 
      were later confirmed to be present in tumor but at allele fractions significantly
      less than 1%. Of the remaining 95 patients diagnosed with benign or non-cancer
      pathology, 44 had no significant cancer mutations detected. Intriguingly, 51
      patients without histopathologic evidence of cancer had relatively high allele
      fraction (1.0%-30.4%), cancer-associated mutations. Participants with detected
      driver and potential driver mutations were significantly older (mean age mutated 
      = 57.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.30-infinity, mean age no mutations =
      50.35; p-value = 0.002; Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] adjusted p-value = 0.015) and
      more likely to be post-menopausal (p-value = 0.004; BH-adjusted p-value = 0.015) 
      than those without these mutations. No associations were detected between
      mutation status and race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, parity, and
      smoking status. Long-term follow-up was not presently available in this
      prospective study for those women without histopathologic evidence of cancer.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using ultra-deep NGS, we identified somatic mutations in DNA
      extracted both from cell pellets and a never previously reported cfDNA fraction
      from the uterine lavage. Using our targeted sequencing approach, endometrial
      driver mutations were identified in all seven women who received a cancer
      diagnosis based on classic histopathology of tissue curettage obtained at the
      time of hysteroscopy. In addition, relatively high allele fraction driver
      mutations were identified in the lavage fluid of approximately half of the women 
      without a cancer diagnosis. Increasing age and post-menopausal status were
      associated with the presence of these cancer-associated mutations, suggesting the
      prevalent existence of a premalignant landscape in women without clinical
      evidence of cancer. Given that a uterine lavage can be easily and quickly
      performed even outside of the operating room and in a physician's office-based
      setting, our findings suggest the future possibility of this approach for
      screening women for the earliest stages of endometrial cancer. However, our
      findings suggest that further insight into development of cancer or its
      interruption are needed before translation to the clinic.

TI  - Base-Position Error Rate Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Applied to
      Circulating Tumor DNA in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective Study.
PG  - e1002199
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an approved noninvasive biomarker to
      test for the presence of EGFR mutations at diagnosis or recurrence of lung
      cancer. However, studies evaluating ctDNA as a noninvasive "real-time" biomarker 
      to provide prognostic and predictive information in treatment monitoring have
      given inconsistent results, mainly due to methodological differences. We have
      recently validated a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to detect ctDNA.
      Using this new approach, we evaluated the clinical usefulness of ctDNA monitoring
      in a prospective observational series of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We recruited 124 patients with newly diagnosed
      advanced NSCLC for ctDNA monitoring. The primary objective was to analyze the
      prognostic value of baseline ctDNA on overall survival. ctDNA was assessed by
      ultra-deep targeted NGS using our dedicated variant caller algorithm. Common
      mutations were validated by digital PCR. Out of the 109 patients with at least
      one follow-up marker mutation, plasma samples were contributive at baseline (n = 
      105), at first evaluation (n = 85), and at tumor progression (n = 66). We found
      that the presence of ctDNA at baseline was an independent marker of poor
      prognosis, with a median overall survival of 13.6 versus 21.5 mo (adjusted hazard
      ratio [HR] 1.82, 95% CI 1.01-3.55, p = 0.045) and a median progression-free
      survival of 4.9 versus 10.4 mo (adjusted HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.67, p = 0.002).
      It was also related to the presence of bone and liver metastasis. At first
      evaluation (E1) after treatment initiation, residual ctDNA was an early predictor
      of treatment benefit as judged by best radiological response and progression-free
      survival. Finally, negative ctDNA at E1 was associated with overall survival
      independently of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (HR 3.27, 
      95% CI 1.66-6.40, p < 0.001). Study population heterogeneity, over-representation
      of EGFR-mutated patients, and heterogeneous treatment types might limit the
      conclusions of this study, which require future validation in independent
      populations. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC,
      we found that ctDNA detection using targeted NGS was associated with poor
      prognosis. The heterogeneity of lung cancer molecular alterations, particularly
      at time of progression, impairs the ability of individual gene testing to
      accurately detect ctDNA in unselected patients. Further investigations are needed
      to evaluate the clinical impact of earlier evaluation times at 1 or 2 wk.
      Supporting clinical decisions, such as early treatment switching based on ctDNA
      positivity at first evaluation, will require dedicated interventional studies.

TI  - The Subclonal Architecture of Metastatic Breast Cancer: Results from a
      Prospective Community-Based Rapid Autopsy Program "CASCADE".
PG  - e1002204
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the cancer genome is seen as a key step in improving
      outcomes for cancer patients. Genomic assays are emerging as a possible avenue to
      personalised medicine in breast cancer. However, evolution of the cancer genome
      during the natural history of breast cancer is largely unknown, as is the profile
      of disease at death. We sought to study in detail these aspects of advanced
      breast cancers that have resulted in lethal disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Three 
      patients with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer and one patient with triple negative
      breast cancer underwent rapid autopsy as part of an institutional prospective
      community-based rapid autopsy program (CASCADE). Cases represented a range of
      management problems in breast cancer, including late relapse after early stage
      disease, de novo metastatic disease, discordant disease response, and disease
      refractory to treatment. Between 5 and 12 metastatic sites were collected at
      autopsy together with available primary tumours and longitudinal metastatic
      biopsies taken during life. Samples underwent paired tumour-normal whole exome
      sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Subclonal
      architectures were inferred by jointly analysing all samples from each patient.
      Mutations were validated using high depth amplicon sequencing. Between cases,
      there were significant differences in mutational burden, driver mutations,
      mutational processes, and copy number variation. Within each case, we found
      dramatic heterogeneity in subclonal structure from primary to metastatic disease 
      and between metastatic sites, such that no single lesion captured the breadth of 
      disease. Metastatic cross-seeding was found in each case, and treatment drove
      subclonal diversification. Subclones displayed parallel evolution of treatment
      resistance in some cases and apparent augmentation of key oncogenic drivers as an
      alternative resistance mechanism. We also observed the role of mutational
      processes in subclonal evolution. Limitations of this study include the potential
      for bias introduced by joint analysis of formalin-fixed archival specimens with
      fresh specimens and the difficulties in resolving subclones with whole exome
      sequencing. Other alterations that could define subclones such as structural
      variants or epigenetic modifications were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      highlights various mechanisms that shape the genome of metastatic breast cancer
      and the value of studying advanced disease in detail. Treatment drives
      significant genomic heterogeneity in breast cancers which has implications for
      disease monitoring and treatment selection in the personalised medicine paradigm.

TI  - IL-7 Receptor Mutations and Steroid Resistance in Pediatric T cell Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Genome Sequencing Study.
PG  - e1002200
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002200 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common
      childhood cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in children. T
      cell ALL (T-ALL) represents about 15% of pediatric ALL cases and is considered a 
      high-risk disease. T-ALL is often associated with resistance to treatment,
      including steroids, which are currently the cornerstone for treating ALL;
      moreover, initial steroid response strongly predicts survival and cure. However, 
      the cellular mechanisms underlying steroid resistance in T-ALL patients are
      poorly understood. In this study, we combined various genomic datasets in order
      to identify candidate genetic mechanisms underlying steroid resistance in
      children undergoing T-ALL treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole
      genome sequencing on paired pre-treatment (diagnostic) and post-treatment
      (remission) samples from 13 patients, and targeted exome sequencing of
      pre-treatment samples from 69 additional T-ALL patients. We then integrated
      mutation data with copy number data for 151 mutated genes, and this integrated
      dataset was tested for associations of mutations with clinical outcomes and in
      vitro drug response. Our analysis revealed that mutations in JAK1 and KRAS, two
      genes encoding components of the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) signaling pathway,
      were associated with steroid resistance and poor outcome. We then sequenced JAK1,
      KRAS, and other genes in this pathway, including IL7R, JAK3, NF1, NRAS, and AKT, 
      in these 69 T-ALL patients and a further 77 T-ALL patients. We identified
      mutations in 32% (47/146) of patients, the majority of whom had a specific T-ALL 
      subtype (early thymic progenitor ALL or TLX). Based on the outcomes of these
      patients and their prednisolone responsiveness measured in vitro, we then
      confirmed that these mutations were associated with both steroid resistance and
      poor outcome. To explore how these mutations in IL7R signaling pathway genes
      cause steroid resistance and subsequent poor outcome, we expressed wild-type and 
      mutant IL7R signaling molecules in two steroid-sensitive T-ALL cell lines (SUPT1 
      and P12 Ichikawa cells) using inducible lentiviral expression constructs. We
      found that expressing mutant IL7R, JAK1, or NRAS, or wild-type NRAS or AKT,
      specifically induced steroid resistance without affecting sensitivity to
      vincristine or L-asparaginase. In contrast, wild-type IL7R, JAK1, and JAK3, as
      well as mutant JAK3 and mutant AKT, had no effect. We then performed a functional
      study to examine the mechanisms underlying steroid resistance and found that,
      rather than changing the steroid receptor's ability to activate downstream
      targets, steroid resistance was associated with strong activation of MEK-ERK and 
      AKT, downstream components of the IL7R signaling pathway, thereby inducing a
      robust antiapoptotic response by upregulating MCL1 and BCLXL expression. Both the
      MEK-ERK and AKT pathways also inactivate BIM, an essential molecule for
      steroid-induced cell death, and inhibit GSK3B, an important regulator of
      proapoptotic BIM. Importantly, treating our cell lines with IL7R signaling
      inhibitors restored steroid sensitivity. To address clinical relevance, we
      treated primary T-ALL cells obtained from 11 patients with steroids either alone 
      or in combination with IL7R signaling inhibitors; we found that including a MEK, 
      AKT, mTOR, or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor strongly increased steroid-induced cell
      death. Therefore, combining these inhibitors with steroid treatment may enhance
      steroid sensitivity in patients with ALL. The main limitation of our study was
      the modest cohort size, owing to the very low incidence of T-ALL. CONCLUSIONS:
      Using an unbiased sequencing approach, we found that specific mutations in IL7R
      signaling molecules underlie steroid resistance in T-ALL. Future prospective
      clinical studies should test the ability of inhibitors of MEK, AKT, mTOR, or
      PI3K/mTOR to restore or enhance steroid sensitivity and improve clinical outcome.

TI  - Exploratory Analysis of TP53 Mutations in Circulating Tumour DNA as Biomarkers of
      Treatment Response for Patients with Relapsed High-Grade Serous Ovarian
      Carcinoma: A Retrospective Study.
PG  - e1002198
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) carrying tumour-specific sequence
      alterations may provide a minimally invasive means to dynamically assess tumour
      burden and response to treatment in cancer patients. Somatic TP53 mutations are a
      defining feature of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). We tested
      whether these mutations could be used as personalised markers to monitor tumour
      burden and early changes as a predictor of response and time to progression
      (TTP). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective analysis of serial
      plasma samples collected during routine clinical visits from 40 patients with
      HGSOC undergoing heterogeneous standard of care treatment. Patient-specific TP53 
      assays were developed for 31 unique mutations identified in formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded tumour DNA from these patients. These assays were used to
      quantify ctDNA in 318 plasma samples using microfluidic digital PCR. The TP53
      mutant allele fraction (TP53MAF) was compared to serum CA-125, the current
      gold-standard response marker for HGSOC in blood, as well as to disease volume on
      computed tomography scans by volumetric analysis. Changes after one cycle of
      treatment were compared with TTP. The median TP53MAF prior to treatment in 51
      relapsed treatment courses was 8% (interquartile range [IQR] 1.2%-22%) compared
      to 0.7% (IQR 0.3%-2.0%) for seven untreated newly diagnosed stage IIIC/IV
      patients. TP53MAF correlated with volumetric measurements (Pearson r = 0.59, p < 
      0.001), and this correlation improved when patients with ascites were excluded (r
      = 0.82). The ratio of TP53MAF to volume of disease was higher in relapsed
      patients (0.04% per cm3) than in untreated patients (0.0008% per cm3, p = 0.004).
      In nearly all relapsed patients with disease volume > 32 cm3, ctDNA was detected 
      at >/=20 amplifiable copies per millilitre of plasma. In 49 treatment courses for
      relapsed disease, pre-treatment TP53MAF concentration, but not CA-125, was
      associated with TTP. Response to chemotherapy was seen earlier with ctDNA, with a
      median time to nadir of 37 d (IQR 28-54) compared with a median time to nadir of 
      84 d (IQR 42-116) for CA-125. In 32 relapsed treatment courses evaluable for
      response after one cycle of chemotherapy, a decrease in TP53MAF of >60% was an
      independent predictor of TTP in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.22, 95% CI
      0.07-0.67, p = 0.008). Conversely, a decrease in TP53MAF of </=60% was associated
      with poor response and identified cases with TTP < 6 mo with 71% sensitivity (95%
      CI 42%-92%) and 88% specificity (95% CI 64%-99%). Specificity was improved when
      patients with recent drainage of ascites were excluded. Ascites drainage led to a
      reduction of TP53MAF concentration. The limitations of this study include
      retrospective design, small sample size, and heterogeneity of treatment within
      the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, we demonstrated that ctDNA 
      is correlated with volume of disease at the start of treatment in women with
      HGSOC and that a decrease of </=60% in TP53MAF after one cycle of chemotherapy
      was associated with shorter TTP. These results provide evidence that ctDNA has
      the potential to be a highly specific early molecular response marker in HGSOC
      and warrants further investigation in larger cohorts receiving uniform treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, yet incurable B cell
      malignancy. A subset of patients experience an increased mortality rate driven by
      two distinct clinical end points: histological transformation and early
      progression after immunochemotherapy. The nature of tumor clonal dynamics leading
      to these clinical end points is poorly understood, and previously determined
      genetic alterations do not explain the majority of transformed cases or
      accurately predict early progressive disease. We contend that detailed knowledge 
      of the expansion patterns of specific cell populations plus their associated
      mutations would provide insight into therapeutic strategies and disease biology
      over the time course of FL clinical histories. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a
      combination of whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing, and digital
      droplet PCR on matched diagnostic and relapse specimens, we deciphered the
      constituent clonal populations in 15 transformation cases and 6 progression
      cases, and measured the change in clonal population abundance over time. We
      observed widely divergent patterns of clonal dynamics in transformed cases
      relative to progressed cases. Transformation specimens were generally composed of
      clones that were rare or absent in diagnostic specimens, consistent with dramatic
      clonal expansions that came to dominate the transformation specimens. This
      pattern was independent of time to transformation and treatment modality. By
      contrast, early progression specimens were composed of clones that were already
      present in the diagnostic specimens and exhibited only moderate clonal dynamics, 
      even in the presence of immunochemotherapy. Analysis of somatic mutations
      impacting 94 genes was undertaken in an extension cohort consisting of 395
      samples from 277 patients in order to decipher disrupted biology in the two
      clinical end points. We found 12 genes that were more commonly mutated in
      transformed samples than in the preceding FL tumors, including TP53, B2M, CCND3, 
      GNA13, S1PR2, and P2RY8. Moreover, ten genes were more commonly mutated in
      diagnostic specimens of patients with early progression, including TP53, BTG1,
      MKI67, and XBP1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illuminate contrasting modes of
      evolution shaping the clinical histories of transformation and progression. They 
      have implications for interpretation of evolutionary dynamics in the context of
      treatment-induced selective pressures, and indicate that transformation and
      progression will require different clinical management strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous and
      aggressive disease, and although no effective targeted therapies are available to
      date, about one-third of patients with TNBC achieve pathologic complete response 
      (pCR) from standard-of-care anthracycline/taxane (ACT) chemotherapy. The
      heterogeneity of these tumors, however, has hindered the discovery of effective
      biomarkers to identify such patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole
      exome sequencing on 29 TNBC cases from the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)
      selected because they had either pCR (n = 18) or extensive residual disease (n = 
      11) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas
      (TCGA; n = 144) and METABRIC (n = 278) cohorts serving as validation cohorts. Our
      analysis revealed that mutations in the AR- and FOXA1-regulated networks, in
      which BRCA1 plays a key role, are associated with significantly higher
      sensitivity to ACT chemotherapy in the MDACC cohort (pCR rate of 94.1% compared
      to 16.6% in tumors without mutations in AR/FOXA1 pathway, adjusted p = 0.02) and 
      significantly better survival outcome in the TCGA TNBC cohort (log-rank test, p =
      0.05). Combined analysis of DNA sequencing, DNA methylation, and RNA sequencing
      identified tumors of a distinct BRCA-deficient (BRCA-D) TNBC subtype
      characterized by low levels of wild-type BRCA1/2 expression. Patients with
      functionally BRCA-D tumors had significantly better survival with
      standard-of-care chemotherapy than patients whose tumors were not BRCA-D
      (log-rank test, p = 0.021), and they had significantly higher mutation burden (p 
      < 0.001) and presented clonal neoantigens that were associated with increased
      immune cell activity. A transcriptional signature of BRCA-D TNBC tumors was
      independently validated to be significantly associated with improved survival in 
      the METABRIC dataset (log-rank test, p = 0.009). As a retrospective study,
      limitations include the small size and potential selection bias in the discovery 
      cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive molecular analysis presented in this study
      directly links BRCA deficiency with increased clonal mutation burden and
      significantly enhanced chemosensitivity in TNBC and suggests that functional
      RNA-based BRCA deficiency needs to be further examined in TNBC.

      A Gene-Expression-Based Retrospective Study.
PG  - e1002194
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune infiltration of breast tumours is associated with clinical
      outcome. However, past work has not accounted for the diversity of functionally
      distinct cell types that make up the immune response. The aim of this study was
      to determine whether differences in the cellular composition of the immune
      infiltrate in breast tumours influence survival and treatment response, and
      whether these effects differ by molecular subtype. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      applied an established computational approach (CIBERSORT) to bulk gene expression
      profiles of almost 11,000 tumours to infer the proportions of 22 subsets of
      immune cells. We investigated associations between each cell type and survival
      and response to chemotherapy, modelling cellular proportions as quartiles. We
      found that tumours with little or no immune infiltration were associated with
      different survival patterns according to oestrogen receptor (ER) status. In
      ER-negative disease, tumours lacking immune infiltration were associated with the
      poorest prognosis, whereas in ER-positive disease, they were associated with
      intermediate prognosis. Of the cell subsets investigated, T regulatory cells and 
      M0 and M2 macrophages emerged as the most strongly associated with poor outcome, 
      regardless of ER status. Among ER-negative tumours, CD8+ T cells (hazard ratio
      [HR] = 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p = 0.02) and activated memory T cells (HR 0.88,
      95% CI 0.80-0.97; p = 0.01) were associated with favourable outcome. T follicular
      helper cells (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.57; p < 0.001) and memory B
      cells (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.0-1.39; p = 0.04) were associated with pathological
      complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative disease, suggesting 
      a role for humoral immunity in mediating response to cytotoxic therapy.
      Unsupervised clustering analysis using immune cell proportions revealed eight
      subgroups of tumours, largely defined by the balance between M0, M1, and M2
      macrophages, with distinct survival patterns by ER status and associations with
      patient age at diagnosis. The main limitations of this study are the use of
      diverse platforms for measuring gene expression, including some not previously
      used with CIBERSORT, and the combined analysis of different forms of follow-up
      across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in the cellular composition of the
      immune infiltrate in breast tumours appear to exist, and these differences are
      likely to be important determinants of both prognosis and response to treatment. 
      In particular, macrophages emerge as a possible target for novel therapies.
      Detailed analysis of the cellular immune response in tumours has the potential to
      enhance clinical prediction and to identify candidates for immunotherapy.

TI  - Somatic Genomics and Clinical Features of Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Retrospective
      Study.
PG  - e1002162
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histologic subtype of
      lung cancer and has a high risk of distant metastasis at every disease stage. We 
      aimed to characterize the genomic landscape of LUAD and identify mutation
      signatures associated with tumor progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed 
      an integrative genomic analysis, incorporating whole exome sequencing (WES),
      determination of DNA copy number and DNA methylation, and transcriptome
      sequencing for 101 LUAD samples from the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer 
      Etiology (EAGLE) study. We detected driver genes by testing whether the
      nonsynonymous mutation rate was significantly higher than the background mutation
      rate and replicated our findings in public datasets with 724 samples. We
      performed subclonality analysis for mutations based on mutant allele data and
      copy number alteration data. We also tested the association between mutation
      signatures and clinical outcomes, including distant metastasis, survival, and
      tumor grade. We identified and replicated two novel candidate driver genes, POU
      class 4 homeobox 2 (POU4F2) (mutated in 9 [8.9%] samples) and ZKSCAN1 (mutated in
      6 [5.9%] samples), and characterized their major deleterious mutations. ZKSCAN1
      was part of a mutually exclusive gene set that included the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway
      genes BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, MET, and NF1, indicating an important driver role for
      this gene. Moreover, we observed strong associations between methylation in
      specific genomic regions and somatic mutation patterns. In the tumor evolution
      analysis, four driver genes had a significantly lower fraction of subclonal
      mutations (FSM), including TP53 (p = 0.007), KEAP1 (p = 0.012), STK11 (p =
      0.0076), and EGFR (p = 0.0078), suggesting a tumor initiation role for these
      genes. Subclonal mutations were significantly enriched in APOBEC-related
      signatures (p < 2.5x10-50). The total number of somatic mutations (p = 0.0039)
      and the fraction of transitions (p = 5.5x10-4) were associated with increased
      risk of distant metastasis. Our study's limitations include a small number of
      LUAD patients for subgroup analyses and a single-sample design for investigation 
      of subclonality. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a genomic characterization of
      LUAD pathogenesis and progression. The distinct clonal and subclonal mutation
      signatures suggest possible diverse carcinogenesis pathways for endogenous and
      exogenous exposures, and may serve as a foundation for more effective treatments 
      for this lethal disease. LUAD's high heterogeneity emphasizes the need to further
      study this tumor type and to associate genomic findings with clinical outcomes.

TI  - Expression of lncRNAs in Low-Grade Gliomas and Glioblastoma Multiforme: An In
      Silico Analysis.
PG  - e1002192
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, over 16,000 patients die from malignant brain cancer in
      the US. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been shown to play critical
      roles in regulating neurogenesis and brain tumor progression. To better
      understand the role of lncRNAs in brain cancer, we performed a global analysis to
      identify and characterize all annotated and novel lncRNAs in both grade II and
      III gliomas as well as grade IV glioblastomas (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]).
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We determined the expression of all lncRNAs in over 650
      brain cancer and 70 normal brain tissue RNA sequencing datasets from The Cancer
      Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other publicly available datasets. We identified 611
      induced and 677 repressed lncRNAs in glial tumors relative to normal brains.
      Hundreds of lncRNAs were specifically expressed in each of the three lower grade 
      glioma (LGG) subtypes (IDH1/2 wt, IDH1/2 mut, and IDH1/2 mut 1p19q codeletion)
      and the four subtypes of GBMs (classical, mesenchymal, neural, and proneural).
      Overlap between the subtype-specific lncRNAs in GBMs and LGGs demonstrated
      similarities between mesenchymal GBMs and IDH1/2 wt LGGs, with 2-fold higher
      overlap than would be expected by random chance. Using a multivariate Cox
      regression survival model, we identified 584 and 282 lncRNAs that were associated
      with a poor and good prognosis, respectively, in GBM patients. We developed a
      survival algorithm for LGGs based on the expression of 64 lncRNAs that was
      associated with patient prognosis in a test set (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.168, 95%
      CI = 1.765-2.807, p < 0.001) and validation set (HR = 1.921, 95% CI =
      1.333-2.767, p < 0.001) of patients from TCGA. The main limitations of this study
      are that further work is needed to investigate the clinical relevance of our
      findings, and that validation in an independent dataset is needed to determine
      the robustness of our survival algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies a
      panel of lncRNAs that appear to be prognostic in gliomas and provides a critical 
      resource for future studies examining the role of lncRNAs in brain cancers.

TI  - Tumor Evolution in Two Patients with Basal-like Breast Cancer: A Retrospective
      Genomics Study of Multiple Metastases.
PG  - e1002174
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the main cause of cancer patient deaths and remains a
      poorly characterized process. It is still unclear when in tumor progression the
      ability to metastasize arises and whether this ability is inherent to the primary
      tumor or is acquired well after primary tumor formation. Next-generation
      sequencing and analytical methods to define clonal heterogeneity provide a means 
      for identifying genetic events and the temporal relationships between these
      events in the primary and metastatic tumors within an individual. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We performed DNA whole genome and mRNA sequencing on two primary
      tumors, each with either four or five distinct tissue site-specific metastases,
      from two individuals with triple-negative/basal-like breast cancers. As evidenced
      by their case histories, each patient had an aggressive disease course with
      abbreviated survival. In each patient, the overall gene expression signatures,
      DNA copy number patterns, and somatic mutation patterns were highly similar
      across each primary tumor and its associated metastases. Almost every mutation
      found in the primary was found in a metastasis (for the two patients, 52/54 and
      75/75). Many of these mutations were found in every tumor (11/54 and 65/75,
      respectively). In addition, each metastasis had fewer metastatic-specific events 
      and shared at least 50% of its somatic mutation repertoire with the primary
      tumor, and all samples from each patient grouped together by gene expression
      clustering analysis. TP53 was the only mutated gene in common between both
      patients and was present in every tumor in this study. Strikingly, each
      metastasis resulted from multiclonal seeding instead of from a single cell of
      origin, and few of the new mutations, present only in the metastases, were
      expressed in mRNAs. Because of the clinical differences between these two
      patients and the small sample size of our study, the generalizability of these
      findings will need to be further examined in larger cohorts of patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that multiclonal seeding may be common amongst 
      basal-like breast cancers. In these two patients, mutations and DNA copy number
      changes in the primary tumors appear to have had a biologic impact on metastatic

TI  - Clonal Evolutionary Analysis during HER2 Blockade in HER2-Positive Inflammatory
      Breast Cancer: A Phase II Open-Label Clinical Trial of Afatinib +/- Vinorelbine.
PG  - e1002136
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, aggressive form of breast
      cancer associated with HER2 amplification, with high risk of metastasis and an
      estimated median survival of 2.9 y. We performed an open-label, single-arm phase 
      II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01325428) to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family inhibitor, alone and in
      combination with vinorelbine in patients with HER2-positive IBC. This trial
      included prospectively planned exome analysis before and after afatinib
      monotherapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: HER2-positive IBC patients received afatinib
      40 mg daily until progression, and thereafter afatinib 40 mg daily and
      intravenous vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 weekly. The primary endpoint was clinical
      benefit; secondary endpoints were objective response (OR), duration of OR, and
      progression-free survival (PFS). Of 26 patients treated with afatinib
      monotherapy, clinical benefit was achieved in 9 patients (35%), 0 of 7
      trastuzumab-treated patients and 9 of 19 trastuzumab-naive patients. Following
      disease progression, 10 patients received afatinib plus vinorelbine, and clinical
      benefit was achieved in 2 of 4 trastuzumab-treated and 0 of 6 trastuzumab-naive
      patients. All patients had treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Whole-exome
      sequencing of tumour biopsies taken before treatment and following disease
      progression on afatinib monotherapy was performed to assess the mutational
      landscape of IBC and evolutionary trajectories during therapy. Compared to a
      cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with HER2-positive non-IBC,
      HER2-positive IBC patients had significantly higher mutational and neoantigenic
      burden, more frequent gain-of-function TP53 mutations and a recurrent 11q13.5
      amplification overlapping PAK1. Planned exploratory analysis revealed that
      trastuzumab-naive patients with tumours harbouring somatic activation of PI3K/Akt
      signalling had significantly shorter PFS compared to those without (p = 0.03).
      High genomic concordance between biopsies taken before and following afatinib
      resistance was observed with stable clonal structures in non-responding tumours, 
      and evidence of branched evolution in 8 of 9 tumours analysed. Recruitment to the
      trial was terminated early following the LUX-Breast 1 trial, which showed that
      afatinib combined with vinorelbine had similar PFS and OR rates to trastuzumab
      plus vinorelbine but shorter overall survival (OS), and was less tolerable. The
      main limitations of this study are that the results should be interpreted with
      caution given the relatively small patient cohort and the potential for tumour
      sampling bias between pre- and post-treatment tumour biopsies. CONCLUSIONS:
      Afatinib, with or without vinorelbine, showed activity in trastuzumab-naive
      HER2-positive IBC patients in a planned subgroup analysis. HER2-positive IBC is
      characterized by frequent TP53 gain-of-function mutations and a high mutational
      burden. The high mutational load associated with HER2-positive IBC suggests a
      potential role for checkpoint inhibitor therapy in this disease. TRIAL

TI  - Genetic Predisposition to an Impaired Metabolism of the Branched-Chain Amino
      Acids and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A Mendelian Randomisation Analysis.
PG  - e1002179
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Higher circulating levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs;
      i.e., isoleucine, leucine, and valine) are strongly associated with higher type 2
      diabetes risk, but it is not known whether this association is causal. We
      undertook large-scale human genetic analyses to address this question. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: Genome-wide studies of BCAA levels in 16,596 individuals revealed
      five genomic regions associated at genome-wide levels of significance (p < 5 x
      10-8). The strongest signal was 21 kb upstream of the PPM1K gene (beta in
      standard deviations [SDs] of leucine per allele = 0.08, p = 3.9 x 10-25),
      encoding an activator of the mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid
      dehydrogenase (BCKD) responsible for the rate-limiting step in BCAA catabolism.
      In another analysis, in up to 47,877 cases of type 2 diabetes and 267,694
      controls, a genetically predicted difference of 1 SD in amino acid level was
      associated with an odds ratio for type 2 diabetes of 1.44 (95% CI 1.26-1.65, p = 
      9.5 x 10-8) for isoleucine, 1.85 (95% CI 1.41-2.42, p = 7.3 x 10-6) for leucine, 
      and 1.54 (95% CI 1.28-1.84, p = 4.2 x 10-6) for valine. Estimates were highly
      consistent with those from prospective observational studies of the association
      between BCAA levels and incident type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis of 1,992
      cases and 4,319 non-cases. Metabolome-wide association analyses of BCAA-raising
      alleles revealed high specificity to the BCAA pathway and an accumulation of
      metabolites upstream of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid oxidation, consistent with 
      reduced BCKD activity. Limitations of this study are that, while the association 
      of genetic variants appeared highly specific, the possibility of pleiotropic
      associations cannot be entirely excluded. Similar to other complex phenotypes,
      genetic scores used in the study captured a limited proportion of the
      heritability in BCAA levels. Therefore, it is possible that only some of the
      mechanisms that increase BCAA levels or affect BCAA metabolism are implicated in 
      type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this large-scale human genetic and
      metabolomic study is consistent with a causal role of BCAA metabolism in the
      aetiology of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - A Core Outcome Set for the Benefits and Adverse Events of Bariatric and Metabolic
      Surgery: The BARIACT Project.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bariatric and metabolic surgery is used as a treatment for patients
      with severe and complex obesity. However, there is a need to improve outcome
      selection and reporting in bariatric surgery trials. A Core Outcome Set (COS), an
      agreed minimum set of outcomes reported in all studies of a specific condition,
      may achieve this. Here, we present the development of a COS for BARIAtric and
      metabolic surgery Clinical Trials-the BARIACT Study. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Outcomes identified from systematic reviews and patient interviews informed a
      questionnaire survey. Patients and health professionals were surveyed three times
      and asked to rate the importance of each item on a 1-9 scale. Delphi methods
      provided anonymised feedback to participants. Items not meeting predefined
      criteria were discarded between rounds. Remaining items were discussed at
      consensus meetings, held separately with patients and professionals, where the
      COS was agreed. Data sources identified 2,990 outcomes, which were used to
      develop a 130-item questionnaire. Round 1 response rates were moderate but
      subsequently improved to above 75% for other rounds. After rounds 2 and 3, 81 and
      14 items were discarded, respectively, leaving 35 items for discussion at
      consensus meetings. The final COS included nine items: "weight," "diabetes
      status," "cardiovascular risk," "overall quality of life (QOL)," "mortality,"
      "technical complications of the specific operation," "any
      re-operation/re-intervention," "dysphagia/regurgitation," and "micronutrient
      status." The main limitation of this study was that it was based in the United
      Kingdom only. CONCLUSIONS: The COS is recommended to be used as a minimum in all 
      trials of bariatric and metabolic surgery. Adoption of the COS will improve data 
      synthesis and the value of research data. Future work will establish methods for 
      the measurement of the outcomes in the COS.

TI  - Patient-Reported Barriers to Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e1002183
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintaining high levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
      is a challenge across settings and populations. Understanding the relative
      importance of different barriers to adherence will help inform the targeting of
      different interventions and future research priorities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We 
      searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsychINFO from 01
      January 1997 to 31 March 2016 for studies reporting barriers to adherence to ART.
      We calculated pooled proportions of reported barriers to adherence per age group 
      (adults, adolescents, and children). We included data from 125 studies that
      provided information about adherence barriers for 17,061 adults, 1,099 children, 
      and 856 adolescents. We assessed differences according to geographical location
      and level of economic development. The most frequently reported individual
      barriers included forgetting (adults 41.4%, 95% CI 37.3%-45.4%; adolescents
      63.1%, 95% CI 46.3%-80.0%; children/caregivers 29.2%, 95% CI 20.1%-38.4%), being 
      away from home (adults 30.4%, 95% CI 25.5%-35.2%; adolescents 40.7%, 95% CI
      25.7%-55.6%; children/caregivers 18.5%, 95% CI 10.3%-26.8%), and a change to
      daily routine (adults 28.0%, 95% CI 20.9%-35.0%; adolescents 32.4%, 95% CI
      0%-75.0%; children/caregivers 26.3%, 95% CI 15.3%-37.4%). Depression was reported
      as a barrier to adherence by more than 15% of patients across all age categories 
      (adults 15.5%, 95% CI 12.8%-18.3%; adolescents 25.7%, 95% CI 17.7%-33.6%;
      children 15.1%, 95% CI 3.9%-26.3%), while alcohol/substance misuse was commonly
      reported by adults (12.9%, 95% CI 9.7%-16.1%) and adolescents (28.8%, 95% CI
      11.8%-45.8%). Secrecy/stigma was a commonly cited barrier to adherence, reported 
      by more than 10% of adults and children across all regions (adults 13.6%, 95% CI 
      11.9%-15.3%; children/caregivers 22.3%, 95% CI 10.2%-34.5%). Among adults,
      feeling sick (15.9%, 95% CI 13.0%-18.8%) was a more commonly cited barrier to
      adherence than feeling well (9.3%, 95% CI 7.2%-11.4%). Health service-related
      barriers, including distance to clinic (adults 17.5%, 95% CI 13.0%-21.9%) and
      stock outs (adults 16.1%, 95% CI 11.7%-20.4%), were also frequently reported.
      Limitations of this review relate to the fact that included studies differed in
      approaches to assessing adherence barriers and included variable durations of
      follow up. Studies that report self-reported adherence will likely underestimate 
      the frequency of non-adherence. For children, barriers were mainly reported by
      caregivers, which may not correspond to the most important barriers faced by
      children. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on ART face multiple barriers to adherence, and
      no single intervention will be sufficient to ensure that high levels of adherence
      to treatment and virological suppression are sustained. For maximum efficacy,
      health providers should consider a more triaged approach that first identifies
      patients at risk of poor adherence and then seeks to establish the support that
      is needed to overcome the most important barriers to adherence.

TI  - Leukocyte Telomere Length in Relation to 17 Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease 
      Risk: A Cross-Sectional Study of US Adults.
PG  - e1002188
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a putative biological marker of
      immune system age, and there are demonstrated associations between LTL and
      cardiovascular disease. This may be due in part to the relationship of LTL with
      other biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease risk. However, the
      strength of associations between LTL and adiposity, metabolic, proinflammatory,
      and cardiovascular biomarkers has not been systematically evaluated in a United
      States nationally representative population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined
      associations between LTL and 17 cardiovascular biomarkers, including
      lipoproteins, blood sugar, circulatory pressure, proinflammatory markers, kidney 
      function, and adiposity measures, in adults ages 20 to 84 from the
      cross-sectional US nationally representative 1999-2002 National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n = 7,252), statistically adjusting for
      immune cell type distributions. We also examine whether these associations
      differed systematically by age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, and income. We
      found that a one unit difference in the following biomarkers were associated with
      kilobase pair differences in LTL: BMI -0.00478 (95% CI -0.00749--0.00206), waist 
      circumference -0.00211 (95% CI -0.00325--0.000969), percentage of body fat
      -0.00516 (95% CI -0.00761--0.0027), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
      0.00179 (95% CI 0.000571-0.00301), triglycerides -0.000285 (95% CI
      -0.000555--0.0000158), pulse rate -0.00194 (95% CI -0.00317--0.000705),
      C-reactive protein -0.0363 (95% CI 0.0601--0.0124), cystatin C -0.0391 (95% CI
      -0.0772--0.00107). When using clinical cut-points we additionally found
      associations between LTL and insulin resistance -0.0412 (95% CI -0.0685--0.0139),
      systolic blood pressure 0.0455 (95% CI 0.00137-0.0897), and diastolic blood
      pressure -0.0674 (95% CI -0.126--0.00889). These associations were 10%-15%
      greater without controlling for leukocyte cell types. There were very few
      differences in the associations by age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, or
      income. Our findings are relevant to the relationships between these
      cardiovascular biomarkers in the general population but not to cardiovascular
      disease as a clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: LTL is most strongly associated with 
      adiposity, but is also associated with biomarkers across several physiological
      systems. LTL may thus be a predictor of cardiovascular disease through its
      association with multiple risk factors that are physiologically correlated with
      risk for development of cardiovascular disease. Our results are consistent with
      LTL being a biomarker of cardiovascular aging through established physiological
      mechanisms.

TI  - Lifestyle Advice Combined with Personalized Estimates of Genetic or Phenotypic
      Risk of Type 2 Diabetes, and Objectively Measured Physical Activity: A Randomized
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002185
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002185 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information about genetic and phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes is
      now widely available and is being incorporated into disease prevention programs. 
      Whether such information motivates behavior change or has adverse effects is
      uncertain. We examined the effect of communicating an estimate of genetic or
      phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes in a parallel group, open, randomized
      controlled trial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We recruited 569 healthy middle-aged
      adults from the Fenland Study, an ongoing population-based, observational study
      in the east of England (Cambridgeshire, UK). We used a computer-generated random 
      list to assign participants in blocks of six to receive either standard lifestyle
      advice alone (control group, n = 190) or in combination with a genetic (n = 189) 
      or a phenotypic (n = 190) risk estimate for type 2 diabetes (intervention
      groups). After 8 wk, we measured the primary outcome, objectively measured
      physical activity (kJ/kg/day), and also measured several secondary outcomes
      (including self-reported diet, self-reported weight, worry, anxiety, and
      perceived risk). The study was powered to detect a between-group difference of
      4.1 kJ/kg/d at follow-up. 557 (98%) participants completed the trial. There were 
      no significant intervention effects on physical activity (difference in adjusted 
      mean change from baseline: genetic risk group versus control group 0.85 kJ/kg/d
      (95% CI -2.07 to 3.77, p = 0.57); phenotypic risk group versus control group 1.32
      (95% CI -1.61 to 4.25, p = 0.38); and genetic risk group versus phenotypic risk
      group -0.47 (95% CI -3.40 to 2.46, p = 0.75). No significant differences in
      self-reported diet, self-reported weight, worry, and anxiety were observed
      between trial groups. Estimates of perceived risk were significantly more
      accurate among those who received risk information than among those who did not. 
      Key limitations include the recruitment of a sample that may not be
      representative of the UK population, use of self-reported secondary outcome
      measures, and a short follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we did not
      observe short-term changes in behavior associated with the communication of an
      estimate of genetic or phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes. We also did not
      observe changes in worry or anxiety in the study population. Additional research 
      is needed to investigate the conditions under which risk information might
      enhance preventive strategies. (Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN09650496; Date
      applied: April 4, 2011; Date assigned: June 10, 2011). TRIAL REGISTRATION: The
      trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN09650496.

TI  - The Long-Term Safety, Public Health Impact, and Cost-Effectiveness of Routine
      Vaccination with a Recombinant, Live-Attenuated Dengue Vaccine (Dengvaxia): A
      Model Comparison Study.
PG  - e1002181
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002181 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large Phase III trials across Asia and Latin America have recently
      demonstrated the efficacy of a recombinant, live-attenuated dengue vaccine
      (Dengvaxia) over the first 25 mo following vaccination. Subsequent data collected
      in the longer-term follow-up phase, however, have raised concerns about a
      potential increase in hospitalization risk of subsequent dengue infections, in
      particular among young, dengue-naive vaccinees. We here report predictions from
      eight independent modelling groups on the long-term safety, public health impact,
      and cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination with Dengvaxia in a range of
      transmission settings, as characterised by seroprevalence levels among 9-y-olds
      (SP9). These predictions were conducted for the World Health Organization to
      inform their recommendations on optimal use of this vaccine. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: The models adopted, with small variations, a parsimonious vaccine mode 
      of action that was able to reproduce quantitative features of the observed trial 
      data. The adopted mode of action assumed that vaccination, similarly to natural
      infection, induces transient, heterologous protection and, further, establishes a
      long-lasting immunogenic memory, which determines disease severity of subsequent 
      infections. The default vaccination policy considered was routine vaccination of 
      9-y-old children in a three-dose schedule at 80% coverage. The outcomes examined 
      were the impact of vaccination on infections, symptomatic dengue, hospitalised
      dengue, deaths, and cost-effectiveness over a 30-y postvaccination period. Case
      definitions were chosen in accordance with the Phase III trials. All models
      predicted that in settings with moderate to high dengue endemicity (SP9 >/= 50%),
      the default vaccination policy would reduce the burden of dengue disease for the 
      population by 6%-25% (all simulations: -3%-34%) and in high-transmission settings
      (SP9 >/= 70%) by 13%-25% (all simulations: 10%- 34%). These endemicity levels are
      representative of the participating sites in both Phase III trials. In contrast, 
      in settings with low transmission intensity (SP9 </= 30%), the models predicted
      that vaccination could lead to a substantial increase in hospitalisation because 
      of dengue. Modelling reduced vaccine coverage or the addition of catch-up
      campaigns showed that the impact of vaccination scaled approximately linearly
      with the number of people vaccinated. In assessing the optimal age of
      vaccination, we found that targeting older children could increase the net
      benefit of vaccination in settings with moderate transmission intensity (SP9 =
      50%). Overall, vaccination was predicted to be potentially cost-effective in most
      endemic settings if priced competitively. The results are based on the assumption
      that the vaccine acts similarly to natural infection. This assumption is
      consistent with the available trial results but cannot be directly validated in
      the absence of additional data. Furthermore, uncertainties remain regarding the
      level of protection provided against disease versus infection and the rate at
      which vaccine-induced protection declines. CONCLUSIONS: Dengvaxia has the
      potential to reduce the burden of dengue disease in areas of moderate to high
      dengue endemicity. However, the potential risks of vaccination in areas with
      limited exposure to dengue as well as the local costs and benefits of routine
      vaccination are important considerations for the inclusion of Dengvaxia into
      existing immunisation programmes. These results were important inputs into WHO
      global policy for use of this licensed dengue vaccine.

TI  - Educational Outreach with an Integrated Clinical Tool for Nurse-Led
      Non-communicable Chronic Disease Management in Primary Care in South Africa: A
      Pragmatic Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002178
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In many low-income countries, care for patients with non-communicable
      diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions is provided by nurses. The benefits 
      of nurse substitution and supplementation in NCD care in high-income settings are
      well recognised, but evidence from low- and middle-income countries is limited.
      Primary Care 101 (PC101) is a programme designed to support and expand nurses'
      role in NCD care, comprising educational outreach to nurses and a clinical
      management tool with enhanced prescribing provisions. We evaluated the effect of 
      the programme on primary care nurses' capacity to manage NCDs. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: In a cluster randomised controlled trial design, 38 public sector
      primary care clinics in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, were randomised.
      Nurses in the intervention clinics were trained to use the PC101 management tool 
      during educational outreach sessions delivered by health department trainers and 
      were authorised to prescribe an expanded range of drugs for several NCDs. Control
      clinics continued use of the Practical Approach to Lung Health and HIV/AIDS in
      South Africa (PALSA PLUS) management tool and usual training. Patients attending 
      these clinics with one or more of hypertension (3,227), diabetes (1,842), chronic
      respiratory disease (1,157) or who screened positive for depression (2,466),
      totalling 4,393 patients, were enrolled between 28 March 2011 and 10 November
      2011. Primary outcomes were treatment intensification in the hypertension,
      diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease cohorts, defined as the proportion of
      patients in whom treatment was escalated during follow-up over 14 mo, and case
      detection in the depression cohort. Primary outcome data were analysed for 2,110 
      (97%) intervention and 2,170 (97%) control group patients. Treatment
      intensification rates in intervention clinics were not superior to those in the
      control clinics (hypertension: 44% in the intervention group versus 40% in the
      control group, risk ratio [RR] 1.08 [95% CI 0.94 to 1.24; p = 0.252]; diabetes:
      57% versus 50%, RR 1.10 [0.97 to 1.24; p = 0.126]; chronic respiratory disease:
      14% versus 12%, RR 1.08 [0.75 to 1.55; p = 0.674]), nor was case detection of
      depression (18% versus 24%, RR 0.76 [0.53 to 1.10; p = 0.142]). No adverse
      effects of the nurses' expanded scope of practice were observed. Limitations of
      the study include dependence on self-reported diagnoses for inclusion in the
      patient cohorts, limited data on uptake of PC101 by users, reliance on process
      outcomes, and insufficient resources to measure important health outcomes, such
      as HbA1c, at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Educational outreach to primary care nurses 
      to train them in the use of a management tool involving an expanded role in
      managing NCDs was feasible and safe but was not associated with treatment
      intensification or improved case detection for index diseases. This
      notwithstanding, the intervention, with adjustments to improve its effectiveness,
      has been adopted for implementation in primary care clinics throughout South
      Africa. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered with Current Controlled
      Trials (ISRCTN20283604).

TI  - Willingness to Know the Cause of Death and Hypothetical Acceptability of the
      Minimally Invasive Autopsy in Six Diverse African and Asian Settings: A Mixed
      Methods Socio-Behavioural Study.
PG  - e1002172
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) is being investigated as an
      alternative to complete diagnostic autopsies for cause of death (CoD)
      investigation. Before potential implementation of the MIA in settings where
      post-mortem procedures are unusual, a thorough assessment of its feasibility and 
      acceptability is essential. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a
      socio-behavioural study at the community level to understand local attitudes and 
      perceptions related to death and the hypothetical feasibility and acceptability
      of conducting MIAs in six distinct settings in Gabon, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique,
      and Pakistan. A total of 504 interviews (135 key informants, 175 health providers
      [including formal health professionals and traditional or informal health
      providers], and 194 relatives of deceased people) were conducted. The constructs 
      "willingness to know the CoD" and "hypothetical acceptability of MIAs" were
      quantified and analysed using the framework analysis approach to compare the
      occurrence of themes related to acceptability across participants. Overall, 75%
      (379/504) of the participants would be willing to know the CoD of a relative. The
      overall hypothetical acceptability of MIA on a relative was 73% (366/504). The
      idea of the MIA was acceptable because of its perceived simplicity and rapidity
      and particularly for not "mutilating" the body. Further, MIAs were believed to
      help prevent infectious diseases, address hereditary diseases, clarify the CoD,
      and avoid witchcraft accusations and conflicts within families. The main concerns
      regarding the procedure included the potential breach of confidentiality on the
      CoD, the misperception of organ removal, and the incompatibility with some
      religious beliefs. Formal health professionals were concerned about possible
      contradictions between the MIA findings and the clinical pre-mortem diagnoses.
      Acceptability of the MIA was equally high among Christian and Islamic
      communities. However, in the two predominantly Muslim countries, MIA
      acceptability was higher in Mali than in Pakistan. While the results of the study
      are encouraging for the potential use of the MIA for CoD investigation in
      low-income settings, they remain hypothetical, with a need for confirmation with 
      real-life MIA implementation and in populations beyond Health and Demographic
      Surveillance System areas. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high level of
      interest in knowing the CoD of a relative and a high hypothetical acceptability
      of MIAs as a tool for CoD investigation across six distinct settings. These
      findings anticipate potential barriers and facilitators, both at the health
      facility and community level, essential for local tailoring of recommendations
      for future MIA implementation.

TI  - Validity of a Minimally Invasive Autopsy for Cause of Death Determination in
      Adults in Mozambique: An Observational Study.
PG  - e1002171
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to identify tools able to provide reliable
      information on the cause of death in low-income regions, since current methods
      (verbal autopsy, clinical records, and complete autopsies) are either inaccurate,
      not feasible, or poorly accepted. We aimed to compare the performance of a
      standardized minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) approach with that of the gold
      standard, the complete diagnostic autopsy (CDA), in a series of adults who died
      at Maputo Central Hospital in Mozambique. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this
      observational study, coupled MIAs and CDAs were performed in 112 deceased
      patients. The MIA analyses were done blindly, without knowledge of the clinical
      data or the results of the CDA. We compared the MIA diagnosis with the CDA
      diagnosis of cause of death. CDA diagnoses comprised infectious diseases (80;
      71.4%), malignant tumors (16; 14.3%), and other diseases, including
      non-infectious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, kidney, and lung diseases (16;
      14.3%). A MIA diagnosis was obtained in 100/112 (89.2%) cases. The overall
      concordance between the MIA diagnosis and CDA diagnosis was 75.9% (85/112). The
      concordance was higher for infectious diseases and malignant tumors (63/80
      [78.8%] and 13/16 [81.3%], respectively) than for other diseases (9/16; 56.2%).
      The specific microorganisms causing death were identified in the MIA in 62/74
      (83.8%) of the infectious disease deaths with a recognized cause. The main
      limitation of the analysis is that both the MIA and the CDA include some degree
      of expert subjective interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: A simple MIA procedure can
      identify the cause of death in many adult deaths in Mozambique. This tool could
      have a major role in improving the understanding and surveillance of causes of
      death in areas where infectious diseases are a common cause of mortality.

TI  - Effectiveness of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in Children under Ten Years of 
      Age in Senegal: A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomised Trial.
PG  - e1002175
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ), given each month during the transmission season, is
      recommended for children living in areas of the Sahel where malaria transmission 
      is highly seasonal. The recommendation for SMC is currently limited to children
      under five years of age, but, in many areas of seasonal transmission, the burden 
      in older children may justify extending this age limit. This study was done to
      determine the effectiveness of SMC in Senegalese children up to ten years of age.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: SMC was introduced into three districts over three years in
      central Senegal using a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised design. A census of the 
      population was undertaken and a surveillance system was established to record all
      deaths and to record all cases of malaria seen at health facilities. A
      pharmacovigilance system was put in place to detect adverse drug reactions.
      Fifty-four health posts were randomised. Nine started implementation of SMC in
      2008, 18 in 2009, and a further 18 in 2010, with 9 remaining as controls. In the 
      first year of implementation, SMC was delivered to children aged 3-59 months; the
      age range was then extended for the latter two years of the study to include
      children up to 10 years of age. Cluster sample surveys at the end of each
      transmission season were done to measure coverage of SMC and the prevalence of
      parasitaemia and anaemia, to monitor molecular markers of drug resistance, and to
      measure insecticide-treated net (ITN) use. Entomological monitoring and
      assessment of costs of delivery in each health post and of community attitudes to
      SMC were also undertaken. About 780,000 treatments were administered over three
      years. Coverage exceeded 80% each month. Mortality, the primary endpoint, was
      similar in SMC and control areas (4.6 and 4.5 per 1000 respectively in children
      under 5 years and 1.3 and 1.2 per 1000 in children 5-9 years of age; the overall 
      mortality rate ratio [SMC: no SMC] was 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.2, p = 0.496). A
      reduction of 60% (95% CI 54%-64%, p < 0.001) in the incidence of malaria cases
      confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a reduction of 69% (95% CI
      65%-72%, p < 0.001) in the number of treatments for malaria (confirmed and
      unconfirmed) was observed in children. In areas where SMC was implemented,
      incidence of confirmed malaria in adults and in children too old to receive SMC
      was reduced by 26% (95% CI 18%-33%, p < 0.001) and the total number of treatments
      for malaria (confirmed and unconfirmed) in these older age groups was reduced by 
      29% (95% CI 21%-35%, p < 0.001). One hundred and twenty-three children were
      admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe malaria, with 64 in control areas
      and 59 in SMC areas, showing a reduction in the incidence rate of severe disease 
      of 45% (95% CI 5%-68%, p = 0.031). Estimates of the reduction in the prevalence
      of parasitaemia at the end of the transmission season in SMC areas were 68% (95% 
      CI 35%-85%) p = 0.002 in 2008, 84% (95% CI 58%-94%, p < 0.001) in 2009, and 30%
      (95% CI -130%-79%, p = 0.56) in 2010. SMC was well tolerated with no serious
      adverse reactions attributable to SMC drugs. Vomiting was the most commonly
      reported mild adverse event but was reported in less than 1% of treatments. The
      average cost of delivery was US$0.50 per child per month, but varied widely
      depending on the size of the health post. Limitations included the low rate of
      mortality, which limited our ability to detect an effect on this endpoint.
      CONCLUSIONS: SMC substantially reduced the incidence of outpatient cases of
      malaria and of severe malaria in children, but no difference in all-cause
      mortality was observed. Introduction of SMC was associated with an overall
      reduction in malaria incidence in untreated age groups. In many areas of Africa
      with seasonal malaria, there is a substantial burden in older children that could
      be prevented by SMC. SMC in older children is well tolerated and effective and
      can contribute to reducing malaria transmission. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Exposure Patterns Driving Ebola Transmission in West Africa: A Retrospective
      Observational Study.
PG  - e1002170
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ongoing West African Ebola epidemic began in December 2013 in
      Guinea, probably from a single zoonotic introduction. As a result of ineffective 
      initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 
      4 May 2015, it had resulted in more than 19,000 probable and confirmed Ebola
      cases, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746).
      Here, we present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying
      drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control could be improved.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 19,000 confirmed and probable Ebola cases were
      reported in West Africa by 4 May 2015. Individuals with confirmed or probable
      Ebola ("cases") were asked if they had exposure to other potential Ebola cases
      ("potential source contacts") in a funeral or non-funeral context prior to
      becoming ill. We performed retrospective analyses of a case line-list, collated
      from national databases of case investigation forms that have been reported to
      WHO. These analyses were initially performed to assist WHO's response during the 
      epidemic, and have been updated for publication. We analysed data from 3,529
      cases in Guinea, 5,343 in Liberia, and 10,746 in Sierra Leone; exposures were
      reported by 33% of cases. The proportion of cases reporting a funeral exposure
      decreased over time. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p < 0.001)
      between this proportion in a given district for a given month and the
      within-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction 
      number (R). We also found a negative correlation (r = -0.37, p < 0.001) between R
      and the district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted within </=4 days of
      symptom onset. These two proportions were not correlated, suggesting that reduced
      funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local
      transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14% of potential source contacts
      as cases in the case line-list. Linking cases to the contacts who potentially
      infected them provided information on the transmission network. This revealed a
      high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with only 20% of cases
      accounting for at least 73% of new infections, a phenomenon often called
      super-spreading. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify
      predictors of being named as a potential source contact. These were similar for
      funeral and non-funeral contacts: severe symptoms, death, non-hospitalisation,
      older age, and travelling prior to symptom onset. Non-funeral exposures were
      strongly peaked around the death of the contact. There was evidence that
      hospitalisation reduced but did not eliminate onward exposures. We found that
      Ebola treatment units were better than other health care facilities at preventing
      exposure from hospitalised and deceased individuals. The principal limitation of 
      our analysis is limited data quality, with cases not being entered into the
      database, cases not reporting exposures, or data being entered incorrectly
      (especially dates, and possible misclassifications). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving
      elimination of Ebola is challenging, partly because of super-spreading. Safe
      funeral practices and fast hospitalisation contributed to the containment of this
      Ebola epidemic. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are
      vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten
      and maintain elimination of the virus from the human population.

TI  - Under-prescribing of Prevention Drugs and Primary Prevention of Stroke and
      Transient Ischaemic Attack in UK General Practice: A Retrospective Analysis.
PG  - e1002169
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability; worldwide it is
      estimated that 16.9 million people have a first stroke each year. Lipid-lowering,
      anticoagulant, and antihypertensive drugs can prevent strokes, but may be
      underused. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed anonymised electronic primary care
      records from a United Kingdom (UK) primary care database that covers
      approximately 6% of the UK population. Patients with first-ever stroke/transient 
      ischaemic attack (TIA), >/=18 y, with diagnosis between 1 January 2009 and 31
      December 2013, were included. Drugs were considered under-prescribed when
      lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, or antihypertensive drugs were clinically
      indicated but were not prescribed prior to the time of stroke or TIA. The
      proportions of strokes or TIAs with prevention drugs under-prescribed, when
      clinically indicated, were calculated. In all, 29,043 stroke/TIA patients met the
      inclusion criteria; 17,680 had >/=1 prevention drug clinically indicated: 16,028 
      had lipid-lowering drugs indicated, 3,194 anticoagulant drugs, and 7,008
      antihypertensive drugs. At least one prevention drug was not prescribed when
      clinically indicated in 54% (9,579/17,680) of stroke/TIA patients: 49%
      (7,836/16,028) were not prescribed lipid-lowering drugs, 52% (1,647/3,194) were
      not prescribed anticoagulant drugs, and 25% (1,740/7,008) were not prescribed
      antihypertensive drugs. The limitations of our study are that our definition of
      under-prescribing of drugs for stroke/TIA prevention did not address patients'
      adherence to medication or medication targets, such as blood pressure levels.
      CONCLUSIONS: In our study, over half of people eligible for lipid-lowering,
      anticoagulant, or antihypertensive drugs were not prescribed them prior to first 
      stroke/TIA. We estimate that approximately 12,000 first strokes could potentially
      be prevented annually in the UK through optimal prescribing of these drugs.
      Improving prescription of lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive
      drugs is important to reduce the incidence and burden of stroke and TIA.

TI  - Measures of Malaria Burden after Long-Lasting Insecticidal Net Distribution and
      Indoor Residual Spraying at Three Sites in Uganda: A Prospective Observational
      Study.
PG  - e1002167
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002167 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying
      of insecticide (IRS) are the primary vector control interventions used to prevent
      malaria in Africa. Although both interventions are effective in some settings,
      high-quality evidence is rarely available to evaluate their effectiveness
      following deployment by a national malaria control program. In Uganda, we
      measured changes in key malaria indicators following universal LLIN distribution 
      in three sites, with the addition of IRS at one of these sites. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Comprehensive malaria surveillance was conducted from October 1, 2011, 
      to March 31, 2016, in three sub-counties with relatively low (Walukuba), moderate
      (Kihihi), and high transmission (Nagongera). Between 2013 and 2014, universal
      LLIN distribution campaigns were conducted in all sites, and in December 2014,
      IRS with the carbamate bendiocarb was initiated in Nagongera. High-quality
      surveillance evaluated malaria metrics and mosquito exposure before and after
      interventions through (a) enhanced health-facility-based surveillance to estimate
      malaria test positivity rate (TPR), expressed as the number testing positive for 
      malaria/number tested for malaria (number of children tested for malaria:
      Walukuba = 42,833, Kihihi = 28,790, and Nagongera = 38,690); (b) cohort studies
      to estimate the incidence of malaria, expressed as the number of episodes per
      person-year [PPY] at risk (number of children observed: Walukuba = 340, Kihihi = 
      380, and Nagongera = 361); and (c) entomology surveys to estimate household-level
      human biting rate (HBR), expressed as the number of female Anopheles mosquitoes
      collected per house-night of collection (number of households observed: Walukuba 
      = 117, Kihihi = 107, and Nagongera = 107). The LLIN distribution campaign
      substantially increased LLIN coverage levels at the three sites to between 65.0% 
      and 95.5% of households with at least one LLIN. In Walukuba, over the 28-mo
      post-intervention period, universal LLIN distribution was associated with no
      change in the incidence of malaria (0.39 episodes PPY pre-intervention versus
      0.20 post-intervention; adjusted rate ratio [aRR] = 1.02, 95% CI 0.36-2.91, p =
      0.97) and non-significant reductions in the TPR (26.5% pre-intervention versus
      26.2% post-intervention; aRR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.46-1.06, p = 0.09) and HBR (1.07
      mosquitoes per house-night pre-intervention versus 0.71 post-intervention; aRR = 
      0.41, 95% CI 0.14-1.18, p = 0.10). In Kihihi, over the 21-mo post-intervention
      period, universal LLIN distribution was associated with a reduction in the
      incidence of malaria (1.77 pre-intervention versus 1.89 post-intervention; aRR = 
      0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.98, p = 0.04) but no significant change in the TPR (49.3%
      pre-intervention versus 45.9% post-intervention; aRR = 0.83, 95% 0.58-1.18, p =
      0.30) or HBR (4.06 pre-intervention versus 2.44 post-intervention; aRR = 0.71,
      95% CI 0.30-1.64, p = 0.40). In Nagongera, over the 12-mo post-intervention
      period, universal LLIN distribution was associated with a reduction in the TPR
      (45.3% pre-intervention versus 36.5% post-intervention; aRR = 0.82, 95% CI
      0.76-0.88, p < 0.001) but no significant change in the incidence of malaria (2.82
      pre-intervention versus 3.28 post-intervention; aRR = 1.10, 95% 0.76-1.59, p =
      0.60) or HBR (41.04 pre-intervention versus 20.15 post-intervention; aRR = 0.87, 
      95% CI 0.31-2.47, p = 0.80). The addition of three rounds of IRS at ~6-mo
      intervals in Nagongera was followed by clear decreases in all outcomes: incidence
      of malaria (3.25 pre-intervention versus 0.63 post-intervention; aRR = 0.13, 95% 
      CI 0.07-0.27, p < 0.001), TPR (37.8% pre-intervention versus 15.0%
      post-intervention; aRR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.49-0.60, p < 0.001), and HBR (18.71
      pre-intervention versus 3.23 post-intervention; aRR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.17-0.50, p <
      0.001). High levels of pyrethroid resistance were documented at all three study
      sites. Limitations of the study included the observational study design, the lack
      of contemporaneous control groups, and that the interventions were implemented
      under programmatic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Universal distribution of LLINs at
      three sites with varying transmission intensity was associated with modest
      declines in the burden of malaria for some indicators, but the addition of IRS at
      the highest transmission site was associated with a marked decline in the burden 
      of malaria for all indicators. In highly endemic areas of Africa with widespread 
      pyrethroid resistance, IRS using alternative insecticide formulations may be
      needed to achieve substantial gains in malaria control.

TI  - Promoting Partner Testing and Couples Testing through Secondary Distribution of
      HIV Self-Tests: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e1002166
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Achieving higher rates of partner HIV testing and couples testing
      among pregnant and postpartum women in sub-Saharan Africa is essential for the
      success of combination HIV prevention, including the prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission. We aimed to determine whether providing multiple
      HIV self-tests to pregnant and postpartum women for secondary distribution is
      more effective at promoting partner testing and couples testing than conventional
      strategies based on invitations to clinic-based testing. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      conducted a randomized trial in Kisumu, Kenya, between June 11, 2015, and January
      15, 2016. Six hundred antenatal and postpartum women aged 18-39 y were randomized
      to an HIV self-testing (HIVST) group or a comparison group. Participants in the
      HIVST group were given two oral-fluid-based HIV test kits, instructed on how to
      use them, and encouraged to distribute a test kit to their male partner or use
      both kits for testing as a couple. Participants in the comparison group were
      given an invitation card for clinic-based HIV testing and encouraged to
      distribute the card to their male partner, a routine practice in many health
      clinics. The primary outcome was partner testing within 3 mo of enrollment. Among
      570 participants analyzed, partner HIV testing was more likely in the HIVST group
      (90.8%, 258/284) than the comparison group (51.7%, 148/286; difference = 39.1%,
      95% CI 32.4% to 45.8%, p < 0.001). Couples testing was also more likely in the
      HIVST group than the comparison group (75.4% versus 33.2%, difference = 42.1%,
      95% CI 34.7% to 49.6%, p < 0.001). No participants reported intimate partner
      violence due to HIV testing. This study was limited by self-reported outcomes, a 
      common limitation in many studies involving HIVST due to the private manner in
      which self-tests are meant to be used. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of multiple HIV
      self-tests to women seeking antenatal and postpartum care was successful in
      promoting partner testing and couples testing. This approach warrants further
      consideration as countries develop HIVST policies and seek new ways to increase
      awareness of HIV status among men and promote couples testing. TRIAL

TI  - Pregnancy-Associated Changes in Pharmacokinetics: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e1002160
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women are commonly prescribed a variety of medications during
      pregnancy. As most organ systems are affected by the substantial anatomical and
      physiological changes that occur during pregnancy, it is expected that
      pharmacokinetics (PK) (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of
      drugs) would also be affected in ways that may necessitate changes in dosing
      schedules. The objective of this study was to systematically identify existing
      clinically relevant evidence on PK changes during pregnancy. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid),
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), and Web of Science
      (Thomson Reuters), from database inception to August 31, 2015. An update of the
      search from September 1, 2015, to May 20, 2016, was performed, and relevant data 
      were added to the present review. No language or date restrictions were applied. 
      All publications of clinical PK studies involving a group of pregnant women with 
      a comparison to nonpregnant participants or nonpregnant population data were
      eligible to be included in this review. A total of 198 studies involving 121
      different medications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In these studies,
      commonly investigated drug classes included antiretrovirals (54 studies),
      antiepileptic drugs (27 studies), antibiotics (23 studies), antimalarial drugs
      (22 studies), and cardiovascular drugs (17 studies). Overall,
      pregnancy-associated changes in PK parameters were often observed as consistent
      findings among many studies, particularly enhanced drug elimination and decreased
      exposure to total drugs (bound and unbound to plasma proteins) at a given dose.
      However, associated alterations in clinical responses and outcomes, or lack
      thereof, remain largely unknown. CONCLUSION: This systematic review of
      pregnancy-associated PK changes identifies a significant gap between the
      accumulating knowledge of PK changes in pregnant women and our understanding of
      their clinical impact for both mother and fetus. It is essential for clinicians
      to be aware of these unique pregnancy-related changes in PK, and to critically
      examine their clinical implications.

TI  - Projected Impact of Mexico's Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax Policy on Diabetes and 
      Cardiovascular Disease: A Modeling Study.
PG  - e1002158
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rates of diabetes in Mexico are among the highest worldwide. In 2014,
      Mexico instituted a nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in order
      to reduce the high level of SSB consumption, a preventable cause of diabetes and 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). We used an established computer simulation model of
      CVD and country-specific data on demographics, epidemiology, SSB consumption, and
      short-term changes in consumption following the SSB tax in order to project
      potential long-range health and economic impacts of SSB taxation in Mexico.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-Mexico, a
      state transition model of Mexican adults aged 35-94 y, to project the potential
      future effects of reduced SSB intake on diabetes incidence, CVD events, direct
      diabetes healthcare costs, and mortality over 10 y. Model inputs included
      short-term changes in SSB consumption in response to taxation (price elasticity) 
      and data from government and market research surveys and public healthcare
      institutions. Two main scenarios were modeled: a 10% reduction in SSB consumption
      (corresponding to the reduction observed after tax implementation) and a 20%
      reduction in SSB consumption (possible with increases in taxation levels and/or
      additional measures to curb consumption). Given uncertainty about the degree to
      which Mexicans will replace calories from SSBs with calories from other sources, 
      we evaluated a range of values for calorie compensation. We projected that a 10% 
      reduction in SSB consumption with 39% calorie compensation among Mexican adults
      would result in about 189,300 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 155,400-218,100)
      fewer incident type 2 diabetes cases, 20,400 fewer incident strokes and
      myocardial infarctions, and 18,900 fewer deaths occurring from 2013 to 2022. This
      scenario predicts that the SSB tax could save Mexico 983 million international
      dollars (95% UI $769 million-$1,173 million). The largest relative and absolute
      reductions in diabetes and CVD events occurred in the youngest age group modeled 
      (35-44 y). This study's strengths include the use of an established mathematical 
      model of CVD and use of contemporary Mexican vital statistics, data from health
      surveys, healthcare costs, and SSB price elasticity estimates as well as
      probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty. 
      The limitations of the study include reliance on US-based studies for certain
      inputs where Mexico-specific data were lacking (specifically the associations
      between risk factors and CVD outcomes [from the Framingham Heart Study] and SSB
      calorie compensation assumptions), limited data on healthcare costs other than
      those related to diabetes, and lack of information on long-term SSB price
      elasticity that is specific to geographic and economic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Mexico's high diabetes prevalence represents a public health crisis. While the
      long-term impact of Mexico's SSB tax is not yet known, these projections, based
      on observed consumption reductions, suggest that Mexico's SSB tax may
      substantially decrease morbidity and mortality from diabetes and CVD while
      reducing healthcare costs.

TI  - Risk Factors for Childhood Stunting in 137 Developing Countries: A Comparative
      Risk Assessment Analysis at Global, Regional, and Country Levels.
PG  - e1002164
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stunting affects one-third of children under 5 y old in developing
      countries, and 14% of childhood deaths are attributable to it. A large number of 
      risk factors for stunting have been identified in epidemiological studies.
      However, the relative contribution of these risk factors to stunting has not been
      examined across countries. We estimated the number of stunting cases among
      children aged 24-35 mo (i.e., at the end of the 1,000 days' period of
      vulnerability) that are attributable to 18 risk factors in 137 developing
      countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We classified risk factors into five clusters:
      maternal nutrition and infection, teenage motherhood and short birth intervals,
      fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preterm birth, child nutrition and infection, 
      and environmental factors. We combined published estimates and individual-level
      data from population-based surveys to derive risk factor prevalence in each
      country in 2010 and identified the most recent meta-analysis or conducted de novo
      reviews to derive effect sizes. We estimated the prevalence of stunting and the
      number of stunting cases that were attributable to each risk factor and cluster
      of risk factors by country and region. The leading risk worldwide was FGR,
      defined as being term and small for gestational age, and 10.8 million cases (95% 
      CI 9.1 million-12.6 million) of stunting (out of 44.1 million) were attributable 
      to it, followed by unimproved sanitation, with 7.2 million (95% CI 6.3
      million-8.2 million), and diarrhea with 5.8 million (95% CI 2.4 million-9.2
      million). FGR and preterm birth was the leading risk factor cluster in all
      regions. Environmental risks had the second largest estimated impact on stunting 
      globally and in the South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia and Pacific
      regions, whereas child nutrition and infection was the second leading cluster of 
      risk factors in other regions. Although extensive, our analysis is limited to
      risk factors for which effect sizes and country-level exposure data were
      available. The global nature of the study required approximations (e.g., using
      exposures estimated among women of reproductive age as a proxy for maternal
      exposures, or estimating the impact of risk factors on stunting through a
      mediator rather than directly on stunting). Finally, as is standard in global
      risk factor analyses, we used the effect size of risk factors on stunting from
      meta-analyses of epidemiological studies and assumed that proportional effects
      were fairly similar across countries. CONCLUSIONS: FGR and unimproved sanitation 
      are the leading risk factors for stunting in developing countries. Reducing the
      burden of stunting requires a paradigm shift from interventions focusing solely
      on children and infants to those that reach mothers and families and improve
      their living environment and nutrition.

TI  - The Tuberculosis Cascade of Care in India's Public Sector: A Systematic Review
      and Meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002149
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: India has 23% of the global burden of active tuberculosis (TB)
      patients and 27% of the world's "missing" patients, which includes those who may 
      not have received effective TB care and could potentially spread TB to others.
      The "cascade of care" is a useful model for visualizing deficiencies in case
      detection and retention in care, in order to prioritize interventions. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: The care cascade constructed in this paper focuses on the Revised
      National TB Control Programme (RNTCP), which treats about half of India's TB
      patients. We define the TB cascade as including the following patient
      populations: total prevalent active TB patients in India, TB patients who reach
      and undergo evaluation at RNTCP diagnostic facilities, patients successfully
      diagnosed with TB, patients who start treatment, patients retained to treatment
      completion, and patients who achieve 1-y recurrence-free survival. We estimate
      each step of the cascade for 2013 using data from two World Health Organization
      (WHO) reports (2014-2015), one WHO dataset (2015), and three RNTCP reports
      (2014-2016). In addition, we conduct three targeted systematic reviews of the
      scientific literature to identify 39 unique articles published from 2000-2015
      that provide additional data on five indicators that help estimate different
      steps of the TB cascade. We construct separate care cascades for the overall
      population of patients with active TB and for patients with specific forms of
      TB-including new smear-positive, new smear-negative, retreatment smear-positive, 
      and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. The WHO estimated that there were 2,700,000
      (95%CI: 1,800,000-3,800,000) prevalent TB patients in India in 2013. Of these
      patients, we estimate that 1,938,027 (72%) TB patients were evaluated at RNTCP
      facilities; 1,629,906 (60%) were successfully diagnosed; 1,417,838 (53%) got
      registered for treatment; 1,221,764 (45%) completed treatment; and 1,049,237
      (95%CI: 1,008,775-1,083,243), or 39%, of 2,700,000 TB patients achieved the
      optimal outcome of 1-y recurrence-free survival. The separate cascades for
      different forms of TB highlight different patterns of patient attrition.
      Pretreatment loss to follow-up of diagnosed patients and post-treatment TB
      recurrence were major points of attrition in the new smear-positive TB cascade.
      In the new smear-negative and MDR TB cascades, a substantial proportion of
      patients who were evaluated at RNTCP diagnostic facilities were not successfully 
      diagnosed. Retreatment smear-positive and MDR TB patients had poorer treatment
      outcomes than the general TB population. Limitations of our analysis include the 
      lack of available data on the cascade of care in the private sector and
      substantial uncertainty regarding the 1-y period prevalence of TB in India.
      CONCLUSIONS: Increasing case detection is critical to improving outcomes in
      India's TB cascade of care, especially for smear-negative and MDR TB patients.
      For new smear-positive patients, pretreatment loss to follow-up and
      post-treatment TB recurrence are considerable points of attrition that may
      contribute to ongoing TB transmission. Future multisite studies providing more
      accurate information on key steps in the public sector TB cascade and extension
      of this analysis to private sector patients may help to better target
      interventions and resources for TB control in India.

TI  - The Global Burden of Latent Tuberculosis Infection: A Re-estimation Using
      Mathematical Modelling.
PG  - e1002152
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The existing estimate of the global burden of latent TB infection
      (LTBI) as "one-third" of the world population is nearly 20 y old. Given the
      importance of controlling LTBI as part of the End TB Strategy for eliminating TB 
      by 2050, changes in demography and scientific understanding, and progress in TB
      control, it is important to re-assess the global burden of LTBI. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We constructed trends in annual risk in infection (ARI) for countries
      between 1934 and 2014 using a combination of direct estimates of ARI from LTBI
      surveys (131 surveys from 1950 to 2011) and indirect estimates of ARI calculated 
      from World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates of smear positive TB prevalence
      from 1990 to 2014. Gaussian process regression was used to generate ARIs for
      country-years without data and to represent uncertainty. Estimated ARI
      time-series were applied to the demography in each country to calculate the
      number and proportions of individuals infected, recently infected (infected
      within 2 y), and recently infected with isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains.
      Resulting estimates were aggregated by WHO region. We estimated the contribution 
      of existing infections to TB incidence in 2035 and 2050. In 2014, the global
      burden of LTBI was 23.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 20.4%-26.4%), amounting 
      to approximately 1.7 billion people. WHO South-East Asia, Western-Pacific, and
      Africa regions had the highest prevalence and accounted for around 80% of those
      with LTBI. Prevalence of recent infection was 0.8% (95% UI: 0.7%-0.9%) of the
      global population, amounting to 55.5 (95% UI: 48.2-63.8) million individuals
      currently at high risk of TB disease, of which 10.9% (95% UI:10.2%-11.8%) was
      isoniazid-resistant. Current LTBI alone, assuming no additional infections from
      2015 onwards, would be expected to generate TB incidences in the region of 16.5
      per 100,000 per year in 2035 and 8.3 per 100,000 per year in 2050. Limitations
      included the quantity and methodological heterogeneity of direct ARI data, and
      limited evidence to inform on potential clearance of LTBI. CONCLUSIONS: We
      estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the
      global population. Investment in new tools to improve diagnosis and treatment of 
      those with LTBI at risk of progressing to disease is urgently needed to address
      this latent reservoir if the 2050 target of eliminating TB is to be reached.

TI  - Impacts on Breastfeeding Practices of At-Scale Strategies That Combine Intensive 
      Interpersonal Counseling, Mass Media, and Community Mobilization: Results of
      Cluster-Randomized Program Evaluations in Bangladesh and Viet Nam.
PG  - e1002159
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002159 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recommendations supporting optimal breastfeeding, the number 
      of women practicing exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) remains low, and few
      interventions have demonstrated implementation and impact at scale. Alive &
      Thrive was implemented over a period of 6 y (2009-2014) and aimed to improve
      breastfeeding practices through intensified interpersonal counseling (IPC), mass 
      media (MM), and community mobilization (CM) intervention components delivered at 
      scale in the context of policy advocacy (PA) in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In
      Bangladesh, IPC was delivered through a large non-governmental health program; in
      Viet Nam, it was integrated into government health facilities. This study
      evaluated the population-level impact of intensified IPC, MM, CM, and PA
      (intensive) compared to standard nutrition counseling and less intensive MM, CM, 
      and PA (non-intensive) on breastfeeding practices in these two countries. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: A cluster-randomized evaluation design was employed in each
      country. For the evaluation sample, 20 sub-districts in Bangladesh and 40
      communes in Viet Nam were randomized to either the intensive or the non-intensive
      group. Cross-sectional surveys (n ~ 500 children 0-5.9 mo old per group per
      country) were implemented at baseline (June 7-August 29, 2010, in Viet Nam; April
      28-June 26, 2010, in Bangladesh) and endline (June 16-August 30, 2014, in Viet
      Nam; April 20-June 23, 2014, in Bangladesh). Difference-in-differences estimates 
      (DDEs) of impact were calculated, adjusting for clustering. In Bangladesh,
      improvements were significantly greater in the intensive compared to the
      non-intensive group for the proportion of women who reported practicing EBF in
      the previous 24 h (DDE 36.2 percentage points [pp], 95% CI 21.0-51.5, p < 0.001; 
      prevalence in intensive group rose from 48.5% to 87.6%) and engaging in early
      initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) (16.7 pp, 95% CI 2.8-30.6, p = 0.021; 63.7% to
      94.2%). In Viet Nam, EBF increases were greater in the intensive group (27.9 pp, 
      95% CI 17.7-38.1, p < 0.001; 18.9% to 57.8%); EIBF declined (60.0% to 53.2%) in
      the intensive group, but less than in the non-intensive group (57.4% to 40.6%;
      DDE 10.0 pp, 95% CI -1.3 to 21.4, p = 0.072). Our impact estimates may
      underestimate the full potential of such a multipronged intervention because the 
      evaluation lacked a "pure control" area with no MM or national/provincial PA.
      CONCLUSIONS: At-scale interventions combining intensive IPC with MM, CM, and PA
      had greater positive impacts on breastfeeding practices in Bangladesh and Viet
      Nam than standard counseling with less intensive MM, CM, and PA. To our
      knowledge, this study is the first to document implementation and impacts of
      breastfeeding promotion at scale using rigorous evaluation designs. Strategies to
      design and deliver similar programs could improve breastfeeding practices in
      other contexts. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01678716 (Bangladesh)

TI  - Prophylactic Oral Dextrose Gel for Newborn Babies at Risk of Neonatal
      Hypoglycaemia: A Randomised Controlled Dose-Finding Trial (the Pre-hPOD Study).
PG  - e1002155
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypoglycaemia is common, affecting up to 15% of newborns,
      and can cause brain damage. Currently, there are no strategies, beyond early
      feeding, to prevent neonatal hypoglycaemia. Our aim was to determine a dose of
      40% oral dextrose gel that will prevent neonatal hypoglycaemia in newborn babies 
      at risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled dose-finding trial of buccal dextrose gel to prevent neonatal 
      hypoglycaemia at two hospitals in New Zealand. Babies at risk of hypoglycaemia
      (infant of a mother with diabetes, late preterm delivery, small or large
      birthweight, or other risk factors) but without indication for admission to a
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were randomly allocated either to one of four
      treatment groups: 40% dextrose at one of two doses (0.5 ml/kg = 200 mg/kg, or 1
      ml/kg = 400 mg/kg), either once at 1 h of age or followed by three additional
      doses of dextrose (0.5 ml/kg before feeds in the first 12 h); or to one of four
      corresponding placebo groups. Treatments were administered by massaging gel into 
      the buccal mucosa. The primary outcome was hypoglycaemia (<2.6 mM) in the first
      48 h. Secondary outcomes included admission to a NICU, admission for
      hypoglycaemia, and breastfeeding at discharge and at 6 wk. Prespecified potential
      dose limitations were tolerance of gel, time taken to administer, messiness, and 
      acceptability to parents. From August 2013 to November 2014, 416 babies were
      randomised. Compared to babies randomised to placebo, the risk of hypoglycaemia
      was lowest in babies randomised to a single dose of 200 mg/kg dextrose gel
      (relative risk [RR] 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.99, p = 0.04) but
      was not significantly different between dose groups (p = 0.21). Compared to
      multiple doses, single doses of gel were better tolerated, quicker to administer,
      and less messy, but these limitations were not different between dextrose and
      placebo gel groups. Babies who received any dose of dextrose gel were less likely
      to develop hypoglycaemia than those who received placebo (RR 0.79; 95% CI
      0.64-0.98, p = 0.03; number needed to treat = 10, 95% CI 5-115). Rates of NICU
      admission were similar (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.33-1.25, p = 0.19), but admission for
      hypoglycaemia was less common in babies randomised to dextrose gel (RR 0.46; 95% 
      CI 0.21-1.01, p = 0.05). Rates of breastfeeding were similar in both groups.
      Adverse effects were uncommon and not different between groups. A limitation of
      this study was that most of the babies in the trial were infants of mothers with 
      diabetes (73%), which may reduce the applicability of the results to babies from 
      other risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia can be
      reduced with a single dose of buccal 40% dextrose gel 200 mg/kg. A large
      randomised trial (Hypoglycaemia Prevention with Oral Dextrose [hPOD]) is under
      way to determine the effects on NICU admission and later outcomes. TRIAL

TI  - Conveying Equipoise during Recruitment for Clinical Trials: Qualitative Synthesis
      of Clinicians' Practices across Six Randomised Controlled Trials.
PG  - e1002147
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are essential for evidence-based 
      medicine and increasingly rely on front-line clinicians to recruit eligible
      patients. Clinicians' difficulties with negotiating equipoise is assumed to
      undermine recruitment, although these issues have not yet been empirically
      investigated in the context of observable events. We aimed to investigate how
      clinicians conveyed equipoise during RCT recruitment appointments across six
      RCTs, with a view to (i) identifying practices that supported or hindered
      equipoise communication and (ii) exploring how clinicians' reported intentions
      compared with their actual practices. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Six pragmatic
      UK-based RCTs were purposefully selected to include several clinical specialties 
      (e.g., oncology, surgery) and types of treatment comparison. The RCTs were all
      based in secondary-care hospitals (n = 16) around the UK. Clinicians recruiting
      to the RCTs were interviewed (n = 23) to understand their individual sense of
      equipoise about the RCT treatments and their intentions for communicating
      equipoise to patients. Appointments in which these clinicians presented the RCT
      to trial-eligible patients were audio-recorded (n = 105). The appointments were
      analysed using thematic and content analysis approaches to identify practices
      that supported or challenged equipoise communication. A sample of appointments
      was independently coded by three researchers to optimise reliability in reported 
      findings. Clinicians and patients provided full written consent to be interviewed
      and have appointments audio-recorded. Interviews revealed that clinicians' sense 
      of equipoise varied: although all were uncertain about which trial treatment was 
      optimal, they expressed different levels of uncertainty, ranging from complete
      ambivalence to clear beliefs that one treatment was superior. Irrespective of
      their personal views, all clinicians intended to set their personal biases aside 
      to convey trial treatments neutrally to patients (in accordance with existing
      evidence). However, equipoise was omitted or compromised in 48/105 (46%) of the
      recorded appointments. Three commonly recurring practices compromised equipoise
      communication across the RCTs, irrespective of clinical context. First, equipoise
      was overridden by clinicians offering treatment recommendations when patients
      appeared unsure how to proceed or when they asked for the clinician's expert
      advice. Second, clinicians contradicted equipoise by presenting imbalanced
      descriptions of trial treatments that conflicted with scientific information
      stated in the RCT protocols. Third, equipoise was undermined by clinicians
      disclosing their personal opinions or predictions about trial outcomes, based on 
      their intuition and experience. These broad practices were particularly
      demonstrated by clinicians who had indicated in interviews that they held less
      balanced views about trial treatments. A limitation of the study was that
      clinicians volunteering to take part in the research might have had a particular 
      interest in improving their communication skills. However, the frequency of
      occurrence of equipoise issues across the RCTs suggests that the findings are
      likely to be reflective of clinical recruiters' practices more widely.
      CONCLUSIONS: Communicating equipoise is a challenging process that is easily
      disrupted. Clinicians' personal views about trial treatments encroached on their 
      ability to convey equipoise to patients. Clinicians should be encouraged to
      reflect on personal biases and be mindful of the common ways in which these can
      arise in their discussions with patients. Common pitfalls that recurred
      irrespective of RCT context indicate opportunities for specific training in
      communication skills that would be broadly applicable to a wide clinical
      audience.

TI  - Obstetric Facility Quality and Newborn Mortality in Malawi: A Cross-Sectional
      Study.
PG  - e1002151
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ending preventable newborn deaths is a global health priority, but
      efforts to improve coverage of maternal and newborn care have not yielded
      expected gains in infant survival in many settings. One possible explanation is
      poor quality of clinical care. We assess facility quality and estimate the
      association of facility quality with neonatal mortality in Malawi. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Data on facility infrastructure as well as processes of routine and
      basic emergency obstetric care for all facilities in the country were obtained
      from 2013 Malawi Service Provision Assessment. Birth location and mortality for
      children born in the preceding two years were obtained from the 2013-2014
      Millennium Development Goals Endline Survey. Facilities were classified as higher
      quality if they ranked in the top 25% of delivery facilities based on an index of
      25 predefined quality indicators. To address risk selection (sicker mothers
      choosing or being referred to higher-quality facilities), we employed
      instrumental variable (IV) analysis to estimate the association of facility
      quality of care with neonatal mortality. We used the difference between distance 
      to the nearest facility and distance to a higher-quality delivery facility as the
      instrument. Four hundred sixty-seven of the 540 delivery facilities in Malawi,
      including 134 rated as higher quality, were linked to births in the population
      survey. The difference between higher- and lower-quality facilities was most
      pronounced in indicators of basic emergency obstetric care procedures.
      Higher-quality facilities were located a median distance of 3.3 km further from
      women than the nearest delivery facility and were more likely to be in urban
      areas. Among the 6,686 neonates analyzed, the overall neonatal mortality rate was
      17 per 1,000 live births. Delivery in a higher-quality facility (top 25%) was
      associated with a 2.3 percentage point lower newborn mortality (95% confidence
      interval [CI] -0.046, 0.000, p-value 0.047). These results imply a newborn
      mortality rate of 28 per 1,000 births at low-quality facilities and of 5 per
      1,000 births at the top 25% of facilities, accounting for maternal and newborn
      characteristics. This estimate applies to newborns whose mothers would switch
      from a lower-quality to a higher-quality facility if one were more accessible.
      Although we did not find an indication of unmeasured associations between the
      instrument and outcome, this remains a potential limitation of IV analysis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Poor quality of delivery facilities is associated with higher risk
      of newborn mortality in Malawi. A shift in focus from increasing utilization of
      delivery facilities to improving their quality is needed if global targets for
      further reductions in newborn mortality are to be achieved.

TI  - Burden of Six Healthcare-Associated Infections on European Population Health:
      Estimating Incidence-Based Disability-Adjusted Life Years through a Population
      Prevalence-Based Modelling Study.
PG  - e1002150
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)
      compared to other communicable diseases is an ongoing challenge given the need
      for good quality data on the incidence of these infections and the involved
      comorbidities. Based on the methodology of the Burden of Communicable Diseases in
      Europe (BCoDE) project and 2011-2012 data from the European Centre for Disease
      Prevention and Control (ECDC) point prevalence survey (PPS) of HAIs and
      antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals, we estimated the burden of
      six common HAIs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The included HAIs were
      healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), healthcare-associated urinary tract
      infection (HA UTI), surgical site infection (SSI), healthcare-associated
      Clostridium difficile infection (HA CDI), healthcare-associated neonatal sepsis, 
      and healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infection (HA primary BSI). The
      burden of these HAIs was measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
      Evidence relating to the disease progression pathway of each type of HAI was
      collected through systematic literature reviews, in order to estimate the risks
      attributable to HAIs. For each of the six HAIs, gender and age group prevalence
      from the ECDC PPS was converted into incidence rates by applying the Rhame and
      Sudderth formula. We adjusted for reduced life expectancy within the hospital
      population using three severity groups based on McCabe score data from the ECDC
      PPS. We estimated that 2,609,911 new cases of HAI occur every year in the
      European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). The cumulative burden of the 
      six HAIs was estimated at 501 DALYs per 100,000 general population each year in
      EU/EEA. HAP and HA primary BSI were associated with the highest burden and
      represented more than 60% of the total burden, with 169 and 145 DALYs per 100,000
      total population, respectively. HA UTI, SSI, HA CDI, and HA primary BSI ranked as
      the third to sixth syndromes in terms of burden of disease. HAP and HA primary
      BSI were associated with the highest burden because of their high severity. The
      cumulative burden of the six HAIs was higher than the total burden of all other
      32 communicable diseases included in the BCoDE 2009-2013 study. The main
      limitations of the study are the variability in the parameter estimates, in
      particular the disease models' case fatalities, and the use of the Rhame and
      Sudderth formula for estimating incident number of cases from prevalence data.
      CONCLUSIONS: We estimated the EU/EEA burden of HAIs in DALYs in 2011-2012 using a
      transparent and evidence-based approach that allows for combining estimates of
      morbidity and of mortality in order to compare with other diseases and to inform 
      a comprehensive ranking suitable for prioritization. Our results highlight the
      high burden of HAIs and the need for increased efforts for their prevention and
      control. Furthermore, our model should allow for estimations of the potential
      benefit of preventive measures on the burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA.

TI  - Core Outcome Set-STAndards for Reporting: The COS-STAR Statement.
PG  - e1002148
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002148 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Core outcome sets (COS) can enhance the relevance of research by
      ensuring that outcomes of importance to health service users and other people
      making choices about health care in a particular topic area are measured
      routinely. Over 200 COS to date have been developed, but the clarity of these
      reports is suboptimal. COS studies will not achieve their goal if reports of COS 
      are not complete and transparent. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In recognition of these
      issues, an international group that included experienced COS developers,
      methodologists, journal editors, potential users of COS (clinical trialists,
      systematic reviewers, and clinical guideline developers), and patient
      representatives developed the Core Outcome Set-STAndards for Reporting (COS-STAR)
      Statement as a reporting guideline for COS studies. The developmental process
      consisted of an initial reporting item generation stage and a two-round Delphi
      survey involving nearly 200 participants representing key stakeholder groups,
      followed by a consensus meeting. The COS-STAR Statement consists of a checklist
      of 18 items considered essential for transparent and complete reporting in all
      COS studies. The checklist items focus on the introduction, methods, results, and
      discussion section of a manuscript describing the development of a particular
      COS. A limitation of the COS-STAR Statement is that it was developed without
      representative views of low- and middle-income countries. COS have equal
      relevance to studies conducted in these areas, and, subsequently, this guideline 
      may need to evolve over time to encompass any additional challenges from
      developing COS in these areas. CONCLUSIONS: With many ongoing COS studies
      underway, the COS-STAR Statement should be a helpful resource to improve the
      reporting of COS studies for the benefit of all COS users.

TI  - Circulating Apolipoprotein E Concentration and Cardiovascular Disease Risk:
      Meta-analysis of Results from Three Studies.
PG  - e1002146
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of APOE genotype with circulating apolipoprotein E
      (ApoE) concentration and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is well established.
      However, the relationship of circulating ApoE concentration and CVD has received 
      little attention. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this, we measured circulating 
      ApoE concentration in 9,587 individuals (with 1,413 CVD events) from three
      studies with incident CVD events: two population-based studies, the English
      Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the men-only Northwick Park Heart Study
      II (NPHSII), and a nested sub-study of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes
      Trial (ASCOT). We examined the association of circulating ApoE with
      cardiovascular risk factors in the two population-based studies (ELSA and NPHSII)
      and the relationship between ApoE concentration and coronary heart disease and
      stroke in all three studies. Analyses were carried out within study, and, where
      appropriate, pooled effect estimates were derived using meta-analysis. In the
      population-based samples, circulating ApoE was associated with systolic blood
      pressure (correlation coefficient 0.08, p < 0.001, in both ELSA and NPHSII),
      total cholesterol (correlation coefficient 0.46 and 0.34 in ELSA and NPHSII,
      respectively; both p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (correlation
      coefficient 0.30 and 0.14, respectively; both p < 0.001), high-density
      lipoprotein (correlation coefficient 0.16 and -0.14, respectively; both p <
      0.001), and triglycerides (correlation coefficient 0.43 and 0.46, respectivly;
      both p < 0.001). In NPHSII, ApoE concentration was additionally associated with
      apolipoprotein B (correlation coefficient 0.13, p = 0.001) and lipoprotein(a)
      (correlation coefficient -0.11, p < 0.001). In the pooled analysis of ASCOT,
      ELSA, and NPHSII, there was no association of ApoE with CVD events; the odds
      ratio (OR) for CVD events per 1-standard-deviation higher ApoE concentration was 
      1.02 (95% CI 0.96, 1.09). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the
      OR for CVD per 1-standard-deviation higher ApoE concentration was 0.97 (95% CI
      0.82, 1.15). Limitations of these analyses include a polyclonal method of ApoE
      measurement, rather than isoform-specific measurement, a moderate sample size
      (although larger than any other study to our knowledge and with a long lag
      between ApoE measures), and CVD events that may attenuate an effect. CONCLUSIONS:
      In the largest study to date on this question, we found no evidence of an
      association of circulating ApoE concentration with CVD events. The established
      association of APOE genotype with CVD events may be explained by isoform-specific
      functions as well as other mechanisms, rather than circulating concentrations of 
      ApoE.

TI  - Impact on Epidemic Measles of Vaccination Campaigns Triggered by Disease
      Outbreaks or Serosurveys: A Modeling Study.
PG  - e1002144
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine vaccination supplemented by planned campaigns occurring at
      2-5 y intervals is the core of current measles control and elimination efforts.
      Yet, large, unexpected outbreaks still occur, even when control measures appear
      effective. Supplementing these activities with mass vaccination campaigns
      triggered when low levels of measles immunity are observed in a sample of the
      population (i.e., serosurveys) or incident measles cases occur may provide a way 
      to limit the size of outbreaks. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Measles incidence was
      simulated using stochastic age-structured epidemic models in settings conducive
      to high or low measles incidence, roughly reflecting demographic contexts and
      measles vaccination coverage of four heterogeneous countries: Nepal, Niger,
      Yemen, and Zambia. Uncertainty in underlying vaccination rates was modeled.
      Scenarios with case- or serosurvey-triggered campaigns reaching 20% of the
      susceptible population were compared to scenarios without triggered campaigns.
      The best performing of the tested case-triggered campaigns prevent an average of 
      28,613 (95% CI 25,722-31,505) cases over 15 y in our highest incidence setting
      and 599 (95% CI 464-735) cases in the lowest incidence setting.
      Serosurvey-triggered campaigns can prevent 89,173 (95% CI, 86,768-91,577) and 744
      (612-876) cases, respectively, but are triggered yearly in high-incidence
      settings. Triggered campaigns reduce the highest cumulative incidence seen in
      simulations by up to 80%. While the scenarios considered in this strategic
      modeling exercise are reflective of real populations, the exact quantitative
      interpretation of the results is limited by the simplifications in country
      structure, vaccination policy, and surveillance system performance. Careful
      investigation into the cost-effectiveness in different contexts would be
      essential before moving forward with implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Serologically
      triggered campaigns could help prevent severe epidemics in the face of
      epidemiological and vaccination uncertainty. Hence, small-scale serology may
      serve as the basis for effective adaptive public health strategies, although, in 
      high-incidence settings, case-triggered approaches are likely more efficient.

TI  - Orthostatic Hypotension and the Long-Term Risk of Dementia: A Population-Based
      Study.
PG  - e1002143
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002143 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cause of transient cerebral 
      hypoperfusion in the population. Cerebral hypoperfusion is widely implicated in
      cognitive impairment, but whether OH contributes to cognitive decline and
      dementia is uncertain. We aimed to determine the association between OH and the
      risk of developing dementia in the general population. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Between 4 October 1989 and 17 June 1993, we assessed OH in non-demented,
      stroke-free participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. OH was defined 
      as a >/=20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or >/=10 mm Hg drop in
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) within 3 min from postural change. We furthermore 
      calculated within participant variability in SBP related to postural change,
      expressed as coefficient of variation. Follow-up for dementia was conducted until
      1 January 2014. We determined the risk of dementia in relation to OH and SBP
      variability, using a Cox regression model, adjusted for age; sex; smoking status;
      alcohol intake; SBP; DBP; cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein ratio; diabetes;
      body mass index; use of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, or anticholinergic
      medication; and apolipoprotein E genotype. Finally, we explored whether
      associations varied according to compensatory increase in heart rate. Among 6,204
      participants (mean +/- standard deviation [SD] age 68.5 +/- 8.6 y, 59.7% female) 
      with a median follow-up of 15.3 y, 1,176 developed dementia, of whom 935 (79.5%) 
      had Alzheimer disease and 95 (8.1%) had vascular dementia. OH was associated with
      an increased risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.15, 95% CI
      1.00-1.34, p = 0.05), which was similar for Alzheimer disease and vascular
      dementia. Similarly, greater SBP variability with postural change was associated 
      with an increased risk of dementia (aHR per SD increase 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16, p
      = 0.02), which was similar when excluding those who fulfilled the formal criteria
      for OH (aHR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.17, p = 0.06). The risk of dementia was
      particularly increased in those with OH who lacked a compensatory increase in
      heart rate (within lowest quartile of heart rate response: aHR 1.39, 95% CI
      1.04-1.85, p-interaction = 0.05). Limitations of this study include potential
      residual confounding despite rigorous adjustments, and potentially limited
      generalisability to populations not of European descent. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      population predominantly of European descent, OH was associated with an increase 
      in long-term risk of dementia.

TI  - Regulatory T Cell Responses in Participants with Type 1 Diabetes after a Single
      Dose of Interleukin-2: A Non-Randomised, Open Label, Adaptive Dose-Finding Trial.
PG  - e1002139
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002139 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has an essential role in the expansion and
      function of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs reduce tissue damage by
      limiting the immune response following infection and regulate autoreactive CD4+
      effector T cells (Teffs) to prevent autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes 
      (T1D). Genetic susceptibility to T1D causes alterations in the IL-2 pathway, a
      finding that supports Tregs as a cellular therapeutic target. Aldesleukin
      (Proleukin; recombinant human IL-2), which is administered at high doses to
      activate the immune system in cancer immunotherapy, is now being repositioned to 
      treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders at lower doses by targeting Tregs.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: To define the aldesleukin dose response for Tregs and to
      find doses that increase Tregs physiologically for treatment of T1D, a
      statistical and systematic approach was taken by analysing the pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics of single doses of subcutaneous aldesleukin in the Adaptive 
      Study of IL-2 Dose on Regulatory T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes (DILT1D), a single
      centre, non-randomised, open label, adaptive dose-finding trial with 40 adult
      participants with recently diagnosed T1D. The primary endpoint was the maximum
      percentage increase in Tregs (defined as CD3+CD4+CD25highCD127low) from the
      baseline frequency in each participant measured over the 7 d following treatment.
      There was an initial learning phase with five pairs of participants, each pair
      receiving one of five pre-assigned single doses from 0.04 x 106 to 1.5 x 106
      IU/m2, in order to model the dose-response curve. Results from each participant
      were then incorporated into interim statistical modelling to target the two doses
      most likely to induce 10% and 20% increases in Treg frequencies. Primary analysis
      of the evaluable population (n = 39) found that the optimal doses of aldesleukin 
      to induce 10% and 20% increases in Tregs were 0.101 x 106 IU/m2 (standard error
      [SE] = 0.078, 95% CI = -0.052, 0.254) and 0.497 x 106 IU/m2 (SE = 0.092, 95% CI =
      0.316, 0.678), respectively. On analysis of secondary outcomes, using a highly
      sensitive IL-2 assay, the observed plasma concentrations of the drug at 90 min
      exceeded the hypothetical Treg-specific therapeutic window determined in vitro
      (0.015-0.24 IU/ml), even at the lowest doses (0.040 x 106 and 0.045 x 106 IU/m2) 
      administered. A rapid decrease in Treg frequency in the circulation was observed 
      at 90 min and at day 1, which was dose dependent (mean decrease 11.6%, SE = 2.3%,
      range 10.0%-48.2%, n = 37), rebounding at day 2 and increasing to frequencies
      above baseline over 7 d. Teffs, natural killer cells, and eosinophils also
      responded, with their frequencies rapidly and dose-dependently decreased in the
      blood, then returning to, or exceeding, pretreatment levels. Furthermore, there
      was a dose-dependent down modulation of one of the two signalling subunits of the
      IL-2 receptor, the beta chain (CD122) (mean decrease = 58.0%, SE = 2.8%, range
      9.8%-85.5%, n = 33), on Tregs and a reduction in their sensitivity to aldesleukin
      at 90 min and day 1 and 2 post-treatment. Due to blood volume requirements as
      well as ethical and practical considerations, the study was limited to adults and
      to analysis of peripheral blood only. CONCLUSIONS: The DILT1D trial results, most
      notably the early altered trafficking and desensitisation of Tregs induced by a
      single ultra-low dose of aldesleukin that resolves within 2-3 d, inform the
      design of the next trial to determine a repeat dosing regimen aimed at
      establishing a steady-state Treg frequency increase of 20%-50%, with the eventual
      goal of preventing T1D. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN27852285;

      Model-Based Analysis.
PG  - e1002142
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are becoming
      available for the first time in over 40 y. Optimal strategies for introducing
      these drugs have not yet been established. The objective of this study was to
      compare different strategies for introducing the new TB drug bedaquiline based on
      patients' resistance patterns. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a Markov decision
      model to follow a hypothetical cohort of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients
      under different bedaquiline use strategies. The explored strategies included
      making bedaquiline available to all patients with MDR TB, restricting bedaquiline
      usage to patients with MDR plus additional resistance and withholding bedaquiline
      introduction completely. We compared these strategies according to life
      expectancy, risks of acquired resistance, and the expected number and health
      outcomes of secondary cases. For our simulated cohort, the mean (2.5th, 97.5th
      percentile) life expectancy from time of initiation of MDR TB treatment at age 30
      was 36.0 y (33.5, 38.7) assuming all patients with MDR TB received bedaquiline,
      35.1 y (34.4, 35.8) assuming patients with pre-extensively drug-resistant
      (PreXDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB received bedaquiline, and 34.9 y
      (34.6, 35.2) assuming only patients with XDR TB received bedaquiline. Although
      providing bedaquiline to all MDR patients resulted in the highest life expectancy
      for our initial cohort averaged across all parameter sets, for parameter sets in 
      which bedaquiline conferred high risks of added mortality and only small
      reductions in median time to culture conversion, the optimal strategy would be to
      withhold use even from patients with the most extensive resistance. Across all
      parameter sets, the most liberal bedaquiline use strategies consistently
      increased the risk of bedaquiline resistance but decreased the risk of resistance
      to other MDR drugs. In almost all cases, more liberal bedaquiline use strategies 
      reduced the expected number of secondary cases and resulting life years lost. The
      generalizability of our results is limited by the lack of available data about
      drug effects among individuals with HIV co-infection, drug interactions, and
      other sources of heterogeneity, as well as changing recommendations for MDR TB
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: If mortality benefits can be empirically verified, our
      results provide support for expanding bedaquiline access to all patients with MDR
      TB. Such expansion could improve patients' health, protect background MDR TB
      drugs, and decrease transmission, but would likely result in greater resistance
      to bedaquiline.

TI  - Population Immunity against Serotype-2 Poliomyelitis Leading up to the Global
      Withdrawal of the Oral Poliovirus Vaccine: Spatio-temporal Modelling of
      Surveillance Data.
PG  - e1002140
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Global withdrawal of serotype-2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV2) took
      place in April 2016. This marked a milestone in global polio eradication and was 
      a public health intervention of unprecedented scale, affecting 155 countries.
      Achieving high levels of serotype-2 population immunity before OPV2 withdrawal
      was critical to avoid subsequent outbreaks of serotype-2 vaccine-derived
      polioviruses (VDPV2s). METHODS AND FINDINGS: In August 2015, we estimated
      vaccine-induced population immunity against serotype-2 poliomyelitis for 1
      January 2004-30 June 2015 and produced forecasts for April 2016 by district in
      Nigeria and Pakistan. Population immunity was estimated from the vaccination
      histories of children <36 mo old identified with non-polio acute flaccid
      paralysis (AFP) reported through polio surveillance, information on immunisation 
      activities with different oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) formulations, and
      serotype-specific estimates of the efficacy of these OPVs against poliomyelitis. 
      District immunity estimates were spatio-temporally smoothed using a Bayesian
      hierarchical framework. Coverage estimates for immunisation activities were also 
      obtained, allowing for heterogeneity within and among districts. Forward
      projections of immunity, based on these estimates and planned immunisation
      activities, were produced through to April 2016 using a cohort model. Estimated
      population immunity was negatively correlated with the probability of VDPV2
      poliomyelitis being reported in a district. In Nigeria and Pakistan, declines in 
      immunity during 2008-2009 and 2012-2013, respectively, were associated with
      outbreaks of VDPV2. Immunity has since improved in both countries as a result of 
      increased use of trivalent OPV, and projections generally indicated sustained or 
      improved immunity in April 2016, such that the majority of districts (99% [95%
      uncertainty interval 97%-100%] in Nigeria and 84% [95% uncertainty interval
      77%-91%] in Pakistan) had >70% population immunity among children <36 mo old.
      Districts with lower immunity were clustered in northeastern Nigeria and
      northwestern Pakistan. The accuracy of immunity estimates was limited by the
      small numbers of non-polio AFP cases in some districts, which was reflected by
      large uncertainty intervals. Forecasted improvements in immunity for April 2016
      were robust to the uncertainty in estimates of baseline immunity (January-June
      2015), vaccine coverage, and vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Immunity against
      serotype-2 poliomyelitis was forecasted to improve in April 2016 compared to the 
      first half of 2015 in Nigeria and Pakistan. These analyses informed the
      endorsement of OPV2 withdrawal in April 2016 by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group 
      of Experts on Immunization.

TI  - Whole Genome Sequence Analysis of a Large Isoniazid-Resistant Tuberculosis
      Outbreak in London: A Retrospective Observational Study.
PG  - e1002137
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis outbreak centred on London, 
      United Kingdom, has been ongoing since 1995. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the power and value of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to resolve the
      transmission network compared to current molecular strain typing approaches,
      including analysis of intra-host diversity within a specimen, across body sites, 
      and over time, with identification of genetic factors underlying the
      epidemiological success of this cluster. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We sequenced 344
      outbreak isolates from individual patients collected over 14 y (2 February
      1998-22 June 2012). This demonstrated that 96 (27.9%) were indistinguishable, and
      only one differed from this major clone by more than five single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs). The maximum number of SNPs between any pair of isolates was
      nine SNPs, and the modal distance between isolates was two SNPs. WGS was able to 
      reveal the direction of transmission of tuberculosis in 16 cases within the
      outbreak (4.7%), including within a multidrug-resistant cluster that carried a
      rare rpoB mutation associated with rifampicin resistance. Eleven longitudinal
      pairs of patient pulmonary isolates collected up to 48 mo apart differed from
      each other by between zero and four SNPs. Extrapulmonary dissemination resulted
      in acquisition of a SNP in two of five cases. WGS analysis of 27 individual
      colonies cultured from a single patient specimen revealed ten loci differed
      amongst them, with a maximum distance between any pair of six SNPs. A limitation 
      of this study, as in previous studies, is that indels and SNPs in repetitive
      regions were not assessed due to the difficulty in reliably determining this
      variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that (1) certain paradigms need to be 
      revised, such as the 12 SNP distance as the gold standard upper threshold to
      identify plausible transmissions; (2) WGS technology is helpful to rule out the
      possibility of direct transmission when isolates are separated by a substantial
      number of SNPs; (3) the concept of a transmission chain or network may not be
      useful in institutional or household settings; (4) the practice of isolating
      single colonies prior to sequencing is likely to lead to an overestimation of the
      number of SNPs between cases resulting from direct transmission; and (5) despite 
      appreciable genomic diversity within a host, transmission of tuberculosis rarely 
      results in minority variants becoming dominant. Thus, whilst WGS provided some
      increased resolution over variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)-based clustering, 
      it was insufficient for inferring transmission in the majority of cases.

TI  - Characterization of Novel Antimalarial Compound ACT-451840: Preclinical
      Assessment of Activity and Dose-Efficacy Modeling.
PG  - e1002138
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002138 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance observed in Southeast Asia threatens the
      continued use of artemisinin-based combination therapy in endemic countries.
      Additionally, the diversity of chemical mode of action in the global portfolio of
      marketed antimalarials is extremely limited. Addressing the urgent need for the
      development of new antimalarials, a chemical class of potent antimalarial
      compounds with a novel mode of action was recently identified. Herein, the
      preclinical characterization of one of these compounds, ACT-451840, conducted in 
      partnership with academic and industrial groups is presented. METHOD AND
      FINDINGS: The properties of ACT-451840 are described, including its spectrum of
      activities against multiple life cycle stages of the human malaria parasite
      Plasmodium falciparum (asexual and sexual) and Plasmodium vivax (asexual) as well
      as oral in vivo efficacies in two murine malaria models that permit infection
      with the human and the rodent parasites P. falciparum and Plasmodium berghei,
      respectively. In vitro, ACT-451840 showed a 50% inhibition concentration of 0.4
      nM (standard deviation [SD]: +/- 0.0 nM) against the drug-sensitive P. falciparum
      NF54 strain. The 90% effective doses in the in vivo efficacy models were 3.7
      mg/kg against P. falciparum (95% confidence interval: 3.3-4.9 mg/kg) and 13 mg/kg
      against P. berghei (95% confidence interval: 11-16 mg/kg). ACT-451840 potently
      prevented male gamete formation from the gametocyte stage with a 50% inhibition
      concentration of 5.89 nM (SD: +/- 1.80 nM) and dose-dependently blocked oocyst
      development in the mosquito with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 30 nM (range: 
      23-39). The compound's preclinical safety profile is presented and is in line
      with the published results of the first-in-man study in healthy male
      participants, in whom ACT-451840 was well tolerated.
      Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling was applied using efficacy in
      the murine models (defined either as antimalarial activity or as survival) in
      relation to area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), maximum
      observed plasma concentration (Cmax), and time above a threshold concentration.
      The determination of the dose-efficacy relationship of ACT-451840 under curative 
      conditions in rodent malaria models allowed prediction of the human efficacious
      exposure. CONCLUSION: The dual activity of ACT-451840 against asexual and sexual 
      stages of P. falciparum and the activity on P. vivax have the potential to meet
      the specific profile of a target compound that could replace the fast-acting
      artemisinin component and harbor additional gametocytocidal activity and,
      thereby, transmission-blocking properties. The fast parasite reduction ratio
      (PRR) and gametocytocidal effect of ACT-451840 were recently also confirmed in a 
      clinical proof-of-concept (POC) study.

TI  - A Comparison of Midwife-Led and Medical-Led Models of Care and Their Relationship
      to Adverse Fetal and Neonatal Outcomes: A Retrospective Cohort Study in New
      Zealand.
PG  - e1002134
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002134 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internationally, a typical model of maternity care is a medically led
      system with varying levels of midwifery input. New Zealand has a midwife-led
      model of care, and there are movements in other countries to adopt such a system.
      There is a paucity of systemic evaluation that formally investigates
      safety-related outcomes in relationship to midwife-led care within an entire
      maternity service. The main objective of this study was to compare major adverse 
      perinatal outcomes between midwife-led and medical-led maternity care in New
      Zealand. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a population-based retrospective cohort
      study. Participants were mother/baby pairs for all 244,047 singleton, term
      deliveries occurring between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012 in New Zealand
      in which no major fetal, neonatal, chromosomal or metabolic abnormality was
      identified and the mother was first registered with a midwife, obstetrician, or
      general practitioner as lead maternity carer. Main outcome measures were low
      Apgar score at five min, intrauterine hypoxia, birth-related asphyxia, neonatal
      encephalopathy, small for gestational age (as a negative control), and mortality 
      outcomes (perinatal related mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality).
      Logistic regression models were fitted, with crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs)
      generated for each outcome for midwife-led versus medical-led care (based on lead
      maternity carer at first registration) with 95% confidence intervals. Fully
      adjusted models included age, ethnicity, deprivation, trimester of registration, 
      parity, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and pre-existing diabetes and/or
      hypertension in the model. Of the 244,047 pregnancies included in the study,
      223,385 (91.5%) were first registered with a midwife lead maternity carer, and
      20,662 (8.5%) with a medical lead maternity carer. Adjusted ORs showed that
      medical-led births were associated with lower odds of an Apgar score of less than
      seven at 5 min (OR 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.64), intrauterine hypoxia
      (OR 0.79; 0.62-1.02), birth-related asphyxia (OR 0.45; 0.32-0.62), and neonatal
      encephalopathy (OR 0.61; 0.38-0.97). No association was found between lead carer 
      at first registration and being small for gestational age (SGA), which was
      included as a negative control (OR 1.00; 0.95-1.05). It was not possible to
      definitively determine whether one model of care was associated with fewer infant
      deaths, with ORs for the medical-led model compared with the midwife-led model
      being 0.80 (0.54-1.19) for perinatal related mortality, 0.86 (0.55-1.34) for
      stillbirth, and 0.62 (0.25-1.53) for neonatal mortality. Major limitations were
      related to the use of routine data in which some variables lacked detail; for
      example, we were unable to differentiate the midwife-led group into those who had
      received medical input during pregnancy and those who had not. CONCLUSIONS: There
      is an unexplained excess of adverse events in midwife-led deliveries in New
      Zealand where midwives practice autonomously. The findings are of concern and
      demonstrate a need for further research that specifically investigates the
      reasons for the apparent excess of adverse outcomes in mothers with midwife-led
      care. These findings should be interpreted in the context of New Zealand's
      internationally comparable birth outcomes and in the context of research that
      supports the many benefits of midwife-led care, such as greater patient
      satisfaction and lower intervention rates.

TI  - Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Use by Breastfeeding HIV-Uninfected Women: A Prospective
      Short-Term Study of Antiretroviral Excretion in Breast Milk and Infant
      Absorption.
PG  - e1002132
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) becomes more widely used in
      heterosexual populations, an important consideration is its safety in infants who
      are breastfed by women taking PrEP. We investigated whether tenofovir and
      emtricitabine are excreted into breast milk and then absorbed by the
      breastfeeding infant in clinically significant concentrations when used as PrEP
      by lactating women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective short-term, 
      open-label study of daily oral emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate PrEP
      among 50 HIV-uninfected breastfeeding African mother-infant pairs between 1-24 wk
      postpartum (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02776748). The primary goal was to 
      quantify the steady-state concentrations of tenofovir and emtricitabine in infant
      plasma ingested via breastfeeding. PrEP was administered to women through daily
      directly observed therapy (DOT) for ten consecutive days and then discontinued
      thereafter. Non-fasting peak and trough samples of maternal plasma and breast
      milk were obtained at drug concentration steady states on days 7 and 10, and a
      single infant plasma sample was obtained on day 7. Peak blood and breast milk
      samples were obtained 1-2 h after the maternal DOT PrEP dose, while maternal
      trough samples were obtained at the end of the PrEP dosing interval (i.e., 23 to 
      24 h) after maternal DOT PrEP dose. Tenofovir and emtricitabine concentrations
      were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
      assays. Of the 50 mother-infant pairs enrolled, 48% were </=12 wk and 52% were
      13-24 wk postpartum, and median maternal age was 25 y (interquartile range [IQR] 
      22-28). During study follow-up, the median (IQR) daily reported frequency of
      infant breastfeeding was 15 times (12 to 18) overall, 16 (14 to 19) for the </=12
      weeks, and 14 (12 to 17) for the 13-24 wk infant age groups. Overall, median
      (IQR) time-averaged peak concentrations in breast milk were 3.2 ng/mL (2.3 to
      4.7) for tenofovir and 212.5 ng/mL (140.0 to 405.0) for emtricitabine. Similarly,
      median (IQR) time-averaged trough concentrations in breast milk were 3.3 ng/mL
      (2.3 to 4.4) for tenofovir and 183.0 ng/mL (113.0 to 250.0) for emtricitabine,
      reflecting trough-to-peak breast milk concentration ratios of 1.0 for tenofovir
      and 0.8 for emtricitabine, respectively. In infant plasma, tenofovir was
      unquantifiable in 46/49 samples (94%), but emtricitabine was detectable in 47/49 
      (96%) (median [IQR] concentration: 13.2 ng/mL [9.3 to 16.7]). The estimated
      equivalent doses an infant would ingest daily from breastfeeding were 0.47 mug/kg
      (IQR 0.35 to 0.71) for tenofovir and 31.9 mug/kg (IQR 21.0 to 60.8) for
      emtricitabine, translating into a <0.01% and 0.5% relative dose when compared to 
      the 6 mg/kg dose that is proposed for therapeutic treatment of infant HIV
      infection and for prevention of infant postnatal HIV infection; a dose that has
      not shown safety concerns. No serious adverse effects were recorded during study 
      follow-up. The key study limitation was that only a single infant sample was
      collected to minimize venipunctures for the children. However, maternal daily DOT
      and specimen collection at drug concentration steady state provided an adequate
      approach to address the key research question. Importantly, there was minimal
      variation in breast milk concentrations of tenofovir and emtricitabine
      (respective median trough-to-peak concentration ratio ~1), demonstrating that
      infants were exposed to consistent drug dosing via breast milk. CONCLUSION: In
      this short-term study of daily directly observed oral PrEP in HIV-uninfected
      breastfeeding women, the estimated infant doses from breast milk and resultant
      infant plasma concentrations for tenofovir and emtricitabine were 12,500 and
      >200-fold lower than the respective proposed infant therapeutic doses, and
      tenofovir was not detected in 94% of infant plasma samples. These data suggest
      that PrEP can be safely used during breastfeeding with minimal infant drug
      exposure. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT02776748.

TI  - Reporting of Adverse Events in Published and Unpublished Studies of Health Care
      Interventions: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e1002127
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We performed a systematic review to assess whether we can quantify
      the underreporting of adverse events (AEs) in the published medical literature
      documenting the results of clinical trials as compared with other nonpublished
      sources, and whether we can measure the impact this underreporting has on
      systematic reviews of adverse events. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies were
      identified from 15 databases (including MEDLINE and Embase) and by handsearching,
      reference checking, internet searches, and contacting experts. The last database 
      searches were conducted in July 2016. There were 28 methodological evaluations
      that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 9 studies compared the proportion of
      trials reporting adverse events by publication status. The median percentage of
      published documents with adverse events information was 46% compared to 95% in
      the corresponding unpublished documents. There was a similar pattern with
      unmatched studies, for which 43% of published studies contained adverse events
      information compared to 83% of unpublished studies. A total of 11 studies
      compared the numbers of adverse events in matched published and unpublished
      documents. The percentage of adverse events that would have been missed had each 
      analysis relied only on the published versions varied between 43% and 100%, with 
      a median of 64%. Within these 11 studies, 24 comparisons of named adverse events 
      such as death, suicide, or respiratory adverse events were undertaken. In 18 of
      the 24 comparisons, the number of named adverse events was higher in unpublished 
      than published documents. Additionally, 2 other studies demonstrated that there
      are substantially more types of adverse events reported in matched unpublished
      than published documents. There were 20 meta-analyses that reported the odds
      ratios (ORs) and/or risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events with and without
      unpublished data. Inclusion of unpublished data increased the precision of the
      pooled estimates (narrower 95% confidence intervals) in 15 of the 20 pooled
      analyses, but did not markedly change the direction or statistical significance
      of the risk in most cases. The main limitations of this review are that the
      included case examples represent only a small number amongst thousands of
      meta-analyses of harms and that the included studies may suffer from publication 
      bias, whereby substantial differences between published and unpublished data are 
      more likely to be published. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence that much of
      the information on adverse events remains unpublished and that the number and
      range of adverse events is higher in unpublished than in published versions of
      the same study. The inclusion of unpublished data can also reduce the imprecision
      of pooled effect estimates during meta-analysis of adverse events.

TI  - The Policy Dystopia Model: An Interpretive Analysis of Tobacco Industry Political
      Activity.
PG  - e1002125
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco industry interference has been identified as the greatest
      obstacle to the implementation of evidence-based measures to reduce tobacco use. 
      Understanding and addressing industry interference in public health policy-making
      is therefore crucial. Existing conceptualisations of corporate political activity
      (CPA) are embedded in a business perspective and do not attend to CPA's social
      and public health costs; most have not drawn on the unique resource represented
      by internal tobacco industry documents. Building on this literature, including
      systematic reviews, we develop a critically informed conceptual model of tobacco 
      industry political activity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We thematically analysed
      published papers included in two systematic reviews examining tobacco industry
      influence on taxation and marketing of tobacco; we included 45 of 46 papers in
      the former category and 20 of 48 papers in the latter (n = 65). We used a
      grounded theory approach to build taxonomies of "discursive" (argument-based) and
      "instrumental" (action-based) industry strategies and from these devised the
      Policy Dystopia Model, which shows that the industry, working through different
      constituencies, constructs a metanarrative to argue that proposed policies will
      lead to a dysfunctional future of policy failure and widely dispersed adverse
      social and economic consequences. Simultaneously, it uses diverse, interlocking
      insider and outsider instrumental strategies to disseminate this narrative and
      enhance its persuasiveness in order to secure its preferred policy outcomes.
      Limitations are that many papers were historical (some dating back to the 1970s) 
      and focused on high-income regions. CONCLUSIONS: The model provides an
      evidence-based, accessible way of understanding diverse corporate political
      strategies. It should enable public health actors and officials to preempt these 
      strategies and develop realistic assessments of the industry's claims.

      Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002128
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly managed in primary care, but
      most guidelines have a secondary care perspective emphasizing the risk of
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and need for renal replacement therapy. In this
      prospective cohort study, we sought to study in detail the natural history of CKD
      in primary care to better inform the appropriate emphasis for future guidance.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, 1,741 people with CKD stage 3 were
      individually recruited from 32 primary care practices in Derbyshire, United
      Kingdom. Study visits were undertaken at baseline, year 1, and year 5. Binomial
      logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to model
      progression, CKD remission, and all-cause mortality. We used Kidney Disease:
      Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria to define CKD progression and defined 
      CKD remission as the absence of diagnostic criteria (estimated glomerular
      filtration rate [eGFR] >60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
      [uACR] <3 mg/mmol) at any study visit. Participants were predominantly elderly
      (mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age 72.9 +/- 9.0 y), with relatively mild
      reduction in GFR (mean +/- SD eGFR 53.5 +/- 11.8 mL/min/1,73 m2) and a low
      prevalence of albuminuria (16.9%). After 5 y, 247 participants (14.2%) had died, 
      most of cardiovascular causes. Only 4 (0.2%) developed ESKD, but 308 (17.7%)
      evidenced CKD progression by KDIGO criteria. Stable CKD was observed in 593
      participants (34.1%), and 336 (19.3%) met the criteria for remission. Remission
      at baseline and year 1 was associated with a high likelihood of remission at year
      5 (odds ratio [OR] = 23.6, 95% CI 16.5-33.9 relative to participants with no
      remission at baseline and year 1 study visits). Multivariable analyses confirmed 
      eGFR and albuminuria as key risk factors for predicting adverse as well as
      positive outcomes. Limitations of this study include reliance on GFR estimated
      using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) equation for
      recruitment (but not subsequent analysis) and a study population that was
      predominantly elderly and white, implying that the results may not be directly
      applicable to younger populations of more diverse ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS:
      Management of CKD in primary care should focus principally on identifying the
      minority of people at high risk of adverse outcomes, to allow intervention to
      slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events. Efforts should also be
      made to identify and reassure the majority who are at low risk of progression to 
      ESKD. Consideration should be given to adopting an age-calibrated definition of
      CKD to avoid labelling a large group of people with age-related decline in GFR
      and low associated risk as having CKD.

TI  - Scheduled Intermittent Screening with Rapid Diagnostic Tests and Treatment with
      Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine versus Intermittent Preventive Therapy with
      Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine for Malaria in Pregnancy in Malawi: An Open-Label
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002124
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Africa, most plasmodium infections during pregnancy remain
      asymptomatic, yet are associated with maternal anemia and low birthweight. WHO
      recommends intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy with
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). However, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)
      efficacy is threatened by high-level parasite resistance. We conducted a trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of scheduled intermittent screening with malaria
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment of RDT-positive women with
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as an alternative strategy to IPTp-SP.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was an open-label, two-arm individually randomized
      superiority trial among HIV-seronegative women at three sites in Malawi with high
      SP resistance. The intervention consisted of three or four scheduled visits in
      the second and third trimester, 4 to 6 wk apart. Women in the IPTp-SP arm
      received SP at each visit. Women in the intermittent screening and treatment in
      pregnancy with DP (ISTp-DP) arm were screened for malaria at every visit and
      treated with DP if RDT-positive. The primary outcomes were adverse live birth
      outcome (composite of small for gestational age, low birthweight [<2,500 g], or
      preterm birth [<37 wk]) in paucigravidae (first or second pregnancy) and maternal
      or placental plasmodium infection at delivery in multigravidae (third pregnancy
      or higher). Analysis was by intention to treat. Between 21 July 2011 and 18 March
      2013, 1,873 women were recruited (1,155 paucigravidae and 718 multigravidae). The
      prevalence of adverse live birth outcome was similar in the ISTp-DP (29.9%) and
      IPTp-SP (28.8%) arms (risk difference = 1.08% [95% CI -3.25% to 5.41%]; all
      women: relative risk [RR] = 1.04 [95% CI 0.90-1.20], p = 0.625; paucigravidae: RR
      = 1.10 [95% CI 0.92-1.31], p = 0.282; multigravidae: RR = 0.92 [95% CI
      0.71-1.20], p = 0.543). The prevalence of malaria at delivery was higher in the
      ISTp-DP arm (48.7% versus 40.8%; risk difference = 7.85%, [95% CI 3.07%-12.63%]; 
      all women: RR = 1.19 [95% CI 1.07-1.33], p = 0.007; paucigravidae: RR = 1.16 [95%
      CI 1.04-1.31], p = 0.011; multigravidae: RR = 1.29 [95% CI 1.02-1.63], p =
      0.037). Fetal loss was more common with ISTp-DP (2.6% versus 1.3%; RR = 2.06 [95%
      CI 1.01-4.21], p = 0.046) and highest among non-DP-recipients (3.1%) in the
      ISTp-DP arm. Limitations included the open-label design. CONCLUSIONS: Scheduled
      screening for malaria parasites with the current generation of RDTs three to four
      times during pregnancy as part of focused antenatal care was not superior to
      IPTp-SP in this area with high malaria transmission and high SP resistance and
      was associated with higher fetal loss and more malaria at delivery. TRIAL

TI  - The Incidence Patterns Model to Estimate the Distribution of New HIV Infections
      in Sub-Saharan Africa: Development and Validation of a Mathematical Model.
PG  - e1002121
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Programmatic planning in HIV requires estimates of the distribution
      of new HIV infections according to identifiable characteristics of individuals.
      In sub-Saharan Africa, robust routine data sources and historical epidemiological
      observations are available to inform and validate such estimates. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We developed a predictive model, the Incidence Patterns Model (IPM),
      representing populations according to factors that have been demonstrated to be
      strongly associated with HIV acquisition risk: gender, marital/sexual activity
      status, geographic location, "key populations" based on risk behaviours (sex
      work, injecting drug use, and male-to-male sex), HIV and ART status within
      married or cohabiting unions, and circumcision status. The IPM estimates the
      distribution of new infections acquired by group based on these factors within a 
      Bayesian framework accounting for regional prior information on demographic and
      epidemiological characteristics from trials or observational studies. We
      validated and trained the model against direct observations of HIV incidence by
      group in seven rounds of cohort data from four studies ("sites") conducted in
      Manicaland, Zimbabwe; Rakai, Uganda; Karonga, Malawi; and Kisesa, Tanzania. The
      IPM performed well, with the projections' credible intervals for the proportion
      of new infections per group overlapping the data's confidence intervals for all
      groups in all rounds of data. In terms of geographical distribution, the
      projections' credible intervals overlapped the confidence intervals for four out 
      of seven rounds, which were used as proxies for administrative divisions in a
      country. We assessed model performance after internal training (within one site) 
      and external training (between sites) by comparing mean posterior log-likelihoods
      and used the best model to estimate the distribution of HIV incidence in six
      countries (Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Swaziland, and Zambia) in the region. We
      subsequently inferred the potential contribution of each group to transmission
      using a simple model that builds on the results from the IPM and makes further
      assumptions about sexual mixing patterns and transmission rates. In all countries
      except Swaziland, individuals in unions were the single group contributing to the
      largest proportion of new infections acquired (39%-77%), followed by never
      married women and men. Female sex workers accounted for a large proportion of new
      infections (5%-16%) compared to their population size. Individuals in unions were
      also the single largest contributor to the proportion of infections transmitted
      (35%-62%), followed by key populations and previously married men and women.
      Swaziland exhibited different incidence patterns, with never married men and
      women accounting for over 65% of new infections acquired and also contributing to
      a large proportion of infections transmitted (up to 56%). Between- and
      within-country variations indicated different incidence patterns in specific
      settings. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to reliably predict the distribution of new
      HIV infections acquired using data routinely available in many countries in the
      sub-Saharan African region with a single relatively simple mathematical model.
      This tool would complement more specific analyses to guide resource allocation,
      data collection, and programme planning.

TI  - Potential for Controlling Cholera Using a Ring Vaccination Strategy: Re-analysis 
      of Data from a Cluster-Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e1002120
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002120 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vaccinating a buffer of individuals around a case (ring
      vaccination) has the potential to target those who are at highest risk of
      infection, reducing the number of doses needed to control a disease. We explored 
      the potential vaccine effectiveness (VE) of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) for such
      a strategy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This analysis uses existing data from a
      cluster-randomized clinical trial in which OCV or placebo was given to 71,900
      participants in Kolkata, India, from 27 July to 10 September 2006. Cholera
      surveillance was then conducted on 144,106 individuals living in the study area, 
      including trial participants, for 5 y following vaccination. First, we explored
      the risk of cholera among contacts of cholera patients, and, second, we measured 
      VE among individuals living within 25 m of cholera cases between 8 and 28 d after
      onset of the index case. For the first analysis, individuals living around each
      index case identified during the 5-y period were assembled using a ring to define
      cohorts of individuals exposed to cholera index cases. An index control without
      cholera was randomly selected for each index case from the same population,
      matched by age group, and individuals living around each index control were
      assembled using a ring to define cohorts not exposed to cholera cases. Cholera
      attack rates among the exposed and non-exposed cohorts were compared using
      different distances from the index case/control to define the rings and different
      time frames to define the period at risk. For the VE analysis, the exposed
      cohorts were further stratified according to the level of vaccine coverage into
      high and low coverage strata. Overall VE was assessed by comparing the attack
      rates between high and low vaccine coverage strata irrespective of individuals'
      vaccination status, and indirect VE was assessed by comparing the attack rates
      among unvaccinated members between high and low vaccine coverage strata. Cholera 
      risk among the cohort exposed to cholera cases was 5-11 times higher than that
      among the cohort not exposed to cholera cases. The risk gradually diminished with
      an increase in distance and time. The overall and indirect VE measured between 8 
      and 28 d after exposure to a cholera index case during the first 2 y was 91% (95%
      CI 62%-98%) and 93% (95% CI 44%-99%), respectively. VE persisted for 5 y after
      vaccination and was similar whether the index case was a young child (<5 y) or
      was older. Of note, this study was a reanalysis of a cholera vaccine trial that
      used two doses; thus, a limitation of the study relates to the assumption that a 
      single dose, if administered quickly, will induce a similar level of total and
      indirect protection over the short term as did two doses. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings suggest that high-level protection can be achieved if individuals living
      close to cholera cases are living in a high coverage ring. Since this was an
      observational study including participants who had received two doses of vaccine 
      (or placebo) in the clinical trial, further studies are needed to determine
      whether a ring vaccination strategy, in which vaccine is given quickly to those
      living close to a case, is feasible and effective. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00289224.

PG  - e1002119
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) case notification rates are usually higher in men
      than in women, but notification data are insufficient to measure sex differences 
      in disease burden. This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex 
      ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to
      identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB
      prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult
      populations (age >/= 15 y) in low- and middle-income countries published between 
      1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed,
      Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of
      abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects 
      meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and
      prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression
      was done to identify factors associated with higher M:F ratios in prevalence and 
      higher P:N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 
      million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three
      in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 
      in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were
      included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M:F prevalence
      ratios were 2.21 (95% CI 1.92-2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB
      and 2.51 (95% CI 2.07-3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence
      ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require
      self-report of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary
      random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.91; 34
      surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or
      urban setting; however, few studies reported such data. CONCLUSIONS: TB
      prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low- and middle-income
      countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or
      accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes 
      should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men's access
      to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more
      effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care.

TI  - Association between Adult Height and Risk of Colorectal, Lung, and Prostate
      Cancer: Results from Meta-analyses of Prospective Studies and Mendelian
      Randomization Analyses.
PG  - e1002118
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002118 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies examining associations between adult height and
      risk of colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers have generated mixed results. We
      conducted meta-analyses using data from prospective cohort studies and further
      carried out Mendelian randomization analyses, using height-associated genetic
      variants identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), to evaluate the
      association of adult height with these cancers. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A
      systematic review of prospective studies was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, 
      and Web of Science databases. Using meta-analyses, results obtained from 62
      studies were summarized for the association of a 10-cm increase in height with
      cancer risk. Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted using summary
      statistics obtained for 423 genetic variants identified from a recent GWAS of
      adult height and from a cancer genetics consortium study of multiple cancers that
      included 47,800 cases and 81,353 controls. For a 10-cm increase in height, the
      summary relative risks derived from the meta-analyses of prospective studies were
      1.12 (95% CI 1.10, 1.15), 1.07 (95% CI 1.05, 1.10), and 1.06 (95% CI 1.02, 1.11) 
      for colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers, respectively. Mendelian randomization
      analyses showed increased risks of colorectal (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58, 95% CI
      1.14, 2.18) and lung cancer (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.00, 1.22) associated with each
      10-cm increase in genetically predicted height. No association was observed for
      prostate cancer (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.92, 1.15). Our meta-analysis was limited to 
      published studies. The sample size for the Mendelian randomization analysis of
      colorectal cancer was relatively small, thus affecting the precision of the point
      estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for a potential causal
      association of adult height with the risk of colorectal and lung cancers and
      suggests that certain genetic factors and biological pathways affecting adult
      height may also affect the risk of these cancers.

TI  - Associations between Extending Access to Primary Care and Emergency Department
      Visits: A Difference-In-Differences Analysis.
PG  - e1002113
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health services across the world increasingly face pressures on the
      use of expensive hospital services. Better organisation and delivery of primary
      care has the potential to manage demand and reduce costs for hospital services,
      but routine primary care services are not open during evenings and weekends.
      Extended access (evening and weekend opening) is hypothesized to reduce pressure 
      on hospital services from emergency department visits. However, the existing
      evidence-base is weak, largely focused on emergency out-of-hours services, and
      analysed using a before-and after-methodology without effective comparators.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Throughout 2014, 56 primary care practices (346,024
      patients) in Greater Manchester, England, offered 7-day extended access, compared
      with 469 primary care practices (2,596,330 patients) providing routine access.
      Extended access included evening and weekend opening and served both urgent and
      routine appointments. To assess the effects of extended primary care access on
      hospital services, we apply a difference-in-differences analysis using hospital
      administrative data from 2011 to 2014. Propensity score matching techniques were 
      used to match practices without extended access to practices with extended
      access. Differences in the change in "minor" patient-initiated emergency
      department visits per 1,000 population were compared between practices with and
      without extended access. Populations registered to primary care practices with
      extended access demonstrated a 26.4% relative reduction (compared to practices
      without extended access) in patient-initiated emergency department visits for
      "minor" problems (95% CI -38.6% to -14.2%, absolute difference: -10,933 per year,
      95% CI -15,995 to -5,866), and a 26.6% (95% CI -39.2% to -14.1%) relative
      reduction in costs of patient-initiated visits to emergency departments for minor
      problems (absolute difference: - pound767,976, - pound1,130,767 to -
      pound405,184). There was an insignificant relative reduction of 3.1% in total
      emergency department visits (95% CI -6.4% to 0.2%). Our results were robust to
      several sensitivity checks. A lack of detailed cost reporting of the running
      costs of extended access and an inability to capture health outcomes and other
      health service impacts constrain the study from assessing the full
      cost-effectiveness of extended access to primary care. CONCLUSIONS: The study
      found that extending access was associated with a reduction in emergency
      department visits in the first 12 months. The results of the research have
      already informed the decision by National Health Service England to extend
      primary care access across Greater Manchester from 2016. However, further
      evidence is needed to understand whether extending primary care access is
      cost-effective and sustainable.

TI  - An Audit and Feedback Intervention for Reducing Antibiotic Prescribing in General
      Dental Practice: The RAPiD Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002115
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentists prescribe approximately 10% of antibiotics dispensed in UK
      community pharmacies. Despite clear clinical guidance, dentists often prescribe
      antibiotics inappropriately. This cluster-randomised controlled trial used
      routinely collected National Health Service (NHS) dental prescribing and
      treatment claim data to compare the impact of individualised audit and feedback
      (A&F) interventions on dentists' antibiotic prescribing rates. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: All 795 antibiotic prescribing NHS general dental practices in Scotland
      were included. Practices were randomised to the control (practices = 163;
      dentists = 567) or A&F intervention group (practices = 632; dentists = 1,999).
      A&F intervention practices were allocated to one of two A&F groups: (1)
      individualised graphical A&F comprising a line graph plotting an individual
      dentist's monthly antibiotic prescribing rate (practices = 316; dentists =
      1,001); or (2) individualised graphical A&F plus a written behaviour change
      message synthesising and reiterating national guidance recommendations for dental
      antibiotic prescribing (practices = 316; dentists = 998). Intervention practices 
      were also simultaneously randomised to receive A&F: (i) with or without a health 
      board comparator comprising the addition of a line to the graphical A&F plotting 
      the monthly antibiotic prescribing rate of all dentists in the health board; and 
      (ii) delivered at 0 and 6 mo or at 0, 6, and 9 mo, giving a total of eight
      intervention groups. The primary outcome, measured by the trial statistician who 
      was blinded to allocation, was the total number of antibiotic items dispensed per
      100 NHS treatment claims over the 12 mo post-delivery of the baseline A&F.
      Primary outcome data was available for 152 control practices (dentists = 438) and
      609 intervention practices (dentists = 1,550). At baseline, the number of
      antibiotic items prescribed per 100 NHS treatment claims was 8.3 in the control
      group and 8.5 in the intervention group. At follow-up, antibiotic prescribing had
      decreased by 0.4 antibiotic items per 100 NHS treatment claims in control
      practices and by 1.0 in intervention practices. This represents a significant
      reduction (-5.7%; 95% CI -10.2% to -1.1%; p = 0.01) in dentists' prescribing rate
      in the intervention group relative to the control group. Intervention subgroup
      analyses found a 6.1% reduction in the antibiotic prescribing rate of dentists
      who had received the written behaviour change message relative to dentists who
      had not (95% CI -10.4% to -1.9%; p = 0.01). There was no significant
      between-group difference in the prescribing rate of dentists who received a
      health board comparator relative to those who did not (-4.3%; 95% CI -8.6% to
      0.1%; p = 0.06), nor between dentists who received A&F at 0 and 6 mo relative to 
      those who received A&F at 0, 6, and 9 mo (0.02%; 95% CI -4.2% to 4.2%; p = 0.99).
      The key limitations relate to the use of routinely collected datasets which did
      not allow evaluation of any effects on inappropriate prescribing. CONCLUSIONS:
      A&F derived from routinely collected datasets led to a significant reduction in
      the antibiotic prescribing rate of dentists. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current
      Controlled Trials ISRCTN49204710.

TI  - Social Dancing and Incidence of Falls in Older Adults: A Cluster Randomised
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002112
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevention of falls among older people is a major public health
      challenge. Exercises that challenge balance are recognized as an efficacious fall
      prevention strategy. Given that small-scale trials have indicated that diverse
      dance styles can improve balance and gait of older adults, two of the strongest
      risk factors for falls in older people, this study aimed to determine whether
      social dance is effective in i) reducing the number of falls and ii) improving
      physical and cognitive fall-related risk factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A
      parallel two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 23
      self-care retirement villages (clusters) around Sydney, Australia. Eligible
      villages had to have an appropriate hall for dancing, house at least 60
      residents, and not be currently offering dance as a village activity. Retirement 
      villages were randomised using a computer generated randomisation method,
      constrained using minimisation. Eligible participants had to be a resident of the
      village, be able to walk at least 50 m, and agree to undergo physical and
      cognitive testing without cognitive impairment. Residents of intervention
      villages (12 clusters) were offered twice weekly one-hour social dancing classes 
      (folk or ballroom dancing) over 12 mo (80 h in total). Programs were standardized
      across villages and were delivered by eight dance teachers. Participants in the
      control villages (11 clusters) were advised to continue with their regular
      activities. MAIN OUTCOMES: falls during the 12 mo trial and Trail Making Tests.
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The Physiological Performance Assessment (i.e., postural
      sway, proprioception, reaction time, leg strength) and the Short Physical
      Performance Battery; health-related physical and mental quality of life from the 
      Short-Form 12 (SF-12) Survey. Data on falls were obtained from 522 of 530 (98%)
      randomised participants (mean age 78 y, 85% women) and 424 (80%) attended the
      12-mo reassessment, which was lower among folk dance participants (71%) than
      ballroom dancing (82%) or control participants (82%, p = 0.04). Mean attendance
      at dance classes was 51%. During the period, 444 falls were recorded; there was
      no significant difference in fall rates between the control group (0.80 per
      person-year) and the dance group (1.03 per person-year). Using negative binomial 
      regression with robust standard errors the adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)
      was 1.19 (95% CI: 95% CI = 0.83, 1.71). In exploratory post hoc subgroup
      analysis, the rate of falls was higher among dance participants with a history of
      multiple falls (IRR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.54, p = 0.23 for interaction) and
      with the folk dance intervention (IRR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.73). There were no 
      significant between-group differences in executive function test (TMT-B = 2.8 s, 
      95% CI: -6.2, 11.8). Intention to treat (ITT) analysis revealed no between-group 
      differences at 12-mo follow-up in the secondary outcome measures, with the
      exception of postural sway, favouring the control group. Exploratory post hoc
      analysis by study completers and style indicated that ballroom dancing
      participants apparently improved their gait speed by 0.07 m/s relative to control
      participants (95% CI: 0.00, 0.14, p = 0.05). Study limitations included
      allocation to style based on logistical considerations rather than at random;
      insufficient power to detect differential impacts of different dance styles and
      smaller overall effects; variation of measurement conditions across villages; and
      no assessment of more complex balance tasks, which may be more sensitive to
      changes brought about by dancing. CONCLUSIONS: Social dancing did not prevent
      falls or their associated risk factors among these retirement villages'
      residents. Modified dance programmes that contain "training elements" to better
      approximate structured exercise programs, targeted at low and high-risk
      participants, warrant investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Australian New
      Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612000889853.

TI  - Comparison of Outcomes before and after Ohio's Law Mandating Use of the
      FDA-Approved Protocol for Medication Abortion: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002110
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In February 2011, an Ohio law took effect mandating use of the United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved protocol for mifepristone,
      which is used with misoprostol for medication abortion. Other state legislatures 
      have passed or enacted similar laws requiring use of the FDA-approved protocol
      for medication abortion. The objective of this study is to examine the
      association of this legal change with medication abortion outcomes and
      utilization. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a retrospective cohort design,
      comparing outcomes of medication abortion patients in the prelaw period to those 
      in the postlaw period. Sociodemographic and clinical chart data were abstracted
      from all medication abortion patients from 1 y prior to the law's implementation 
      (January 2010-January 2011) to 3 y post implementation (February 2011-October
      2014) at four abortion-providing health care facilities in Ohio. Outcome data
      were analyzed for all women undergoing abortion at </=49 d gestation during the
      study period. The main outcomes were as follows: need for additional intervention
      following medication abortion (such as aspiration, repeat misoprostol, and blood 
      transfusion), frequency of continuing pregnancy, reports of side effects, and the
      proportion of abortions that were medication abortions (versus other abortion
      procedures). Among the 2,783 medication abortions </=49 d gestation, 4.9% (95%
      CI: 3.7%-6.2%) in the prelaw and 14.3% (95% CI: 12.6%-16.0%) in the postlaw
      period required one or more additional interventions. Women obtaining a
      medication abortion in the postlaw period had three times the odds of requiring
      an additional intervention as women in the prelaw period (adjusted odds ratio
      [AOR] = 3.11, 95% CI: 2.27-4.27). In a mixed effects multivariable model that
      uses facility-months as the unit of analysis to account for lack of independence 
      by site, we found that the law change was associated with a 9.4% (95% CI:
      4.0%-18.4%) absolute increase in the rate of requiring an additional
      intervention. The most common subsequent intervention in both periods was an
      additional misoprostol dose and was most commonly administered to treat
      incomplete abortion. The percentage of women requiring two or more follow-up
      visits increased from 4.2% (95% CI: 3.0%-5.3%) in the prelaw period to 6.2% (95% 
      CI: 5.5%-8.0%) in the postlaw period (p = 0.003). Continuing pregnancy was rare
      (0.3%). Overall, 12.6% of women reported at least one side effect during their
      medication abortion: 8.4% (95% CI: 6.8%-10.0%) in the prelaw period and 15.6%
      (95% CI: 13.8%-17.3%) in the postlaw period (p < 0.001). Medication abortions
      fell from 22% (95% CI: 20.8%-22.3%) of all abortions the year before the law went
      into effect (2010) to 5% (95% CI: 4.8%-5.6%) 3 y after (2014) (p < 0.001). The
      average patient charge increased from US$426 in 2010 to US$551 in 2014,
      representing a 16% increase after adjusting for inflation in medical prices. The 
      primary limitation to the study is that it was a pre/post-observational study
      with no control group that was not exposed to the law. CONCLUSIONS: Ohio law
      required use of a medication abortion protocol that is associated with a greater 
      need for additional intervention, more visits, more side effects, and higher
      costs for women relative to the evidence-based protocol. There is no evidence
      that the change in law led to improved abortion outcomes. Indeed, our findings
      suggest the opposite. In March 2016, the FDA-protocol was updated, so Ohio
      providers may now legally provide current evidence-based protocols. However, this
      law is still in place and bans physicians from using mifepristone based on any
      new developments in clinical research as best practices continue to be updated.

TI  - Pancreatic Cancer Surgical Resection Margins: Molecular Assessment by Mass
      Spectrometry Imaging.
PG  - e1002108

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical resection with microscopically negative margins remains the 
      main curative option for pancreatic cancer; however, in practice intraoperative
      delineation of resection margins is challenging. Ambient mass spectrometry
      imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for chemical imaging and real-time
      diagnosis of tissue samples. We applied an approach combining desorption
      electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) with the least
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) statistical method to diagnose 
      pancreatic tissue sections and prospectively evaluate surgical resection margins 
      from pancreatic cancer surgery. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our methodology was
      developed and tested using 63 banked pancreatic cancer samples and 65 samples
      (tumor and specimen margins) collected prospectively during 32 pancreatectomies
      from February 27, 2013, to January 16, 2015. In total, mass spectra for 254,235
      individual pixels were evaluated. When cross-validation was employed in the
      training set of samples, 98.1% agreement with histopathology was obtained. Using 
      an independent set of samples, 98.6% agreement was achieved. We used a
      statistical approach to evaluate 177,727 mass spectra from samples with complex, 
      mixed histology, achieving an agreement of 81%. The developed method showed
      agreement with frozen section evaluation of specimen margins in 24 of 32 surgical
      cases prospectively evaluated. In the remaining eight patients, margins were
      found to be positive by DESI-MSI/Lasso, but negative by frozen section analysis. 
      The median overall survival after resection was only 10 mo for these eight
      patients as opposed to 26 mo for patients with negative margins by both
      techniques. This observation suggests that our method (as opposed to the standard
      method to date) was able to detect tumor involvement at the margin in patients
      who developed early recurrence. Nonetheless, a larger cohort of samples is needed
      to validate the findings described in this study. Careful evaluation of the
      long-term benefits to patients of the use of DESI-MSI for surgical margin
      evaluation is also needed to determine its value in clinical practice.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that the molecular information
      obtained by DESI-MSI/Lasso from pancreatic tissue samples has the potential to
      transform the evaluation of surgical specimens. With further development, we
      believe the described methodology could be routinely used for intraoperative
      surgical margin assessment of pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes Associated with Traumatic Brain Injury in Childhood and
      Adolescence: A Nationwide Swedish Cohort Study of a Wide Range of Medical and
      Social Outcomes.
PG  - e1002103
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and
      mortality in children and young adults worldwide. It remains unclear, however,
      how TBI in childhood and adolescence is associated with adult mortality,
      psychiatric morbidity, and social outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a Swedish
      birth cohort between 1973 and 1985 of 1,143,470 individuals, we identified all
      those who had sustained at least one TBI (n = 104,290 or 9.1%) up to age 25 y and
      their unaffected siblings (n = 68,268) using patient registers. We subsequently
      assessed these individuals for the following outcomes using multiple national
      registries: disability pension, specialist diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and
      psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation, premature mortality (before age 41 y), low
      educational attainment (not having achieved secondary school qualifications), and
      receiving means-tested welfare benefits. We used logistic and Cox regression
      models to quantify the association between TBI and specified adverse outcomes on 
      the individual level. We further estimated population attributable fractions
      (PAF) for each outcome measure. We also compared differentially exposed siblings 
      to account for unobserved genetic and environmental confounding. In addition to
      relative risk estimates, we examined absolute risks by calculating prevalence and
      Kaplan-Meier estimates. In complementary analyses, we tested whether the findings
      were moderated by injury severity, recurrence, and age at first injury (ages 0-4,
      5-9, 6-10, 15-19, and 20-24 y). TBI exposure was associated with elevated risks
      of impaired adult functioning across all outcome measures. After a median
      follow-up period of 8 y from age 26 y, we found that TBI contributed to absolute 
      risks of over 10% for specialist diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and low
      educational attainment, approximately 5% for disability pension, and 2% for
      premature mortality. The highest relative risks, adjusted for sex, birth year,
      and birth order, were found for psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation (adjusted
      relative risk [aRR] = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.9-2.0; 6,632 versus 37,095 events),
      disability pension (aRR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.7-1.8; 4,691 versus 29,778 events), and 
      premature mortality (aRR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.6-1.9; 799 versus 4,695 events). These 
      risks were only marginally attenuated when the comparisons were made with their
      unaffected siblings, which implies that the effects of TBI were consistent with a
      causal inference. A dose-response relationship was observed with injury severity.
      Injury recurrence was also associated with higher risks-in particular, for
      disability pension we found that recurrent TBI was associated with a 3-fold risk 
      increase (aRR = 2.6; 95% CI: 2.4-2.8) compared to a single-episode TBI. Higher
      risks for all outcomes were observed for those who had sustained their first
      injury at an older age (ages 20-24 y) with more than 25% increase in relative
      risk across all outcomes compared to the youngest age group (ages 0-4 y). On the 
      population level, TBI explained between 2%-6% of the variance in the examined
      outcomes. Using hospital data underestimates milder forms of TBI, but such
      misclassification bias suggests that the reported estimates are likely
      conservative. The sibling-comparison design accounts for unmeasured familial
      confounders shared by siblings, including half of their genes. Thus, residual
      genetic confounding remains a possibility but will unlikely alter our main
      findings, as associations were only marginally attenuated within families.
      CONCLUSIONS: Given our findings, which indicate potentially causal effects
      between TBI exposure in childhood and later impairments across a range of health 
      and social outcomes, age-sensitive clinical guidelines should be considered and
      preventive strategies should be targeted at children and adolescents.

TI  - Integrated Delivery of Antiretroviral Treatment and Pre-exposure Prophylaxis to
      HIV-1-Serodiscordant Couples: A Prospective Implementation Study in Kenya and
      Uganda.
PG  - e1002099
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral-based interventions for HIV-1 prevention, including
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce the infectiousness of HIV-1 infected
      persons and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the susceptibility of HIV-1
      uninfected persons, showed high efficacy for HIV-1 protection in randomized
      clinical trials. We conducted a prospective implementation study to understand
      the feasibility and effectiveness of these interventions in delivery settings.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between November 5, 2012, and January 5, 2015, we enrolled 
      and followed 1,013 heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples in Kenya and Uganda 
      in a prospective implementation study. ART and PrEP were offered through a
      pragmatic strategy, with ART promoted for all couples and PrEP offered until 6 mo
      after ART initiation by the HIV-1 infected partner, permitting time to achieve
      virologic suppression. One thousand thirteen couples were enrolled, 78% of
      partnerships initiated ART, and 97% used PrEP, during a median follow-up of 0.9
      years. Objective measures of adherence to both prevention strategies demonstrated
      high use (>/=85%). Given the low HIV-1 incidence observed in the study, an
      additional analysis was added to compare observed incidence to incidence
      estimated under a simulated counterfactual model constructed using data from a
      prior prospective study of HIV-1-serodiscordant couples. Counterfactual
      simulations predicted 39.7 HIV-1 infections would be expected in the population
      at an incidence of 5.2 per 100 person-years (95% CI 3.7-6.9). However, only two
      incident HIV-1 infections were observed, at an incidence of 0.2 per 100
      person-years (95% CI 0.0-0.9, p < 0.0001 versus predicted). The use of a
      non-concurrent comparison of HIV-1 incidence is a potential limitation of this
      approach; however, it would not have been ethical to enroll a contemporaneous
      population not provided access to ART and PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated delivery 
      of time-limited PrEP until sustained ART use in African HIV-1-serodiscordant
      couples was feasible, demonstrated high uptake and adherence, and resulted in
      near elimination of HIV-1 transmission, with an observed HIV incidence of <0.5%
      per year compared to an expected incidence of >5% per year.

      WHO Member States in 2011-2013: Analysis of Annual Surveys at the Facility Level.
PG  - e1002088
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 
      targets have reinforced the importance of functioning laboratory services to
      ensure prompt diagnosis and to assess treatment efficacy. We surveyed the
      availability and utilization of technologies for HIV treatment monitoring and
      early infant diagnosis (EID) in World Health Organization (WHO) Member States.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The survey questionnaire included 14 structured questions
      focusing on HIV testing, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) testing, HIV viral
      load (VL) testing, and EID and was administered annually from 2012 to 2014
      through WHO country offices, with each survey covering the previous 12-mo period.
      Across 127 targeted countries, survey response rates were 60% in 2012, 67% in
      2013, and 78% in 2014. There were encouraging trends towards increased
      procurement of CD4 and VL/EID instruments in reporting countries. Globally, the
      capacity of available CD4 instruments was sufficient to meet the demand of all
      people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), irrespective of treatment status (4.62
      theoretical tests per PLWHA in 2013 [median 7.33; interquartile range (IQR)
      3.44-17.75; median absolute deviation (MAD) 4.35]). The capacity of VL
      instruments was inadequate to cover all PLWHA in many reporting countries (0.44
      tests per PLWHA in 2013 [median 0.90; IQR 0.30-2.40; MAD 0.74]). Of concern, only
      13.7% of existing CD4 capacity (median 4.3%; IQR 1.1%-12.1%; MAD 3.8%) and only
      36.5% of existing VL capacity (median 9.4%; IQR 2.3%-28.9%; MAD 8.2%) was being
      utilized across reporting countries in 2013. By the end of 2013, 7.4% of all CD4 
      instruments (5.8% CD4 conventional instruments and 11.0% of CD4 point of care
      [POC]) and 10% of VL/EID instruments were reportedly not in use because of lack
      of reagents, the equipment not being installed or deployed, maintenance, and
      staff training requirements. Major limitations of this survey included
      under-reporting and/or incomplete reporting in some national programmes and
      noncoverage of the private sector. CONCLUSION: This is the first attempt to
      comprehensively gather information on HIV testing technology coverage in WHO
      Member States. The survey results suggest that major operational changes will
      need to be implemented, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, if the 
      90-90-90 targets are to be met.

TI  - Genetically Predicted Body Mass Index and Breast Cancer Risk: Mendelian
      Randomization Analyses of Data from 145,000 Women of European Descent.
PG  - e1002105
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational epidemiological studies have shown that high body mass 
      index (BMI) is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal
      women but an increased risk in postmenopausal women. It is unclear whether this
      association is mediated through shared genetic or environmental factors. METHODS:
      We applied Mendelian randomization to evaluate the association between BMI and
      risk of breast cancer occurrence using data from two large breast cancer
      consortia. We created a weighted BMI genetic score comprising 84 BMI-associated
      genetic variants to predicted BMI. We evaluated genetically predicted BMI in
      association with breast cancer risk using individual-level data from the Breast
      Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) (cases = 46,325, controls = 42,482). We
      further evaluated the association between genetically predicted BMI and breast
      cancer risk using summary statistics from 16,003 cases and 41,335 controls from
      the Discovery, Biology, and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer (DRIVE)
      Project. Because most studies measured BMI after cancer diagnosis, we could not
      conduct a parallel analysis to adequately evaluate the association of measured
      BMI with breast cancer risk prospectively. RESULTS: In the BCAC data, genetically
      predicted BMI was found to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk (odds 
      ratio [OR] = 0.65 per 5 kg/m2 increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.75, 
      p = 3.32 x 10-10). The associations were similar for both premenopausal (OR =
      0.44, 95% CI:0.31-0.62, p = 9.91 x 10-8) and postmenopausal breast cancer (OR =
      0.57, 95% CI: 0.46-0.71, p = 1.88 x 10-8). This association was replicated in the
      data from the DRIVE consortium (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.84, p = 1.64 x 10-7).
      Single marker analyses identified 17 of the 84 BMI-associated single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in association with breast cancer risk at p < 0.05; for 16
      of them, the allele associated with elevated BMI was associated with reduced
      breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: BMI predicted by genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS)-identified variants is inversely associated with the risk of both pre- and
      postmenopausal breast cancer. The reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer
      associated with genetically predicted BMI observed in this study differs from the
      positive association reported from studies using measured adult BMI.
      Understanding the reasons for this discrepancy may reveal insights into the
      complex relationship of genetic determinants of body weight in the etiology of
      breast cancer.

TI  - Measuring Burden of Unhealthy Behaviours Using a Multivariable Predictive
      Approach: Life Expectancy Lost in Canada Attributable to Smoking, Alcohol,
      Physical Inactivity, and Diet.
PG  - e1002082
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behaviours such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and
      unhealthy alcohol consumption are leading risk factors for death. We assessed the
      Canadian burden attributable to these behaviours by developing, validating, and
      applying a multivariable predictive model for risk of all-cause death. METHODS: A
      predictive algorithm for 5 y risk of death-the Mortality Population Risk Tool
      (MPoRT)-was developed and validated using the 2001 to 2008 Canadian Community
      Health Surveys. There were approximately 1 million person-years of follow-up and 
      9,900 deaths in the development and validation datasets. After validation, MPoRT 
      was used to predict future mortality and estimate the burden of smoking, alcohol,
      physical inactivity, and poor diet in the presence of sociodemographic and other 
      risk factors using the 2010 national survey (approximately 90,000 respondents).
      Canadian period life tables were generated using predicted risk of death from
      MPoRT. The burden of behavioural risk factors attributable to life expectancy was
      estimated using hazard ratios from the MPoRT risk model. FINDINGS: The MPoRT 5 y 
      mortality risk algorithms were discriminating (C-statistic: males 0.874 [95% CI: 
      0.867-0.881]; females 0.875 [0.868-0.882]) and well calibrated in all 58
      predefined subgroups. Discrimination was maintained or improved in the validation
      cohorts. For the 2010 Canadian population, unhealthy behaviour attributable life 
      expectancy lost was 6.0 years for both men and women (for men 95% CI: 5.8 to 6.3 
      for women 5.8 to 6.2). The Canadian life expectancy associated with health
      behaviour recommendations was 17.9 years (95% CI: 17.7 to 18.1) greater for
      people with the most favourable risk profile compared to those with the least
      favourable risk profile (88.2 years versus 70.3 years). Smoking, by itself, was
      associated with 32% to 39% of the difference in life expectancy across social
      groups (by education achieved or neighbourhood deprivation). CONCLUSIONS:
      Multivariable predictive algorithms such as MPoRT can be used to assess health
      burdens for sociodemographic groups or for small changes in population exposure
      to risks, thereby addressing some limitations of more commonly used measurement
      approaches. Unhealthy behaviours have a substantial collective burden on the life
      expectancy of the Canadian population.

      during the life course on cancer risk remain scarce. To our knowledge, this study
      is the first to assess the impact of adulthood overweight and obesity duration on
      the risk of cancer in a large cohort of postmenopausal women. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Participants from the observational study of the Women's Health
      Initiative (WHI) with BMI information from at least three occasions during
      follow-up, free of cancer at baseline, and with complete covariate information
      were included (n = 73,913). Trajectories of BMI across ages were estimated using 
      a quadratic growth model; overweight duration (BMI >/= 25 kg/m2), obesity
      duration (BMI >/= 30 kg/m2), and weighted cumulative overweight and obese years, 
      which take into account the degree of overweight and obesity over time (a measure
      similar to pack-years of cigarette smoking), were calculated using predicted
      BMIs. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to determine the cancer risk
      associated with overweight and obesity duration. In secondary analyses, the
      influence of important effect modifiers and confounders, such as smoking status, 
      postmenopausal hormone use, and ethnicity, was assessed. A longer duration of
      overweight was significantly associated with the incidence of all obesity-related
      cancers (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-y increment: 1.07, 95% CI 1.06-1.09). For
      postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer, every 10-y increase in adulthood
      overweight duration was associated with a 5% and 17% increase in risk,
      respectively. On adjusting for intensity of overweight, these figures rose to 8% 
      and 37%, respectively. Risks of postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer
      related to overweight duration were much more pronounced in women who never used 
      postmenopausal hormones. This study has limitations because some of the
      anthropometric information was obtained from retrospective self-reports.
      Furthermore, data from longitudinal studies with long-term follow-up and repeated
      anthropometric measures are typically subject to missing data at various time
      points, which was also the case in this study. Yet, this limitation was partially
      overcome by using growth curve models, which enabled us to impute data at missing
      time points for each participant. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study showed that
      a longer duration of overweight and obesity is associated with an increased risk 
      of developing several forms of cancer. Furthermore, the degree of overweight
      experienced during adulthood seemed to play an important role in the risk of
      developing cancer, especially for endometrial cancer. Although the observational 
      nature of our study precludes inferring causality or making clinical
      recommendations, our findings suggest that reducing overweight duration in
      adulthood could reduce cancer risk and that obesity prevention is important from 
      early onset. If this is true, health care teams should recognize the potential of
      obesity management in cancer prevention and that excess body weight in women is
      important to manage regardless of the age of the patient.

TI  - Assessment of Adverse Events in Protocols, Clinical Study Reports, and Published 
      Papers of Trials of Orlistat: A Document Analysis.
PG  - e1002101
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about how adverse events are summarised and reported 
      in trials, as detailed information is usually considered confidential. We have
      acquired clinical study reports (CSRs) from the European Medicines Agency through
      the Freedom of Information Act. The CSRs describe the results of studies
      conducted as part of the application for marketing authorisation for the slimming
      pill orlistat. The purpose of this study was to study how adverse events were
      summarised and reported in study protocols, CSRs, and published papers of
      orlistat trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We received the CSRs from seven randomised
      placebo controlled orlistat trials (4,225 participants) submitted by Roche. The
      CSRs consisted of 8,716 pages and included protocols. Two researchers
      independently extracted data on adverse events from protocols and CSRs.
      Corresponding published papers were identified on PubMed and adverse event data
      were extracted from this source as well. All three sources were compared.
      Individual adverse events from one trial were summed and compared to the totals
      in the summary report. None of the protocols or CSRs contained instructions for
      investigators on how to question participants about adverse events. In CSRs,
      gastrointestinal adverse events were only coded if the participant reported that 
      they were "bothersome," a condition that was not specified in the protocol for
      two of the trials. Serious adverse events were assessed for relationship to the
      drug by the sponsor, and all adverse events were coded by the sponsor using a
      glossary that could be updated by the sponsor. The criteria for withdrawal due to
      adverse events were in one case related to efficacy (high fasting glucose led to 
      withdrawal), which meant that one trial had more withdrawals due to adverse
      events in the placebo group. Finally, only between 3% and 33% of the total number
      of investigator-reported adverse events from the trials were reported in the
      publications because of post hoc filters, though six of seven papers stated that 
      "all adverse events were recorded." For one trial, we identified an additional
      1,318 adverse events that were not listed or mentioned in the CSR itself but
      could be identified through manually counting individual adverse events reported 
      in an appendix. We discovered that the majority of patients had multiple episodes
      of the same adverse event that were only counted once, though this was not
      described in the CSRs. We also discovered that participants treated with orlistat
      experienced twice as many days with adverse events as participants treated with
      placebo (22.7 d versus 14.9 d, p-value < 0.0001, Student's t test). Furthermore, 
      compared with the placebo group, adverse events in the orlistat group were more
      severe. None of this was stated in the CSR or in the published paper. Our
      analysis was restricted to one drug tested in the mid-1990s; our results might
      therefore not be applicable for newer drugs. CONCLUSIONS: In the orlistat trials,
      we identified important disparities in the reporting of adverse events between
      protocols, clinical study reports, and published papers. Reports of these trials 
      seemed to have systematically understated adverse events. Based on these
      findings, systematic reviews of drugs might be improved by including protocols
      and CSRs in addition to published articles.

TI  - Genetic and Environmental Risk for Chronic Pain and the Contribution of Risk
      Variants for Major Depressive Disorder: A Family-Based Mixed-Model Analysis.
PG  - e1002090
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is highly prevalent and a significant source of
      disability, yet its genetic and environmental risk factors are poorly understood.
      Its relationship with major depressive disorder (MDD) is of particular
      importance. We sought to test the contribution of genetic factors and shared and 
      unique environment to risk of chronic pain and its correlation with MDD in
      Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS). We then sought to
      replicate any significant findings in the United Kingdom Biobank study. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: Using family-based mixed-model analyses, we examined the
      contribution of genetics and shared family environment to chronic pain by spouse,
      sibling, and household relationships. These analyses were conducted in GS:SFHS (n
      = 23,960), a family- and population-based study of individuals recruited from the
      Scottish population through their general practitioners. We then examined and
      partitioned the correlation between chronic pain and MDD and estimated the
      contribution of genetic factors and shared environment in GS:SFHS. Finally, we
      used data from two independent genome-wide association studies to test whether
      chronic pain has a polygenic architecture and examine whether genomic risk of
      psychiatric disorder predicted chronic pain and whether genomic risk of chronic
      pain predicted MDD. These analyses were conducted in GS:SFHS and repeated in UK
      Biobank, a study of 500,000 from the UK population, of whom 112,151 had
      genotyping and phenotypic data. Chronic pain is a moderately heritable trait
      (heritability = 38.4%, 95% CI 33.6% to 43.9%) that is significantly concordant in
      spouses (variance explained 18.7%, 95% CI 9.5% to 25.1%). Chronic pain is
      positively correlated with depression (rho = 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15, p =
      2.72x10-68) and shows a tendency to cluster within families for genetic reasons
      (genetic correlation = 0.51, 95%CI 0.40 to 0.62, p = 8.24x10-19). Polygenic risk 
      profiles for pain, generated using independent GWAS data, were associated with
      chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum beta = 6.18x10-2, 95% CI 2.84 x10-2 to 9.35
      x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum beta = 5.68 x 10-2, 95% CI 4.70x10-2
      to 6.65x10-2, p < 3x10-4). Genomic risk of MDD is also significantly associated
      with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum beta = 6.62x10-2, 95% CI 2.82 x10-2 to
      9.76 x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum beta = 2.56x10-2, 95% CI
      1.62x10-2 to 3.63x10-2, p < 3x10-4). Limitations of the current study include the
      possibility that spouse effects may be due to assortative mating and the
      relatively small polygenic risk score effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors,
      as well as chronic pain in a partner or spouse, contribute substantially to the
      risk of chronic pain for an individual. Chronic pain is genetically correlated
      with MDD, has a polygenic architecture, and is associated with polygenic risk of 
      MDD.

TI  - Associations between Mental Health and Ebola-Related Health Behaviors: A
      Regionally Representative Cross-sectional Survey in Post-conflict Sierra Leone.
PG  - e1002073
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to potential relationships between
      mental health, trauma, and personal exposures to Ebola virus disease (EVD) and
      health behaviors in post-conflict West Africa. We tested a conceptual model
      linking mental health and trauma to EVD risk behaviors and EVD prevention
      behaviors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using survey data from a representative sample
      in the Western Urban and Western Rural districts of Sierra Leone, this study
      examines associations between war exposures, post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) symptoms, depression, anxiety, and personal EVD exposure (e.g., having
      family members or friends diagnosed with EVD) and EVD-related health behaviors
      among 1,008 adults (98% response rate) from 63 census enumeration areas of the
      Western Rural and Western Urban districts randomly sampled at the height of the
      EVD epidemic (January-April 2015). Primary outcomes were EVD risk behaviors (14
      items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.84) and EVD prevention behaviors (16 items,
      Cronbach's alpha = 0.88). Main predictors comprised war exposures (8 items,
      Cronbach's alpha = 0.85), anxiety (10 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.93), depression
      (15 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.91), and PTSD symptoms (16 items, Cronbach's
      alpha = 0.93). Data were analyzed using two-level, population-weighted
      hierarchical linear models with 20 multiply imputed datasets. EVD risk behaviors 
      were associated with intensity of depression symptoms (b = 0.05; 95% CI 0.00,
      0.10; p = 0.037), PTSD symptoms (b = 0.10; 95% CI 0.03, 0.17; p = 0.008), having 
      a friend diagnosed with EVD (b = -0.04; 95% CI -0.08, -0.00; p = 0.036), and war 
      exposures (b = -0.09; 95% CI -0.17, -0.02; p = 0.013). EVD prevention behaviors
      were associated with higher anxiety (b = 0.23; 95% CI 0.06, 0.40; p = 0.008),
      having a friend diagnosed with EVD (b = 0.15; 95% CI 0.04, 0.27; p = 0.011), and 
      higher levels of war exposure (b = 0.45; 95% CI 0.16, 0.74; p = 0.003),
      independent of mental health. PTSD symptoms were associated with lower levels of 
      EVD prevention behavior (b = -0.24; 95% CI -0.43, -0.06; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS:
      In post-conflict settings, past war trauma and mental health problems are
      associated with health behaviors related to combatting EVD. The associations
      between war trauma and both EVD risk behaviors and EVD prevention behaviors may
      be mediated through two key mental health variables: depression and PTSD
      symptoms. Considering the role of mental health in the prevention of disease
      transmission may help fight continuing and future Ebola outbreaks in
      post-conflict Sierra Leone. This sample is specific to Freetown and the Western
      Area and may not be representative of all of Sierra Leone. In addition, our main 
      outcomes as well as personal EVD exposure, war exposures, and mental health
      predictors rely on self-report, and therefore raise the possibility of common
      methods bias. However, the findings of this study may be relevant for
      understanding dynamics related to EVD and mental health in other major capital
      cities in the EVD-affected countries of West Africa.

TI  - Glycemic Control and the Risk of Tuberculosis: A Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002072
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) and is
      increasingly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of
      TB is high. Glycemic control has the potential to modify the risk of TB. However,
      there are few studies on the association between glycemic control and TB risk,
      and the results are inconsistent. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We assembled a cohort
      using 123,546 individuals who participated in a community-based health screening 
      service in northern Taiwan from 5 March 2005 to 27 July 2008. Glycemic control
      was measured using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at the time of screening. The
      cohort was followed up to 31 December 2012 for the occurrence of TB by
      cross-matching the screening database to the national health insurance database. 
      Multiple imputation was used to handle missing information. During a median
      follow-up of 4.6 y, 327 cases of TB occurred. In the multivariable Cox regression
      model, diabetic patients with poor glycemic control (FPG > 130 mg/dl) had a
      significantly higher hazard of TB (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.21, 95% CI
      1.63-2.99, p < 0.001) compared to those without diabetes. The hazard of TB in
      diabetic patients with good glycemic control (FPG </= 130 mg/dl) did not differ
      significantly from that in nondiabetic individuals (aHR 0.69, 95% CI 0.35-1.36, p
      = 0.281). In the linear dose-response analysis, the hazard of TB increased with
      FPG (aHR 1.06 per 10-mg/dl increase in FPG, 95% CI 1.03-1.08, p < 0.001).
      Assuming the observed association between glycemic control and TB was causal, an 
      estimated 7.5% (95% CI 4.1%-11.5%) of incident TB in the study population could
      be attributed to poor glycemic control. Limitations of the study include one-time
      measurement of fasting glucose at baseline and voluntary participation in the
      health screening service. CONCLUSIONS: Good glycemic control could potentially
      modify the risk of TB among diabetic patients and may contribute to the control
      of TB in settings where diabetes and TB are prevalent.

TI  - Core Outcomes for Colorectal Cancer Surgery: A Consensus Study.
PG  - e1002071
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of worldwide morbidity and
      mortality. Surgical treatment is common, and there is a great need to improve the
      delivery of such care. The gold standard for evaluating surgery is within
      well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, the impact of RCTs is
      diminished by a lack of coordinated outcome measurement and reporting. A solution
      to these issues is to develop an agreed standard "core" set of outcomes to be
      measured in all trials to facilitate cross-study comparisons, meta-analysis, and 
      minimize outcome reporting bias. This study defines a core outcome set for CRC
      surgery. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The scope of this COS includes clinical
      effectiveness trials of surgical interventions for colorectal cancer. Excluded
      were nonsurgical oncological interventions. Potential outcomes of importance to
      patients and professionals were identified through systematic literature reviews 
      and patient interviews. All outcomes were transcribed verbatim and categorized
      into domains by two independent researchers. This informed a questionnaire survey
      that asked stakeholders (patients and professionals) from United Kingdom CRC
      centers to rate the importance of each domain. Respondents were resurveyed
      following group feedback (Delphi methods). Outcomes rated as less important were 
      discarded after each survey round according to predefined criteria, and remaining
      outcomes were considered at three consensus meetings; two involving international
      professionals and a separate one with patients. A modified nominal group
      technique was used to gain the final consensus. Data sources identified 1,216
      outcomes of CRC surgery that informed a 91 domain questionnaire. First round
      questionnaires were returned from 63 out of 81 (78%) centers, including 90
      professionals, and 97 out of 267 (35%) patients. Second round response rates were
      high for all stakeholders (>80%). Analysis of responses lead to 45 and 23 outcome
      domains being retained after the first and second surveys, respectively.
      Consensus meetings generated agreement on a 12 domain COS. This constituted five 
      perioperative outcome domains (including anastomotic leak), four quality of life 
      outcome domains (including fecal urgency and incontinence), and three oncological
      outcome domains (including long-term survival). CONCLUSION: This study used
      robust consensus methodology to develop a core outcome set for use in colorectal 
      cancer surgical trials. It is now necessary to validate the use of this set in
      research practice.

TI  - Adjuvant Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer by Age and Hormone
      Receptor Status: A Cost-Utility Analysis.
PG  - e1002067
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002067 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal
      antibody trastuzumab improves outcomes in patients with node-positive HER2+ early
      breast cancer. Given trastuzumab's high cost, we aimed to estimate its
      cost-effectiveness by heterogeneity in age and estrogen receptor (ER) and
      progesterone receptor (PR) status, which has previously been unexplored, to
      assist prioritisation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-utility analysis was
      performed using a Markov macro-simulation model, with a lifetime horizon,
      comparing a 12-mo regimen of trastuzumab with chemotherapy alone using the latest
      (2014) effectiveness measures from landmark randomised trials. A New Zealand (NZ)
      health system perspective was adopted, employing high-quality national
      administrative data. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years for trastuzumab
      versus chemotherapy alone are two times higher (2.33 times for the age group
      50-54 y; 95% CI 2.29-2.37) for the worst prognosis (ER-/PR-) subtype compared to 
      the best prognosis (ER+/PR+) subtype, causing incremental cost-effectiveness
      ratios (ICERs) for the former to be less than half those of the latter for the
      age groups from 25-29 to 90-94 y (0.44 times for the age group 50-54 y; 95% CI
      0.43-0.45). If we were to strictly apply an arbitrary cost-effectiveness
      threshold equal to the NZ gross domestic product per capita (2011 purchasing
      power parity [PPP]-adjusted: US$30,300; euro23,700; pound21,200), our study
      suggests that trastuzumab (2011 PPP-adjusted US$45,400/euro35,900/ pound21,900
      for 1 y at formulary prices) may not be cost-effective for ER+ (which are 61% of 
      all) node-positive HER2+ early breast cancer patients but cost-effective for
      ER-/PR- subtypes (37% of all cases) to age 69 y. Market entry of trastuzumab
      biosimilars will likely reduce the ICER to below this threshold for premenopausal
      ER+/PR- cancer but not for ER+/PR+ cancer. Sensitivity analysis using the
      best-case effectiveness measure for ER+ cancer had the same result. A key
      limitation was a lack of treatment-effect data by hormone receptor subtype.
      Heterogeneity was restricted to age and hormone receptor status; tumour
      size/grade heterogeneity could be explored in future work. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study highlights how cost-effectiveness can vary greatly by heterogeneity in age 
      and hormone receptor subtype. Resource allocation and licensing of subsidised
      therapies such as trastuzumab should consider demographic and clinical
      heterogeneity; there is currently a profound disconnect between how funding
      decisions are made (largely agnostic to heterogeneity) and the principles of
      personalised medicine.

TI  - Uptake of Home-Based HIV Testing, Linkage to Care, and Community Attitudes about 
      ART in Rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Descriptive Results from the First
      Phase of the ANRS 12249 TasP Cluster-Randomised Trial.
PG  - e1002107
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2015 WHO recommendation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all
      immediately following HIV diagnosis is partially based on the anticipated impact 
      on HIV incidence in the surrounding population. We investigated this approach in 
      a cluster-randomised trial in a high HIV prevalence setting in rural
      KwaZulu-Natal. We present findings from the first phase of the trial and report
      on uptake of home-based HIV testing, linkage to care, uptake of ART, and
      community attitudes about ART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between 9 March 2012 and 22 
      May 2014, five clusters in the intervention arm (immediate ART offered to all
      HIV-positive adults) and five clusters in the control arm (ART offered according 
      to national guidelines, i.e., CD4 count </= 350 cells/mul) contributed to the
      first phase of the trial. Households were visited every 6 mo. Following informed 
      consent and administration of a study questionnaire, each resident adult (>/=16
      y) was asked for a finger-prick blood sample, which was used to estimate HIV
      prevalence, and offered a rapid HIV test using a serial HIV testing algorithm.
      All HIV-positive adults were referred to the trial clinic in their cluster. Those
      not linked to care 3 mo after identification were contacted by a linkage-to-care 
      team. Study procedures were not blinded. In all, 12,894 adults were registered as
      eligible for participation (5,790 in intervention arm; 7,104 in control arm), of 
      whom 9,927 (77.0%) were contacted at least once during household visits. HIV
      status was ever ascertained for a total of 8,233/9,927 (82.9%), including 2,569
      ascertained as HIV-positive (942 tested HIV-positive and 1,627 reported a known
      HIV-positive status). Of the 1,177 HIV-positive individuals not previously in
      care and followed for at least 6 mo in the trial, 559 (47.5%) visited their
      cluster trial clinic within 6 mo. In the intervention arm, 89% (194/218)
      initiated ART within 3 mo of their first clinic visit. In the control arm, 42.3% 
      (83/196) had a CD4 count </= 350 cells/mul at first visit, of whom 92.8%
      initiated ART within 3 mo. Regarding attitudes about ART, 93% (8,802/9,460) of
      participants agreed with the statement that they would want to start ART as soon 
      as possible if HIV-positive. Estimated baseline HIV prevalence was 30.5%
      (2,028/6,656) (95% CI 25.0%, 37.0%). HIV prevalence, uptake of home-based HIV
      testing, linkage to care within 6 mo, and initiation of ART within 3 mo in those 
      with CD4 count </= 350 cells/mul did not differ significantly between the
      intervention and control clusters. Selection bias related to noncontact could not
      be entirely excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Home-based HIV testing was well received in
      this rural population, although men were less easily contactable at home;
      immediate ART was acceptable, with good viral suppression and retention. However,
      only about half of HIV-positive people accessed care within 6 mo of being
      identified, with nearly two-thirds accessing care by 12 mo. The observed delay in
      linkage to care would limit the individual and public health ART benefits of
      universal testing and treatment in this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Improving Clinical Risk Stratification at Diagnosis in Primary Prostate Cancer: A
      Prognostic Modelling Study.
PG  - e1002063
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002063 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Over 80% of the nearly 1 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer
      annually worldwide present with localised or locally advanced non-metastatic
      disease. Risk stratification is the cornerstone for clinical decision making and 
      treatment selection for these men. The most widely applied stratification systems
      use presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, biopsy Gleason
      grade, and clinical stage to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high
      risk. There is, however, significant heterogeneity in outcomes within these
      standard groupings. The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has 
      recently adopted a prognosis-based pathological classification that has yet to be
      included within a risk stratification system. Here we developed and tested a new 
      stratification system based on the number of individual risk factors and
      incorporating the new ISUP prognostic score. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Diagnostic
      clinicopathological data from 10,139 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer were
      available for this study from the Public Health England National Cancer
      Registration Service Eastern Office. This cohort was divided into a training set 
      (n = 6,026; 1,557 total deaths, with 462 from prostate cancer) and a testing set 
      (n = 4,113; 1,053 total deaths, with 327 from prostate cancer). The median
      follow-up was 6.9 y, and the primary outcome measure was prostate-cancer-specific
      mortality (PCSM). An external validation cohort (n = 1,706) was also used.
      Patients were first categorised as low, intermediate, or high risk using the
      current three-stratum stratification system endorsed by the National Institute
      for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The variables used to define
      the groups (PSA concentration, Gleason grading, and clinical stage) were then
      used to sub-stratify within each risk category by testing the individual and then
      combined number of risk factors. In addition, we incorporated the new ISUP
      prognostic score as a discriminator. Using this approach, a new five-stratum risk
      stratification system was produced, and its prognostic power was compared against
      the current system, with PCSM as the outcome. The results were analysed using a
      Cox hazards model, the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves, competing-risks
      regression, and concordance indices. In the training set, the new risk
      stratification system identified distinct subgroups with different risks of PCSM 
      in pair-wise comparison (p < 0.0001). Specifically, the new classification
      identified a very low-risk group (Group 1), a subgroup of intermediate-risk
      cancers with a low PCSM risk (Group 2, hazard ratio [HR] 1.62 [95% CI
      0.96-2.75]), and a subgroup of intermediate-risk cancers with an increased PCSM
      risk (Group 3, HR 3.35 [95% CI 2.04-5.49]) (p < 0.0001). High-risk cancers were
      also sub-classified by the new system into subgroups with lower and higher PCSM
      risk: Group 4 (HR 5.03 [95% CI 3.25-7.80]) and Group 5 (HR 17.28 [95% CI
      11.2-26.67]) (p < 0.0001), respectively. These results were recapitulated in the 
      testing set and remained robust after inclusion of competing risks. In comparison
      to the current risk stratification system, the new system demonstrated improved
      prognostic performance, with a concordance index of 0.75 (95% CI 0.72-0.77)
      versus 0.69 (95% CI 0.66-0.71) (p < 0.0001). In an external cohort, the new
      system achieved a concordance index of 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.84) for predicting
      PCSM versus 0.66 (95% CI 0.63-0.69) (p < 0.0001) for the current NICE risk
      stratification system. The main limitations of the study were that it was
      registry based and that follow-up was relatively short. CONCLUSIONS: A novel and 
      simple five-stratum risk stratification system outperforms the standard
      three-stratum risk stratification system in predicting the risk of PCSM at
      diagnosis in men with primary non-metastatic prostate cancer, even when
      accounting for competing risks. This model also allows delineation of new
      clinically relevant subgroups of men who might potentially receive more
      appropriate therapy for their disease. Future research will seek to validate our 
      results in external datasets and will explore the value of including additional
      variables in the system in order in improve prognostic performance.

TI  - Adverse Renal, Endocrine, Hepatic, and Metabolic Events during Maintenance Mood
      Stabilizer Treatment for Bipolar Disorder: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002058
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited, poorly characterized information about adverse
      events occurring during maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. We aimed to
      determine adverse event rates during treatment with lithium, valproate,
      olanzapine, and quetiapine. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a propensity score
      adjusted cohort study using nationally representative United Kingdom electronic
      health records from January 1, 1995, until December 31, 2013. We included
      patients who had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and were prescribed lithium (n =
      2148), valproate (n = 1670), olanzapine (n = 1477), or quetiapine (n = 1376) as
      maintenance mood stabilizer treatment. Adverse outcomes were chronic kidney
      disease, thyroid disease, hypercalcemia, weight gain, hypertension, type 2
      diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and hepatotoxicity. The propensity
      score included important demographic, physical health, and mental health
      predictors of drug treatment allocation. The median duration of drug treatment
      was 1.48 y (interquartile range 0.64-3.43). Compared to patients prescribed
      lithium, those taking valproate, olanzapine, and quetiapine had reduced rates of 
      chronic kidney disease stage 3 or more severe, following adjustment for
      propensity score, age, and calendar year, and accounting for clustering by
      primary care practice (valproate hazard ratio [HR] 0.56; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 0.45-0.69; p < 0.001, olanzapine HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.45-0.71; p < 0.001,
      quetiapine HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.47-0.80; p < 0.001). Hypothyroidism was reduced in
      those taking valproate (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40-0.89; p = 0.012) and olanzapine (HR 
      0.48; 95% CI 0.29-0.77; p = 0.003), compared to those taking lithium. Rates of
      new onset hyperthyroidism (valproate HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.61; p = 0.003,
      olanzapine HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.13-0.73; p = 0.007) and hypercalcemia (valproate HR 
      0.25; 95% CI 0.10-0.60; p = 0.002, olanzapine HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.14-0.76; p =
      0.008, quetiapine HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.07-0.73; p = 0.013) were also reduced
      relative to lithium. However, rates of greater than 15% weight gain on valproate,
      olanzapine, and quetiapine were higher (valproate HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.31-2.01; p < 
      0.001, olanzapine HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.47-2.30; p < 0.001, quetiapine HR 1.67; 95%
      CI 1.24-2.20; p < 0.001) than in individuals prescribed lithium, as were rates of
      hypertension in the olanzapine treated group (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.87; p =
      0.017). We found no significant difference in rates of chronic kidney disease
      stage 4 or more severe, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or
      hepatotoxicity. Despite estimates being robust following sensitivity analyses,
      limitations include the potential for residual confounding and ascertainment bias
      and an inability to examine dosage effects. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium use is
      associated with more renal and endocrine adverse events but less weight gain than
      commonly used alternative mood stabilizers. Risks need to be offset with the
      effectiveness and anti-suicidal benefits of lithium and the potential metabolic
      side effects of alternative treatment options.

TI  - South Asia as a Reservoir for the Global Spread of Ciprofloxacin-Resistant
      Shigella sonnei: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e1002055
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the Shigellae,
      particularly as a specific multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineage of Shigella sonnei
      (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended
      treatment for Shigella infections. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei are
      being increasingly isolated in Asia and sporadically reported on other
      continents. We hypothesized that Asia is a primary hub for the recent
      international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      We performed whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 60 contemporaneous
      ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei isolated in four countries within Asia
      (Vietnam, n = 11; Bhutan, n = 12; Thailand, n = 1; Cambodia, n = 1) and two
      outside of Asia (Australia, n = 19; Ireland, n = 16). We reconstructed the recent
      evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their
      geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global
      phylogeny, we found that all ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei formed a single
      clade within a Central Asian expansion of lineage III. Furthermore, our data show
      that resistance to ciprofloxacin within S. sonnei may be globally attributed to a
      single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and 
      gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely
      primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia
      and intercontinentally into Australia, the United States and Europe. Our analysis
      was limited by the number of S. sonnei sequences available from diverse
      geographical areas and time periods, and we cannot discount the potential
      existence of other unsampled reservoir populations of antimicrobial-resistant S. 
      sonnei. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a single clone, which is widespread
      in South Asia, is likely driving the current intercontinental surge of
      ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei and is capable of establishing endemic
      transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our
      work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of
      antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, with S. sonnei acting as a tractable model for
      studying how antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria spread globally.

TI  - Facility-Based Delivery during the Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic in Rural Liberia:
      Analysis from a Cross-Sectional, Population-Based Household Survey.
PG  - e1002096
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic has threatened access to basic
      health services through facility closures, resource diversion, and decreased
      demand due to community fear and distrust. While modeling studies have attempted 
      to estimate the impact of these disruptions, no studies have yet utilized
      population-based survey data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a two-stage,
      cluster-sample household survey in Rivercess County, Liberia, in March-April
      2015, which included a maternal and reproductive health module. We constructed a 
      retrospective cohort of births beginning 4 y before the first day of survey
      administration (beginning March 24, 2011). We then fit logistic regression models
      to estimate associations between our primary outcome, facility-based delivery
      (FBD), and time period, defined as the pre-EVD period (March 24, 2011-June 14,
      2014) or EVD period (June 15, 2014-April 13, 2015). We fit both univariable and
      multivariable models, adjusted for known predictors of facility delivery,
      accounting for clustering using linearized standard errors. To strengthen causal 
      inference, we also conducted stratified analyses to assess changes in FBD by
      whether respondents believed that health facility attendance was an EVD risk
      factor. A total of 1,298 women from 941 households completed the survey. Median
      age at the time of survey was 29 y, and over 80% had a primary education or less.
      There were 686 births reported in the pre-EVD period and 212 in the EVD period.
      The unadjusted odds ratio of facility-based delivery in the EVD period was 0.66
      (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.90, p-value = 0.010). Adjustment for
      potential confounders did not change the observed association, either in the
      principal model (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.70, 95%CI 0.50-0.98, p = 0.037) or
      a fully adjusted model (AOR = 0.69, 95%CI 0.50-0.97, p = 0.033). The association 
      was robust in sensitivity analyses. The reduction in FBD during the EVD period
      was observed among those reporting a belief that health facilities are or may be 
      a source of Ebola transmission (AOR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.36-0.97, p = 0.038), but not 
      those without such a belief (AOR = 0.90, 95%CI 0.59-1.37, p = 0.612). Limitations
      include the possibility of FBD secular trends coincident with the EVD period,
      recall errors, and social desirability bias. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a 30%
      decreased odds of FBD after the start of EVD in a rural Liberian county with
      relatively few cases. Because health facilities never closed in Rivercess County,
      this estimate may under-approximate the effect seen in the most heavily affected 
      areas. These are the first population-based survey data to show collateral
      disruptions to facility-based delivery caused by the West African EVD epidemic,
      and they reinforce the need to consider the full spectrum of implications caused 
      by public health emergencies.

TI  - Cardiometabolic Risk Factor Changes Observed in Diabetes Prevention Programs in
      US Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - e1002095
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002095 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study showed that weight loss
      in high-risk adults lowered diabetes incidence and cardiovascular disease risk.
      No prior analyses have aggregated weight and cardiometabolic risk factor changes 
      observed in studies implementing DPP interventions in nonresearch settings in the
      United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis,
      we pooled data from studies in the United States implementing DPP lifestyle
      modification programs (focused on modest [5%-7%] weight loss through >/=150 min
      of moderate physical activity per week and restriction of fat intake) in
      clinical, community, and online settings. We reported aggregated pre- and
      post-intervention weight and cardiometabolic risk factor changes (fasting blood
      glucose [FBG], glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c], systolic or diastolic blood
      pressure [SBP/DBP], total [TC] or HDL-cholesterol). We searched the MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases from January 1, 2003, 
      to May 1, 2016. Two reviewers independently evaluated article eligibility and
      extracted data on study designs, populations enrolled, intervention program
      characteristics (duration, number of core and maintenance sessions), and
      outcomes. We used a random effects model to calculate summary estimates for each 
      outcome and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). To examine sources of
      heterogeneity, results were stratified according to the presence of maintenance
      sessions, risk level of participants (prediabetes or other), and intervention
      delivery personnel (lay or professional). Forty-four studies that enrolled 8,995 
      participants met eligibility criteria. Participants had an average age of 50.8
      years and body mass index (BMI) of 34.8 kg/m2, and 25.2% were male. On average,
      study follow-up was 9.3 mo (median 12.0) with a range of 1.5 to 36 months;
      programs offered a mean of 12.6 sessions, with mean participant attendance of
      11.0 core sessions. Sixty percent of programs offered some form of post-core
      maintenance (either email or in person). Mean absolute changes observed were:
      weight -3.77 kg (95% CI: -4.55; -2.99), HbA1c -0.21% (-0.29; -0.13), FBG -2.40
      mg/dL (-3.59; -1.21), SBP -4.29 mmHg (-5.73, -2.84), DBP -2.56 mmHg (-3.40,
      1.71), HDL +0.85 mg/dL (-0.10, 1.60), and TC -5.34 mg/dL (-9.72, -0.97). Programs
      with a maintenance component achieved greater reductions in weight (additional
      -1.66kg) and FBG (additional -3.14 mg/dl). Findings are subject to incomplete
      reporting and heterogeneity of studies included, and confounding because most
      included studies used pre-post study designs. CONCLUSIONS: DPP lifestyle
      modification programs achieved clinically meaningful weight and cardiometabolic
      health improvements. Together, these data suggest that additional value is gained
      from these programs, reinforcing that they are likely very cost-effective.

      Trial of a Postnatal Diabetes Prevention Program.
PG  - e1002092
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an increasingly prevalent risk
      factor for type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the effectiveness of a group-based
      lifestyle modification program in mothers with prior GDM within their first
      postnatal year. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, 573 women were randomised to
      either the intervention (n = 284) or usual care (n = 289). At baseline, 10% had
      impaired glucose tolerance and 2% impaired fasting glucose. The diabetes
      prevention intervention comprised one individual session, five group sessions,
      and two telephone sessions. Primary outcomes were changes in diabetes risk
      factors (weight, waist circumference, and fasting blood glucose), and secondary
      outcomes included achievement of lifestyle modification goals and changes in
      depression score and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The mean changes
      (intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis) over 12 mo were as follows: -0.23 kg body
      weight in intervention group (95% CI -0.89, 0.43) compared with +0.72 kg in usual
      care group (95% CI 0.09, 1.35) (change difference -0.95 kg, 95% CI -1.87, -0.04; 
      group by treatment interaction p = 0.04); -2.24 cm waist measurement in
      intervention group (95% CI -3.01, -1.42) compared with -1.74 cm in usual care
      group (95% CI -2.52, -0.96) (change difference -0.50 cm, 95% CI -1.63, 0.63;
      group by treatment interaction p = 0.389); and +0.18 mmol/l fasting blood glucose
      in intervention group (95% CI 0.11, 0.24) compared with +0.22 mmol/l in usual
      care group (95% CI 0.16, 0.29) (change difference -0.05 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.14,
      0.05; group by treatment interaction p = 0.331). Only 10% of women attended all
      sessions, 53% attended one individual and at least one group session, and 34%
      attended no sessions. Loss to follow-up was 27% and 21% for the intervention and 
      control groups, respectively, primarily due to subsequent pregnancies. Study
      limitations include low exposure to the full intervention and glucose metabolism 
      profiles being near normal at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Although a 1-kg weight
      difference has the potential to be significant for reducing diabetes risk, the
      level of engagement during the first postnatal year was low. Further research is 
      needed to improve engagement, including participant involvement in study design; 
      it is potentially more effective to implement annual diabetes screening until
      women develop prediabetes before offering an intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Exercise Training and Weight Gain in Obese Pregnant Women: A Randomized
      Controlled Trial (ETIP Trial).
PG  - e1002079
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002079 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of exercise training for preventing excessive
      gestational weight gain (GWG) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is still
      uncertain. As maternal obesity is associated with both GWG and GDM, there is a
      special need to assess whether prenatal exercise training programs provided to
      obese women reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our primary aim was to
      assess whether regular supervised exercise training in pregnancy could reduce GWG
      in women with prepregnancy overweight/obesity. Secondary aims were to examine the
      effects of exercise in pregnancy on 30 outcomes including GDM incidence, blood
      pressure, blood measurements, skinfold thickness, and body composition. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: This was a single-center study where we randomized (1:1) 91
      pregnant women with a prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) >/= 28 kg/m2 to exercise
      training (n = 46) or control (standard maternity care) (n = 45). Assessments were
      done at baseline (pregnancy week 12-18) and in late pregnancy (week 34-37), as
      well as at delivery. The exercise group was offered thrice weekly supervised
      sessions of 35 min of moderate intensity endurance exercise and 25 min of
      strength training. Seventeen women were lost to follow-up (eight in the exercise 
      group and nine in the control group). Our primary endpoint was GWG from baseline 
      testing to delivery. The principal analyses were done as intention-to-treat
      analyses, with supplementary per protocol analyses where we assessed outcomes in 
      the women who adhered to the exercise program (n = 19) compared to the control
      group. Mean GWG from baseline to delivery was 10.5 kg in the exercise group and
      9.2 kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.92 kg (95% CI -1.35,
      3.18; p = 0.43). Among the 30 secondary outcomes in late pregnancy, an apparent
      reduction was recorded in the incidence of GDM (2009 WHO definition) in the
      exercise group (2 cases; 6.1%) compared to the control group (9 cases; 27.3%),
      with an odds ratio of 0.1 (95% CI 0.02, 0.95; p = 0.04). Systolic blood pressure 
      was significantly lower in the exercise group (mean 120.4 mm Hg) compared to the 
      control group (mean 128.1 mm Hg), with a mean difference of -7.73 mm Hg (95% CI
      -13.23, -2.22; p = 0.006). No significant between-group differences were seen in 
      diastolic blood pressure, blood measurements, skinfold thickness, or body
      composition in late pregnancy. In per protocol analyses, late pregnancy systolic 
      blood pressure was 115.7 (95% CI 110.0, 121.5) mm Hg in the exercise group
      (significant between-group difference, p = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure
      was 75.1 (95% CI 71.6, 78.7) mm Hg (significant between-group difference, p =
      0.02). We had planned to recruit 150 women into the trial; hence,
      under-recruitment represents a major limitation of our results. Another
      limitation to our study was the low adherence to the exercise program, with only 
      50% of the women included in the intention-to-treat analysis adhering as
      described in the study protocol. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial we did not observe a 
      reduction in GWG among overweight/obese women who received a supervised exercise 
      training program during their pregnancy. The incidence of GDM in late pregnancy
      seemed to be lower in the women randomized to exercise training than in the women
      receiving standard maternity care only. Systolic blood pressure in late pregnancy
      was also apparently lower in the exercise group than in the control group. These 
      results indicate that supervised exercise training might be beneficial as a part 
      of standard pregnancy care for overweight/obese women. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Supported Telemonitoring and Glycemic Control in People with Type 2 Diabetes: The
      Telescot Diabetes Pragmatic Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002098
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002098 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood glucose among people with type 2 diabetes
      not treated with insulin does not appear to be effective in improving glycemic
      control. We investigated whether health professional review of telemetrically
      transmitted self-monitored glucose results in improved glycemic control in people
      with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a
      randomized, parallel, investigator-blind controlled trial with centralized
      randomization in family practices in four regions of the United Kingdom among 321
      people with type 2 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >58 mmol/mol. The
      supported telemonitoring intervention involved self-measurement and transmission 
      to a secure website of twice-weekly morning and evening glucose for review by
      family practice clinicians who were not blinded to allocation group. The control 
      group received usual care, with at least annual review and more frequent reviews 
      for people with poor glycemic or blood pressure control. HbA1c assessed at 9 mo
      was the primary outcome. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. 160 people
      were randomized to the intervention group and 161 to the usual care group between
      June 6, 2011, and July 19, 2013. HbA1c data at follow-up were available for 146
      people in the intervention group and 139 people in the control group. The mean
      (SD) HbA1c at follow-up was 63.0 (15.5) mmol/mol in the intervention group and
      67.8 (14.7) mmol/mol in the usual care group. For primary analysis, adjusted mean
      HbA1c was 5.60 mmol/mol / 0.51% lower (95% CI 2.38 to 8.81 mmol/mol/ 95% CI 0.22%
      to 0.81%, p = 0.0007). For secondary analyses, adjusted mean ambulatory systolic 
      blood pressure was 3.06 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.56-5.56 mmHg, p = 0.017) and mean
      ambulatory diastolic blood pressure was 2.17 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.62-3.72, p =
      0.006) among people in the intervention group when compared with usual care after
      adjustment for baseline differences and minimization strata. No significant
      differences were identified between groups in weight, treatment pattern,
      adherence to medication, or quality of life in secondary analyses. There were few
      adverse events and these were equally distributed between the intervention and
      control groups. In secondary analysis, there was a greater number of telephone
      calls between practice nurses and patients in the intervention compared with
      control group (rate ratio 7.50 (95% CI 4.45-12.65, p < 0.0001) but no other
      significant differences between groups in use of health services were identified 
      between groups. Key limitations include potential lack of representativeness of
      trial participants, inability to blind participants and health professionals, and
      uncertainty about the mechanism, the duration of the effect, and the optimal
      length of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Supported telemonitoring resulted in
      clinically important improvements in control of glycaemia in patients with type 2
      diabetes in family practice. Current Controlled Trials, registration number
      ISRCTN71674628. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 71674628.

PG  - e1002094
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether and how n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are
      related to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is debated. Objectively measured plasma PUFAs
      can help to clarify these associations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Plasma phospholipid
      PUFAs were measured by gas chromatography among 12,132 incident T2D cases and
      15,919 subcohort participants in the European Prospective Investigation into
      Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct study across eight European countries.
      Country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox
      regression and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. We also systematically
      reviewed published prospective studies on circulating PUFAs and T2D risk and
      pooled the quantitative evidence for comparison with results from EPIC-InterAct. 
      In EPIC-InterAct, among long-chain n-3 PUFAs, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was
      inversely associated with T2D (HR per standard deviation [SD] 0.93; 95% CI
      0.88-0.98), but eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were
      not significantly associated. Among n-6 PUFAs, linoleic acid (LA) (0.80; 95% CI
      0.77-0.83) and eicosadienoic acid (EDA) (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.94) were inversely
      related, and arachidonic acid (AA) was not significantly associated, while
      significant positive associations were observed with gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), 
      dihomo-GLA, docosatetraenoic acid (DTA), and docosapentaenoic acid (n6-DPA), with
      HRs between 1.13 to 1.46 per SD. These findings from EPIC-InterAct were broadly
      similar to comparative findings from summary estimates from up to nine studies
      including between 71 to 2,499 T2D cases. Limitations included potential residual 
      confounding and the inability to distinguish between dietary and metabolic
      influences on plasma phospholipid PUFAs. CONCLUSIONS: These large-scale findings 
      suggest an important inverse association of circulating plant-origin n-3 PUFA
      (ALA) but no convincing association of marine-derived n3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) with
      T2D. Moreover, they highlight that the most abundant n6-PUFA (LA) is inversely
      associated with T2D. The detection of associations with previously less
      well-investigated PUFAs points to the importance of considering individual fatty 
      acids rather than focusing on fatty acid class.

TI  - Effects of Saturated Fat, Polyunsaturated Fat, Monounsaturated Fat, and
      Carbohydrate on Glucose-Insulin Homeostasis: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-analysis of Randomised Controlled Feeding Trials.
PG  - e1002087
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effects of major dietary macronutrients on glucose-insulin
      homeostasis remain controversial and may vary by the clinical measures examined. 
      We aimed to assess how saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA),
      polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), and carbohydrate affect key metrics of
      glucose-insulin homeostasis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We systematically searched
      multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, BIOSIS, Web-of-Knowledge, CAB, CINAHL, 
      Cochrane Library, SIGLE, Faculty1000) for randomised controlled feeding trials
      published by 26 Nov 2015 that tested effects of macronutrient intake on blood
      glucose, insulin, HbA1c, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion in adults
      aged >/=18 years. We excluded trials with non-isocaloric comparisons and trials
      providing dietary advice or supplements rather than meals. Studies were reviewed 
      and data extracted independently in duplicate. Among 6,124 abstracts, 102 trials,
      including 239 diet arms and 4,220 adults, met eligibility requirements. Using
      multiple-treatment meta-regression, we estimated dose-response effects of
      isocaloric replacements between SFA, MUFA, PUFA, and carbohydrate, adjusted for
      protein, trans fat, and dietary fibre. Replacing 5% energy from carbohydrate with
      SFA had no significant effect on fasting glucose (+0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI = -0.01,
      +0.04; n trials = 99), but lowered fasting insulin (-1.1 pmol/L; -1.7, -0.5; n = 
      90). Replacing carbohydrate with MUFA lowered HbA1c (-0.09%; -0.12, -0.05; n =
      23), 2 h post-challenge insulin (-20.3 pmol/L; -32.2, -8.4; n = 11), and
      homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (-2.4%; -4.6, -0.3;
      n = 30). Replacing carbohydrate with PUFA significantly lowered HbA1c (-0.11%;
      -0.17, -0.05) and fasting insulin (-1.6 pmol/L; -2.8, -0.4). Replacing SFA with
      PUFA significantly lowered glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, and HOMA. Based on
      gold-standard acute insulin response in ten trials, PUFA significantly improved
      insulin secretion capacity (+0.5 pmol/L/min; 0.2, 0.8) whether replacing
      carbohydrate, SFA, or even MUFA. No significant effects of any macronutrient
      replacements were observed for 2 h post-challenge glucose or insulin sensitivity 
      (minimal-model index). Limitations included a small number of trials for some
      outcomes and potential issues of blinding, compliance, generalisability,
      heterogeneity due to unmeasured factors, and publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled feeding trials provides evidence that
      dietary macronutrients have diverse effects on glucose-insulin homeostasis. In
      comparison to carbohydrate, SFA, or MUFA, most consistent favourable effects were
      seen with PUFA, which was linked to improved glycaemia, insulin resistance, and
      insulin secretion capacity.

TI  - Obesity and Life Expectancy with and without Diabetes in Adults Aged 55 Years and
      Older in the Netherlands: A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002086
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002086 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of type 2
      diabetes. Limited evidence exists regarding the effect of excess weight on years 
      lived with and without diabetes. We aimed to determine the association of
      overweight and obesity with the number of years lived with and without diabetes
      in a middle-aged and elderly population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study included
      6,499 individuals (3,656 women) aged 55 y and older from the population-based
      Rotterdam Study. We developed a multistate life table to calculate life
      expectancy for individuals who were normal weight, overweight, and obese and the 
      difference in years lived with and without diabetes. For life table calculations,
      we used prevalence, incidence rate, and hazard ratios (HRs) for three transitions
      (healthy to diabetes, healthy to death, and diabetes to death), stratifying by
      body mass index (BMI) at baseline and adjusting for confounders. During a median 
      follow-up of 11.1 y, we observed 697 incident diabetes events and 2,192 overall
      deaths. Obesity was associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes (HR:
      2.13 [p < 0.001] for men and 3.54 [p < 0.001] for women). Overweight and obesity 
      were not associated with mortality in men and women with or without diabetes.
      Total life expectancy remained unaffected by overweight and obesity.
      Nevertheless, men with obesity aged 55 y and older lived 2.8 (95% CI -6.1 to
      -0.1) fewer y without diabetes than normal weight individuals, whereas, for
      women, the difference between obese and normal weight counterparts was 4.7 (95%
      CI -9.0 to -0.6) y. Men and women with obesity lived 2.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 6.2) and 
      5.3 (95% CI 1.6 to 9.3) y longer with diabetes, respectively, compared to their
      normal weight counterparts. Since the implications of these findings could be
      limited to middle-aged and older white European populations, our results need
      confirmation in other populations. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in the middle aged and
      elderly is associated with a reduction in the number of years lived free of
      diabetes and an increase in the number of years lived with diabetes. Those extra 
      years lived with morbidity might place a high toll on individuals and health care
      systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is a key modifiable risk factor for multiple chronic conditions,
      including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Consuming a range of foods from the five major
      food groups is advocated as critical to healthy eating, but the association of
      diversity across major food groups with T2D is not clear and the relationship of 
      within-food-group diversity is unknown. In addition, there is a growing price gap
      between more and less healthy foods, which may limit the uptake of varied diets. 
      The current study had two aims: first, to examine the association of reported
      diversity of intake of food groups as well as their subtypes with risk of
      developing T2D, and second, to estimate the monetary cost associated with dietary
      diversity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective study of 23,238 participants in
      the population-based EPIC-Norfolk cohort completed a baseline Food Frequency
      Questionnaire in 1993-1997 and were followed up for a median of 10 y. We derived 
      a total diet diversity score and additional scores for diversity within each food
      group (dairy products, fruits, vegetables, meat and alternatives, and grains). We
      used multivariable Cox regression analyses for incident diabetes (892 new cases),
      and multivariable linear regression for diet cost. Greater total diet diversity
      was associated with 30% lower risk of developing T2D (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.70 [95%
      CI 0.51 to 0.95]) comparing diets comprising all five food groups to those with
      three or fewer, adjusting for confounders including obesity and socioeconomic
      status. In analyses of diversity within each food group, greater diversity in
      dairy products (HR 0.61 [0.45 to 0.81]), fruits (HR 0.69 [0.52 to 0.90]), and
      vegetables (HR 0.67 [0.52 to 0.87]) were each associated with lower incident
      diabetes. The cost of consuming a diet covering all 5 food groups was 18% higher 
      ( pound4.15/day [4.14 to 4.16]) than one comprising three or fewer groups. Key
      limitations are the self-reported dietary data and the binary scoring approach
      whereby some food groups contained both healthy and less healthy food items.
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet characterized by regular consumption of all five food groups 
      and by greater variety of dairy, fruit, and vegetable subtypes, appears important
      for a reduced risk of diabetes. However, such a diet is more expensive. Public
      health efforts to prevent diabetes should include food price policies to promote 
      healthier, more varied diets.

TI  - Engagement, Retention, and Progression to Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective
      Analysis of the Cluster-Randomised "Let's Prevent Diabetes" Trial.
PG  - e1002078
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global priority.
      Let's Prevent Diabetes is a group-based diabetes prevention programme; it was
      evaluated in a cluster-randomised trial, in which the primary analysis showed a
      reduction in T2DM (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.14, p = 0.18). We
      examined the association of engagement and retention with the Let's Prevent
      Diabetes prevention programme and T2DM incidence. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used
      data from a completed cluster-randomised controlled trial including 43 general
      practices randomised to receive either standard care or a 6-h group structured
      education programme with an annual refresher course for 2 y. The primary outcome 
      was progression to T2DM at 3 y. The characteristics of those who attended the
      initial education session (engagers) versus nonengagers and those who attended
      all sessions (retainers) versus nonretainers were compared. Risk reduction of
      progression to T2DM by level of attendance was compared to standard care. Eight
      hundred and eighty participants were recruited, with 447 to the intervention arm,
      of which 346 (77.4%) were engagers and 130 (29.1%) were retainers. Retainers and 
      engagers were more likely to be older, leaner, and nonsmokers than
      nonretainers/nonengagers. Engagers were also more likely to be male and be from
      less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonengagers. Participants who attended
      the initial session and at least one refresher session were less likely to
      develop T2DM compared to those in the control arm (30 people of 248 versus 67
      people of 433, HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.24-0.62]). Participants who were retained in the
      programme were also less likely to develop T2DM compared to those in the control 
      arm (7 people of 130 versus 67 people of 433, HR 0.12 [95% CI 0.05-0.28]). Being 
      retained in the programme was also associated with improvements in glucose,
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, waist circumference, anxiety, quality of
      life, and daily step count. Given that the data used are from a clinical trial,
      those taking part might reflect a more motivated sample than the population,
      which should be taken into account when interpreting the results. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study suggests that being retained/engaged in a relatively low-resource,
      pragmatic diabetes prevention programme for those at high risk is associated with
      reductions in the progression to T2DM in comparison to those who receive standard
      care. Nonengagers and nonretainers share similar high-risk traits. Service
      providers of programmes should focus on reaching these hard-to-reach groups.

TI  - Associations between Recreational and Commuter Cycling, Changes in Cycling, and
      Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Cohort Study of Danish Men and Women.
PG  - e1002076
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002076 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cycling is a recreational activity and mode of commuting with
      substantial potential to improve public health in many countries around the
      world. The aim of this study was to examine prospective associations between
      recreational and commuter cycling, changes in cycling habits, and risk of type 2 
      diabetes (T2D) in Danish adults from the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: At baseline from 1993 to 1997, 24,623 men and 27,890 women 
      from Denmark, 50-65 y of age and free of T2D and other chronic diseases,
      underwent a number of assessments, including completing a lifestyle questionnaire
      also addressing cycling habits. Approximately 5 y later, at a second examination,
      participants completed a new, updated lifestyle questionnaire. Cox regression was
      used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of incident T2D registered in the Danish
      National Diabetes Registry, according to recreational and commuter cycling and
      changes in cycling habits, with adjustment for a priori known T2D risk factors.
      During 743,245.4 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up 14.2 y), 6,779
      incident cases of T2D were documented. Multivariable adjusted HRs (95% confidence
      interval [CI]) were 1, 0.87 (0.82, 0.93), 0.83 (0.77, 0.89), 0.80 (0.74, 0.86)
      and 0.80 (0.74, 0.87) (p for trend = <0.001) for 0, 1-60, 61-150, 151-300, and
      >300 min/wk of total cycling (recreational and commuter cycling), respectively.
      In analysis of seasonal cycling, multivariable adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.88
      (0.83, 0.94), and 0.80 (0.76, 0.85) for non-cyclists, seasonal cyclists (those
      cycling only in summer or winter), and those cycling during both summer and
      winter, respectively. How changes in total cycling from baseline to the second
      examination affected risk was also investigated, and multivariable adjusted HRs
      (95% CI) were 1, 0.88 (0.78, 1.01), 0.80 (0.69, 0.91), and 0.71 (0.65, 0.77) for 
      non-cyclists and for those who ceased, initiated, or continued cycling between
      baseline and the second examination, respectively. Lastly, in the analysis of
      commuter cycling, multivariable HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.72 (0.60, 0.87), 0.83
      (0.69, 1.00), and 0.70 (0.57, 0.85) (p for trend = <0.001) for cycling 0, 1-60,
      61-150, and >150 min/wk to work, respectively. The main limitation of the current
      study is the use of self-reported physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Commuter and
      recreational cycling was consistently associated with lower risk of T2D in Danish
      adults. Our results also provide evidence that late-in-life initiation of or
      continued engagement in cycling lowers risk of T2D.

TI  - Detecting Dysglycemia Using the 2015 United States Preventive Services Task Force
      Screening Criteria: A Cohort Analysis of Community Health Center Patients.
PG  - e1002074
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2015, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
      recommended targeted screening for prediabetes and diabetes (dysglycemia) in
      adults who are aged 40 to 70 y old and overweight or obese. Given increasing
      prevalence of dysglycemia at younger ages and lower body weight, particularly
      among racial/ethnic minorities, we sought to determine whether the current
      screening criteria may fail to identify some high-risk population subgroups.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigated the performance of the 2015 USPSTF
      screening recommendation in detecting dysglycemia among US community health
      center patients. A retrospective analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data 
      from 50,515 adult primary care patients was conducted. Longitudinal EHR data were
      collected in six health centers in the Midwest and Southwest. Patients with a
      first office visit between 2008 and 2010 were identified and followed for up to 3
      y through 2013. We excluded patients who had dysglycemia at baseline and those
      with fewer than two office visits during the follow-up period. The exposure of
      interest was eligibility for screening according to the 2015 USPSTF criteria. The
      primary outcome was development of dysglycemia during follow-up, determined by:
      (1) laboratory results (fasting/2-h postload/random glucose >/= 100/140/200 mg/dL
      [5.55/7.77/11.10 mmol/L] or hemoglobin A1C >/= 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]); (2) diagnosis
      codes for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes; or (3) antidiabetic medication order.
      At baseline, 18,846 (37.3%) participants were aged >/=40 y, 33,537 (66.4%) were
      overweight or obese, and 39,061 (77.3%) were racial/ethnic minorities (34.6%
      Black, 33.9% Hispanic/Latino, and 8.7% Other). Overall, 29,946 (59.3%) patients
      had a glycemic test within 3 y of follow-up, and 8,478 of them developed
      dysglycemia. Only 12,679 (25.1%) patients were eligible for screening according
      to the 2015 USPSTF criteria, which demonstrated the following sensitivity and
      specificity (95% CI): 45.0% (43.9%-46.1%) and 71.9% (71.3%-72.5%), respectively. 
      Racial/ethnic minorities were significantly less likely to be eligible for
      screening yet had higher odds of developing dysglycemia than whites (odds ratio
      [95% CI]: Blacks 1.24 [1.09-1.40]; Hispanics 1.46 [1.30-1.64]; and Other 1.33
      [1.16-1.54]). In addition, the screening criteria had lower sensitivity in all
      racial/ethnic minority groups compared to whites. Limitations of this study
      include the ascertainment of dysglycemia only among patients with available test 
      results and findings that may not be generalizable at the population level.
      CONCLUSIONS: Targeted diabetes screening based on new USPSTF criteria may detect 
      approximately half of adult community health center patients with undiagnosed
      dysglycemia and proportionately fewer racial/ethnic minorities than whites.
      Future research is needed to estimate the performance of these screening criteria
      in population-based samples.

TI  - First-Year Evaluation of Mexico's Tax on Nonessential Energy-Dense Foods: An
      Observational Study.
PG  - e1002057
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In an effort to prevent continued increases in obesity and diabetes, 
      in January 2014, the Mexican government implemented an 8% tax on nonessential
      foods with energy density >/=275 kcal/100 g and a peso-per-liter tax on
      sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Limited rigorous evaluations of food taxes
      exist worldwide. The objective of this study was to examine changes in volume of 
      taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases in response to these taxes in the
      entire sample and stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      This study uses data on household packaged food purchases representative of the
      Mexican urban population from The Nielsen Company's Mexico Consumer Panel
      Services (CPS). We included 6,248 households that participated in the Nielsen CPS
      in at least 2 mo during 2012-2014; average household follow-up was 32.7 mo. We
      analyzed the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to 
      December 2014, using a longitudinal, fixed-effects model that adjusted for
      preexisting trends to test whether the observed post-tax trend was significantly 
      different from the one expected based on the pre-tax trend. We controlled for
      household characteristics and contextual factors like minimum salary and
      unemployment rate. The mean volume of purchases of taxed foods in 2014 changed by
      -25 g (95% confidence interval = -46, -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1% change
      beyond what would have been expected based on pre-tax (2012-2013) trends, with no
      corresponding change in purchases of untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased 
      on average 10.2% less taxed foods than expected (-44 [-72, -16] g per capita per 
      month); medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods than expected (-28 
      [-46, -11] g per capita per month), whereas high SES households' purchases did
      not change. The main limitations of our findings are the inability to infer
      causality because the taxes were implemented at the national level (lack of
      control group), our sample is only representative of urban areas, we only have 2 
      y of data prior to the tax, and, as with any consumer panel survey, we did not
      capture all foods purchased by the household. CONCLUSIONS: Household purchases of
      nonessential energy-dense foods declined in the first year after the
      implementation of Mexico's SSB and nonessential foods taxes. Future studies
      should evaluate the impact of the taxes on overall energy intake, dietary
      quality, and food purchase patterns (see S1 Abstract in Spanish).

TI  - Consumption of Meals Prepared at Home and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: An Analysis of
      Two Prospective Cohort Studies.
PG  - e1002052
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a trend towards increased dining out in many
      countries. Consuming food prepared out of the home has been linked to poor diet
      quality, weight gain, and diabetes risk, but whether having meals prepared at
      home (MPAH) is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unknown.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We followed 58,051 women (from 1986 to 2012) and 41,676 men
      (from 1986 to 2010) in two prospective cohort studies of health professionals.
      Frequencies of consuming midday or evening MPAH were assessed at baseline and
      during follow-up. Incident T2D was identified through self-report and confirmed
      using a validated supplementary questionnaire. During 2.1 million person-years of
      follow-up, 9,356 T2D cases were documented. After adjusting for demographic,
      socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CIs) of T2D were 1 (reference), 0.93 (0.88-0.99), 0.96
      (0.90-1.03), and 0.86 (0.81-0.91) for those eating 0-6, 7-8, 9-10, and 11-14 MPAH
      (p-trend < 0.001) per week, respectively. Participants eating 5-7 midday MPAH had
      9% lower T2D risk than those with 0-2 midday MPAH, and participants having 5-7
      evening MPAH had 15% lower risk than those with 0-2 evening MPAH (both p-trend < 
      0.001). In the first 8 y of follow-up, women and men who consumed 11-14 MPAH per 
      week had 0.34 kg (95% CI: 0.15-0.53; p < 0.001) and 1.23 kg (95% CI: 0.92-1.54)
      less weight gain than those with 0-6 MPAH, respectively. Among participants who
      were nonobese (body mass index [BMI] < 30 kg/m2) at baseline, pooled HR (95% CI) 
      of developing obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m2) was 0.86 (0.82-0.91; p-trend < 0.001)
      when extreme MPAH groups (11-14 MPAH versus 0-6 MPAH) were compared. When midday 
      and evening MPAH were analyzed separately, HRs comparing extreme groups (5-7 MPAH
      versus 0-2 MPAH) were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89-0.97, p-trend = 0.003) for midday MPAH
      and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.83; p-trend < 0.001) for evening MPAH. Further adjusting
      for BMI during follow-up attenuated the association between MPAH and T2D risk:
      the HR (95% CI) for participants with 11-14 MPAH was 0.95 (0.89-1.01, p-trend =
      0.13). The main limitations of our study were that it lacked assessments on
      individual foods constituting the MPAH and that the findings were limited to
      health professionals with a relatively homogeneous socioeconomic status.
      CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohort studies, frequent consumption of
      MPAH is associated with a lower risk of developing T2D, and this association is
      partly attributable to less weight gain linked with this dining behavior.

TI  - Risks and Population Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases Associated with Diabetes
      in China: A Prospective Study of 0.5 Million Adults.
PG  - e1002026
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In China, diabetes prevalence is rising rapidly, but little is known 
      about the associated risks and population burden of cardiovascular diseases. We
      assess associations of diabetes with major cardiovascular diseases and the
      relevance of diabetes duration and other modifiable risk factors to these
      associations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A nationwide prospective study recruited
      512,891 men and women aged 30-79 y between 25 June 2004 and 15 July 2008 from ten
      diverse localities across China. During ~7 y of follow-up, 7,353 cardiovascular
      deaths and 25,451 non-fatal major cardiovascular events were recorded among
      488,760 participants without prior cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox
      regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing disease risks in
      individuals with diabetes to those without. Overall, 5.4% (n = 26,335) of
      participants had self-reported (2.7%) or screen-detected (2.7%) diabetes.
      Individuals with self-reported diabetes had an adjusted HR of 2.07 (95% CI
      1.90-2.26) for cardiovascular mortality. There were significant excess risks of
      major coronary event (2.44, 95% CI 2.18-2.73), ischaemic stroke (1.68, 95% CI
      1.60-1.77), and intracerebral haemorrhage (1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.44).
      Screen-detected diabetes was also associated with significant, though more
      modest, excess cardiovascular risks, with corresponding HRs of 1.66 (95% CI
      1.51-1.83), 1.62 (95% CI 1.40-1.86), 1.48 (95% CI 1.40-1.57), and 1.17 (95% CI
      1.01-1.36), respectively. Misclassification of screen-detected diabetes may have 
      caused these risk estimates to be underestimated, whilst lack of data on lipids
      may have resulted in residual confounding of diabetes-associated cardiovascular
      disease risks. Among individuals with diabetes, cardiovascular risk increased
      progressively with duration of diabetes and number of other presenting modifiable
      cardiovascular risk factors. Assuming a causal association, diabetes now accounts
      for ~0.5 million (489,676, 95% CI 335,777-681,202) cardiovascular deaths annually
      in China. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese adults, diabetes is associated with
      significantly increased risks of major cardiovascular diseases. The increasing
      prevalence and younger age of onset of diabetes foreshadow greater
      diabetes-attributable disease burden in China.

TI  - Age, Spatial, and Temporal Variations in Hospital Admissions with Malaria in
      Kilifi County, Kenya: A 25-Year Longitudinal Observational Study.
PG  - e1002047
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002047 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Encouraging progress has been seen with reductions in Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria transmission in some parts of Africa. Reduced transmission
      might lead to increasing susceptibility to malaria among older children due to
      lower acquired immunity, and this has implications for ongoing control
      strategies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study
      of children admitted to Kilifi County Hospital in Kenya and linked it to data on 
      residence and insecticide-treated net (ITN) use. This included data from 69,104
      children aged from 3 mo to 13 y admitted to Kilifi County Hospital between 1
      January 1990 and 31 December 2014. The variation in malaria slide positivity
      among admissions was examined in logistic regression models using the following
      predictors: location of the residence, calendar time, the child's age, ITN use,
      and the enhanced vegetation index (a proxy for soil moisture). The proportion of 
      malaria slide-positive admissions declined from 0.56 (95% confidence interval
      [CI] 0.54-0.58) in 1998 to 0.07 (95% CI 0.06-0.08) in 2009 but then increased
      again through to 0.24 (95% CI 0.22-0.25) in 2014. Older children accounted for
      most of the increase after 2009 (0.035 [95% CI 0.030-0.040] among young children 
      compared to 0.22 [95% CI 0.21-0.23] in older children). There was a nonlinear
      relationship between malaria risk and prevalence of ITN use within a 2 km radius 
      of an admitted child's residence such that the predicted malaria positive
      fraction varied from ~0.4 to <0.1 as the prevalence of ITN use varied from 20% to
      80%. In this observational analysis, we were unable to determine the cause of the
      decline in malaria between 1998 and 2009, which pre-dated the dramatic scale-up
      in ITN distribution and use. CONCLUSION: Following a period of reduced
      transmission, a cohort of older children emerged who have increased
      susceptibility to malaria. Further reductions in malaria transmission are needed 
      to mitigate the increasing burden among older children, and universal ITN
      coverage is a promising strategy to achieve this goal.

TI  - Agreements between Industry and Academia on Publication Rights: A Retrospective
      Study of Protocols and Publications of Randomized Clinical Trials.
PG  - e1002046
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about publication agreements between industry and
      academic investigators in trial protocols and the consistency of these agreements
      with corresponding statements in publications. We aimed to investigate (i) the
      existence and types of publication agreements in trial protocols, (ii) the
      completeness and consistency of the reporting of these agreements in subsequent
      publications, and (iii) the frequency of co-authorship by industry employees.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a retrospective cohort of randomized clinical
      trials (RCTs) based on archived protocols approved by six research ethics
      committees between 13 January 2000 and 25 November 2003. Only RCTs with industry 
      involvement were eligible. We investigated the documentation of publication
      agreements in RCT protocols and statements in corresponding journal publications.
      Of 647 eligible RCT protocols, 456 (70.5%) mentioned an agreement regarding
      publication of results. Of these 456, 393 (86.2%) documented an industry
      partner's right to disapprove or at least review proposed manuscripts; 39 (8.6%) 
      agreements were without constraints of publication. The remaining 24 (5.3%)
      protocols referred to separate agreement documents not accessible to us. Of those
      432 protocols with an accessible publication agreement, 268 (62.0%) trials were
      published. Most agreements documented in the protocol were not reported in the
      subsequent publication (197/268 [73.5%]). Of 71 agreements reported in
      publications, 52 (73.2%) were concordant with those documented in the protocol.
      In 14 of 37 (37.8%) publications in which statements suggested unrestricted
      publication rights, at least one co-author was an industry employee. In 25
      protocol-publication pairs, author statements in publications suggested no
      constraints, but 18 corresponding protocols documented restricting agreements.
      CONCLUSIONS: Publication agreements constraining academic authors' independence
      are common. Journal articles seldom report on publication agreements, and, if
      they do, statements can be discrepant with the trial protocol.

TI  - Obesity and Multiple Sclerosis: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
PG  - e1002053
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have reported an association between obesity,
      as measured by elevated body mass index (BMI), in early adulthood and risk of
      multiple sclerosis (MS). However, bias potentially introduced by confounding and 
      reverse causation may have influenced these findings. Therefore, we elected to
      perform Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to evaluate whether genetically
      increased BMI is associated with an increased risk of MS. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Employing a two-sample MR approach, we used summary statistics from the Genetic
      Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and the International
      MS Genetics Consortium (IMSGC), the largest genome-wide association studies for
      BMI and MS, respectively (GIANT: n = 322,105; IMSGC: n = 14,498 cases and 24,091 
      controls). Seventy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genome-wide
      significant (p < 5 x 10-8) for BMI in GIANT (n = 322,105) and were investigated
      for their association with MS risk in the IMSGC. The effect of each SNP on MS was
      weighted by its effect on BMI, and estimates were pooled to provide a summary
      measure for the effect of increased BMI upon risk of MS. Our results suggest that
      increased BMI influences MS susceptibility, where a 1 standard deviation increase
      in genetically determined BMI (kg/m2) increased odds of MS by 41% (odds ratio
      [OR]: 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.66, p = 2.7 x 10-5, I2 = 0%, 95% CI 0-29). Sensitivity 
      analyses, including MR-Egger regression, and the weighted median approach
      provided no evidence of pleiotropic effects. The main study limitations are that,
      while these sensitivity analyses reduce the possibility that pleiotropy
      influenced our results, residual pleiotropy is difficult to exclude entirely.
      CONCLUSION: Genetically elevated BMI is associated with risk of MS, providing
      evidence for a causal role for obesity in MS etiology. While obesity has been
      associated with many late-life outcomes, these findings suggest an important
      consequence of childhood and/or early adulthood obesity.

TI  - The Effect of Sitagliptin on Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis in Type 2 Diabetes:
      The PROLOGUE Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002051
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4
      (DPP-4) inhibitors provide cardiovascular protective effects. We performed a
      randomized study to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin added on to the
      conventional therapy compared with conventional therapy alone (diet, exercise,
      and/or drugs, except for incretin-related agents) on the intima-media thickness
      (IMT) of the carotid artery, a surrogate marker for the evaluation of
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a multicenter PROBE (prospective,
      randomized, open label, blinded endpoint) design. Individuals aged >/=30 y with
      T2DM (6.2% </= HbA1c < 9.4%) were randomly allocated to receive either
      sitagliptin (25 to 100 mg/d) or conventional therapy. Carotid ultrasound was
      performed at participating medical centers, and all parameters were measured in a
      core laboratory. Of the 463 enrolled participants with T2DM, 442 were included in
      the primary analysis (sitagliptin group, 222; conventional therapy group, 220).
      Estimated mean (+/- standard error) common carotid artery IMT at 24 mo of
      follow-up in the sitagliptin and conventional therapy groups was 0.827 +/- 0.007 
      mm and 0.837 +/- 0.007 mm, respectively, with a mean difference of -0.009 mm
      (97.2% CI -0.028 to 0.011, p = 0.309). HbA1c level at 24 mo was significantly
      lower with sitagliptin than with conventional therapy (6.56% +/- 0.05% versus
      6.72% +/- 0.05%, p = 0.008; group mean difference -0.159, 95% CI -0.278 to
      -0.041). Episodes of serious hypoglycemia were recorded only in the conventional 
      therapy group, and the rate of other adverse events was not different between the
      two groups. As it was not a placebo-controlled trial and carotid IMT was measured
      as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, there were some limitations of
      interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: In the PROLOGUE study, there was no evidence that
      treatment with sitagliptin had an additional effect on the progression of carotid
      IMT in participants with T2DM beyond that achieved with conventional treatment.

TI  - Exclusive Breastfeeding and Cognition, Executive Function, and Behavioural
      Disorders in Primary School-Aged Children in Rural South Africa: A Cohort
      Analysis.
PG  - e1002044
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is associated with early child health; 
      its longer-term benefits for child development remain inconclusive. We examine
      the associations between EBF, HIV exposure, and other maternal/child factors and 
      the cognitive and emotional-behavioural development of children aged 7-11 y.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Vertical Transmission Study (VTS) supported EBF in
      HIV-positive and HIV-negative women; between 2012 and 2014, HIV-negative VTS
      children (332 HIV exposed, 574 HIV unexposed) were assessed in terms of cognition
      (Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition [KABC-II]), executive
      function (Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment Second Edition [NEPSY-II]),
      and emotional-behavioural functioning (parent-reported Child Behaviour Checklist,
      [CBCL]). We developed population means by combining the VTS sample with 629
      same-aged HIV-negative children from the local demographic platform. For each
      outcome, we split the VTS sample into scores above or at/below each population
      mean and modelled each outcome using logistic regression analyses, overall and
      stratified by child sex. There was no demonstrated effect of EBF on overall
      cognitive functioning. EBF was associated with fewer conduct disorders overall
      (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.3-0.7], p </= 0.01), and there was weak
      evidence of better cognition in boys who had been exclusively breastfed for 2-5
      mo versus </=1 mo (Learning subscale aOR 2.07 [95% CI 1.0-4.3], p = 0.05). Other 
      factors associated with better child cognition were higher maternal cognitive
      ability (aOR 1.43 [95% CI 1.1-1.9], p = 0.02, Sequential; aOR 1.74 [95% CI
      1.3-2.4], p < 0.001, Planning subscales) and creche attendance (aOR 1.96 [95% CI 
      1.1-3.5], p = 0.02, Sequential subscale). Factors positively associated with
      executive function were home stimulation (aOR 1.36 [95% CI 1.0-1.8], p = 0.04,
      Auditory Attention; aOR 1.35 [95% CI 1.0-1.8], p = 0.05, Response Set) and creche
      (aOR 1.74 [95% CI 1.0-3.0], p = 0.05, Animal Sorting). Maternal mental health
      problems and parenting stress were associated with increased
      emotional-behavioural problems on the total CBCL (aOR 2.44 [95% CI 1.3-4.6], p = 
      0.01; aOR 7.04 [95% CI 4.2-11.9], p < 0.001, respectively). Maternal HIV status
      was not associated with any outcomes in the overall cohort. Limitations include
      the nonrandomised study design and lack of maternal mental health assessment at
      the child's birth. CONCLUSIONS: EBF was associated with fewer than average
      conduct disorders and weakly associated with improved cognitive development in
      boys. Efforts to improve stimulation at home, reduce maternal stress, and enable 
      creche attendance are likely to improve executive function and
      emotional-behavioural development of children.

TI  - Prediction of Bladder Outcomes after Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: A Longitudinal
      Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002041
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurogenic bladder dysfunction represents one of the most common and 
      devastating sequelae of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). As early prediction
      of bladder outcomes is essential to counsel patients and to plan neurourological 
      management, we aimed to develop and validate a model to predict urinary
      continence and complete bladder emptying 1 y after traumatic SCI. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Using multivariate logistic regression analysis from the data of 1,250 
      patients with traumatic SCI included in the European Multicenter Spinal Cord
      Injury study, we developed two prediction models of urinary continence and
      complete bladder emptying 1 y after traumatic SCI and performed an external
      validation in 111 patients. As predictors, we evaluated age, gender, and all
      variables of the International Standards for Neurological Classification of
      Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) and of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). 
      Urinary continence and complete bladder emptying 1 y after SCI were assessed
      through item 6 of SCIM. The full model relies on lower extremity motor score
      (LEMS), light-touch sensation in the S3 dermatome of ISNCSI, and SCIM subscale
      respiration and sphincter management: the area under the receiver operating
      characteristics curve (aROC) was 0.936 (95% confidence interval [CI]:
      0.922-0.951). The simplified model is based on LEMS only: the aROC was 0.912 (95%
      CI: 0.895-0.930). External validation of the full and simplified models confirmed
      the excellent predictive power: the aROCs were 0.965 (95% CI: 0.934-0.996) and
      0.972 (95% CI 0.943-0.999), respectively. This study is limited by the
      substantial number of patients with a missing 1-y outcome and by differences
      between derivation and validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides two
      simple and reliable models to predict urinary continence and complete bladder
      emptying 1 y after traumatic SCI. Early prediction of bladder function might
      optimize counselling and patient-tailored rehabilitative interventions and
      improve patient stratification in future clinical trials.

TI  - Geographical Inequalities and Social and Environmental Risk Factors for
      Under-Five Mortality in Ghana in 2000 and 2010: Bayesian Spatial Analysis of
      Census Data.
PG  - e1002038
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Under-five mortality is declining in Ghana and many other countries. 
      Very few studies have measured under-five mortality-and its social and
      environmental risk factors-at fine spatial resolutions, which is relevant for
      policy purposes. Our aim was to estimate under-five mortality and its social and 
      environmental risk factors at the district level in Ghana. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      We used 10% random samples of Ghana's 2000 and 2010 National Population and
      Housing Censuses. We applied indirect demographic methods and a Bayesian spatial 
      model to the information on total number of children ever born and children
      surviving to estimate under-five mortality (probability of dying by 5 y of age,
      5q0) for each of Ghana's 110 districts. We also used the census data to estimate 
      the distributions of households or persons in each district in terms of fuel used
      for cooking, sanitation facility, drinking water source, and parental education. 
      Median district 5q0 declined from 99 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 70
      in 2010. The decline ranged from <5% in some northern districts, where 5q0 had
      been higher in 2000, to >40% in southern districts, where it had been lower in
      2000, exacerbating existing inequalities. Primary education increased in men and 
      women, and more households had access to improved water and sanitation and
      cleaner cooking fuels. Higher use of liquefied petroleum gas for cooking was
      associated with lower 5q0 in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Under-five
      mortality has declined in all of Ghana's districts, but the cross-district
      inequality in mortality has increased. There is a need for additional data,
      including on healthcare, and additional environmental and socioeconomic
      measurements, to understand the reasons for the variations in mortality levels
      and trends.

      Somatic and Psychiatric Outcomes: A Large-Scale Cross-Consortium Mendelian
      Randomization Study.
PG  - e1001976
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001976 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with immune, cardiometabolic, 
      and psychiatric traits and diseases. Yet it is inconclusive whether these
      associations are causal. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed Mendelian
      randomization (MR) analyses using two genetic risk scores (GRSs) as instrumental 
      variables (IVs). The first GRS consisted of four single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) in the CRP gene (GRSCRP), and the second consisted of 18 SNPs that were
      significantly associated with CRP levels in the largest genome-wide association
      study (GWAS) to date (GRSGWAS). To optimize power, we used summary statistics
      from GWAS consortia and tested the association of these two GRSs with 32 complex 
      somatic and psychiatric outcomes, with up to 123,865 participants per outcome
      from populations of European ancestry. We performed heterogeneity tests to
      disentangle the pleiotropic effect of IVs. A Bonferroni-corrected significance
      level of less than 0.0016 was considered statistically significant. An observed
      p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered nominally significant evidence 
      for a potential causal association, yet to be confirmed. The strengths
      (F-statistics) of the IVs were 31.92-3,761.29 and 82.32-9,403.21 for GRSCRP and
      GRSGWAS, respectively. CRP GRSGWAS showed a statistically significant protective 
      relationship of a 10% genetically elevated CRP level with the risk of
      schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.79-0.94]; p < 0.001). We validated 
      this finding with individual-level genotype data from the schizophrenia GWAS (OR 
      0.96 [95% CI 0.94-0.98]; p < 1.72 x 10-6). Further, we found that a standardized 
      CRP polygenic risk score (CRPPRS) at p-value thresholds of 1 x 10-4, 0.001, 0.01,
      0.05, and 0.1 using individual-level data also showed a protective effect (OR <
      1.00) against schizophrenia; the first CRPPRS (built of SNPs with p < 1 x 10-4)
      showed a statistically significant (p < 2.45 x 10-4) protective effect with an OR
      of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99). The CRP GRSGWAS showed that a 10% increase in
      genetically determined CRP level was significantly associated with coronary
      artery disease (OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.84-0.94]; p < 2.4 x 10-5) and was nominally
      associated with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 0.85 [95% CI
      0.74-0.98]; p < 0.03), Crohn disease (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.70-0.94]; p < 0.005),
      psoriatic arthritis (OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.00-1.84]; p < 0.049), knee osteoarthritis 
      (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.01-1.36]; p < 0.04), and bipolar disorder (OR 1.21 [95% CI
      1.05-1.40]; p < 0.007) and with an increase of 0.72 (95% CI 0.11-1.34; p < 0.02) 
      mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, 0.45 (95% CI 0.06-0.84; p < 0.02) mm Hg in
      diastolic blood pressure, 0.01 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI 0.003-0.02; p < 0.005) in
      estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine, 0.01 g/dl (95% CI
      0.0004-0.02; p < 0.04) in serum albumin level, and 0.03 g/dl (95% CI 0.008-0.05; 
      p < 0.009) in serum protein level. However, after adjustment for heterogeneity,
      neither GRS showed a significant effect of CRP level (at p < 0.0016) on any of
      these outcomes, including coronary artery disease, nor on the other 20 complex
      outcomes studied. Our study has two potential limitations: the limited variance
      explained by our genetic instruments modeling CRP levels in blood and the
      unobserved bias introduced by the use of summary statistics in our MR analyses.
      CONCLUSIONS: Genetically elevated CRP levels showed a significant potentially
      protective causal relationship with risk of schizophrenia. We observed nominal
      evidence at an observed p < 0.05 using either GRSCRP or GRSGWAS-with persistence 
      after correction for heterogeneity-for a causal relationship of elevated CRP
      levels with psoriatic osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, knee osteoarthritis, 
      systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and bipolar
      disorder. These associations remain yet to be confirmed. We cannot verify any
      causal effect of CRP level on any of the other common somatic and
      neuropsychiatric outcomes investigated in the present study. This implies that
      interventions that lower CRP level are unlikely to result in decreased risk for
      the majority of common complex outcomes.

TI  - Novel Three-Day, Community-Based, Nonpharmacological Group Intervention for
      Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain (COPERS): A Randomised Clinical Trial.
PG  - e1002040
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is the leading cause of disability
      worldwide. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for chronic pain is
      often limited, and there is growing concern about the adverse effects of these
      treatments, including opioid dependence. Nonpharmacological approaches to chronic
      pain may be an attractive alternative or adjunctive treatment. We describe the
      effectiveness of a novel, theoretically based group pain management support
      intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted
      a multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) trial across 27 general practices and community
      musculoskeletal services in the UK. We recruited 703 adults with musculoskeletal 
      pain of at least 3 mo duration between August 1, 2011, and July 31, 2012, and
      randomised participants 1.33:1 to intervention (403) or control (300).
      Intervention participants were offered a participative group intervention
      (COPERS) delivered over three alternate days with a follow-up session at 2 wk.
      The intervention introduced cognitive behavioural approaches and was designed to 
      promote self-efficacy to manage chronic pain. Controls received usual care and a 
      relaxation CD. The primary outcome was pain-related disability at 12 mo (Chronic 
      Pain Grade [CPG] disability subscale); secondary outcomes included the CPG
      disability subscale at 6 mo and the following measured at 6 and 12 mo: anxiety
      and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), pain acceptance
      (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire), social integration (Health Education
      Impact Questionnaire social integration and support subscale), pain-related
      self-efficacy (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), pain intensity (CPG pain
      intensity subscale), the census global health question (2011 census for England
      and Wales), health utility (EQ-5D-3L), and health care resource use. Analyses
      followed the intention-to-treat principle, accounted for clustering by course in 
      the intervention arm, and used multiple imputation for missing or incomplete
      primary outcome data. The mean age of participants was 59.9 y, with 81% white,
      67% female, 23% employed, 85% with pain for at least 3 y, and 23% on strong
      opioids. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were common (baseline mean HADS
      scores 7.4 [standard deviation 4.1] and 9.2 [4.6], respectively). Overall, 282
      (70%) intervention participants met the predefined intervention adherence
      criterion. Primary outcome data were obtained from 88% of participants. There was
      no significant difference between groups in pain-related disability at 6 or 12 mo
      (12 mo: difference -1.0, intervention versus control, 95% CI -4.9 to 3.0), pain
      intensity, or the census global health question. Anxiety, depression,
      pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, and social integration were better
      in the intervention group at 6 mo; at 12 mo, these differences remained
      statistically significant only for depression (-0.7, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.2) and
      social integration (0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.2). Intervention participants received
      more analgesics than the controls across the 12 mo. The total cost of the course 
      per person was pound145 (US$214). The cost-utility analysis showed there to be a 
      small benefit in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.0325, 95% CI
      -0.0074 to 0.0724), and on the cost side the intervention was a little more
      expensive than usual care (i.e., pound188 [US$277], 95% CI - pound125 [-US$184]
      to pound501 [US$738]), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of
      pound5,786 (US$8,521) per QALY. Limitations include the fact that the
      intervention was relatively brief and did not include any physical activity
      components. CONCLUSIONS: While the COPERS intervention was brief, safe, and
      inexpensive, with a low attrition rate, it was not effective for reducing
      pain-related disability over 12 mo (primary outcome). For secondary outcomes, we 
      found sustained benefits on depression and social integration at 6 and 12 mo, but
      there was no effect on anxiety, pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, pain
      intensity, or the census global health question at 12 mo. There was some evidence
      that the intervention may be cost-effective based on a modest difference in QALYs
      between groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry 24426731.

TI  - Plant-Based Dietary Patterns and Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in US Men and
      Women: Results from Three Prospective Cohort Studies.
PG  - e1002039
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant-based diets have been recommended to reduce the risk of type 2 
      diabetes (T2D). However, not all plant foods are necessarily beneficial. We
      examined the association of an overall plant-based diet and hypothesized
      healthful and unhealthful versions of a plant-based diet with T2D incidence in
      three prospective cohort studies in the US. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included
      69,949 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2012), 90,239 women from the
      Nurses' Health Study 2 (1991-2011), and 40,539 men from the Health Professionals 
      Follow-Up Study (1986-2010), free of chronic diseases at baseline. Dietary data
      were collected every 2-4 y using a semi-quantitative food frequency
      questionnaire. Using these data, we created an overall plant-based diet index
      (PDI), where plant foods received positive scores, while animal foods (animal
      fats, dairy, eggs, fish/seafood, poultry/red meat, miscellaneous animal-based
      foods) received reverse scores. We also created a healthful plant-based diet
      index (hPDI), where healthy plant foods (whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, 
      legumes, vegetable oils, tea/coffee) received positive scores, while less healthy
      plant foods (fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes,
      sweets/desserts) and animal foods received reverse scores. Lastly, we created an 
      unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) by assigning positive scores to less
      healthy plant foods and reverse scores to healthy plant foods and animal foods.
      We documented 16,162 incident T2D cases during 4,102,369 person-years of
      follow-up. In pooled multivariable-adjusted analysis, both PDI and hPDI were
      inversely associated with T2D (PDI: hazard ratio [HR] for extreme deciles 0.51,
      95% CI 0.47-0.55, p trend < 0.001; hPDI: HR for extreme deciles 0.55, 95% CI
      0.51-0.59, p trend < 0.001). The association of T2D with PDI was considerably
      attenuated when we additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) categories (HR
      0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87, p trend < 0.001), while that with hPDI remained largely
      unchanged (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.61-0.72, p trend < 0.001). uPDI was positively
      associated with T2D even after BMI adjustment (HR for extreme deciles 1.16, 95%
      CI 1.08-1.25, p trend < 0.001). Limitations of the study include self-reported
      diet assessment, with the possibility of measurement error, and the potential for
      residual or unmeasured confounding given the observational nature of the study
      design. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that plant-based diets, especially when
      rich in high-quality plant foods, are associated with substantially lower risk of
      developing T2D. This supports current recommendations to shift to diets rich in
      healthy plant foods, with lower intake of less healthy plant and animal foods.

TI  - Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors and Risk of Malignant Melanoma: Matched
      Cohort Study Using Primary Care Data from the UK Clinical Practice Research
      Datalink.
PG  - e1002037
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laboratory evidence suggests that reduced phosphodiesterase type 5
      (PDE5) expression increases the invasiveness of melanoma cells; hence,
      pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 could affect melanoma risk. Two major
      epidemiological studies have investigated this and come to differing conclusions.
      We therefore aimed to investigate whether PDE5 inhibitor use is associated with
      an increased risk of malignant melanoma, and whether any increase in risk is
      likely to represent a causal relationship. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a
      matched cohort study using primary care data from the UK Clinical Practice
      Research Datalink. All men initiating a PDE5 inhibitor and with no prior cancer
      diagnosis were identified and matched on age, diabetes status, and general
      practice to up to four unexposed controls. Ever use of a PDE5 inhibitor and
      time-updated cumulative number of PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions were investigated 
      as exposures, and the primary outcome was malignant melanoma. Basal cell
      carcinoma, solar keratosis, and colorectal cancer were investigated as negative
      control outcomes to exclude bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox
      models stratified by matched set and adjusted for potential confounders. 145,104 
      men with >/=1 PDE5 inhibitor prescription, and 560,933 unexposed matched controls
      were included. In total, 1,315 incident malignant melanoma diagnoses were
      observed during 3.44 million person-years of follow-up (mean 4.9 y per person).
      After adjusting for potential confounders, there was weak evidence of a small
      positive association between PDE5 inhibitor use and melanoma risk (HR = 1.14, 95%
      CI 1.01-1.29, p = 0.04). A similar increase in risk was seen for the two negative
      control outcomes related to sun exposure (HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.11-1.19, p < 0.001,
      for basal cell carcinoma; HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.17-1.25, p < 0.001, for solar
      keratosis), but there was no increased risk for colorectal cancer (HR = 0.91, 95%
      CI 0.85-0.98, p = 0.01). There was no evidence that risk increased with number of
      prescriptions received (p-trend = 0.83). In a post hoc analysis, there was strong
      evidence that solar keratosis was associated with future PDE5 inhibitor use (odds
      ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.23-1.34, p < 0.001), suggesting that men with higher sun
      exposure were more likely to become PDE5 inhibitor users. However, a limitation
      of our study was that we did not have individual-level data on sun exposure, so
      we could not directly control for this in the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results were not consistent with PDE5 inhibitors being causally associated with
      melanoma risk, and strongly suggest that observed risk increases are driven by
      greater sun exposure among patients exposed to a PDE5 inhibitor.

TI  - Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-Nutritional 
      Epidemiology (STROBE-nut): An Extension of the STROBE Statement.
PG  - e1002036
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about the quality of reporting in
      nutritional epidemiology. Research reporting guidelines such as the Strengthening
      the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement can
      improve quality of reporting in observational studies. Herein, we propose
      recommendations for reporting nutritional epidemiology and dietary assessment
      research by extending the STROBE statement into Strengthening the Reporting of
      Observational Studies in Epidemiology-Nutritional Epidemiology (STROBE-nut).
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recommendations for the reporting of nutritional
      epidemiology and dietary assessment research were developed following a
      systematic and consultative process, coordinated by a multidisciplinary group of 
      21 experts. Consensus on reporting guidelines was reached through a three-round
      Delphi consultation process with 53 external experts. In total, 24
      recommendations for nutritional epidemiology were added to the STROBE checklist. 
      CONCLUSION: When used appropriately, reporting guidelines for nutritional
      epidemiology can contribute to improve reporting of observational studies with a 
      focus on diet and health.

TI  - Impact Evaluation of a System-Wide Chronic Disease Management Program on Health
      Service Utilisation: A Propensity-Matched Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002035
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The New South Wales Health (NSW Health) Chronic Disease Management
      Program (CDMP) delivers interventions to adults at risk of hospitalisation for
      five target chronic conditions that respond well to ambulatory care: diabetes,
      hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure,
      and coronary artery disease. The intervention consists of two main components:
      (1) care coordination across sectors (acute, ambulatory, and community care from 
      both public and private sectors) and clinical specialties, facilitated by program
      care coordinators, and (2) health coaching including management of lifestyle risk
      factors and medications and self-management. These components were broadly
      prescribed by the head office of NSW Health, which funded the program, and were
      implemented by regional health services (local health districts) in ways that
      best suited their own history, environment, workforce, and patient need. We used 
      a propensity-matched cohort study to evaluate health service utilisation after
      enrolment in the CDMP. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The evaluation cohort included
      41,303 CDMP participants enrolled between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013 who
      experienced at least one hospital admission or emergency department (ED)
      presentation for a target condition in the 12 mo preceding enrolment. Potential
      controls were selected from patients not enrolled in the CDMP but experiencing at
      least one hospital admission or ED presentation over the same period. Each CDMP
      patient in the evaluation cohort was matched to one control using 1:1 propensity 
      score matching. The primary outcome was avoidable hospitalisations. Secondary
      outcomes included avoidable readmissions, avoidable bed days, unplanned
      hospitalisations, unplanned readmissions, unplanned bed days, ED presentations,
      and all-cause death. The primary analysis consisted of 30,057 CDMP participants
      and 30,057 matched controls with a median follow-up of 15 mo. Of those, 25,638
      (85.3%) and 25,597 (85.2%) were alive by the end of follow-up in the CDMP and
      control groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics (including history of
      health service utilisation) were well balanced between the matched groups. In
      both groups, utilisation peaked just before the time of enrolment/matching,
      declined sharply immediately following enrolment, and then continued to decrease 
      more gradually; however, after enrolment, avoidable and unplanned health service 
      utilisation remained higher for CDMP participants compared to controls. The
      adjusted yearly rate of avoidable hospital admissions was 0.57 (95% CI 0.52 to
      0.62) in the CDMP group versus 0.33 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.37) in the control group
      (adjusted rate ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.62 to 1.79, p < 0.001). Significant increases
      in service utilisation were also observed for unplanned hospitalisations (1.42,
      95% CI 1.37 to 1.47, p < 0.001) and ED presentations (1.37, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.42, 
      p < 0.001) as well as avoidable (2.00, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.22, p < 0.001) and
      unplanned (1.51, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.62, p < 0.001) readmissions and avoidable
      (1.70, 95% CI 1.59 to 1.82, p < 0.001) and unplanned (1.43, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.49, 
      p < 0.001) bed days. No evidence of a difference was seen for all-cause death
      (adjusted risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.01, p = 0.10) or non-avoidable
      hospitalisations (all hospitalisations minus avoidable hospitalisations; adjusted
      rate ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.10, p = 0.26). Despite the robustness of these 
      results to sensitivity analyses, in the absence of a randomised control group,
      one cannot exclude the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding that was
      not controlled for by the matching process and multivariable analyses.
      CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the CDMP was associated with an increase in
      avoidable hospital admissions compared to matched controls but no difference in
      the rate of other types of hospitalisation or death. A possible explanation is
      that the program identified conditions that required participants to be
      hospitalised. Service utilisation decreased sharply following its peak for both
      groups. This finding reflects the natural tendency for high-risk patients to show
      reductions in use following intense phases of service utilisation and highlights 
      that, despite the additional complexity, a carefully selected control group is
      essential when assessing the effectiveness of interventions on hospital use.

TI  - Early Childhood Developmental Status in Low- and Middle-Income Countries:
      National, Regional, and Global Prevalence Estimates Using Predictive Modeling.
PG  - e1002034
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of cognitive and socioemotional skills early in life 
      influences later health and well-being. Existing estimates of unmet developmental
      potential in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are based on either
      measures of physical growth or proxy measures such as poverty. In this paper we
      aim to directly estimate the number of children in LMICs who would be reported by
      their caregivers to show low cognitive and/or socioemotional development. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: The present paper uses Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI)
      data collected between 2005 and 2015 from 99,222 3- and 4-y-old children living
      in 35 LMICs as part of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and
      Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programs. First, we estimate the prevalence 
      of low cognitive and/or socioemotional ECDI scores within our MICS/DHS sample.
      Next, we test a series of ordinary least squares regression models predicting low
      ECDI scores across our MICS/DHS sample countries based on country-level data from
      the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Nutrition Impact Model Study. We use
      cross-validation to select the model with the best predictive validity. We then
      apply this model to all LMICs to generate country-level estimates of the
      prevalence of low ECDI scores globally, as well as confidence intervals around
      these estimates. In the pooled MICS and DHS sample, 14.6% of children had low
      ECDI scores in the cognitive domain, 26.2% had low socioemotional scores, and
      36.8% performed poorly in either or both domains. Country-level prevalence of low
      cognitive and/or socioemotional scores on the ECDI was best represented by a
      model using the HDI as a predictor. Applying this model to all LMICs, we estimate
      that 80.8 million children ages 3 and 4 y (95% CI 48.1 million, 113.6 million) in
      LMICs experienced low cognitive and/or socioemotional development in 2010, with
      the largest number of affected children in sub-Saharan Africa (29.4.1 million;
      43.8% of children ages 3 and 4 y), followed by South Asia (27.7 million; 37.7%)
      and the East Asia and Pacific region (15.1 million; 25.9%). Positive associations
      were found between low development scores and stunting, poverty, male sex, rural 
      residence, and lack of cognitive stimulation. Additional research using more
      detailed developmental assessments across a larger number of LMICs is needed to
      address the limitations of the present study. CONCLUSIONS: The number of children
      globally failing to reach their developmental potential remains large. Additional
      research is needed to identify the specific causes of poor developmental outcomes
      in diverse settings, as well as potential context-specific interventions that
      might promote children's early cognitive and socioemotional well-being.

TI  - Inter-pregnancy Weight Change and Risks of Severe Birth-Asphyxia-Related Outcomes
      in Singleton Infants Born at Term: A Nationwide Swedish Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002033
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal overweight and obesity are associated with increased risks
      of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes, but the mechanisms are unclear. If a change
      of exposure (i.e., maternal body mass index [BMI]) over time influences risks,
      this would be consistent with a causal relationship between maternal BMI and
      offspring risks. Our objective was to investigate associations between changes in
      maternal BMI between consecutive pregnancies and risks of birth-asphyxia-related 
      outcomes in the second offspring born at term. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study
      was a prospective population-based cohort study that included 526,435 second-born
      term (>/=37 wk) infants of mothers with two consecutive live singleton term
      births in Sweden between January 1992 and December 2012. We estimated
      associations between the difference in maternal BMI between the first and second 
      pregnancy and risks of low Apgar score (0-6) at 5 min, neonatal seizures, and
      meconium aspiration in the second-born offspring. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted
      for BMI at first pregnancy, maternal height, maternal age at second delivery,
      smoking, education, mother s country of birth, inter-pregnancy interval, and year
      of second delivery. Analyses were also stratified by BMI (<25 versus >/=25 kg/m2)
      in the first pregnancy. Risks of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures, and meconium
      aspiration increased with inter-pregnancy weight gain. Compared with offspring of
      mothers with stable weight (BMI change of -1 to <1 kg/m2), the adjusted OR for a 
      low Apgar score in the offspring of mothers with a BMI change of 4 kg/m2 or more 
      was 1.33 (95% CI 1.12-1.58). The corresponding risks for neonatal seizures and
      meconium aspiration were 1.42 (95% CI 1.00-2.02) and 1.78 (95% CI 1.19-2.68),
      respectively. The increased risk of neonatal seizures related to weight gain
      appeared to be restricted to mothers with BMI < 25 kg/m2 in the first pregnancy. 
      A study limitation was the lack of data on the effects of obstetric interventions
      and neonatal resuscitation efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of birth-asphyxia-related 
      outcomes increased with maternal weight gain between pregnancies. Preventing
      weight gain before and in between pregnancies may improve neonatal health.

TI  - Financial Relationships between Organizations That Produce Clinical Practice
      Guidelines and the Biomedical Industry: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e1002029
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Financial relationships between organizations that produce clinical
      practice guidelines and biomedical companies are vulnerable to conflicts of
      interest. We sought to determine whether organizations that produce clinical
      practice guidelines have financial relationships with biomedical companies and
      whether there are associations between organizations' conflict of interest
      policies and recommendations and disclosures provided in guidelines. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey and review of websites of 95
      national/international medical organizations that produced 290 clinical practice 
      guidelines published on the National Guideline Clearinghouse website from January
      1 to December 31, 2012. Survey responses were available for 68% (65/95) of
      organizations (167/290 guidelines, 58%), and websites were reviewed for 100%
      (95/95) of organizations (290/290 guidelines, 100%). In all, 63% (60/95) of
      organizations producing clinical practice guidelines reported receiving funds
      from a biomedical company; 80% (76/95) of organizations reported having a policy 
      for managing conflicts of interest. Disclosure statements (disclosing presence or
      absence of financial relationships with biomedical companies) were available in
      65% (188/290) of clinical practice guidelines for direct funding sources to
      produce the guideline, 51% (147/290) for financial relationships of the guideline
      committee members, and 1% (4/290) for financial relationships of the
      organizations producing the guidelines. Among all guidelines, 6% (18/290)
      disclosed direct funding by biomedical companies, 40% (117/290) disclosed
      financial relationships between committee members and biomedical companies (38%
      of guideline committee members, 773/2,043), and 1% (4/290) disclosed financial
      relationships between the organizations producing the guidelines and biomedical
      companies. In the survey responses, 60 organizations reported the procedures that
      they included in their conflict of interest policies (158 guidelines): guidelines
      produced by organizations reporting more comprehensive conflict of interest
      policies (per additional procedure, range 5-17) included fewer positive (rate
      ratio [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.95) and more negative (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.60) 
      recommendations regarding patented biomedical products. The clinical practice
      guidelines produced by organizations reporting more comprehensive conflict of
      interest policies were also more likely to include disclosure statements for
      direct funding sources (odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.56) and financial
      relationships of guideline committee members (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.79), but not
      financial relationships of the organizations (0 disclosures). Limitations of the 
      study include the use of the National Guideline Clearinghouse as the single
      source of clinical practice guidelines and the self-report of survey responses
      and organizations' website postings. CONCLUSIONS: Financial relationships between
      organizations that produce clinical practice guidelines and biomedical companies 
      are common and infrequently disclosed in guidelines. Our study highlights the
      need for an effective policy to manage organizational conflicts of interest and
      disclosure of financial relationships.

TI  - Prices, Costs, and Affordability of New Medicines for Hepatitis C in 30
      Countries: An Economic Analysis.
PG  - e1002032
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002032 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: New hepatitis C virus (HCV) medicines have markedly improved
      treatment efficacy and regimen tolerability. However, their high prices have
      limited access, prompting wide debate about fair and affordable prices. This
      study systematically compared the price and affordability of sofosbuvir and
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir across 30 countries to assess affordability to health
      systems and patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Published 2015 ex-factory prices for 
      a 12-wk course of treatment were provided by the Pharma Price Information (PPI)
      service of the Austrian public health institute Gesundheit Osterreich GmbH or
      were obtained from national government or drug reimbursement authorities and
      recent press releases, where necessary. Prices in Organisation for Economic
      Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries and select low- and
      middle-income countries were converted to US dollars using period average
      exchange rates and were adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). We analysed
      prices compared to national economic performance and estimated market size and
      the cost of these drugs in terms of countries' annual total pharmaceutical
      expenditure (TPE) and in terms of the duration of time an individual would need
      to work to pay for treatment out of pocket. Patient affordability was calculated 
      using 2014 OECD average annual wages, supplemented with International Labour
      Organization median wage data where necessary. All data were compiled between 17 
      July 2015 and 25 January 2016. For the base case analysis, we assumed a 23%
      rebate/discount on the published price in all countries, except for countries
      with special pricing arrangements or generic licensing agreements. The median
      nominal ex-factory price of a 12-wk course of sofosbuvir across 26 OECD countries
      was US$42,017, ranging from US$37,729 in Japan to US$64,680 in the US. Central
      and Eastern European countries had higher PPP-adjusted prices than other
      countries: prices of sofosbuvir in Poland and Turkey (PPP$101,063 and PPP$70,331)
      and of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in Poland (PPP$118,754) were at least 1.09 and 1.63 
      times higher, respectively than in the US (PPP$64,680 and PPP$72,765). Based on
      PPP-adjusted TPE and without the cost of ribavirin and other treatment costs,
      treating the entire HCV viraemic population with these regimens at the
      PPP-adjusted prices with a 23% price reduction would amount to at least one-tenth
      of current TPE across the countries included in this study, ranging from 10.5% of
      TPE in the Netherlands to 190.5% of TPE in Poland. In 12 countries, the price of 
      a course of sofosbuvir without other costs was equivalent to 1 y or more of the
      average annual wage of individuals, ranging from 0.21 y in Egypt to 5.28 y in
      Turkey. This analysis relies on the accuracy of price information and infection
      prevalence estimates. It does not include the costs of diagnostic testing,
      supplementary treatments, treatment for patients with reinfection or cirrhosis,
      or associated health service costs. CONCLUSIONS: Current prices of these
      medicines are variable and unaffordable globally. These prices threaten the
      sustainability of health systems in many countries and prevent large-scale
      provision of treatment. Stakeholders should implement a fairer pricing framework 
      to deliver lower prices that take account of affordability. Without lower prices,
      countries are unlikely to be able to increase investment to minimise the burden
      of hepatitis C.

TI  - Epidemiology and Reporting Characteristics of Systematic Reviews of Biomedical
      Research: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e1002028
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews (SRs) can help decision makers interpret the
      deluge of published biomedical literature. However, a SR may be of limited use if
      the methods used to conduct the SR are flawed, and reporting of the SR is
      incomplete. To our knowledge, since 2004 there has been no cross-sectional study 
      of the prevalence, focus, and completeness of reporting of SRs across different
      specialties. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the
      epidemiological and reporting characteristics of a more recent cross-section of
      SRs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE to identify potentially eligible
      SRs indexed during the month of February 2014. Citations were screened using
      prespecified eligibility criteria. Epidemiological and reporting characteristics 
      of a random sample of 300 SRs were extracted by one reviewer, with a 10% sample
      extracted in duplicate. We compared characteristics of Cochrane versus
      non-Cochrane reviews, and the 2014 sample of SRs versus a 2004 sample of SRs. We 
      identified 682 SRs, suggesting that more than 8,000 SRs are being indexed in
      MEDLINE annually, corresponding to a 3-fold increase over the last decade. The
      majority of SRs addressed a therapeutic question and were conducted by authors
      based in China, the UK, or the US; they included a median of 15 studies involving
      2,072 participants. Meta-analysis was performed in 63% of SRs, mostly using
      standard pairwise methods. Study risk of bias/quality assessment was performed in
      70% of SRs but was rarely incorporated into the analysis (16%). Few SRs (7%)
      searched sources of unpublished data, and the risk of publication bias was
      considered in less than half of SRs. Reporting quality was highly variable; at
      least a third of SRs did not report use of a SR protocol, eligibility criteria
      relating to publication status, years of coverage of the search, a full Boolean
      search logic for at least one database, methods for data extraction, methods for 
      study risk of bias assessment, a primary outcome, an abstract conclusion that
      incorporated study limitations, or the funding source of the SR. Cochrane SRs,
      which accounted for 15% of the sample, had more complete reporting than all other
      types of SRs. Reporting has generally improved since 2004, but remains suboptimal
      for many characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of SRs are being
      published, and many are poorly conducted and reported. Strategies are needed to
      help reduce this avoidable waste in research.

TI  - Common Infections in Patients Prescribed Systemic Glucocorticoids in Primary
      Care: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - e1002024
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relative risk of common bacterial, viral,
      fungal, and parasitic infections in the general population of individuals exposed
      to systemic glucocorticoids, or about the impact of glucocorticoid exposure
      duration and predisposing factors on this risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The hazard 
      ratios of various common infections were assessed in 275,072 adults prescribed
      glucocorticoids orally for >/=15 d (women: 57.8%, median age: 63 [interquartile
      range 48-73] y) in comparison to those not prescribed glucocorticoids. For each
      infection, incidence rate ratios were calculated for five durations of exposure
      (ranging from 15-30 d to >12 mo), and risk factors were assessed. Data were
      extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database. When 
      compared to those with the same underlying disease but not exposed to
      glucocorticoids, the adjusted hazard ratios for infections with significantly
      higher risk in the glucocorticoid-exposed population ranged from 2.01 (95% CI
      1.83-2.19; p < 0.001) for cutaneous cellulitis to 5.84 (95% CI 5.61-6.08; p <
      0.001) for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). There was no difference in
      the risk of scabies, dermatophytosis and varicella. The relative increase in risk
      was stable over the durations of exposure, except for LRTI and local candidiasis,
      for which it was much higher during the first weeks of exposure. The risks of
      infection increased with age and were higher in those with diabetes, in those
      prescribed higher glucocorticoid doses, and in those with lower plasma albumin
      level. Most associations were also dependent on the underlying disease. A
      sensitivity analysis conducted on all individuals except those with asthma or
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease produced similar results. Another
      sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of potential unmeasured confounders
      such as disease severity or concomitant prescription of chemotherapy suggested
      that it was unlikely that adjusting for these potential confounders would have
      radically changed the findings. Limitations of our study include the use of
      electronic medical records, which could have resulted in some degree of
      misclassification of the infectious outcomes; a possible reporting bias, as
      general practitioners could be more prone to record an infection in those exposed
      to glucocorticoids; and a low number of events for some outcomes such as scabies 
      or varicella, which may have led to limited statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: The
      relative risk of LRTI and local candidiasis is very high during the first weeks
      of glucocorticoid exposure. Further studies are needed to assess whether low
      albumin level is a risk factor for infection by itself (e.g., by being associated
      with a higher free glucocorticoid fraction) or whether it reflects other
      underlying causes of general debilitation.

TI  - Estimating the Risk of Chronic Pain: Development and Validation of a Prognostic
      Model (PICKUP) for Patients with Acute Low Back Pain.
PG  - e1002019
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a major health problem. Globally it is
      responsible for the most years lived with disability. The most problematic type
      of LBP is chronic LBP (pain lasting longer than 3 mo); it has a poor prognosis
      and is costly, and interventions are only moderately effective. Targeting
      interventions according to risk profile is a promising approach to prevent the
      onset of chronic LBP. Developing accurate prognostic models is the first step. No
      validated prognostic models are available to accurately predict the onset of
      chronic LBP. The primary aim of this study was to develop and validate a
      prognostic model to estimate the risk of chronic LBP. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      used the PROGRESS framework to specify a priori methods, which we published in a 
      study protocol. Data from 2,758 patients with acute LBP attending primary care in
      Australia between 5 November 2003 and 15 July 2005 (development sample, n =
      1,230) and between 10 November 2009 and 5 February 2013 (external validation
      sample, n = 1,528) were used to develop and externally validate the model. The
      primary outcome was chronic LBP (ongoing pain at 3 mo). In all, 30% of the
      development sample and 19% of the external validation sample developed chronic
      LBP. In the external validation sample, the primary model (PICKUP) discriminated 
      between those who did and did not develop chronic LBP with acceptable performance
      (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.66 [95% CI 0.63 to
      0.69]). Although model calibration was also acceptable in the external validation
      sample (intercept = -0.55, slope = 0.89), some miscalibration was observed for
      high-risk groups. The decision curve analysis estimated that, if decisions to
      recommend further intervention were based on risk scores, screening could lead to
      a net reduction of 40 unnecessary interventions for every 100 patients presenting
      to primary care compared to a "treat all" approach. Limitations of the method
      include the model being restricted to using prognostic factors measured in
      existing studies and using stepwise methods to specify the model. Limitations of 
      the model include modest discrimination performance. The model also requires
      recalibration for local settings. CONCLUSIONS: Based on its performance in these 
      cohorts, this five-item prognostic model for patients with acute LBP may be a
      useful tool for estimating risk of chronic LBP. Further validation is required to
      determine whether screening with this model leads to a net reduction in
      unnecessary interventions provided to low-risk patients.

TI  - Prioritizing Surgical Care on National Health Agendas: A Qualitative Case Study
      of Papua New Guinea, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
PG  - e1002023
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the social and political factors that influence
      priority setting for different health services in low- and middle-income
      countries (LMICs), yet these factors are integral to understanding how national
      health agendas are established. We investigated factors that facilitate or
      prevent surgical care from being prioritized in LMICs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      undertook country case studies in Papua New Guinea, Uganda, and Sierra Leone,
      using a qualitative process-tracing method. We conducted 74 semi-structured
      interviews with stakeholders involved in health agenda setting and surgical care 
      in these countries. Interviews were triangulated with published academic
      literature, country reports, national health plans, and policies. Data were
      analyzed using a conceptual framework based on four components (actor power,
      ideas, political contexts, issue characteristics) to assess national factors
      influencing priority for surgery. Political priority for surgical care in the
      three countries varies. Priority was highest in Papua New Guinea, where surgical 
      care is firmly embedded within national health plans and receives significant
      domestic and international resources, and much lower in Uganda and Sierra Leone. 
      Factors influencing whether surgical care was prioritized were the degree of
      sustained and effective domestic advocacy by the local surgical community, the
      national political and economic environment in which health policy setting
      occurs, and the influence of international actors, particularly donors, on
      national agenda setting. The results from Papua New Guinea show that a strong
      surgical community can generate priority from the ground up, even where other
      factors are unfavorable. CONCLUSIONS: National health agenda setting is a complex
      social and political process. To embed surgical care within national health
      policy, sustained advocacy efforts, effective framing of the problem and
      solutions, and country-specific data are required. Political, technical, and
      financial support from regional and international partners is also important.

TI  - Smoking Behavior and Healthcare Expenditure in the United States, 1992-2009:
      Panel Data Estimates.
PG  - e1002020
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reductions in smoking in Arizona and California have been shown to be
      associated with reduced per capita healthcare expenditures in these states
      compared to control populations in the rest of the US. This paper extends that
      analysis to all states and estimates changes in healthcare expenditure
      attributable to changes in aggregate measures of smoking behavior in all states. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: State per capita healthcare expenditure is modeled as a
      function of current smoking prevalence, mean cigarette consumption per smoker,
      other demographic and economic factors, and cross-sectional time trends using a
      fixed effects panel data regression on annual time series data for each the 50
      states and the District of Columbia for the years 1992 through 2009. We found
      that 1% relative reductions in current smoking prevalence and mean packs smoked
      per current smoker are associated with 0.118% (standard error [SE] 0.0259%, p <
      0.001) and 0.108% (SE 0.0253%, p < 0.001) reductions in per capita healthcare
      expenditure (elasticities). The results of this study are subject to the
      limitations of analysis of aggregate observational data, particularly that a
      study of this nature that uses aggregate data and a relatively small sample size 
      cannot, by itself, establish a causal connection between smoking behavior and
      healthcare costs. Historical regional variations in smoking behavior (including
      those due to the effects of state tobacco control programs, smoking restrictions,
      and differences in taxation) are associated with substantial differences in per
      capita healthcare expenditures across the United States. Those regions (and the
      states in them) that have lower smoking have substantially lower medical costs.
      Likewise, those that have higher smoking have higher medical costs. Sensitivity
      analysis confirmed that these results are robust. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in
      healthcare expenditure appear quickly after changes in smoking behavior. A 10%
      relative drop in smoking in every state is predicted to be followed by an
      expected $63 billion reduction (in 2012 US dollars) in healthcare expenditure the
      next year. State and national policies that reduce smoking should be part of
      short term healthcare cost containment.

TI  - All-Cause Mortality of Low Birthweight Infants in Infancy, Childhood, and
      Adolescence: Population Study of England and Wales.
PG  - e1002018
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low birthweight (LBW) is associated with increased mortality in
      infancy, but its association with mortality in later childhood and adolescence is
      less clear. We investigated the association between birthweight and all-cause
      mortality and identified major causes of mortality for different birthweight
      groups. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population study of all live births 
      occurring in England and Wales between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2011.
      Following exclusions, the 12,355,251 live births were classified by birthweight: 
      500-1,499 g (very LBW [VLBW], n = 139,608), 1,500-2,499 g (LBW, n = 759,283),
      2,500-3,499 g (n = 6,511,411), and >/=3,500 g (n = 4,944,949). The association of
      birthweight group with mortality in infancy (<1 y of age) and
      childhood/adolescence (1-18 y of age) was quantified, with and without
      covariates, through hazard ratios using Cox regression. International
      Classification of Diseases codes identified causes of death. In all, 74,890
      (0.61%) individuals died between birth and 18 y of age, with 23% of deaths
      occurring after infancy. Adjusted hazard ratios for infant deaths were 145 (95%
      CI 141, 149) and 9.8 (95% CI 9.5, 10.1) for the VLBW and LBW groups,
      respectively, compared to the >/=3,500 g group. The respective hazard ratios for 
      death occurring at age 1-18 y were 6.6 (95% CI 6.1, 7.1) and 2.9 (95% CI 2.8,
      3.1). Male gender, the youngest and oldest maternal age bands, multiple births,
      and deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation score) also contributed to
      increased deaths in the VLBW and LBW groups in both age ranges. In infancy,
      perinatal factors, particularly respiratory issues and infections, explained 84% 
      and 31% of deaths in the VLBW and LBW groups, respectively; congenital
      malformations explained 36% and 23% in the LBW group and >/=2,500 g groups
      (2,500-3,499 g and >/=3,500 g groups combined), respectively. Central nervous
      system conditions explained 20% of deaths in childhood/adolescence in the VLBW
      group, with deaths from neoplasms and external conditions increasingly prevalent 
      in the 1,500-2,499 g and >/=2,500 g birthweight groups. The study would have
      benefited had we had access to information on gestational age and maternal
      smoking, but since the former is highly correlated with birthweight and the
      latter with deprivation, we believe that our findings remain robust despite these
      shortcomings. CONCLUSIONS: LBW is associated with infant and later child and
      adolescent mortality, with perinatal factors and congenital malformations
      explaining many of the deaths. By understanding and ameliorating the influences
      of upstream exposures such as maternal smoking and deprivation, later mortality
      can be decreased by reducing the delivery of vulnerable infants with LBW.

TI  - Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV at a Patient's First Clinic Visit: The 
      RapIT Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1002015
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High rates of patient attrition from care between HIV testing and
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation have been documented in sub-Saharan
      Africa, contributing to persistently low CD4 cell counts at treatment initiation.
      One reason for this is that starting ART in many countries is a lengthy and
      burdensome process, imposing long waits and multiple clinic visits on patients.
      We estimated the effect on uptake of ART and viral suppression of an accelerated 
      initiation algorithm that allowed treatment-eligible patients to be dispensed
      their first supply of antiretroviral medications on the day of their first
      HIV-related clinic visit. METHODS AND FINDINGS: RapIT (Rapid Initiation of
      Treatment) was an unblinded randomized controlled trial of single-visit ART
      initiation in two public sector clinics in South Africa, a primary health clinic 
      (PHC) and a hospital-based HIV clinic. Adult (>/=18 y old), non-pregnant patients
      receiving a positive HIV test or first treatment-eligible CD4 count were
      randomized to standard or rapid initiation. Patients in the rapid-initiation arm 
      of the study ("rapid arm") received a point-of-care (POC) CD4 count if needed;
      those who were ART-eligible received a POC tuberculosis (TB) test if symptomatic,
      POC blood tests, physical exam, education, counseling, and antiretroviral (ARV)
      dispensing. Patients in the standard-initiation arm of the study ("standard arm")
      followed standard clinic procedures (three to five additional clinic visits over 
      2-4 wk prior to ARV dispensing). Follow up was by record review only. The primary
      outcome was viral suppression, defined as initiated, retained in care, and
      suppressed (</=400 copies/ml) within 10 mo of study enrollment. Secondary
      outcomes included initiation of ART </=90 d of study enrollment, retention in
      care, time to ART initiation, patient-level predictors of primary outcomes,
      prevalence of TB symptoms, and the feasibility and acceptability of the
      intervention. A survival analysis was conducted comparing attrition from care
      after ART initiation between the groups among those who initiated within 90 d.
      Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the study between May
      8, 2013 and August 29, 2014 (median CD4 count 210 cells/mm3). In the rapid arm,
      119/187 patients (64%) initiated treatment and were virally suppressed at 10 mo, 
      compared to 96/190 (51%) in the standard arm (relative risk [RR] 1.26
      [1.05-1.50]). In the rapid arm 182/187 (97%) initiated ART </=90 d, compared to
      136/190 (72%) in the standard arm (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.24-1.49). Among 318 patients who did initiate ART within 90 d, the hazard of
      attrition within the first 10 mo did not differ between the treatment arms
      (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06; 95% CI 0.61-1.84). The study was limited by the small
      number of sites and small sample size, and the generalizability of the results to
      other settings and to non-research conditions is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Offering
      single-visit ART initiation to adult patients in South Africa increased uptake of
      ART by 36% and viral suppression by 26%. This intervention should be considered
      for adoption in the public sector in Africa. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effectiveness of and Financial Returns to Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision for
      HIV Prevention in South Africa: An Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.
PG  - e1002012
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empirical studies and population-level policy simulations show the
      importance of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) in generalized
      epidemics. This paper complements available scenario-based studies (projecting
      costs and outcomes over some policy period, typically spanning decades) by
      adopting an incremental approach-analyzing the expected consequences of
      circumcising one male individual with specific characteristics in a specific
      year. This approach yields more precise estimates of VMMC's cost-effectiveness
      and identifies the outcomes of current investments in VMMC (e.g., within a fiscal
      budget period) rather than of investments spread over the entire policy period.
      METHODS/FINDINGS: The model has three components. We adapted the ASSA2008 model, 
      a demographic and epidemiological model of the HIV epidemic in South Africa, to
      analyze the impact of one VMMC on HIV incidence over time and across the
      population. A costing module tracked the costs of VMMC and the resulting
      financial savings owing to reduced HIV incidence over time. Then, we used several
      financial indicators to assess the cost-effectiveness of and financial return on 
      investments in VMMC. One circumcision of a young man up to age 20 prevents on
      average over 0.2 HIV infections, but this effect declines steeply with age, e.g.,
      to 0.08 by age 30. Net financial savings from one VMMC at age 20 are estimated at
      US$617 at a discount rate of 5% and are lower for circumcisions both at younger
      ages (because the savings occur later and are discounted more) and at older ages 
      (because male circumcision becomes less effective). Investments in male
      circumcision carry a financial rate of return of up to 14.5% (for circumcisions
      at age 20). The cost of a male circumcision is refinanced fastest, after 13 y,
      for circumcisions at ages 20 to 25. Principal limitations of the analysis arise
      from the long time (decades) over which the effects of VMMC unfold-the results
      are therefore sensitive to the discount rate applied, and more generally to the
      future course of the epidemic and of HIV/AIDS-related policies pursued by the
      government. CONCLUSIONS: VMMC in South Africa is highly effective in reducing
      both HIV incidence and the financial costs of the HIV response. The return on
      investment is highest if males are circumcised between ages 20 and 25, but this
      return on investment declines steeply with age.

      Study.
PG  - e1002010
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of disease in children 
      less than 5 y of age. Poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions are the
      primary routes of exposure and infection. Sanitation and hygiene interventions
      are estimated to generate a 36% and 48% reduction in diarrheal risk in young
      children, respectively. Little is known about whether the number of households
      sharing a sanitation facility affects a child's risk of diarrhea. The objective
      of this study was to describe sanitation and hygiene access across the Global
      Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) sites in Africa and South Asia and to assess
      sanitation and hygiene exposures, including shared sanitation access, as risk
      factors for moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children less than 5 y of age.
      METHODS/FINDINGS: The GEMS matched case-control study was conducted between
      December 1, 2007, and March 3, 2011, at seven sites in Basse, The Gambia; Nyanza 
      Province, Kenya; Bamako, Mali; Manhica, Mozambique; Mirzapur, Bangladesh;
      Kolkata, India; and Karachi, Pakistan. Data was collected for 8,592 case children
      aged <5 y old experiencing MSD and for 12,390 asymptomatic age, gender, and
      neighborhood-matched controls. An MSD case was defined as a child with a
      diarrheal illness <7 d duration comprising >/=3 loose stools in 24 h and >/=1 of 
      the following: sunken eyes, skin tenting, dysentery, intravenous (IV)
      rehydration, or hospitalization. Site-specific conditional logistic regression
      models were used to explore the association between sanitation and hygiene
      exposures and MSD. Most households at six sites (>93%) had access to a sanitation
      facility, while 70% of households in rural Kenya had access to a facility.
      Practicing open defecation was a risk factor for MSD in children <5 y old in
      Kenya. Sharing sanitation facilities with 1-2 or >/=3 other households was a
      statistically significant risk factor for MSD in Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, and
      Pakistan. Among those with a designated handwashing area near the home, soap or
      ash were more frequently observed at control households and were significantly
      protective against MSD in Mozambique and India. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests 
      that sharing a sanitation facility with just one to two other households can
      increase the risk of MSD in young children, compared to using a private facility.
      Interventions aimed at increasing access to private household sanitation
      facilities may reduce the burden of MSD in children. These findings support the
      current World Health Organization/ United Nations Children's Emergency Fund
      (UNICEF) system that categorizes shared sanitation as unimproved.

TI  - Risk of Advanced Neoplasia in First-Degree Relatives with Colorectal Cancer: A
      Large Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e1002008
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: First-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with colorectal cancer have 
      a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer than the general population. For
      this reason, screening guidelines recommend colonoscopy every 5 or 10 y, starting
      at the age of 40, depending on whether colorectal cancer in the index-case is
      diagnosed at <60 or >/=60 y, respectively. However, studies on the risk of
      neoplastic lesions are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine the
      risk of advanced neoplasia (three or more non-advanced adenomas, advanced
      adenoma, or invasive cancer) in FDR of patients with colorectal cancer compared
      to average-risk individuals (i.e., asymptomatic adults 50 to 69 y of age with no 
      family history of colorectal cancer). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This cross-sectional 
      analysis includes data from 8,498 individuals undergoing their first lifetime
      screening colonoscopy between 2006 and 2012 at six Spanish tertiary hospitals. Of
      these individuals, 3,015 were defined as asymptomatic FDR of patients with
      colorectal cancer ("familial-risk group") and 3,038 as asymptomatic with
      average-risk for colorectal cancer ("average-risk group"). The familial-risk
      group was stratified as one FDR, with one family member diagnosed with colorectal
      cancer at >/=60 y (n = 1,884) or at <60 y (n = 831), and as two FDR, with two
      family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer at any age (n = 300). Multiple
      logistic regression analysis was used for between-group comparisons after
      adjusting for potential confounders (age, gender, and center). Compared with the 
      average-risk group, advanced neoplasia was significantly more prevalent in
      individuals having two FDR with colorectal cancer (odds ratio [OR] 1.90; 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.66, p < 0.001), but not in those having one FDR
      with colorectal cancer diagnosed at >/=60 y (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.83-1.27, p = 0.77)
      and <60 y (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.90-1.58, p = 0.20). After the age of 50 y, men
      developed advanced neoplasia over two times more frequently than women and
      advanced neoplasia appeared at least ten y earlier. Fewer colonoscopies by 2-fold
      were required to detect one advanced neoplasia in men than in women. Major
      limitations of this study were first that although average-risk individuals were 
      consecutively included in a randomized control trial, this was not the case for
      all individuals in the familial-risk cohort; and second, the difference in age
      between the average-risk and familial-risk cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals
      having two FDR with colorectal cancer showed an increased risk of advanced
      neoplasia compared to those with average-risk for colorectal cancer. Men had over
      2-fold higher risk of advanced neoplasia than women, independent of family
      history. These data suggest that screening colonoscopy guidelines should be
      revised in the familial-risk population.

TI  - Disentangling the Association between Statins, Cholesterol, and Colorectal
      Cancer: A Nested Case-Control Study.
PG  - e1002007
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several prior studies have found an association between statin use
      and reduced risk of colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that these findings may be
      due to systematic bias and examined the independent association of colorectal
      cancer risk with statin use, serum cholesterol, and change in cholesterol
      concentration. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 22,163 colorectal cancer cases and 86,538
      matched controls between 1995 and 2013 were identified within The Health
      Improvement Network (THIN) a population-representative database. Conditional
      logistic regression models estimated colorectal cancer risk with statin use,
      serum total cholesterol (mmol/L), and change in total cholesterol level. We
      confirmed a decreased risk of colorectal cancer with statin use (long-term: odds 
      ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-0.99; short-term: OR, 0.92; 
      95% CI, 0.85-0.99). However, to assess whether the observed association may
      result from indication bias, a subgroup analysis was conducted among patients
      prescribed a statin. In this subgroup (n = 5,102 cases, n = 19,032 controls),
      3.1% of case subjects and 3.1% of controls discontinued therapy. The risk of
      colorectal cancer was not significantly different among those who continued
      statin therapy and those who discontinued (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79-1.22).
      Increased serum cholesterol was independently associated with decreased risk of
      colorectal cancer (OR, 0.89 per mmol/L increase; 95% CI, 0.87-0.91); the
      association was only present if serum cholesterol was measured near the cancer
      diagnosis (<6 mo: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.47-0.61; >24 mo: OR, 0.98; 95% CI,
      0.93-1.03). Decreases in serum total cholesterol >1 mmol/L >/=1 year prior to
      cancer diagnosis were associated with subsequent colorectal cancer (statin users:
      OR, 1.25; 95 CI%, 1.03-1.53; nonusers: OR, 2.36; 95 CI%, 1.78-3.12). As an
      observational study, limitations included incomplete data and residual
      confounding. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of colorectal cancer was lower in
      statin users versus nonusers, no difference was observed among those who
      continued versus discontinued statin therapy, suggesting the potential for
      indication bias. The association between decreased serum cholesterol and
      colorectal cancer risk suggests a cholesterol-lowering effect of undiagnosed
      malignancy. Clinical judgment should be used when considering causes of
      cholesterol reduction in patients, including those on statin therapy.

TI  - Development and Validation of a New Prognostic System for Patients with
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - e1002006
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prognostic assessment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      remains controversial. Using the Italian Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA) database as a
      training set, we sought to develop and validate a new prognostic system for
      patients with HCC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospective collected databases from
      Italy (training cohort, n = 3,628; internal validation cohort, n = 1,555) and
      Taiwan (external validation cohort, n = 2,651) were used to develop the ITA.LI.CA
      prognostic system. We first defined ITA.LI.CA stages (0, A, B1, B2, B3, C) using 
      only tumor characteristics (largest tumor diameter, number of nodules, intra- and
      extrahepatic macroscopic vascular invasion, extrahepatic metastases). A
      parametric multivariable survival model was then used to calculate the relative
      prognostic value of ITA.LI.CA tumor stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) performance status, Child-Pugh score (CPS), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in
      predicting individual survival. Based on the model results, an ITA.LI.CA
      integrated prognostic score (from 0 to 13 points) was constructed, and its
      prognostic power compared with that of other integrated systems (BCLC, HKLC,
      MESIAH, CLIP, JIS). Median follow-up was 58 mo for Italian patients
      (interquartile range, 26-106 mo) and 39 mo for Taiwanese patients (interquartile 
      range, 12-61 mo). The ITA.LI.CA integrated prognostic score showed optimal
      discrimination and calibration abilities in Italian patients. Observed median
      survival in the training and internal validation sets was 57 and 61 mo,
      respectively, in quartile 1 (ITA.LI.CA score </= 1), 43 and 38 mo in quartile 2
      (ITA.LI.CA score 2-3), 23 and 23 mo in quartile 3 (ITA.LI.CA score 4-5), and 9
      and 8 mo in quartile 4 (ITA.LI.CA score > 5). Observed and predicted median
      survival in the training and internal validation sets largely coincided. Although
      observed and predicted survival estimations were significantly lower (log-rank
      test, p < 0.001) in Italian than in Taiwanese patients, the ITA.LI.CA score
      maintained very high discrimination and calibration features also in the external
      validation cohort. The concordance index (C index) of the ITA.LI.CA score in the 
      internal and external validation cohorts was 0.71 and 0.78, respectively. The
      ITA.LI.CA score's prognostic ability was significantly better (p < 0.001) than
      that of BCLC stage (respective C indexes of 0.64 and 0.73), CLIP score (0.68 and 
      0.75), JIS stage (0.67 and 0.70), MESIAH score (0.69 and 0.77), and HKLC stage
      (0.68 and 0.75). The main limitations of this study are its retrospective nature 
      and the intrinsically significant differences between the Taiwanese and Italian
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ITA.LI.CA prognostic system includes both a tumor
      staging-stratifying patients with HCC into six main stages (0, A, B1, B2, B3, and
      C)-and a prognostic score-integrating ITA.LI.CA tumor staging, CPS, ECOG
      performance status, and AFP. The ITA.LI.CA prognostic system shows a strong
      ability to predict individual survival in European and Asian populations.

TI  - Gender Differences in Homicide of Neonates, Infants, and Children under 5 y in
      South Africa: Results from the Cross-Sectional 2009 National Child Homicide
      Study.
PG  - e1002003
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Homicide of children is a global problem. The under-5-y age group is 
      the second largest homicide age group after 15-19 y olds, but has received little
      research attention. Understanding age and gender patterns is important for
      assisting with developing prevention interventions. Here we present an age and
      gender analysis of homicides among children under 5 y in South Africa from a
      national study that included a focus on neonaticide and infanticide. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: A retrospective national cross-sectional study was conducted using a
      random sample of 38 medico-legal laboratories operating in 2009 to identify
      homicides of children under 5 y. Child data were abstracted from the mortuary
      files and autopsy reports, and both child and perpetrator data data were
      collected from police interviews. We erred towards applying a conservative
      definition of homicide and excluded sudden infant death syndrome cases. We
      estimated that 454 (95% CI 366, 541) children under the age of 5 y were killed in
      South Africa in 2009. More than half (53.2%; 95% CI 46.7%, 59.5%) were neonates
      (0-28 d), and 74.4% (95% CI 69.3%, 78.9%) were infants (under 1 y), giving a
      neonaticide rate of 19.6 per 100,000 live births and an infanticide rate of 28.4 
      per 100,000 live births. The majority of the neonates died in the early neonatal 
      period (0-6 d), and abandonment accounted for 84.9% (95% CI 81.5%, 87.8%) of all 
      the neonates killed. Distinct age and gender patterns were found, with
      significantly fewer boy children killed in rural settings compared to urban
      settings (odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.4, 0.9; p = 0.015). Abuse-related killings and
      evidence of sexual assault were more common among older girls than in all other
      age and gender groups. Mothers were identified as the perpetrators in all of the 
      neonaticides and were the most common perpetrators overall (71.0%; 95% CI 63.9%, 
      77.2%). Abandoned neonates were mainly term babies, with a mean gestational age
      of 38 wk. We did not have information on abandonment motives for all newborns and
      did not know if babies were abandoned with the intention that they would die or
      with the hope that they would be found alive. We therefore considered all
      abandoned babies as homicides. CONCLUSIONS: Homicide of children is an extreme
      form or consequence of violence against children. This national study provides
      one of the first analyses of neonaticide and infanticide by age and gender and
      shows the failure of reproductive and mental health and social services to
      identify and help vulnerable mothers. Multi-sectoral prevention strategies are
      needed.

TI  - The Vast and Varied Global Burden of Norovirus: Prospects for Prevention and
      Control.

AB  - Globally, norovirus is associated with approximately one-fifth of all diarrhea
      cases, with similar prevalence in both children and adults, and is estimated to
      cause over 200,000 deaths annually in developing countries. Norovirus is an
      important pathogen in a number of high-priority domains: it is the most common
      cause of diarrheal episodes globally, the principal cause of foodborne disease
      outbreaks in the United States, a key health care-acquired infection, a common
      cause of travel-associated diarrhea, and a bane for deployed military troops.
      Partly as a result of this ubiquity and burden across a range of different
      populations, identifying target groups and strategies for intervention has been
      challenging. And, on top of the breadth of this public health problem, there
      remain important gaps in scientific knowledge regarding norovirus, especially
      with respect to disease in low-income settings. Many pathogens can cause acute
      gastroenteritis. Historically, rotavirus was the most common cause of severe
      disease in young children globally. Now, vaccines are available for rotavirus and
      are universally recommended by the World Health Organization. In countries with
      effective rotavirus vaccination programs, disease due to that pathogen has
      decreased markedly, but norovirus persists and is now the most common cause of
      pediatric gastroenteritis requiring medical attention. However, the data
      supporting the precise role of norovirus in low- and middle-income settings are
      sparse. With vaccines in the pipeline, addressing these and other important
      knowledge gaps is increasingly pressing. We assembled an expert group to assess
      the evidence for the global burden of norovirus and to consider the prospects for
      norovirus vaccine development. The group assessed the evidence in the areas of
      burden of disease, epidemiology, diagnostics, disease attribution, acquired
      immunity, and innate susceptibility, and the group considered how to bring
      norovirus vaccines from their current state of development to a viable product
      that will benefit global health.

TI  - Birth "Out-of-Hours": An Evaluation of Obstetric Practice and Outcome According
      to the Presence of Senior Obstetricians on the Labour Ward.
PG  - e1002000
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised that a lack of senior obstetricians
      ("consultants") on the labour ward outside normal hours may lead to worse
      outcomes among babies born during periods of reduced cover. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      We carried out a multicentre cohort study using data from 19 obstetric units in
      the United Kingdom between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013 to examine whether
      rates of obstetric intervention and outcome change "out-of-hours," i.e., when
      consultants are not providing dedicated, on-site labour ward cover. At the 19
      hospitals, obstetric rotas ranged from 51 to 106 h of on-site labour ward cover
      per week. There were 87,501 singleton live births during the year, and 55.8%
      occurred out-of-hours. Women who delivered out-of-hours had slightly lower rates 
      of intrapartum caesarean section (CS) (12.7% versus 13.4%, adjusted odds ratio
      [OR] 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90 to 0.98) and instrumental delivery
      (15.6% versus 17.0%, adj. OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.96) than women who delivered 
      at times of on-site labour ward cover. There was some evidence that the severe
      perineal tear rate was reduced in out-of-hours vaginal deliveries (3.3% versus
      3.6%, adj. OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00). There was no evidence of a
      statistically significant difference between out-of-hours and "in-hours"
      deliveries in the rate of babies with a low Apgar score at 5 min (1.33% versus
      1.25%, adjusted OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or low cord pH (0.94% versus 0.82%;
      adjusted OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.31). Key study limitations include the
      potential for bias by indication, the reliance upon an organisational measure of 
      consultant presence, and a non-random sample of maternity units. CONCLUSIONS:
      There was no difference in the rate of maternal and neonatal morbidity according 
      to the presence of consultants on the labour ward, with the possible exception of
      a reduced rate of severe perineal tears in out-of-hours vaginal deliveries. Fewer
      women had operative deliveries out-of-hours. Taken together, the available
      evidence provides some reassurance that the current organisation of maternity
      care in the UK allows for good planning and risk management. However there is a
      need for more robust evidence on the quality of care afforded by different models
      of labour ward staffing.

TI  - Underweight, Markers of Cachexia, and Mortality in Acute Myocardial Infarction: A
      Prospective Cohort Study of Elderly Medicare Beneficiaries.
PG  - e1001998
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001998 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Underweight patients are at higher risk of death after acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) than normal weight patients; however, it is unclear
      whether this relationship is explained by confounding due to cachexia or other
      factors associated with low body mass index (BMI). This study aimed to answer two
      questions: (1) does comprehensive risk adjustment for comorbid illness and
      frailty measures explain the higher mortality after AMI in underweight patients, 
      and (2) is the relationship between underweight and mortality also observed in
      patients with AMI who are otherwise without significant chronic illness and are
      presumably free of cachexia? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data from the
      Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a cohort-based study of Medicare
      beneficiaries hospitalized for AMI between January 1994 and February 1996 with 17
      y of follow-up and detailed clinical information to compare short- and long-term 
      mortality in underweight and normal weight patients (n = 57,574). We used Cox
      proportional hazards regression to investigate the association of low BMI with
      30-d, 1-y, 5-y, and 17-y mortality after AMI while adjusting for patient
      comorbidities, frailty measures, and laboratory markers of nutritional status. We
      also repeated the analyses in a subset of patients without significant
      comorbidity or frailty. Of the 57,574 patients with AMI included in this cohort, 
      5,678 (9.8%) were underweight and 51,896 (90.2%) were normal weight at baseline. 
      Underweight patients were older, on average, than normal weight patients and had 
      a higher prevalence of most comorbidities and measures of frailty. Crude
      mortality was significantly higher for underweight patients than normal weight
      patients at 30 d (25.2% versus 16.4%, p < 0.001), 1 y (51.3% versus 33.8%, p <
      0.001), 5 y (79.2% versus 59.4%, p < 0.001), and 17 y (98.3% versus 94.0%, p <
      0.001). After adjustment, underweight patients had a 13% higher risk of 30-d
      death and a 26% higher risk of 17-y death than normal weight patients (30-d
      hazard ratio [HR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.20; 17-y HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23-1.30).
      Survival curves for underweight and normal weight patients separated early and
      remained separate over 17 y, suggesting that underweight patients remained at a
      significant survival disadvantage over time. Similar findings were observed among
      the subset of patients without comorbidity at baseline. Underweight patients
      without comorbidity had a 30-d adjusted mortality similar to that of normal
      weight patients but a 21% higher risk of death over the long term (30-d HR 1.08, 
      95% CI 0.93-1.26; 17-y HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.14-1.29). The adverse effects of low BMI
      were greatest in patients with very low BMIs. The major limitation of this study 
      was the use of surrogate markers of frailty and comorbid conditions to identify
      patients at highest risk for cachexia rather than clear diagnostic criteria for
      cachexia. CONCLUSIONS: Underweight BMI is an important risk factor for mortality 
      after AMI, independent of confounding by comorbidities, frailty measures, and
      laboratory markers of nutritional status. Strategies to promote weight gain in
      underweight patients after AMI are worthy of testing.

      2 Clinical Trial.
PG  - e1001997
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001997 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TKM-130803, a small interfering RNA lipid nanoparticle product, has
      been developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD), but its efficacy
      and safety in humans has not been evaluated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this
      single-arm phase 2 trial, adults with laboratory-confirmed EVD received 0.3 mg/kg
      of TKM-130803 by intravenous infusion once daily for up to 7 d. On days when
      trial enrolment capacity was reached, patients were enrolled into a concurrent
      observational cohort. The primary outcome was survival to day 14 after admission,
      excluding patients who died within 48 h of admission. After 14 adults with EVD
      had received TKM-130803, the pre-specified futility boundary was reached,
      indicating a probability of survival to day 14 of </=0.55, and enrolment was
      stopped. Pre-treatment geometric mean Ebola virus load in the 14 TKM-130803
      recipients was 2.24 x 109 RNA copies/ml plasma (95% CI 7.52 x 108, 6.66 x 109).
      Two of the TKM-130803 recipients died within 48 h of admission and were therefore
      excluded from the primary outcome analysis. Of the remaining 12 TKM-130803
      recipients, nine died and three survived. The probability that a TKM-130803
      recipient who survived for 48 h will subsequently survive to day 14 was estimated
      to be 0.27 (95% CI 0.06, 0.58). TKM-130803 infusions were well tolerated, with 56
      doses administered and only one possible infusion-related reaction observed.
      Three patients were enrolled in the observational cohort, of whom two died.
      CONCLUSIONS: Administration of TKM-130803 at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/d by intravenous
      infusion to adult patients with severe EVD was not shown to improve survival when
      compared to historic controls. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pan African Clinical Trials

TI  - The Impact of Hotspot-Targeted Interventions on Malaria Transmission in Rachuonyo
      South District in the Western Kenyan Highlands: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled
      Trial.
PG  - e1001993
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001993 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is highly heterogeneous, generating malaria
      hotspots that can fuel malaria transmission across a wider area. Targeting
      hotspots may represent an efficacious strategy for reducing malaria transmission.
      We determined the impact of interventions targeted to serologically defined
      malaria hotspots on malaria transmission both inside hotspots and in surrounding 
      communities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Twenty-seven serologically defined malaria
      hotspots were detected in a survey conducted from 24 June to 31 July 2011 that
      included 17,503 individuals from 3,213 compounds in a 100-km2 area in Rachuonyo
      South District, Kenya. In a cluster-randomized trial from 22 March to 15 April
      2012, we randomly allocated five clusters to hotspot-targeted interventions with 
      larviciding, distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, indoor
      residual spraying, and focal mass drug administration (2,082 individuals in 432
      compounds); five control clusters received malaria control following Kenyan
      national policy (2,468 individuals in 512 compounds). Our primary outcome measure
      was parasite prevalence in evaluation zones up to 500 m outside hotspots,
      determined by nested PCR (nPCR) at baseline and 8 wk (16 June-6 July 2012) and 16
      wk (21 August-10 September 2012) post-intervention by technicians blinded to the 
      intervention arm. Secondary outcome measures were parasite prevalence inside
      hotpots, parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone as a function of distance
      from the hotspot boundary, Anopheles mosquito density, mosquito breeding site
      productivity, malaria incidence by passive case detection, and the safety and
      acceptability of the interventions. Intervention coverage exceeded 87% for all
      interventions. Hotspot-targeted interventions did not result in a change in nPCR 
      parasite prevalence outside hotspot boundaries (p >/= 0.187). We observed an
      average reduction in nPCR parasite prevalence of 10.2% (95% CI -1.3 to 21.7%)
      inside hotspots 8 wk post-intervention that was statistically significant after
      adjustment for covariates (p = 0.024), but not 16 wk post-intervention (p =
      0.265). We observed no statistically significant trend in the effect of the
      intervention on nPCR parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone in relation to
      distance from the hotspot boundary 8 wk (p = 0.27) or 16 wk post-intervention (p 
      = 0.75). Thirty-six patients with clinical malaria confirmed by rapid diagnostic 
      test could be located to intervention or control clusters, with no apparent
      difference between the study arms. In intervention clusters we caught an average 
      of 1.14 female anophelines inside hotspots and 0.47 in evaluation zones; in
      control clusters we caught an average of 0.90 female anophelines inside hotspots 
      and 0.50 in evaluation zones, with no apparent difference between study arms. Our
      trial was not powered to detect subtle effects of hotspot-targeted interventions 
      nor designed to detect effects of interventions over multiple transmission
      seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high coverage, the impact of interventions
      targeting malaria vectors and human infections on nPCR parasite prevalence was
      modest, transient, and restricted to the targeted hotspot areas. Our findings
      suggest that transmission may not primarily occur from hotspots to the
      surrounding areas and that areas with highly heterogeneous but widespread malaria
      transmission may currently benefit most from an untargeted community-wide
      approach. Hotspot-targeted approaches may have more validity in settings where
      human settlement is more nuclear. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - The Association between Sulfonylurea Use and All-Cause and Cardiovascular
      Mortality: A Meta-Analysis with Trial Sequential Analysis of Randomized Clinical 
      Trials.
PG  - e1001992
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001992 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfonylureas are an effective and inexpensive treatment for type 2
      diabetes. There is conflicting data about the safety of these drugs regarding
      mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. The objective of the present study was to 
      evaluate the safety of the sulfonylureas most frequently used and to use trial
      sequential analysis (TSA) to analyze whether the available sample was powered
      enough to support the results. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Electronic databases were
      reviewed from 1946 (Embase) or 1966 (MEDLINE) up to 31 December 2014. Randomized 
      clinical trials (RCTs) of at least 52 wk in duration evaluating second- or
      third-generation sulfonylureas in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes
      and reporting outcomes of interest were included. Primary outcomes were all-cause
      and cardiovascular mortality. Additionally, myocardial infarction and stroke
      events were evaluated. Data were summarized with Peto odds ratios (ORs), and the 
      reliability of the results was evaluated with TSA. Forty-seven RCTs with 37,650
      patients and 890 deaths in total were included. Sulfonylureas were not associated
      with all-cause (OR 1.12 [95% CI 0.96 to 1.30]) or cardiovascular mortality (OR
      1.12 [95% CI 0.87 to 1.42]). Sulfonylureas were also not associated with
      increased risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.92 [95% CI 0.76 to 1.12]) or stroke
      (OR 1.16 [95% CI 0.81 to 1.66]). TSA could discard an absolute difference of 0.5%
      between the treatments, which was considered the minimal clinically significant
      difference. The major limitation of this review was the inclusion of studies not 
      designed to evaluate safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfonylureas are not
      associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality,
      myocardial infarction, or stroke. Current evidence supports the safety of
      sulfonylureas; an absolute risk of 0.5% could be firmly discarded. REVIEW

TI  - A Nested Case-Control Study of Metabolically Defined Body Size Phenotypes and
      Risk of Colorectal Cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
      and Nutrition (EPIC).
PG  - e1001988
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001988 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is positively associated with colorectal cancer. Recently,
      body size subtypes categorised by the prevalence of hyperinsulinaemia have been
      defined, and metabolically healthy overweight/obese individuals (without
      hyperinsulinaemia) have been suggested to be at lower risk of cardiovascular
      disease than their metabolically unhealthy (hyperinsulinaemic) overweight/obese
      counterparts. Whether similarly variable relationships exist for metabolically
      defined body size phenotypes and colorectal cancer risk is unknown. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: The association of metabolically defined body size phenotypes with
      colorectal cancer was investigated in a case-control study nested within the
      European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study.
      Metabolic health/body size phenotypes were defined according to hyperinsulinaemia
      status using serum concentrations of C-peptide, a marker of insulin secretion. A 
      total of 737 incident colorectal cancer cases and 737 matched controls were
      divided into tertiles based on the distribution of C-peptide concentration
      amongst the control population, and participants were classified as metabolically
      healthy if below the first tertile of C-peptide and metabolically unhealthy if
      above the first tertile. These metabolic health definitions were then combined
      with body mass index (BMI) measurements to create four metabolic health/body size
      phenotype categories: (1) metabolically healthy/normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2),
      (2) metabolically healthy/overweight (BMI >/= 25 kg/m2), (3) metabolically
      unhealthy/normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2), and (4) metabolically
      unhealthy/overweight (BMI >/= 25 kg/m2). Additionally, in separate models, waist 
      circumference measurements (using the International Diabetes Federation
      cut-points [>/=80 cm for women and >/=94 cm for men]) were used (instead of BMI) 
      to create the four metabolic health/body size phenotype categories. Statistical
      tests used in the analysis were all two-sided, and a p-value of <0.05 was
      considered statistically significant. In multivariable-adjusted conditional
      logistic regression models with BMI used to define adiposity, compared with
      metabolically healthy/normal weight individuals, we observed a higher colorectal 
      cancer risk among metabolically unhealthy/normal weight (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59, 
      95% CI 1.10-2.28) and metabolically unhealthy/overweight (OR = 1.40, 95% CI
      1.01-1.94) participants, but not among metabolically healthy/overweight
      individuals (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.65-1.42). Among the overweight individuals,
      lower colorectal cancer risk was observed for metabolically healthy/overweight
      individuals compared with metabolically unhealthy/overweight individuals (OR =
      0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96). These associations were generally consistent when waist 
      circumference was used as the measure of adiposity. To our knowledge, there is no
      universally accepted clinical definition for using C-peptide level as an
      indication of hyperinsulinaemia. Therefore, a possible limitation of our analysis
      was that the classification of individuals as being hyperinsulinaemic-based on
      their C-peptide level-was arbitrary. However, when we used quartiles or the
      median of C-peptide, instead of tertiles, as the cut-point of hyperinsulinaemia, 
      a similar pattern of associations was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      support the idea that individuals with the metabolically healthy/overweight
      phenotype (with normal insulin levels) are at lower colorectal cancer risk than
      those with hyperinsulinaemia. The combination of anthropometric measures with
      metabolic parameters, such as C-peptide, may be useful for defining strata of the
      population at greater risk of colorectal cancer.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001987 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews of the effects of healthcare interventions
      frequently include non-randomized studies. These are subject to confounding and a
      range of other biases that are seldom considered in detail when synthesizing and 
      interpreting the results. Our aims were to assess the reliability and usability
      of a new Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool for non-randomized studies of
      interventions and to determine whether restricting analysis to studies with low
      or moderate RoB made a material difference to the results of the reviews. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: We selected two systematic reviews of population-based, controlled 
      non-randomized studies of the relationship between the use of thiazolidinediones 
      (TZDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and major cardiovascular events.
      Two epidemiologists applied the Cochrane RoB tool and made assessments across the
      seven specified domains of bias for each of 37 component studies. Inter-rater
      agreement was measured using the weighted Kappa statistic. We grouped studies
      according to overall RoB and performed statistical pooling for (a) all studies
      and (b) only studies with low or moderate RoB. Kappa scores across the seven bias
      domains ranged from 0.50 to 1.0. In the COX-2 inhibitor review, two studies had
      low overall RoB, 14 had moderate RoB, and five had serious RoB. In the TZD
      review, six studies had low RoB, four had moderate RoB, four had serious RoB, and
      two had critical RoB. The pooled odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart
      failure, and death for rosiglitazone versus pioglitazone remained significantly
      elevated when analyses were confined to studies with low or moderate RoB.
      However, the estimate for myocardial infarction declined from 1.14 (95% CI
      1.07-1.24) to 1.06 (95% CI 0.99-1.13) when analysis was confined to studies with 
      low RoB. Estimates of pooled relative risks of cardiovascular events with COX-2
      inhibitors compared with no nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug changed little
      when analyses were confined to studies with low or moderate RoB. The exception
      was a rise in the relative risk associated with ibuprofen from 1.07 (95% CI
      0.97-1.18) to 1.14 (95% CI 1.03-1.26). The main limitation of our study was
      testing the instrument on a narrow range of pharmacoepidemiological studies; we
      cannot assume our findings extend to a broader range of interventions and
      settings. CONCLUSIONS: The Cochrane RoB tool highlighted a wide range of risks of
      bias in studies included in two widely cited reviews and had the potential to
      change the conclusions of the reviews. Systematic reviews that incorporate
      non-randomized studies of medical interventions should include a detailed
      assessment of RoB for each included study.

TI  - Performance of the GeneXpert Ebola Assay for Diagnosis of Ebola Virus Disease in 
      Sierra Leone: A Field Evaluation Study.
PG  - e1001980
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001980 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Throughout the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa,
      field laboratory testing for EVD has relied on complex, multi-step real-time
      reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays; an accurate sample-to-answer RT-PCR
      test would reduce time to results and potentially increase access to testing. We 
      evaluated the performance of the Cepheid GeneXpert Ebola assay on clinical
      venipuncture whole blood (WB) and buccal swab (BS) specimens submitted to a field
      biocontainment laboratory in Sierra Leone for routine EVD testing by RT-PCR
      ("Trombley assay"). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted in the Public 
      Health England EVD diagnostic laboratory in Port Loko, Sierra Leone, using
      residual diagnostic specimens remaining after clinical testing. EDTA-WB specimens
      (n = 218) were collected from suspected or confirmed EVD patients between April 1
      and July 20, 2015. BS specimens (n = 71) were collected as part of a national
      postmortem screening program between March 7 and July 20, 2015. EDTA-WB and BS
      specimens were tested with Xpert (targets: glycoprotein [GP] and nucleoprotein
      [NP] genes) and Trombley (target: NP gene) assays in parallel. All WB specimens
      were fresh; 84/218 were tested in duplicate on Xpert to compare WB sampling
      methods (pipette versus swab); 43/71 BS specimens had been previously frozen. In 
      all, 7/218 (3.2%) WB and 7/71 (9.9%) BS samples had Xpert results that were
      reported as "invalid" or "error" and were excluded, leaving 211 WB and 64 BS
      samples with valid Trombley and Xpert results. For WB, 22/22 Trombley-positive
      samples were Xpert-positive (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 84.6%-100%), and 181/189
      Trombley-negative samples were Xpert-negative (specificity 95.8%, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 91.8%-98.2%). Seven of the eight Trombley-negative, Xpert-positive 
      (Xpert cycle threshold [Ct] range 37.7-43.4) WB samples were confirmed to be
      follow-up submissions from previously Trombley-positive EVD patients, suggesting 
      a revised Xpert specificity of 99.5% (95% CI 97.0%-100%). For Xpert-positive WB
      samples (n = 22), Xpert NP Ct values were consistently lower than GP Ct values
      (mean difference -4.06, 95% limits of agreement -6.09, -2.03); Trombley (NP) Ct
      values closely matched Xpert NP Ct values (mean difference -0.04, 95% limits of
      agreement -2.93, 2.84). Xpert results (positive/negative) for WB sampled by
      pipette versus swab were concordant for 78/79 (98.7%) WB samples, with comparable
      Ct values for positive results. For BS specimens, 20/20 Trombley-positive samples
      were Xpert-positive (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 83.2%-100%), and 44/44
      Trombley-negative samples were Xpert-negative (specificity 100%, 95% CI
      92.0%-100%). This study was limited to testing residual diagnostic samples, some 
      of which had been frozen before use; it was not possible to test the performance 
      of the Xpert Ebola assay at point of care. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert Ebola assay had
      excellent performance compared to an established RT-PCR benchmark on WB and BS
      samples in a field laboratory setting. Future studies should evaluate feasibility
      and performance outside of a biocontainment laboratory setting to facilitate
      expanded access to testing.

TI  - Comparison of the Schwartz and CKD-EPI Equations for Estimating Glomerular
      Filtration Rate in Children, Adolescents, and Adults: A Retrospective
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e1001979
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001979 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimating kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is of utmost
      importance in many clinical conditions. However, very few studies have evaluated 
      the performance of GFR estimating equations over all ages and degrees of kidney
      impairment. We evaluated the reliability of two major equations for GFR
      estimation, the CKD-EPI and Schwartz equations, with urinary clearance of inulin 
      as gold standard. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study included 10,610 participants
      referred to the Renal and Metabolic Function Exploration Unit of Edouard Herriot 
      Hospital (Lyon, France). GFR was measured by urinary inulin clearance (only first
      measurement kept for analysis) then estimated with isotope dilution mass
      spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable CKD-EPI and Schwartz equations. The participants'
      ages ranged from 3 to 90 y, and the measured GFRs from 3 to 160 ml/min/1.73 m2. A
      linear mixed-effects model was used to model the bias (mean ratio of estimated
      GFR to measured GFR). Equation reliability was also assessed using precision
      (interquartile range [IQR] of the ratio) and accuracy (percentage of estimated
      GFRs within the 10% [P10] and 30% [P30] limits above and below the measured GFR).
      In the whole sample, the mean ratio with the CKD-EPI equation was significantly
      higher than that with the Schwartz equation (1.17 [95% CI 1.16; 1.18] versus 1.08
      [95% CI 1.07; 1.09], p < 0.001, t-test). At GFR values of 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2,
      the mean ratios with the Schwartz equation were closer to 1 than the mean ratios 
      with the CKD-EPI equation whatever the age class (1.02 [95% CI 1.01; 1.03] versus
      1.15 [95% CI 1.13; 1.16], p < 0.001, t-test). In young adults (18-40 y), the
      Schwartz equation had a better precision and was also more accurate than the
      CKD-EPI equation at GFR values under 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (IQR: 0.32 [95% CI 0.28;
      0.33] versus 0.40 [95% CI 0.36; 0.44]; P30: 81.4 [95% CI 78.1; 84.7] versus 63.8 
      [95% CI 59.7; 68.0]) and also at GFR values of 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2. In all
      patients aged >/=65 y, the CKD-EPI equation performed better than the Schwartz
      equation (IQR: 0.33 [95% CI 0.31; 0.34] versus 0.40 [95% CI 0.38; 0.41]; P30:
      77.6 [95% CI 75.7; 79.5] versus 67.5 [95% CI 65.4; 69.7], respectively). In
      children and adolescents (2-17 y), the Schwartz equation was superior to the
      CKD-EPI equation (IQR: 0.23 [95% CI 0.21; 0.24] versus 0.33 [95% CI 0.31; 0.34]; 
      P30: 88.6 [95% CI 86.7; 90.4] versus 29.4 [95% CI 26.8; 32.0]). This study is
      limited by its retrospective design, single-center setting with few non-white
      patients, and small number of patients with severe chronic kidney disease.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that the Schwartz equation may
      be more reliable than the CKD-EPI equation for estimating GFR in children and
      adolescents and in adults with mild to moderate kidney impairment up to age 40 y.

TI  - Increased Duration of Paid Maternity Leave Lowers Infant Mortality in Low- and
      Middle-Income Countries: A Quasi-Experimental Study.
PG  - e1001985
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001985 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternity leave reduces neonatal and infant mortality rates in
      high-income countries. However, the impact of maternity leave on infant health
      has not been rigorously evaluated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In
      this study, we utilized a difference-in-differences approach to evaluate whether 
      paid maternity leave policies affect infant mortality in LMICs. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We used birth history data collected via the Demographic and Health
      Surveys to assemble a panel of approximately 300,000 live births in 20 countries 
      from 2000 to 2008; these observational data were merged with longitudinal
      information on the duration of paid maternity leave provided by each country. We 
      estimated the effect of an increase in maternity leave in the prior year on the
      probability of infant (<1 y), neonatal (<28 d), and post-neonatal (between 28 d
      and 1 y after birth) mortality. Fixed effects for country and year were included 
      to control for, respectively, unobserved time-invariant confounders that varied
      across countries and temporal trends in mortality that were shared across
      countries. Average rates of infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality over
      the study period were 55.2, 30.7, and 23.0 per 1,000 live births, respectively.
      Each additional month of paid maternity was associated with 7.9 fewer infant
      deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI 3.7, 12.0), reflecting a 13% relative
      reduction. Reductions in infant mortality associated with increases in the
      duration of paid maternity leave were concentrated in the post-neonatal period.
      Estimates were robust to adjustment for individual, household, and country-level 
      characteristics, although there may be residual confounding by unmeasured
      time-varying confounders, such as coincident policy changes. CONCLUSIONS: More
      generous paid maternity leave policies represent a potential instrument for
      facilitating early-life interventions and reducing infant mortality in LMICs and 
      warrant further discussion in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. From 
      a policy planning perspective, further work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms
      that explain the benefits of paid maternity leave for infant mortality.

TI  - Global Role and Burden of Influenza in Pediatric Respiratory Hospitalizations,
      1982-2012: A Systematic Analysis.
PG  - e1001977
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001977 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The global burden of pediatric severe respiratory illness is
      substantial, and influenza viruses contribute to this burden. Systematic
      surveillance and testing for influenza among hospitalized children has expanded
      globally over the past decade. However, only a fraction of the data has been used
      to estimate influenza burden. In this analysis, we use surveillance data to
      provide an estimate of influenza-associated hospitalizations among children
      worldwide. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We aggregated data from a systematic review (n =
      108) and surveillance platforms (n = 37) to calculate a pooled estimate of the
      proportion of samples collected from children hospitalized with respiratory
      illnesses and positive for influenza by age group (<6 mo, <1 y, <2 y, <5 y, 5-17 
      y, and <18 y). We applied this proportion to global estimates of acute lower
      respiratory infection hospitalizations among children aged <1 y and <5 y, to
      obtain the number and per capita rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations by
      geographic region and socio-economic status. Influenza was associated with 10%
      (95% CI 8%-11%) of respiratory hospitalizations in children <18 y worldwide,
      ranging from 5% (95% CI 3%-7%) among children <6 mo to 16% (95% CI 14%-20%) among
      children 5-17 y. On average, we estimated that influenza results in approximately
      374,000 (95% CI 264,000 to 539,000) hospitalizations in children <1 y-of which
      228,000 (95% CI 150,000 to 344,000) occur in children <6 mo-and 870,000 (95% CI
      610,000 to 1,237,000) hospitalizations in children <5 y annually.
      Influenza-associated hospitalization rates were more than three times higher in
      developing countries than in industrialized countries (150/100,000 children/year 
      versus 48/100,000). However, differences in hospitalization practices between
      settings are an important limitation in interpreting these findings. CONCLUSIONS:
      Influenza is an important contributor to respiratory hospitalizations among young
      children worldwide. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage among young
      children and pregnant women could reduce this burden and protect infants <6 mo.

TI  - Routine Pediatric Enterovirus 71 Vaccination in China: a Cost-Effectiveness
      Analysis.
PG  - e1001975
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001975 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: China accounted for 87% (9.8 million/11.3 million) of all hand, foot,
      and mouth disease (HFMD) cases reported to WHO during 2010-2014. Enterovirus 71
      (EV71) is responsible for most of the severe HFMD cases. Three EV71 vaccines
      recently demonstrated good efficacy in children aged 6-71 mo. Here we assessed
      the cost-effectiveness of routine pediatric EV71 vaccination in China. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: We characterized the economic and health burden of EV71-associated 
      HFMD (EV71-HFMD) in China using (i) the national surveillance database, (ii)
      virological surveillance records from all provinces, and (iii) a caregiver survey
      on the household costs and health utility loss for 1,787 laboratory-confirmed
      pediatric cases. Using a static model parameterized with these data, we estimated
      the effective vaccine cost (EVC, defined as cost/efficacy or simply the cost of a
      100% efficacious vaccine) below which routine pediatric vaccination would be
      considered cost-effective. We performed the base-case analysis from the societal 
      perspective with a willingness-to-pay threshold of one times the gross domestic
      product per capita (GDPpc) and an annual discount rate of 3%. We performed
      uncertainty analysis by (i) accounting for the uncertainty in the risk of
      EV71-HFMD due to missing laboratory data in the national database, (ii) excluding
      productivity loss of parents and caregivers, (iii) increasing the
      willingness-to-pay threshold to three times GDPpc, (iv) increasing the discount
      rate to 6%, and (v) accounting for the proportion of EV71-HFMD cases not
      registered by national surveillance. In each of these scenarios, we performed
      probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account for parametric uncertainty in our
      estimates of the risk of EV71-HFMD and the expected costs and health utility loss
      due to EV71-HFMD. Routine pediatric EV71 vaccination would be cost-saving if the 
      all-inclusive EVC is below US$10.6 (95% CI US$9.7-US$11.5) and would remain
      cost-effective if EVC is below US$17.9 (95% CI US$16.9-US$18.8) in the base case,
      but these ceilings could be up to 66% higher if all the test-negative cases with 
      missing laboratory data are EV71-HFMD. The EVC ceiling is (i) 10%-14% lower if
      productivity loss of parents/caregivers is excluded, (ii) 58%-84% higher if the
      willingness-to-pay threshold is increased to three times GDPpc, (iii) 14%-19%
      lower if the discount rate is increased to 6%, and (iv) 36% (95% CI 23%-50%)
      higher if the proportion of EV71-HFMD registered by national surveillance is the 
      same as that observed in the three EV71 vaccine phase III trials. The validity of
      our results relies on the following assumptions: (i) self-reported hospital
      charges are a good proxy for the opportunity cost of care, (ii) the cost and
      health utility loss estimates based on laboratory-confirmed EV71-HFMD cases are
      representative of all EV71-HFMD cases, and (iii) the long-term average risk of
      EV71-HFMD in the future is similar to that registered by national surveillance
      during 2010-2013. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to no vaccination, routine pediatric EV71
      vaccination would be very cost-effective in China if the cost of immunization
      (including all logistical, procurement, and administration costs needed to confer
      5 y of vaccine protection) is below US$12.0-US$18.3, depending on the choice of
      vaccine among the three candidates. Given that the annual number of births in
      China has been around 16 million in recent years, the annual costs for routine
      pediatric EV71 vaccination at this cost range should not exceed US$192-US$293
      million. Our results can be used to determine the optimal vaccine when the prices
      of the three vaccines are known.

TI  - Planned Repeat Cesarean Section at Term and Adverse Childhood Health Outcomes: A 
      Record-Linkage Study.
PG  - e1001973
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001973 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Global cesarean section (CS) rates range from 1% to 52%, with a
      previous CS being the commonest indication. Labour following a previous CS
      carries risk of scar rupture, with potential for offspring hypoxic brain injury, 
      leading to high rates of repeat elective CS. However, the effect of delivery by
      CS on long-term outcomes in children is unclear. Increasing evidence suggests
      that in avoiding exposure to maternal bowel flora during labour or vaginal birth,
      offspring delivered by CS may be adversely affected in terms of energy uptake
      from the gut and immune development, increasing obesity and asthma risks,
      respectively. This study aimed to address the evidence gap on long-term childhood
      outcomes following repeat CS by comparing adverse childhood health outcomes after
      (1) planned repeat CS and (2) unscheduled repeat CS with those that follow
      vaginal birth after CS (VBAC). METHODS AND FINDINGS: A data-linkage cohort study 
      was performed. All second-born, term, singleton offspring delivered between 1
      January 1993 and 31 December 2007 in Scotland, UK, to women with a history of CS 
      (n = 40,145) were followed up until 31 January 2015. Outcomes assessed included
      obesity at age 5 y, hospitalisation with asthma, learning disability, cerebral
      palsy, and death. Cox regression and binary logistic regression were used as
      appropriate to compare outcomes following planned repeat CS (n = 17,919) and
      unscheduled repeat CS (n = 8,847) with those following VBAC (n = 13,379). Risk of
      hospitalisation with asthma was greater following both unscheduled repeat CS
      (3.7% versus 3.3%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.33) and planned
      repeat CS (3.6% versus 3.3%, adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.42) compared with
      VBAC. Learning disability and death were more common following unscheduled repeat
      CS compared with VBAC (3.7% versus 2.3%, adjusted odds ratio 1.64, 95% CI
      1.17-2.29, and 0.5% versus 0.4%, adjusted HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.00-2.25,
      respectively). Risk of obesity at age 5 y and risk of cerebral palsy were similar
      between planned repeat CS or unscheduled repeat CS and VBAC. Study limitations
      include the risk that women undergoing an unscheduled CS had intended to have a
      planned CS, and lack of data on indication for CS, which may confound the
      findings. CONCLUSIONS: Birth by repeat CS, whether planned or unscheduled, was
      associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation with asthma but no
      difference in risk of obesity at age 5 y. Greater risk of death and learning
      disability following unscheduled repeat CS compared to VBAC may reflect
      complications during labour. Further research, including meta-analyses of studies
      of rarer outcomes (e.g., cerebral palsy), are needed to confirm whether such
      risks are similar between delivery groups.

TI  - Length of Stay After Childbirth in 92 Countries and Associated Factors in 30 Low-
      and Middle-Income Countries: Compilation of Reported Data and a Cross-sectional
      Analysis from Nationally Representative Surveys.
PG  - e1001972
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001972 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Following childbirth, women need to stay sufficiently long in health 
      facilities to receive adequate care. Little is known about length of stay
      following childbirth in low- and middle-income countries or its determinants.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We described length of stay after facility delivery in 92
      countries. We then created a conceptual framework of the main drivers of length
      of stay, and explored factors associated with length of stay in 30 countries
      using multivariable linear regression. Finally, we used multivariable logistic
      regression to examine the factors associated with stays that were "too short"
      (<24 h for vaginal deliveries and <72 h for cesarean-section deliveries). Across 
      countries, the mean length of stay ranged from 1.3 to 6.6 d: 0.5 to 6.2 d for
      singleton vaginal deliveries and 2.5 to 9.3 d for cesarean-section deliveries.
      The percentage of women staying too short ranged from 0.2% to 83% for vaginal
      deliveries and from 1% to 75% for cesarean-section deliveries. Our conceptual
      framework identified three broad categories of factors that influenced length of 
      stay: need-related determinants that required an indicated extension of stay, and
      health-system and woman/family dimensions that were drivers of inappropriately
      short or long stays. The factors identified as independently important in our
      regression analyses included cesarean-section delivery, birthweight, multiple
      birth, and infant survival status. Older women and women whose infants were
      delivered by doctors had extended lengths of stay, as did poorer women. Reliance 
      on factors captured in secondary data that were self-reported by women up to 5 y 
      after a live birth was the main limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Length of stay after
      childbirth is very variable between countries. Substantial proportions of women
      stay too short to receive adequate postnatal care. We need to ensure that
      facilities have skilled birth attendants and effective elements of care, but also
      that women stay long enough to benefit from these. The challenge is to commit to 
      achieving adequate lengths of stay in low- and middle-income countries, while
      ensuring any additional time is used to provide high-quality and respectful care.

TI  - Cardiovascular and Renal Outcomes of Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade in Adult
      Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review with Network Meta-Analyses.
PG  - e1001971
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001971 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medications aimed at inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
      have been used extensively for preventing cardiovascular and renal complications 
      in patients with diabetes, but data that compare their clinical effectiveness are
      limited. We aimed to compare the effects of classes of RAS blockers on
      cardiovascular and renal outcomes in adults with diabetes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      Eligible trials were identified by electronic searches in PubMed/MEDLINE and the 
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1 January 2004 to 17 July 2014).
      Interventions of interest were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and direct renin (DR) inhibitors. The
      primary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and
      stroke-singly and as a composite endpoint, major cardiovascular outcome-and
      end-stage renal disease [ESRD], doubling of serum creatinine, and all-cause
      mortality-singly and as a composite endpoint, progression of renal disease.
      Secondary endpoints were angina pectoris and hospitalization for heart failure.
      In all, 71 trials (103,120 participants), with a total of 14 different regimens, 
      were pooled using network meta-analyses. When compared with ACE inhibitor, no
      other RAS blocker used in monotherapy and/or combination was associated with a
      significant reduction in major cardiovascular outcomes: ARB (odds ratio [OR]
      1.02; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.90-1.18), ACE inhibitor plus ARB (0.97; 95%
      CrI 0.79-1.19), DR inhibitor plus ACE inhibitor (1.32; 95% CrI 0.96-1.81), and DR
      inhibitor plus ARB (1.00; 95% CrI 0.73-1.38). For the risk of progression of
      renal disease, no significant differences were detected between ACE inhibitor and
      each of the remaining therapies: ARB (OR 1.10; 95% CrI 0.90-1.40), ACE inhibitor 
      plus ARB (0.97; 95% CrI 0.72-1.29), DR inhibitor plus ACE inhibitor (0.99; 95%
      CrI 0.65-1.57), and DR inhibitor plus ARB (1.18; 95% CrI 0.78-1.84). No
      significant differences were showed between ACE inhibitors and ARBs with respect 
      to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
      angina pectoris, hospitalization for heart failure, ESRD, or doubling serum
      creatinine. Findings were limited by the clinical and methodological
      heterogeneity of the included studies. Potential inconsistency was identified in 
      network meta-analyses of stroke and angina pectoris, limiting the conclusiveness 
      of findings for these single endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with diabetes,
      comparisons of different RAS blockers showed similar effects of ACE inhibitors
      and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Compared with monotherapies,
      the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB failed to provide significant
      benefits on major outcomes. Clinicians should discuss the balance between
      benefits, costs, and potential harms with individual diabetes patients before
      starting treatment. REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42014014404.

TI  - Experimental Treatment with Favipiravir for Ebola Virus Disease (the JIKI Trial):
      A Historically Controlled, Single-Arm Proof-of-Concept Trial in Guinea.
PG  - e1001967
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001967 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a highly lethal condition for which no
      specific treatment has proven efficacy. In September 2014, while the Ebola
      outbreak was at its peak, the World Health Organization released a short list of 
      drugs suitable for EVD research. Favipiravir, an antiviral developed for the
      treatment of severe influenza, was one of these. In late 2014, the conditions for
      starting a randomized Ebola trial were not fulfilled for two reasons. One was the
      perception that, given the high number of patients presenting simultaneously and 
      the very high mortality rate of the disease, it was ethically unacceptable to
      allocate patients from within the same family or village to receive or not
      receive an experimental drug, using a randomization process impossible to
      understand by very sick patients. The other was that, in the context of rumors
      and distrust of Ebola treatment centers, using a randomized design at the outset 
      might lead even more patients to refuse to seek care. Therefore, we chose to
      conduct a multicenter non-randomized trial, in which all patients would receive
      favipiravir along with standardized care. The objectives of the trial were to
      test the feasibility and acceptability of an emergency trial in the context of a 
      large Ebola outbreak, and to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of
      favipiravir in reducing mortality and viral load in patients with EVD. The trial 
      was not aimed at directly informing future guidelines on Ebola treatment but at
      quickly gathering standardized preliminary data to optimize the design of future 
      studies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Inclusion criteria were positive Ebola virus
      reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test, age >/= 1 y, weight >/= 10 kg, ability
      to take oral drugs, and informed consent. All participants received oral
      favipiravir (day 0: 6,000 mg; day 1 to day 9: 2,400 mg/d). Semi-quantitative
      Ebola virus RT-PCR (results expressed in "cycle threshold" [Ct]) and biochemistry
      tests were performed at day 0, day 2, day 4, end of symptoms, day 14, and day 30.
      Frozen samples were shipped to a reference biosafety level 4 laboratory for RNA
      viral load measurement using a quantitative reference technique (genome
      copies/milliliter). Outcomes were mortality, viral load evolution, and adverse
      events. The analysis was stratified by age and Ct value. A "target value" of
      mortality was defined a priori for each stratum, to guide the interpretation of
      interim and final analysis. Between 17 December 2014 and 8 April 2015, 126
      patients were included, of whom 111 were analyzed (adults and adolescents, >/=13 
      y, n = 99; young children, </=6 y, n = 12). Here we present the results obtained 
      in the 99 adults and adolescents. Of these, 55 had a baseline Ct value >/= 20
      (Group A Ct >/= 20), and 44 had a baseline Ct value < 20 (Group A Ct < 20). Ct
      values and RNA viral loads were well correlated, with Ct = 20 corresponding to
      RNA viral load = 7.7 log10 genome copies/ml. Mortality was 20% (95% CI
      11.6%-32.4%) in Group A Ct >/= 20 and 91% (95% CI 78.8%-91.1%) in Group A Ct <
      20. Both mortality 95% CIs included the predefined target value (30% and 85%,
      respectively). Baseline serum creatinine was >/=110 mumol/l in 48% of patients in
      Group A Ct >/= 20 (>/=300 mumol/l in 14%) and in 90% of patients in Group A Ct < 
      20 (>/=300 mumol/l in 44%). In Group A Ct >/= 20, 17% of patients with baseline
      creatinine >/=110 mumol/l died, versus 97% in Group A Ct < 20. In patients who
      survived, the mean decrease in viral load was 0.33 log10 copies/ml per day of
      follow-up. RNA viral load values and mortality were not significantly different
      between adults starting favipiravir within <72 h of symptoms compared to others. 
      Favipiravir was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of an outbreak at its
      peak, with crowded care centers, randomizing patients to receive either standard 
      care or standard care plus an experimental drug was not felt to be appropriate.
      We did a non-randomized trial. This trial reaches nuanced conclusions. On the one
      hand, we do not conclude on the efficacy of the drug, and our conclusions on
      tolerance, although encouraging, are not as firm as they could have been if we
      had used randomization. On the other hand, we learned about how to quickly set up
      and run an Ebola trial, in close relationship with the community and
      non-governmental organizations; we integrated research into care so that it
      improved care; and we generated knowledge on EVD that is useful to further
      research. Our data illustrate the frequency of renal dysfunction and the powerful
      prognostic value of low Ct values. They suggest that drug trials in EVD should
      systematically stratify analyses by baseline Ct value, as a surrogate of viral
      load. They also suggest that favipiravir monotherapy merits further study in
      patients with medium to high viremia, but not in those with very high viremia.

TI  - A Novel Brief Therapy for Patients Who Attempt Suicide: A 24-months Follow-Up
      Randomized Controlled Study of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program
      (ASSIP).
PG  - e1001968
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001968 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attempted suicide is the main risk factor for suicide and repeated
      suicide attempts. However, the evidence for follow-up treatments reducing
      suicidal behavior in these patients is limited. The objective of the present
      study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention
      Program (ASSIP) in reducing suicidal behavior. ASSIP is a novel brief therapy
      based on a patient-centered model of suicidal behavior, with an emphasis on early
      therapeutic alliance. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patients who had recently attempted
      suicide were randomly allocated to treatment as usual (n = 60) or treatment as
      usual plus ASSIP (n = 60). ASSIP participants received three therapy sessions
      followed by regular contact through personalized letters over 24 months.
      Participants considered to be at high risk of suicide were included, 63% were
      diagnosed with an affective disorder, and 50% had a history of prior suicide
      attempts. Clinical exclusion criteria were habitual self-harm, serious cognitive 
      impairment, and psychotic disorder. Study participants completed a set of
      psychosocial and clinical questionnaires every 6 months over a 24-month follow-up
      period. The study represents a real-world clinical setting at an outpatient
      clinic of a university hospital of psychiatry. The primary outcome measure was
      repeat suicide attempts during the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome
      measures were suicidal ideation, depression, and health-care utilization.
      Furthermore, effects of prior suicide attempts, depression at baseline,
      diagnosis, and therapeutic alliance on outcome were investigated. During the
      24-month follow-up period, five repeat suicide attempts were recorded in the
      ASSIP group and 41 attempts in the control group. The rates of participants
      reattempting suicide at least once were 8.3% (n = 5) and 26.7% (n = 16). ASSIP
      was associated with an approximately 80% reduced risk of participants making at
      least one repeat suicide attempt (Wald chi21 = 13.1, 95% CI 12.4-13.7, p <
      0.001). ASSIP participants spent 72% fewer days in the hospital during follow-up 
      (ASSIP: 29 d; control group: 105 d; W = 94.5, p = 0.038). Higher scores of
      patient-rated therapeutic alliance in the ASSIP group were associated with a
      lower rate of repeat suicide attempts. Prior suicide attempts, depression, and a 
      diagnosis of personality disorder at baseline did not significantly affect
      outcome. Participants with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (n =
      20) had more previous suicide attempts and a higher number of reattempts. Key
      study limitations were missing data and dropout rates. Although both were
      generally low, they increased during follow-up. At 24 months, the group
      difference in dropout rate was significant: ASSIP, 7% (n = 4); control, 22% (n = 
      13). A further limitation is that we do not have detailed information of the
      co-active follow-up treatment apart from participant self-reports every 6 months 
      on the setting and the duration of the co-active treatment. CONCLUSIONS: ASSIP, a
      manual-based brief therapy for patients who have recently attempted suicide,
      administered in addition to the usual clinical treatment, was efficacious in
      reducing suicidal behavior in a real-world clinical setting. ASSIP fulfills the
      need for an easy-to-administer low-cost intervention. Large pragmatic trials will
      be needed to conclusively establish the efficacy of ASSIP and replicate our
      findings in other clinical settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

      outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In the context of a multicenter randomized
      controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of IPTp with MQ compared to
      SP in pregnancy carried out in four sub-Saharan countries (Mozambique, Benin,
      Gabon, and Tanzania), 4,247 newborns, 2,815 born to women who received MQ and
      1,432 born to women who received SP for IPTp, were followed up until 12 mo of
      age. Anthropometric parameters and psychomotor development were assessed at 1, 9,
      and 12 mo of age, and the incidence of malaria, anemia, hospital admissions,
      outpatient visits, and mortality were determined until 12 mo of age. No
      significant differences were found in the proportion of infants with stunting,
      underweight, wasting, and severe acute malnutrition at 1, 9, and 12 mo of age
      between infants born to women who were on IPTp with MQ versus SP. Except for
      three items evaluated at 9 mo of age, no significant differences were observed in
      the psychomotor development milestones assessed. Incidence of malaria, anemia,
      hospital admissions, outpatient visits, and mortality were similar between the
      two groups. Information on the outcomes at 12 mo of age was unavailable in 26% of
      the infants, 761 (27%) from the MQ group and 377 (26%) from the SP group. Reasons
      for not completing the study were death (4% of total study population), study
      withdrawal (6%), migration (8%), and loss to follow-up (9%). CONCLUSIONS: No
      significant differences were found between IPTp with MQ and SP administered in
      pregnancy on infant mortality, morbidity, and nutritional outcomes. The poorer
      performance on certain psychomotor development milestones at 9 mo of age in
      children born to women in the MQ group compared to those in the SP group may
      deserve further studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00811421.

TI  - Estimated Effects of Different Alcohol Taxation and Price Policies on Health
      Inequalities: A Mathematical Modelling Study.
PG  - e1001963
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001963 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: While evidence that alcohol pricing policies reduce alcohol-related
      health harm is robust, and alcohol taxation increases are a WHO "best buy"
      intervention, there is a lack of research comparing the scale and distribution
      across society of health impacts arising from alternative tax and price policy
      options. The aim of this study is to test whether four common alcohol taxation
      and pricing strategies differ in their impact on health inequalities. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: An econometric epidemiological model was built with England 2014/2015
      as the setting. Four pricing strategies implemented on top of the current tax
      were equalised to give the same 4.3% population-wide reduction in total
      alcohol-related mortality: current tax increase, a 13.4% all-product duty
      increase under the current UK system; a value-based tax, a 4.0% ad valorem tax
      based on product price; a strength-based tax, a volumetric tax of pound0.22 per
      UK alcohol unit (= 8 g of ethanol); and minimum unit pricing, a minimum price
      threshold of pound0.50 per unit, below which alcohol cannot be sold. Model inputs
      were calculated by combining data from representative household surveys on
      alcohol purchasing and consumption, administrative and healthcare data on 43
      alcohol-attributable diseases, and published price elasticities and relative risk
      functions. Outcomes were annual per capita consumption, consumer spending, and
      alcohol-related deaths. Uncertainty was assessed via partial probabilistic
      sensitivity analysis (PSA) and scenario analysis. The pricing strategies differ
      as to how effects are distributed across the population, and, from a public
      health perspective, heavy drinkers in routine/manual occupations are a key group 
      as they are at greatest risk of health harm from their drinking. Strength-based
      taxation and minimum unit pricing would have greater effects on mortality among
      drinkers in routine/manual occupations (particularly for heavy drinkers, where
      the estimated policy effects on mortality rates are as follows: current tax
      increase, -3.2%; value-based tax, -2.9%; strength-based tax, -6.1%; minimum unit 
      pricing, -7.8%) and lesser impacts among drinkers in professional/managerial
      occupations (for heavy drinkers: current tax increase, -1.3%; value-based tax,
      -1.4%; strength-based tax, +0.2%; minimum unit pricing, +0.8%). Results from the 
      PSA give slightly greater mean effects for both the routine/manual (current tax
      increase, -3.6% [95% uncertainty interval (UI) -6.1%, -0.6%]; value-based tax,
      -3.3% [UI -5.1%, -1.7%]; strength-based tax, -7.5% [UI -13.7%, -3.9%]; minimum
      unit pricing, -10.3% [UI -10.3%, -7.0%]) and professional/managerial occupation
      groups (current tax increase, -1.8% [UI -4.7%, +1.6%]; value-based tax, -1.9% [UI
      -3.6%, +0.4%]; strength-based tax, -0.8% [UI -6.9%, +4.0%]; minimum unit pricing,
      -0.7% [UI -5.6%, +3.6%]). Impacts of price changes on moderate drinkers were
      small regardless of income or socioeconomic group. Analysis of uncertainty shows 
      that the relative effectiveness of the four policies is fairly stable, although
      uncertainty in the absolute scale of effects exists. Volumetric taxation and
      minimum unit pricing consistently outperform increasing the current tax or adding
      an ad valorem tax in terms of reducing mortality among the heaviest drinkers and 
      reducing alcohol-related health inequalities (e.g., in the routine/manual
      occupation group, volumetric taxation reduces deaths more than increasing the
      current tax in 26 out of 30 probabilistic runs, minimum unit pricing reduces
      deaths more than volumetric tax in 21 out of 30 runs, and minimum unit pricing
      reduces deaths more than increasing the current tax in 30 out of 30 runs). Study 
      limitations include reducing model complexity by not considering a largely
      ineffective ban on below-tax alcohol sales, special duty rates covering only
      small shares of the market, and the impact of tax fraud or retailer
      non-compliance with minimum unit prices. CONCLUSIONS: Our model estimates that,
      compared to tax increases under the current system or introducing taxation based 
      on product value, alcohol-content-based taxation or minimum unit pricing would
      lead to larger reductions in health inequalities across income groups. We also
      estimate that alcohol-content-based taxation and minimum unit pricing would have 
      the largest impact on harmful drinking, with minimal effects on those drinking in
      moderation.

TI  - Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in China: Modeling Epidemic Dynamics of Enterovirus
      Serotypes and Implications for Vaccination.
PG  - e1001958
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001958 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness
      caused by serotypes of the Enterovirus A species in the genus Enterovirus of the 
      Picornaviridae family. The disease has had a substantial burden throughout East
      and Southeast Asia over the past 15 y. China reported 9 million cases of HFMD
      between 2008 and 2013, with the two serotypes Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and
      Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) being responsible for the majority of these cases.
      Three recent phase 3 clinical trials showed that inactivated monovalent EV-A71
      vaccines manufactured in China were highly efficacious against HFMD associated
      with EV-A71, but offered no protection against HFMD caused by CV-A16. To better
      inform vaccination policy, we used mathematical models to evaluate the effect of 
      prospective vaccination against EV-A71-associated HFMD and the potential risk of 
      serotype replacement by CV-A16. We also extended the model to address the
      co-circulation, and implications for vaccination, of additional non-EV-A71,
      non-CV-A16 serotypes of enterovirus. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Weekly reports of HFMD
      incidence from 31 provinces in Mainland China from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 
      2013 were used to fit multi-serotype time series susceptible-infected-recovered
      (TSIR) epidemic models. We obtained good model fit for the two-serotype TSIR with
      cross-protection, capturing the seasonality and geographic heterogeneity of
      province-level transmission, with strong correlation between the observed and
      simulated epidemic series. The national estimate of the basic reproduction
      number, R0, weighted by provincial population size, was 26.63 for EV-A71
      (interquartile range [IQR]: 23.14, 30.40) and 27.13 for CV-A16 (IQR: 23.15,
      31.34), with considerable variation between provinces (however, predictions about
      the overall impact of vaccination were robust to this variation). EV-A71
      incidence was projected to decrease monotonically with higher coverage rates of
      EV-A71 vaccination. Across provinces, CV-A16 incidence in the
      post-EV-A71-vaccination period remained either comparable to or only slightly
      increased from levels prior to vaccination. The duration and strength of
      cross-protection following infection with EV-A71 or CV-A16 was estimated to be
      9.95 wk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.31, 23.40) in 68% of the population (95%
      CI: 37%, 96%). Our predictions are limited by the necessarily short and
      under-sampled time series and the possible circulation of unidentified serotypes,
      but, nonetheless, sensitivity analyses indicate that our results are robust in
      predicting that the vaccine should drastically reduce incidence of EV-A71 without
      a substantial competitive release of CV-A16. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of our
      models to capture the observed epidemic cycles suggests that herd immunity is
      driving the epidemic dynamics caused by the multiple serotypes of enterovirus.
      Our results predict that the EV-A71 and CV-A16 serotypes provide a temporary
      immunizing effect against each other. Achieving high coverage rates of EV-A71
      vaccination would be necessary to eliminate the ongoing transmission of EV-A71,
      but serotype replacement by CV-A16 following EV-A71 vaccination is likely to be
      transient and minor compared to the corresponding reduction in the burden of
      EV-A71-associated HFMD. Therefore, a mass EV-A71 vaccination program of infants
      and young children should provide significant benefits in terms of a reduction in
      overall HFMD burden.

TI  - Microenvironmental Heterogeneity Parallels Breast Cancer Progression: A
      Histology-Genomic Integration Analysis.
PG  - e1001961
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001961 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intra-tumor diversity of cancer cells is under intense
      investigation; however, little is known about the heterogeneity of the tumor
      microenvironment that is key to cancer progression and evolution. We aimed to
      assess the degree of microenvironmental heterogeneity in breast cancer and
      correlate this with genomic and clinical parameters. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      developed a quantitative measure of microenvironmental heterogeneity along three 
      spatial dimensions (3-D) in solid tumors, termed the tumor ecosystem diversity
      index (EDI), using fully automated histology image analysis coupled with
      statistical measures commonly used in ecology. This measure was compared with
      disease-specific survival, key mutations, genome-wide copy number, and expression
      profiling data in a retrospective study of 510 breast cancer patients as a test
      set and 516 breast cancer patients as an independent validation set. In
      high-grade (grade 3) breast cancers, we uncovered a striking link between high
      microenvironmental heterogeneity measured by EDI and a poor prognosis that cannot
      be explained by tumor size, genomics, or any other data types. However, this
      association was not observed in low-grade (grade 1 and 2) breast cancers. The
      prognostic value of EDI was superior to known prognostic factors and was enhanced
      with the addition of TP53 mutation status (multivariate analysis test set, p = 9 
      x 10-4, hazard ratio = 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.84; validation set, p = 0.0011, hazard
      ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.26-2.52). Integration with genome-wide profiling data
      identified losses of specific genes on 4p14 and 5q13 that were enriched in grade 
      3 tumors with high microenvironmental diversity that also substratified patients 
      into poor prognostic groups. Limitations of this study include the number of cell
      types included in the model, that EDI has prognostic value only in grade 3
      tumors, and that our spatial heterogeneity measure was dependent on spatial scale
      and tumor size. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to couple 
      unbiased measures of microenvironmental heterogeneity with genomic alterations to
      predict breast cancer clinical outcome. We propose a clinically relevant role of 
      microenvironmental heterogeneity for advanced breast tumors, and highlight that
      ecological statistics can be translated into medical advances for identifying a
      new type of biomarker and, furthermore, for understanding the synergistic
      interplay of microenvironmental heterogeneity with genomic alterations in cancer 
      cells.

TI  - Effect of Short-Term Supplementation with Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food or
      Micronutrients for Children after Illness for Prevention of Malnutrition: A
      Randomised Controlled Trial in Nigeria.
PG  - e1001952
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001952 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) treats more than 300,000
      severely malnourished children annually. Malnutrition is not only caused by lack 
      of food and poor infant and child feeding practices but also by illnesses.
      Breaking the vicious cycle of illness and malnutrition by providing ill children 
      with nutritional supplementation is a potentially powerful strategy for
      preventing malnutrition that has not been adequately investigated. Therefore, MSF
      investigated whether incidence of malnutrition among ill children <5 y old could 
      be reduced by providing a fortified food product or micronutrients during their
      2-wk convalescence period. Two trials, one in Nigeria and one in Uganda, were
      conducted; here we report on the trial that took place in Goronyo, a rural region
      of northwest Nigeria with high morbidity and malnutrition rates. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We investigated the effect of supplementation with ready-to-use
      therapeutic food (RUTF) and a micronutrient powder (MNP) on the incidence of
      malnutrition in ill children presenting at an outpatient clinic in Goronyo during
      February to September 2012. A three-armed, partially-blinded, randomised
      controlled trial was conducted in children diagnosed as having malaria,
      diarrhoea, or lower respiratory tract infection. Children aged 6 to 59 mo were
      randomised to one of three arms: one sachet/d of RUTF; two sachets/d of
      micronutrients or no supplement (control) for 14 d for each illness over 6 mo.
      The primary outcome was the incidence of first negative nutritional outcome (NNO)
      during the 6 mo follow-up. NNO was a study-specific measure used to indicate
      occurrence of malnutrition; it was defined as low weight-for-height z-score (<-2 
      for non-malnourished and <-3 for moderately malnourished children), mid-upper arm
      circumference <115 mm, or oedema, whichever came first. Of the 2,213 randomised
      participants, 50.0% were female and the mean age was 20.2 (standard deviation
      11.2) months; 160 (7.2%) were lost to follow-up, 54 (2.4%) were admitted to
      hospital, and 29 (1.3%) died. The incidence rates of NNO for the RUTF, MNP, and
      control groups were 0.522 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.442-0.617), 0.495 
      (0.415-0.589), and 0.566 (0.479-0.668) first events/y, respectively. The
      incidence rate ratio was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74-1.15; p = 0.471) for RUTF versus
      control; 0.87 (0.70-1.10; p = 0.242) for MNP versus control and 1.06 (0.84-1.33, 
      p = 0.642) for RUTF versus MNP. A subgroup analysis showed no interaction nor
      confounding, nor a different effectiveness of supplementation, among children who
      were moderately malnourished compared with non-malnourished at enrollment. The
      average number of study illnesses for the RUTF, MNP, and control groups were 4.2 
      (95% CI, 4.0-4.3), 3.4 (3.2-3.6), and 3.6 (3.4-3.7). The proportion of children
      who died in the RUTF, MNP, and control groups were 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3-1.8), 1.8%
      (1.0-3.3), and 1.4% (0.7-2.8). CONCLUSIONS: A 2-wk supplementation with RUTF or
      MNP to ill children as part of routine primary medical care did not reduce the
      incidence of malnutrition. The lack of effect in Goronyo may be due to a high
      frequency of morbidity, which probably further affects a child's nutritional
      status and children's ability to escape from the illness-malnutrition cycle. The 
      duration of the supplementation may have been too short or the doses of the
      supplements may have been too low to mitigate the effects of high morbidity and
      pre-existing malnutrition. An integrated approach combining prevention and
      treatment of diseases and treatment of moderate malnutrition, rather than
      prevention of malnutrition by nutritional supplementation alone, might be more
      effective in reducing the incidence of acute malnutrition in ill children. TRIAL

      malnutrition, more than half (58%) of the population in the district of Kaabong
      is considered food insecure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigated the effect of 
      two types of nutritional supplementation on the incidence of malnutrition in ill 
      children presenting at outpatient clinics during March 2011 to April 2012 in
      Kaabong, Karamoja region, Uganda, a resource-poor region where malnutrition is a 
      chronic problem for its seminomadic population. A three-armed, partially-blinded,
      randomised controlled trial was conducted in children diagnosed with malaria,
      diarrhoea, or lower respiratory tract infection. Non-malnourished children aged 6
      to 59 mo were randomised to one of three arms: one sachet/d of ready-to-use
      therapeutic food (RUTF), two sachets/d of micronutrient powder (MNP), or no
      supplement (control) for 14 d for each illness over 6 mo. The primary outcome was
      the incidence of first negative nutritional outcome (NNO) during the 6 mo
      follow-up. NNO was a study-specific measure used to indicate progression to
      moderate or severe acute malnutrition; it was defined as weight-for-height
      z-score <-2, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <115 mm, or oedema, whichever
      came first. Of the 2,202 randomised participants, 51.2% were girls, and the mean 
      age was 25.2 (+/-13.8) mo; 148 (6.7%) participants were lost to follow-up, 9
      (0.4%) died, and 14 (0.6%) were admitted to hospital. The incidence rates of NNO 
      (first event/year) for the RUTF, MNP, and control groups were 0.143 (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.107-0.191), 0.185 (0.141-0.239), and 0.213
      (0.167-0.272), respectively. The incidence rate ratio was 0.67 (95% CI,
      0.46-0.98; p = 0.037) for RUTF versus control; a reduction of 33.3%. The
      incidence rate ratio was 0.86 (0.61-1.23; p = 0.413) for MNP versus control and
      0.77 for RUTF versus MNP (95% CI 0.52-1.15; p = 0.200). The average numbers of
      study illnesses for the RUTF, MNP, and control groups were 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2-2.4),
      2.1 (2.0-2.3), and 2.3 (2.2-2.5). The proportions of children who died in the
      RUTF, MNP, and control groups were 0%, 0.8%, and 0.4%. The findings apply to ill 
      but not malnourished children and cannot be generalised to a general population
      including children who are not necessarily ill or who are already malnourished.
      CONCLUSIONS: A 2-wk nutrition supplementation programme with RUTF as part of
      routine primary medical care to non-malnourished children with malaria, LRTI, or 
      diarrhoea proved effective in preventing malnutrition in eastern Uganda. The low 
      incidence of malnutrition in this population may warrant a more targeted
      intervention to improve cost effectiveness. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Risk of Injurious Fall and Hip Fracture up to 26 y before the Diagnosis of
      Parkinson Disease: Nested Case-Control Studies in a Nationwide Cohort.
PG  - e1001954
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low muscle strength has been found in late adolescence in individuals
      diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD) 30 y later. This study investigated whether
      this lower muscle strength also may translate into increased risks of falling and
      fracture before the diagnosis of PD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Among all Swedish
      citizens aged >/=50 y in 2005, two nested case-control cohorts were compiled. In 
      cohort I, individuals diagnosed with PD during 1988-2012 (n = 24,412) were
      matched with up to ten controls (n = 243,363), and the risk of fall-related
      injuries before diagnosis of PD was evaluated. In cohort II, individuals with an 
      injurious fall in need of emergency care during 1988-2012 (n = 622,333) were
      matched with one control (n = 622,333), and the risk of PD after the injurious
      fall was evaluated. In cohort I, 18.0% of cases and 11.5% of controls had at
      least one injurious fall (p < 0.001) prior to PD diagnosis in the case. Assessed 
      by conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for comorbid diagnoses and
      education level, PD was associated with increased risks of injurious fall up to
      10 y before diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31; 7 to <10 y before 
      diagnosis) and hip fracture >/=15 y before diagnosis (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.10-1.69; 
      15-26 y before diagnosis). In cohort II, 0.7% of individuals with an injurious
      fall and 0.5% of controls were diagnosed with PD during follow-up (p < 0.001).
      The risk of PD was increased for up to 10 y after an injurious fall (OR 1.18, 95%
      CI 1.02-1.37; 7 to <10 y after diagnosis). An important limitation is that the
      diagnoses were obtained from registers and could not be clinically confirmed for 
      the study. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risks of falling and hip fracture prior to 
      the diagnosis of PD may suggest the presence of clinically relevant
      neurodegenerative impairment many years before the diagnosis of this disease.

TI  - Strategies to Prevent Cholera Introduction during International Personnel
      Deployments: A Computational Modeling Analysis Based on the 2010 Haiti Outbreak.
PG  - e1001947
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001947 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Introduction of Vibrio cholerae to Haiti during the deployment of
      United Nations (UN) peacekeepers in 2010 resulted in one of the largest cholera
      epidemics of the modern era. Following the outbreak, a UN-commissioned
      independent panel recommended three pre-deployment intervention strategies to
      minimize the risk of cholera introduction in future peacekeeping operations:
      screening for V. cholerae carriage, administering prophylactic antimicrobial
      chemotherapies, or immunizing with oral cholera vaccines. However, uncertainty
      regarding the effectiveness of these approaches has forestalled their
      implementation by the UN. We assessed how the interventions would have impacted
      the likelihood of the Haiti cholera epidemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed 
      a stochastic model for cholera importation and transmission, fitted to reported
      cases during the first weeks of the 2010 outbreak in Haiti. Using this model, we 
      estimated that diagnostic screening reduces the probability of cases occurring by
      82% (95% credible interval: 75%, 85%); however, false-positive test outcomes may 
      hamper this approach. Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis at time of departure and
      oral cholera vaccination reduce the probability of cases by 50% (41%, 57%) and by
      up to 61% (58%, 63%), respectively. Chemoprophylaxis beginning 1 wk before
      departure confers a 91% (78%, 96%) reduction independently, and up to a 98%
      reduction (94%, 99%) if coupled with vaccination. These results are not sensitive
      to assumptions about the background cholera incidence rate in the endemic
      troop-sending country. Further research is needed to (1) validate the sensitivity
      and specificity of rapid test approaches for detecting asymptomatic carriage, (2)
      compare prophylactic efficacy across antimicrobial regimens, and (3) quantify the
      impact of oral cholera vaccine on transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
      CONCLUSIONS: Screening, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccination are all effective
      strategies to prevent cholera introduction during large-scale personnel
      deployments such as that precipitating the 2010 Haiti outbreak. Antimicrobial
      chemoprophylaxis was estimated to provide the greatest protection at the lowest
      cost among the approaches recently evaluated by the UN.

TI  - Pharmaceutical Industry Off-label Promotion and Self-regulation: A Document
      Analysis of Off-label Promotion Rulings by the United Kingdom Prescription
      Medicines Code of Practice Authority 2003-2012.
PG  - e1001945
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001945 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: European Union law prohibits companies from marketing drugs
      off-label. In the United Kingdom--as in some other European countries, but unlike
      the United States--industry self-regulatory bodies are tasked with supervising
      compliance with marketing rules. The objectives of this study were to (1)
      characterize off-label promotion rulings in the UK compared to the
      whistleblower-initiated cases in the US and (2) shed light on the UK
      self-regulatory mechanism for detecting, deterring, and sanctioning off-label
      promotion. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted structured reviews of rulings by
      the UK self-regulatory authority, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice
      Authority (PMCPA), between 2003 and 2012. There were 74 off-label promotion
      rulings involving 43 companies and 65 drugs. Nineteen companies were ruled in
      breach more than once, and ten companies were ruled in breach three or more times
      over the 10-y period. Drawing on a typology previously developed to analyse US
      whistleblower complaints, we coded and analysed the apparent strategic goals of
      each off-label marketing scheme and the practices consistent with those alleged
      goals. 50% of rulings cited efforts to expand drug use to unapproved indications,
      and 39% and 38% cited efforts to expand beyond approved disease entities and
      dosing strategies, respectively. The most frequently described promotional tactic
      was attempts to influence prescribers (n = 72, 97%), using print material (70/72,
      97%), for example, advertisements (21/70, 30%). Although rulings cited
      prescribers as the prime target of off-label promotion, competing companies
      lodged the majority of complaints (prescriber: n = 16, 22%, versus companies: n =
      42, 57%). Unlike US whistleblower complaints, few UK rulings described practices 
      targeting consumers (n = 3, 4%), payers (n = 2, 3%), or company staff (n = 2,
      3%). Eight UK rulings (11%) pertaining to six drugs described promotion of the
      same drug for the same off-label use as was alleged by whistleblowers in the US. 
      However, while the UK cases typically related to only one or a few claims made in
      printed material, several complaints in the US alleged multifaceted and covert
      marketing activities. Because this study is limited to PMCPA rulings and
      whistleblower-initiated federal cases, it may offer a partial view of exposed
      off-label marketing. CONCLUSION: The UK self-regulatory system for exposing
      marketing violations relies largely on complaints from company outsiders, which
      may explain why most off-label promotion rulings relate to plainly visible
      promotional activities such as advertising. This contrasts with the US, where
      Department of Justice investigations and whistleblower testimony have alleged
      complex off-label marketing campaigns that remain concealed to company outsiders.
      UK authorities should consider introducing increased incentives and protections
      for whistleblowers combined with US-style governmental investigations and
      meaningful sanctions. UK prescribers should be attentive to, and increasingly
      report, off-label promotion.

TI  - Evidence for Community Transmission of Community-Associated but Not
      Health-Care-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Strains Linked
      to Social and Material Deprivation: Spatial Analysis of Cross-sectional Data.
PG  - e1001944
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001944 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying and tackling the social determinants of infectious
      diseases has become a public health priority following the recognition that
      individuals with lower socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by
      infectious diseases. In many parts of the world, epidemiologically and
      genotypically defined community-associated (CA) methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains have emerged to become frequent causes of
      hospital infection. The aim of this study was to use spatial models with
      adjustment for area-level hospital attendance to determine the transmission niche
      of genotypically defined CA- and health-care-associated (HA)-MRSA strains across 
      a diverse region of South East London and to explore a potential link between
      MRSA carriage and markers of social and material deprivation. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: This study involved spatial analysis of cross-sectional data linked
      with all MRSA isolates identified by three National Health Service (NHS)
      microbiology laboratories between 1 November 2011 and 29 February 2012. The
      cohort of hospital-based NHS microbiology diagnostic services serves 867,254
      usual residents in the Lambeth, Southwark, and Lewisham boroughs in South East
      London, United Kingdom (UK). Isolates were classified as HA- or CA-MRSA based on 
      whole genome sequencing. All MRSA cases identified over 4 mo within the
      three-borough catchment area (n = 471) were mapped to small geographies and
      linked to area-level aggregated socioeconomic and demographic data. Disease
      mapping and ecological regression models were used to infer the most likely
      transmission niches for each MRSA genetic classification and to describe the
      spatial epidemiology of MRSA in relation to social determinants. Specifically, we
      aimed to identify demographic and socioeconomic population traits that explain
      cross-area extra variation in HA- and CA-MRSA relative risks following adjustment
      for hospital attendance data. We explored the potential for associations with the
      English Indices of Deprivation 2010 (including the Index of Multiple Deprivation 
      and several deprivation domains and subdomains) and the 2011 England and Wales
      census demographic and socioeconomic indicators (including numbers of households 
      by deprivation dimension) and indicators of population health. Both CA-and
      HA-MRSA were associated with household deprivation (CA-MRSA relative risk [RR]:
      1.72 [1.03-2.94]; HA-MRSA RR: 1.57 [1.06-2.33]), which was correlated with
      hospital attendance (Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] = 0.76). HA-MRSA was
      also associated with poor health (RR: 1.10 [1.01-1.19]) and residence in communal
      care homes (RR: 1.24 [1.12-1.37]), whereas CA-MRSA was linked with household
      overcrowding (RR: 1.58 [1.04-2.41]) and wider barriers, which represent a
      combined score for household overcrowding, low income, and homelessness (RR: 1.76
      [1.16-2.70]). CA-MRSA was also associated with recent immigration to the UK (RR: 
      1.77 [1.19-2.66]). For the area-level variation in RR for CA-MRSA, 28.67% was
      attributable to the spatial arrangement of target geographies, compared with only
      0.09% for HA-MRSA. An advantage to our study is that it provided a representative
      sample of usual residents receiving care in the catchment areas. A limitation is 
      that relationships apparent in aggregated data analyses cannot be assumed to
      operate at the individual level. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of community 
      transmission of HA-MRSA strains, implying that HA-MRSA cases identified in the
      community originate from the hospital reservoir and are maintained by frequent
      attendance at health care facilities. In contrast, there was a high risk of
      CA-MRSA in deprived areas linked with overcrowding, homelessness, low income, and
      recent immigration to the UK, which was not explainable by health care exposure. 
      Furthermore, areas adjacent to these deprived areas were themselves at greater
      risk of CA-MRSA, indicating community transmission of CA-MRSA. This ongoing
      community transmission could lead to CA-MRSA becoming the dominant strain types
      carried by patients admitted to hospital, particularly if successful
      hospital-based MRSA infection control programmes are maintained. These results
      suggest that community infection control programmes targeting transmission of
      CA-MRSA will be required to control MRSA in both the community and hospital.
      These epidemiological changes will also have implications for effectiveness of
      risk-factor-based hospital admission MRSA screening programmes.

TI  - Preventing Weight Gain in Women in Rural Communities: A Cluster Randomised
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1001941
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001941 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in both developed and
      developing countries. Even modest weight gain increases the risk for chronic
      illness, yet evidence-based interventions to prevent weight gain are rare. This
      trial will determine if a simple low-intensity intervention can prevent weight
      gain in women compared to general health information. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      conducted a 1-yr pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial in 41 Australian 
      towns (clusters) randomised using a computer-generated randomisation list for
      intervention (n = 21) or control (n = 20). Women aged 18 to 50 yr were recruited 
      from the general population to receive a 1-yr self-management lifestyle
      intervention (HeLP-her) consisting of one group session, monthly SMS text
      messages, one phone coaching session, and a program manual, or to a control group
      receiving one general women's health education session. From October 2012 to
      April 2014 we studied 649 women, mean age 39.6 yr (+/- SD 6.7) and BMI of 28.8
      kg/m(2) (+/- SD 6.9) with the primary outcome weight change between groups at 1
      yr. The mean change in the control was +0.44 kg (95% CI -0.09 to 0.97) and in the
      intervention group -0.48 kg (95% CI -0.99 to 0.03) with an unadjusted between
      group difference of -0.92 kg (95% CI -1.67 to -0.16) or -0.87 kg (95% CI -1.62 to
      -0.13) adjusted for baseline values and clustering. Secondary outcomes included
      improved diet quality and greater self-management behaviours. The intervention
      appeared to be equally efficacious across all age, BMI, income, and education
      subgroups. Loss to follow-up included 23.8% in the intervention group and 21.8%
      in the control group and was within the anticipated range. Limitations include
      lack of sensitive tools to measure the small changes to energy intake and
      physical activity. Those who gained weight may have been less inclined to return 
      for 1 yr weight measures. CONCLUSIONS: A low intensity lifestyle program can
      prevent the persistent weight gain observed in women. Key features included
      community integration, nonprescriptive simple health messages, small changes to
      behaviour, low participant burden, self-weighing, and delivery including a mix of
      group, phone, and SMS text reminders. The findings support population strategies 
      to halt the rise in obesity prevalence.

TI  - Intimate Partner Violence and Depression Symptom Severity among South African
      Women during Pregnancy and Postpartum: Population-Based Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001943
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Violence against women by intimate partners remains unacceptably
      common worldwide. The evidence base for the assumed psychological impacts of
      intimate partner violence (IPV) is derived primarily from studies conducted in
      high-income countries. A recently published systematic review identified 13
      studies linking IPV to incident depression, none of which were conducted in
      sub-Saharan Africa. To address this gap in the literature, we analyzed
      longitudinal data collected during the course of a 3-y cluster-randomized trial
      with the aim of estimating the association between IPV and depression symptom
      severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a secondary analysis of
      population-based, longitudinal data collected from 1,238 pregnant women during a 
      3-y cluster-randomized trial of a home visiting intervention in Cape Town, South 
      Africa. Surveys were conducted at baseline, 6 mo, 18 mo, and 36 mo (85%
      retention). The primary explanatory variable of interest was exposure to four
      types of physical IPV in the past year. Depression symptom severity was measured 
      using the Xhosa version of the ten-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. In 
      a pooled cross-sectional multivariable regression model adjusting for potentially
      confounding time-fixed and time-varying covariates, lagged IPV intensity had a
      statistically significant association with depression symptom severity
      (regression coefficient b = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.61-1.47), with estimates from a
      quantile regression model showing greater adverse impacts at the upper end of the
      conditional depression distribution. Fitting a fixed effects regression model
      accounting for all time-invariant confounding (e.g., history of childhood sexual 
      abuse) yielded similar findings (b = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13-1.96). The magnitudes of 
      the coefficients indicated that a one-standard-deviation increase in IPV
      intensity was associated with a 12.3% relative increase in depression symptom
      severity over the same time period. The most important limitations of our study
      include exposure assessment that lacked measurement of sexual violence, which
      could have caused us to underestimate the severity of exposure; the extended
      latency period in the lagged analysis, which could have caused us to
      underestimate the strength of the association; and outcome assessment that was
      limited to the use of a screening instrument for depression symptom severity.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this secondary analysis of data from a population-based, 3-y
      cluster-randomized controlled trial, IPV had a statistically significant
      association with depression symptom severity. The estimated associations were
      relatively large in magnitude, consistent with findings from high-income
      countries, and robust to potential confounding by time-invariant factors.
      Intensive health sector responses to reduce IPV and improve women's mental health
      should be explored.

TI  - Intramuscular Artesunate for Severe Malaria in African Children: A Multicenter
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e1001938
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current artesunate (ARS) regimens for severe malaria are complex.
      Once daily intramuscular (i.m.) injection for 3 d would be simpler and more
      appropriate for remote health facilities than the current WHO-recommended regimen
      of five intravenous (i.v.) or i.m. injections over 4 d. We compared both a
      three-dose i.m. and a three-dose i.v. parenteral ARS regimen with the standard
      five-dose regimen using a non-inferiority design (with non-inferiority margins of
      10%). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This randomized controlled trial included children
      (0.5-10 y) with severe malaria at seven sites in five African countries to assess
      whether the efficacy of simplified three-dose regimens is non-inferior to a
      five-dose regimen. We randomly allocated 1,047 children to receive a total dose
      of 12 mg/kg ARS as either a control regimen of five i.m. injections of 2.4 mg/kg 
      (at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) (n = 348) or three injections of 4 mg/kg (at 0, 24, 
      and 48 h) either i.m. (n = 348) or i.v. (n = 351), both of which were the
      intervention arms. The primary endpoint was the proportion of children with >/=
      99% reduction in parasitemia at 24 h from admission values, measured by
      microscopists who were blinded to the group allocations. Primary analysis was
      performed on the per-protocol population, which was 96% of the intention-to-treat
      population. Secondary analyses included an analysis of host and parasite
      genotypes as risks for prolongation of parasite clearance kinetics, measured
      every 6 h, and a Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare parasite clearance kinetics
      between treatment groups. A post hoc analysis was performed for delayed anemia,
      defined as hemoglobin </= 7 g/dl 7 d or more after admission. The per-protocol
      population was 1,002 children (five-dose i.m.: n = 331; three-dose i.m.: n = 338;
      three-dose i.v.: n = 333); 139 participants were lost to follow-up. In the
      three-dose i.m. arm, 265/338 (78%) children had a >/= 99% reduction in
      parasitemia at 24 h compared to 263/331 (79%) receiving the five-dose i.m.
      regimen, showing non-inferiority of the simplified three-dose regimen to the
      conventional five-dose regimen (95% CI -7, 5; p = 0.02). In the three-dose i.v.
      arm, 246/333 (74%) children had >/= 99% reduction in parasitemia at 24 h; hence, 
      non-inferiority of this regimen to the five-dose control regimen was not shown
      (95% CI -12, 1; p = 0.24). Delayed parasite clearance was associated with the
      N86YPfmdr1 genotype. In a post hoc analysis, 192/885 (22%) children developed
      delayed anemia, an adverse event associated with increased leukocyte counts.
      There was no observed difference in delayed anemia between treatment arms. A
      potential limitation of the study is its open-label design, although the primary 
      outcome measures were assessed in a blinded manner. CONCLUSIONS: A simplified
      three-dose i.m. regimen for severe malaria in African children is non-inferior to
      the more complex WHO-recommended regimen. Parenteral ARS is associated with a
      risk of delayed anemia in African children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pan African

TI  - Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis Discontinuation among Antiretroviral-Treated
      HIV-1-Infected Adults in Kenya: A Randomized Non-inferiority Trial.
PG  - e1001934
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001934 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cotrimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis is recommended by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) for HIV-1-infected individuals in settings with high
      infectious disease prevalence. The WHO 2006 guidelines were developed prior to
      the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The threshold for CTX
      discontinuation following ART is undefined in resource-limited settings. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: Between 1 February 2012 and 30 September 2013, we conducted an
      unblinded non-inferiority randomized controlled trial of CTX prophylaxis
      cessation versus continuation among HIV-1-infected adults on ART for >/= 18 mo
      with CD4 count > 350 cells/mm3 in a malaria-endemic region in Kenya. Participants
      were randomized and followed up at 3-mo intervals for 12 mo. The primary endpoint
      was a composite of morbidity (malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea) and mortality.
      Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regression. Among 538
      ART-treated adults screened, 500 were enrolled and randomized, 250 per arm.
      Median age was 40 y, 361 (72%) were women, and 442 (88%) reported
      insecticide-treated bednet use. Combined morbidity/mortality was significantly
      higher in the CTX discontinuation arm (IRR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.52-3.38; p < 0.001), 
      driven by malaria morbidity. There were 34 cases of malaria, with 33 in the CTX
      discontinuation arm (IRR = 33.02, 95% CI 4.52-241.02; p = 0.001). Diarrhea and
      pneumonia rates did not differ significantly between arms (IRR = 1.36, 95% CI
      0.82-2.27, and IRR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.54-3.75, respectively). Study limitations
      include a lack of placebo and a lower incidence of morbidity events than
      expected. CONCLUSIONS: CTX discontinuation among ART-treated,
      immune-reconstituted adults in a malaria-endemic region resulted in increased
      incidence of malaria but not pneumonia or diarrhea. Malaria endemicity may be the
      most relevant factor to consider in the decision to stop CTX after ART-induced
      immune reconstitution in regions with high infectious disease prevalence. These
      data support the 2014 WHO CTX guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      NCT01425073.

TI  - Association between Regimen Composition and Treatment Response in Patients with
      Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001932
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001932 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), the World
      Health Organization (WHO) recommends a regimen of at least four second-line drugs
      that are likely to be effective as well as pyrazinamide. WHO guidelines indicate 
      only marginal benefit for regimens based directly on drug susceptibility testing 
      (DST) results. Recent evidence from isolated cohorts suggests that regimens
      containing more drugs may be beneficial, and that DST results are predictive of
      regimen effectiveness. The objective of our study was to gain insight into how
      regimen design affects treatment response by analyzing the association between
      time to sputum culture conversion and both the number of potentially effective
      drugs included in a regimen and the DST results of the drugs in the regimen.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data from the Preserving Effective Tuberculosis
      Treatment Study (PETTS), a prospective observational study of 1,659 adults
      treated for MDR TB during 2005-2010 in nine countries: Estonia, Latvia, Peru,
      Philippines, Russian Federation, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan.
      For all patients, monthly sputum samples were collected, and DST was performed on
      baseline isolates at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We
      included 1,137 patients in our analysis based on their having known baseline DST 
      results for at least fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs, and not
      having extensively drug-resistant TB. These patients were followed for a median
      of 20 mo (interquartile range 16-23 mo) after MDR TB treatment initiation. The
      primary outcome of interest was initial sputum culture conversion. We used Cox
      proportional hazards regression, stratifying by country to control for
      setting-associated confounders, and adjusting for the number of drugs to which
      patients' baseline isolates were resistant, baseline resistance pattern, previous
      treatment history, sputum smear result, and extent of disease on chest
      radiograph. In multivariable analysis, receiving an average of at least six
      potentially effective drugs (defined as drugs without a DST result indicating
      resistance) per day was associated with a 36% greater likelihood of sputum
      culture conversion than receiving an average of at least five but fewer than six 
      potentially effective drugs per day (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.36, 95% CI
      1.09-1.69). Inclusion of pyrazinamide (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.65-2.41) or more drugs 
      to which baseline DST indicated susceptibility (aHR 1.65, 95% CI 1.48-1.84, per
      drug) in regimens was associated with greater increases in the likelihood of
      sputum culture conversion than including more drugs to which baseline DST
      indicated resistance (aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18-1.51, per drug). Including in the
      regimen more drugs for which DST was not performed was beneficial only if a
      minimum of three effective drugs was present in the regimen (aHR 1.39, 95% CI
      1.09-1.76, per drug when three effective drugs present in regimen). The main
      limitation of this analysis is that it is based on observational data, not a
      randomized trial, and drug regimens varied across sites. However, PETTS was a
      uniquely large and rigorous observational study in terms of both the number of
      patients enrolled and the standardization of laboratory testing. Other
      limitations include the assumption of equivalent efficacy across drugs in a
      category, incomplete data on adherence, and the fact that the analysis considers 
      only initial sputum culture conversion, not reversion or long-term relapse.
      CONCLUSIONS: MDR TB regimens including more potentially effective drugs than the 
      minimum of five currently recommended by WHO may encourage improved response to
      treatment in patients with MDR TB. Rapid access to high-quality DST results could
      facilitate the design of more effective individualized regimens. Randomized
      controlled trials are necessary to confirm whether individualized regimens with
      more than five drugs can indeed achieve better cure rates than current
      recommended regimens.

TI  - 10-y Risks of Death and Emergency Re-admission in Adolescents Hospitalised with
      Violent, Drug- or Alcohol-Related, or Self-Inflicted Injury: A Population-Based
      Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001931
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001931 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitalisation for adversity-related injury (violent,
      drug/alcohol-related, or self-inflicted injury) has been described as a
      "teachable moment", when intervention may reduce risks of further harm. Which
      adolescents are likely to benefit most from intervention strongly depends on
      their long-term risks of harm. We compared 10-y risks of mortality and
      re-admission after adversity-related injury with risks after accident-related
      injury. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed National Health Service admissions data
      for England (1 April 1997-31 March 2012) for 10-19 y olds with emergency
      admissions for adversity-related injury (violent, drug/alcohol-related, or
      self-inflicted injury; n = 333,009) or for accident-related injury (n = 649,818).
      We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression to estimate and compare 10-y
      post-discharge risks of death and emergency re-admission. Among adolescents
      discharged after adversity-related injury, one in 137 girls and one in 64 boys
      died within 10 y, and 54.2% of girls and 40.5% of boys had an emergency
      re-admission, with rates being highest for 18-19 y olds. Risks of death were
      higher than in adolescents discharged after accident-related injury (girls:
      age-adjusted hazard ratio 1.61, 95% CI 1.43-1.82; boys: 2.13, 95% CI 1.98-2.29), 
      as were risks of re-admission (girls: 1.76, 95% CI 1.74-1.79; boys: 1.41, 95% CI 
      1.39-1.43). Risks of death and re-admission were increased after all combinations
      of violent, drug/alcohol-related, and self-inflicted injury, but particularly
      after any drug/alcohol-related or self-inflicted injury (i.e., with/without
      violent injury), for which age-adjusted hazard ratios for death in boys ranged
      from 1.67 to 5.35, compared with 1.25 following violent injury alone (girls: 1.09
      to 3.25, compared with 1.27). The main limitation of the study was
      under-recording of adversity-related injuries and misclassification of these
      cases as accident-related injuries. This misclassification would attenuate the
      relative risks of death and re-admission for adversity-related compared with
      accident-related injury. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents discharged after an admission
      for violent, drug/alcohol-related, or self-inflicted injury have increased risks 
      of subsequent harm up to a decade later. Introduction of preventive strategies
      for reducing subsequent harm after admission should be considered for all types
      of adversity-related injury, particularly for older adolescents.

TI  - Bariatric Surgery in the United Kingdom: A Cohort Study of Weight Loss and
      Clinical Outcomes in Routine Clinical Care.
PG  - e1001925
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001925 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is becoming a more widespread treatment for
      obesity. Comprehensive evidence of the long-term effects of contemporary surgery 
      on a broad range of clinical outcomes in large populations treated in routine
      clinical practice is lacking. The objective of this study was to measure the
      association between bariatric surgery, weight, body mass index, and
      obesity-related co-morbidities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was an observational
      retrospective cohort study using data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice
      Research Datalink. All 3,882 patients registered in the database and with
      bariatric surgery on or before 31 December 2014 were included and matched by
      propensity score to 3,882 obese patients without surgery. The main outcome
      measures were change in weight and body mass index over 4 y; incident diagnoses
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction
      (MI), stroke, fractures, obstructive sleep apnoea, and cancer; mortality; and
      resolution of hypertension and T2DM. Weight measures were available for 3,847
      patients between 1 and 4 mo, 2,884 patients between 5 and 12 mo, and 2,258
      patients between 13 and 48 mo post-procedure. Bariatric surgery patients
      exhibited rapid weight loss for the first four postoperative months, at a rate of
      4.98 kg/mo (95% CI 4.88-5.08). Slower weight loss was sustained to the end of 4
      y. Gastric bypass (6.56 kg/mo) and sleeve gastrectomy (6.29 kg/mo) were
      associated with greater initial weight reduction than gastric banding (2.77
      kg/mo). Protective hazard ratios (HRs) were detected for bariatric surgery for
      incident T2DM, 0.68 (95% CI 0.55-0.83); hypertension, 0.35 (95% CI 0.27-0.45);
      angina, 0.59 (95% CI 0.40-0.87);MI, 0.28 (95% CI 0.10-0.74); and obstructive
      sleep apnoea, 0.55 (95% CI 0.40-0.87). Strong associations were found between
      bariatric surgery and the resolution of T2DM, with a HR of 9.29 (95% CI
      6.84-12.62), and between bariatric surgery and the resolution of hypertension,
      with a HR of 5.64 (95% CI 2.65-11.99). No association was detected between
      bariatric surgery and fractures, cancer, or stroke. Effect estimates for
      mortality found no protective association with bariatric surgery overall, with a 
      HR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.66-1.43). The data used were recorded for the management of 
      patients in primary care and may be subject to inaccuracy, which would tend to
      lead to underestimates of true relative effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric
      surgery as delivered in the UK healthcare system is associated with dramatic
      weight loss, sustained at least 4 y after surgery. This weight loss is
      accompanied by substantial improvements in pre-existing T2DM and hypertension, as
      well as a reduced risk of incident T2DM, hypertension, angina, MI, and
      obstructive sleep apnoea. Widening the availability of bariatric surgery could
      lead to substantial health benefits for many people who are morbidly obese.

TI  - Risks and Benefits of Nalmefene in the Treatment of Adult Alcohol Dependence: A
      Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis of Published and Unpublished
      Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - e1001924
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nalmefene is a recent option in alcohol dependence treatment. Its
      approval was controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
      the aggregated data (registered as PROSPERO 2014:CRD42014014853) to compare the
      harm/benefit of nalmefene versus placebo or active comparator in this indication.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Three reviewers searched for published and unpublished
      studies in Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current
      Controlled Trials, and bibliographies and by mailing pharmaceutical companies,
      the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the US Food and Drug Administration.
      Double-blind randomized clinical trials evaluating nalmefene to treat adult
      alcohol dependence, irrespective of the comparator, were included if they
      reported (1) health outcomes (mortality, accidents/injuries, quality of life,
      somatic complications), (2) alcohol consumption outcomes, (3) biological
      outcomes, or (4) treatment safety outcomes, at 6 mo and/or 1 y. Three authors
      independently screened the titles and abstracts of the trials identified.
      Relevant trials were evaluated in full text. The reviewers independently assessed
      the included trials for methodological quality using the Cochrane Collaboration
      tool for assessing risk of bias. On the basis of the I2 index or the Cochrane's Q
      test, fixed or random effect models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs), mean
      differences (MDs), or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. In
      sensitivity analyses, outcomes for participants who were lost to follow-up were
      included using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF); for binary measures, 
      patients lost to follow-up were considered equal to failures (i.e., non-assessed 
      patients were recorded as not having responded in both groups). Five randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) versus placebo, with a total of 2,567 randomized
      participants, were included in the main analysis. None of these studies was
      performed in the specific population defined by the EMA approval of nalmefene,
      i.e., adults with alcohol dependence who consume more than 60 g of alcohol per
      day (for men) or more than 40 g per day (for women). No RCT compared nalmefene
      with another medication. Mortality at 6 mo (RR = 0.39, 95% CI [0.08; 2.01]) and 1
      y (RR = 0.98, 95% CI [0.04; 23.95]) and quality of life at 6 mo (SF-36 physical
      component summary score: MD = 0.85, 95% CI [-0.32; 2.01]; SF-36 mental component 
      summary score: MD = 1.01, 95% CI [-1.33; 3.34]) were not different across groups.
      Other health outcomes were not reported. Differences were encountered for alcohol
      consumption outcomes such as monthly number of heavy drinking days at 6 mo (MD = 
      -1.65, 95% CI [-2.41; -0.89]) and at 1 y (MD = -1.60, 95% CI [-2.85; -0.35]) and 
      total alcohol consumption at 6 mo (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.30; -0.10]). An
      attrition bias could not be excluded, with more withdrawals for nalmefene than
      for placebo, including more withdrawals for safety reasons at both 6 mo (RR =
      3.65, 95% CI [2.02; 6.63]) and 1 y (RR = 7.01, 95% CI [1.72; 28.63]). Sensitivity
      analyses showed no differences for alcohol consumption outcomes between nalmefene
      and placebo, but the weight of these results should not be overestimated, as the 
      BOCF approach to managing withdrawals was used. CONCLUSIONS: The value of
      nalmefene for treatment of alcohol addiction is not established. At best,
      nalmefene has limited efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption.

      Discharged from a Safety-Net Hospital: A Propensity-Score-Balanced Retrospective 
      Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001922
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001922 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is accepted as
      safe and effective for medically stable patients to complete intravenous (IV)
      antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Since, however, uninsured patients in the
      United States generally cannot afford OPAT, safety-net hospitals are often
      burdened with long hospitalizations purely to infuse antibiotics, occupying beds 
      that could be used for patients requiring more intensive services. OPAT is
      generally delivered in one of four settings: infusion centers, nursing homes, at 
      home with skilled nursing assistance, or at home with self-administered therapy. 
      The first three-termed healthcare-administered OPAT (H-OPAT)--are most commonly
      used in the United States by patients with insurance funding. The
      fourth--self-administered OPAT (S-OPAT)--is relatively uncommon, with the few
      published studies having been conducted in the United Kingdom. With
      multidisciplinary planning, we established an S-OPAT clinic in 2009 to shift care
      of selected uninsured patients safely to self-administration of their IV
      antibiotics at home. We undertook this study to determine whether the low-income 
      mostly non-English-speaking patients in our S-OPAT program could administer their
      own IV antimicrobials at home with outcomes as good as, or better than, those
      receiving H-OPAT. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Parkland Hospital is a safety-net
      hospital serving Dallas County, Texas. From 1 January 2009 to 14 October 2013,
      all uninsured patients meeting criteria were enrolled in S-OPAT, while insured
      patients were discharged to H-OPAT settings. The S-OPAT patients were trained
      through multilingual instruction to self-administer IV antimicrobials by gravity,
      tested for competency before discharge, and thereafter followed at designated
      intervals in the S-OPAT outpatient clinic for IV access care, laboratory
      monitoring, and physician follow-up. The primary outcome was 30-d all-cause
      readmission, and the secondary outcome was 1-y all-cause mortality. The study was
      adequately powered for readmission but not for mortality. Clinical,
      sociodemographic, and outcome data were collected from the Parkland Hospital
      electronic medical records and the US census, constituting a historical
      prospective cohort study. We used multivariable logistic regression to develop a 
      propensity score predicting S-OPAT versus H-OPAT group membership from
      covariates. We then estimated the effect of S-OPAT versus H-OPAT on the two
      outcomes using multivariable proportional hazards regression, controlling for
      selection bias and confounding with the propensity score and covariates. Of the
      1,168 patients discharged to receive OPAT, 944 (81%) were managed in the S-OPAT
      program and 224 (19%) by H-OPAT services. In multivariable proportional hazards
      regression models controlling for confounding and selection bias, the 30-d
      readmission rate was 47% lower in the S-OPAT group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 
      0.53; 95% CI 0.35-0.81; p = 0.003), and the 1-y mortality rate did not differ
      significantly between the groups (aHR, 0.86; 95% CI 0.37-2.00; p = 0.73). The
      S-OPAT program shifted a median 26 d of inpatient infusion per patient to the
      outpatient setting, avoiding 27,666 inpatient days. The main limitation of this
      observational study-the potential bias from the difference in healthcare funding 
      status of the groups-was addressed by propensity score modeling. CONCLUSIONS:
      S-OPAT was associated with similar or better clinical outcomes than H-OPAT.
      S-OPAT may be an acceptable model of treatment for uninsured, medically stable
      patients to complete extended courses of IV antimicrobials at home.

TI  - Acute Cardiovascular Events after Herpes Zoster: A Self-Controlled Case Series
      Analysis in Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Older Residents of the United States.
PG  - e1001919
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster is common and can have serious consequences.
      Additionally, emerging data suggest an increased risk of acute cardiovascular
      events following herpes zoster. However, to our knowledge, existing association
      studies compare outcomes between individuals and are therefore vulnerable to
      between-person confounding. In this study, we used a within-person study design
      to quantify any short-term increased risk of acute cardiovascular events (stroke 
      and myocardial infarction [MI]) after zoster and to assess whether zoster
      vaccination modifies this association. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The self-controlled 
      case series method was used to estimate rates of stroke and acute MI in defined
      periods after herpes zoster compared to other time periods, within individuals.
      Participants were fully eligible Medicare beneficiaries aged >/= 65 y with a
      herpes zoster diagnosis and either an ischemic stroke (n = 42,954) or MI (n =
      24,237) between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011. Age-adjusted incidence
      ratios (IRs) for stroke and MI during predefined periods up to 12 mo after zoster
      relative to unexposed time periods were calculated using conditional Poisson
      regression. We observed a marked increase in the rate of acute cardiovascular
      events in the first week after zoster diagnosis: a 2.4-fold increased ischemic
      stroke rate (IR 2.37, 95% CI 2.17-2.59) and a 1.7-fold increased MI rate (IR
      1.68, 95% CI 1.47-1.92), followed by a gradual resolution over 6 mo. Zoster
      vaccination did not appear to modify the association with MI (interaction p-value
      = 0.44). We also found no evidence for a difference in the IR for ischemic stroke
      between vaccinated (IR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75-1.74) and unvaccinated (IR 1.78, 95% CI 
      1.68-1.88) individuals during the first 4 wk after zoster diagnosis (interaction 
      p-value = 0.28). The relatively few vaccinated individuals limited the study's
      power to assess the role of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke and MI rates are
      transiently increased after exposure to herpes zoster. We found no evidence for a
      role of zoster vaccination in these associations. These findings enhance our
      understanding of the temporality and magnitude of the association between zoster 
      and acute cardiovascular events.

TI  - Traditional and Emerging Lifestyle Risk Behaviors and All-Cause Mortality in
      Middle-Aged and Older Adults: Evidence from a Large Population-Based Australian
      Cohort.
PG  - e1001917
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001917 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle risk behaviors are responsible for a large proportion of
      disease burden worldwide. Behavioral risk factors, such as smoking, poor diet,
      and physical inactivity, tend to cluster within populations and may have
      synergistic effects on health. As evidence continues to accumulate on emerging
      lifestyle risk factors, such as prolonged sitting and unhealthy sleep patterns,
      incorporating these new risk factors will provide clinically relevant information
      on combinations of lifestyle risk factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using data from 
      a large Australian cohort of middle-aged and older adults, this is the first
      study to our knowledge to examine a lifestyle risk index incorporating sedentary 
      behavior and sleep in relation to all-cause mortality. Baseline data (February
      2006- April 2009) were linked to mortality registration data until June 15, 2014.
      Smoking, high alcohol intake, poor diet, physical inactivity, prolonged sitting, 
      and unhealthy (short/long) sleep duration were measured by questionnaires and
      summed into an index score. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used with the
      index score and each unique risk combination as exposure variables, adjusted for 
      socio-demographic characteristics. During 6 y of follow-up of 231,048
      participants for 1,409,591 person-years, 15,635 deaths were registered. Of all
      participants, 31.2%, 36.9%, 21.4%, and 10.6% reported 0, 1, 2, and 3+ risk
      factors, respectively. There was a strong relationship between the lifestyle risk
      index score and all-cause mortality. The index score had good predictive validity
      (c index = 0.763), and the partial population attributable risk was 31.3%. Out of
      all 96 possible risk combinations, the 30 most commonly occurring combinations
      accounted for more than 90% of the participants. Among those, combinations
      involving physical inactivity, prolonged sitting, and/or long sleep duration and 
      combinations involving smoking and high alcohol intake had the strongest
      associations with all-cause mortality. Limitations of the study include
      self-reported and under-specified measures, dichotomized risk scores, lack of
      long-term patterns of lifestyle behaviors, and lack of cause-specific mortality
      data. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors could reduce the risk
      for death from all causes. Specific combinations of lifestyle risk behaviors may 
      be more harmful than others, suggesting synergistic relationships among risk
      factors.

TI  - A Molecular Host Response Assay to Discriminate Between Sepsis and
      Infection-Negative Systemic Inflammation in Critically Ill Patients: Discovery
      and Validation in Independent Cohorts.
PG  - e1001916
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001916 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation is a whole body reaction having an
      infection-positive (i.e., sepsis) or infection-negative origin. It is important
      to distinguish between these two etiologies early and accurately because this has
      significant therapeutic implications for critically ill patients. We hypothesized
      that a molecular classifier based on peripheral blood RNAs could be discovered
      that would (1) determine which patients with systemic inflammation had sepsis,
      (2) be robust across independent patient cohorts, (3) be insensitive to disease
      severity, and (4) provide diagnostic utility. The goal of this study was to
      identify and validate such a molecular classifier. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      conducted an observational, non-interventional study of adult patients recruited 
      from tertiary intensive care units (ICUs). Biomarker discovery utilized an
      Australian cohort (n = 105) consisting of 74 cases (sepsis patients) and 31
      controls (post-surgical patients with infection-negative systemic inflammation)
      recruited at five tertiary care settings in Brisbane, Australia, from June 3,
      2008, to December 22, 2011. A four-gene classifier combining CEACAM4, LAMP1,
      PLA2G7, and PLAC8 RNA biomarkers was identified. This classifier, designated
      SeptiCyte Lab, was validated using reverse transcription quantitative PCR and
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in five cohorts (n = 345) 
      from the Netherlands. Patients for validation were selected from the Molecular
      Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis study (ClinicalTrials.gov,
      NCT01905033), which recruited ICU patients from the Academic Medical Center in
      Amsterdam and the University Medical Center Utrecht. Patients recruited from
      November 30, 2012, to August 5, 2013, were eligible for inclusion in the present 
      study. Validation cohort 1 (n = 59) consisted entirely of unambiguous cases and
      controls; SeptiCyte Lab gave an area under curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-1.00)
      in this cohort. ROC curve analysis of an independent, more heterogeneous group of
      patients (validation cohorts 2-5; 249 patients after excluding 37 patients with
      an infection likelihood of "possible") gave an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.93).
      Disease severity, as measured by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score
      or Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score, was not a
      significant confounding variable. The diagnostic utility of SeptiCyte Lab was
      evaluated by comparison to various clinical and laboratory parameters available
      to a clinician within 24 h of ICU admission. SeptiCyte Lab was significantly
      better at differentiating cases from controls than all tested parameters, both
      singly and in various logistic combinations, and more than halved the diagnostic 
      error rate compared to procalcitonin in all tested cohorts and cohort
      combinations. Limitations of this study relate to (1) cohort compositions that do
      not perfectly reflect the composition of the intended use population, (2)
      potential biases that could be introduced as a result of the current lack of a
      gold standard for diagnosing sepsis, and (3) lack of a complete, unbiased
      comparison to C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: SeptiCyte Lab is a rapid molecular
      assay that may be clinically useful in managing ICU patients with systemic
      inflammation. Further study in population-based cohorts is needed to validate
      this assay for clinical use.

TI  - World Health Organization Global Estimates and Regional Comparisons of the Burden
      of Foodborne Disease in 2010.
PG  - e1001923
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001923 [doi]
AB  - Illness and death from diseases caused by contaminated food are a constant threat
      to public health and a significant impediment to socio-economic development
      worldwide. To measure the global and regional burden of foodborne disease (FBD), 
      the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Foodborne Disease Burden
      Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which here reports their first estimates of 
      the incidence, mortality, and disease burden due to 31 foodborne hazards. We find
      that the global burden of FBD is comparable to those of the major infectious
      diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The most frequent causes of
      foodborne illness were diarrheal disease agents, particularly norovirus and
      Campylobacter spp. Diarrheal disease agents, especially non-typhoidal Salmonella 
      enterica, were also responsible for the majority of deaths due to FBD. Other
      major causes of FBD deaths were Salmonella Typhi, Taenia solium and hepatitis A
      virus. The global burden of FBD caused by the 31 hazards in 2010 was 33 million
      Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs); children under five years old bore 40% of
      this burden. The 14 subregions, defined on the basis of child and adult
      mortality, had considerably different burdens of FBD, with the greatest falling
      on the subregions in Africa, followed by the subregions in South-East Asia and
      the Eastern Mediterranean D subregion. Some hazards, such as non-typhoidal S.
      enterica, were important causes of FBD in all regions of the world, whereas
      others, such as certain parasitic helminths, were highly localised. Thus, the
      burden of FBD is borne particularly by children under five years old-although
      they represent only 9% of the global population-and people living in low-income
      regions of the world. These estimates are conservative, i.e., underestimates
      rather than overestimates; further studies are needed to address the data gaps
      and limitations of the study. Nevertheless, all stakeholders can contribute to
      improvements in food safety throughout the food chain by incorporating these
      estimates into policy development at national and international levels.

TI  - World Health Organization Estimates of the Global and Regional Disease Burden of 
      22 Foodborne Bacterial, Protozoal, and Viral Diseases, 2010: A Data Synthesis.
PG  - e1001921
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foodborne diseases are important worldwide, resulting in considerable
      morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, we present the first global and
      regional estimates of the disease burden of the most important foodborne
      bacterial, protozoal, and viral diseases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We synthesized
      data on the number of foodborne illnesses, sequelae, deaths, and Disability
      Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), for all diseases with sufficient data to support
      global and regional estimates, by age and region. The data sources included
      varied by pathogen and included systematic reviews, cohort studies, surveillance 
      studies and other burden of disease assessments. We sought relevant data circa
      2010, and included sources from 1990-2012. The number of studies per pathogen
      ranged from as few as 5 studies for bacterial intoxications through to 494
      studies for diarrheal pathogens. To estimate mortality for Mycobacterium bovis
      infections and morbidity and mortality for invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella
      enterica infections, we excluded cases attributed to HIV infection. We excluded
      stillbirths in our estimates. We estimate that the 22 diseases included in our
      study resulted in two billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.5-2.9 billion)
      cases, over one million (95% UI 0.89-1.4 million) deaths, and 78.7 million (95%
      UI 65.0-97.7 million) DALYs in 2010. To estimate the burden due to contaminated
      food, we then applied proportions of infections that were estimated to be
      foodborne from a global expert elicitation. Waterborne transmission of disease
      was not included. We estimate that 29% (95% UI 23-36%) of cases caused by
      diseases in our study, or 582 million (95% UI 401-922 million), were transmitted 
      by contaminated food, resulting in 25.2 million (95% UI 17.5-37.0 million) DALYs.
      Norovirus was the leading cause of foodborne illness causing 125 million (95% UI 
      70-251 million) cases, while Campylobacter spp. caused 96 million (95% UI 52-177 
      million) foodborne illnesses. Of all foodborne diseases, diarrheal and invasive
      infections due to non-typhoidal S. enterica infections resulted in the highest
      burden, causing 4.07 million (95% UI 2.49-6.27 million) DALYs. Regionally, DALYs 
      per 100,000 population were highest in the African region followed by the South
      East Asian region. Considerable burden of foodborne disease is borne by children 
      less than five years of age. Major limitations of our study include data gaps,
      particularly in middle- and high-mortality countries, and uncertainty around the 
      proportion of diseases that were foodborne. CONCLUSIONS: Foodborne diseases
      result in a large disease burden, particularly in children. Although it is known 
      that diarrheal diseases are a major burden in children, we have demonstrated for 
      the first time the importance of contaminated food as a cause. There is a need to
      focus food safety interventions on preventing foodborne diseases, particularly in
      low- and middle-income settings.

TI  - World Health Organization Estimates of the Global and Regional Disease Burden of 
      11 Foodborne Parasitic Diseases, 2010: A Data Synthesis.
PG  - e1001920
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001920 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foodborne diseases are globally important, resulting in considerable 
      morbidity and mortality. Parasitic diseases often result in high burdens of
      disease in low and middle income countries and are frequently transmitted to
      humans via contaminated food. This study presents the first estimates of the
      global and regional human disease burden of 10 helminth diseases and
      toxoplasmosis that may be attributed to contaminated food. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      Data were abstracted from 16 systematic reviews or similar studies published
      between 2010 and 2015; from 5 disease data bases accessed in 2015; and from 79
      reports, 73 of which have been published since 2000, 4 published between 1995 and
      2000 and 2 published in 1986 and 1981. These included reports from national
      surveillance systems, journal articles, and national estimates of foodborne
      diseases. These data were used to estimate the number of infections, sequelae,
      deaths, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), by age and region for 2010.
      These parasitic diseases, resulted in 48.4 million cases (95% Uncertainty
      intervals [UI] of 43.4-79.0 million) and 59,724 (95% UI 48,017-83,616) deaths
      annually resulting in 8.78 million (95% UI 7.62-12.51 million) DALYs. We
      estimated that 48% (95% UI 38%-56%) of cases of these parasitic diseases were
      foodborne, resulting in 76% (95% UI 65%-81%) of the DALYs attributable to these
      diseases. Overall, foodborne parasitic disease, excluding enteric protozoa,
      caused an estimated 23.2 million (95% UI 18.2-38.1 million) cases and 45,927 (95%
      UI 34,763-59,933) deaths annually resulting in an estimated 6.64 million (95% UI 
      5.61-8.41 million) DALYs. Foodborne Ascaris infection (12.3 million cases, 95% UI
      8.29-22.0 million) and foodborne toxoplasmosis (10.3 million cases, 95% UI
      7.40-14.9 million) were the most common foodborne parasitic diseases. Human
      cysticercosis with 2.78 million DALYs (95% UI 2.14-3.61 million), foodborne
      trematodosis with 2.02 million DALYs (95% UI 1.65-2.48 million) and foodborne
      toxoplasmosis with 825,000 DALYs (95% UI 561,000-1.26 million) resulted in the
      highest burdens in terms of DALYs, mainly due to years lived with disability.
      Foodborne enteric protozoa, reported elsewhere, resulted in an additional 67.2
      million illnesses or 492,000 DALYs. Major limitations of our study include often 
      substantial data gaps that had to be filled by imputation and suffer from the
      uncertainties that surround such models. Due to resource limitations it was also 
      not possible to consider all potentially foodborne parasites (for example
      Trypanosoma cruzi). CONCLUSIONS: Parasites are frequently transmitted to humans
      through contaminated food. These estimates represent an important step forward in
      understanding the impact of foodborne diseases globally and regionally. The
      disease burden due to most foodborne parasites is highly focal and results in
      significant morbidity and mortality among vulnerable populations.

TI  - Inequalities in Alcohol-Related Mortality in 17 European Countries: A
      Retrospective Analysis of Mortality Registers.
PG  - e1001909
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities in alcohol-related mortality have been
      documented in several European countries, but it is unknown whether the magnitude
      of these inequalities differs between countries and whether these inequalities
      increase or decrease over time. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected and harmonized
      data on mortality from four alcohol-related causes (alcoholic psychosis,
      dependence, and abuse; alcoholic cardiomyopathy; alcoholic liver cirrhosis; and
      accidental poisoning by alcohol) by age, sex, education level, and occupational
      class in 20 European populations from 17 different countries, both for a recent
      period and for previous points in time, using data from mortality registers.
      Mortality was age-standardized using the European Standard Population, and
      measures for both relative and absolute inequality between low and high
      socioeconomic groups (as measured by educational level and occupational class)
      were calculated. Rates of alcohol-related mortality are higher in lower
      educational and occupational groups in all countries. Both relative and absolute 
      inequalities are largest in Eastern Europe, and Finland and Denmark also have
      very large absolute inequalities in alcohol-related mortality. For example, for
      educational inequality among Finnish men, the relative index of inequality is 3.6
      (95% CI 3.3-4.0) and the slope index of inequality is 112.5 (95% CI 106.2-118.8) 
      deaths per 100,000 person-years. Over time, the relative inequality in
      alcohol-related mortality has increased in many countries, but the main change is
      a strong rise of absolute inequality in several countries in Eastern Europe
      (Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia) and Northern Europe (Finland, Denmark) because of a
      rapid rise in alcohol-related mortality in lower socioeconomic groups. In some of
      these countries, alcohol-related causes now account for 10% or more of the
      socioeconomic inequality in total mortality. Because our study relies on
      routinely collected underlying causes of death, it is likely that our results
      underestimate the true extent of the problem. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-related
      conditions play an important role in generating inequalities in total mortality
      in many European countries. Countering increases in alcohol-related mortality in 
      lower socioeconomic groups is essential for reducing inequalities in mortality.
      Studies of why such increases have not occurred in countries like France,
      Switzerland, Spain, and Italy can help in developing evidence-based policies in
      other European countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The case fatality ratio (CFR) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) can vary
      over time and space for reasons that are not fully understood. This makes it
      difficult to define the baseline CFRs needed to evaluate treatments in the
      absence of randomized controls. Here, we investigate whether viremia in EVD
      patients may be used to evaluate baseline EVD CFRs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      analyzed the laboratory and epidemiological records of patients with EVD
      confirmed by reverse transcription PCR hospitalized in the Conakry area, Guinea, 
      between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015. We used viremia and other variables to
      model the CFR. Data for 699 EVD patients were analyzed. In the week following
      symptom onset, mean viremia remained stable, and the CFR increased with viremia, 
      V, from 21% (95% CI 16%-27%) for low viremia (V < 104.4 copies/ml) to 53% (95% CI
      44%-61%) for intermediate viremia (104.4 </= V < 105.2 copies/ml) and 81% (95% CI
      75%-87%) for high viremia (V >/= 105.2 copies/ml). Compared to adults (15-44 y
      old [y.o.]), the CFR was larger in young children (0-4 y.o.) (odds ratio [OR]:
      2.44; 95% CI 1.02-5.86) and older adults (>/= 45 y.o.) (OR: 2.84; 95% CI
      1.81-4.46) but lower in children (5-14 y.o.) (OR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.86). An
      order of magnitude increase in mean viremia in cases after July 2014 compared to 
      those before coincided with a 14% increase in the CFR. Our findings come from a
      large hospital-based study in Conakry and may not be generalizable to settings
      with different case profiles, such as with individuals who never sought care.
      CONCLUSIONS: Viremia in EVD patients was a strong predictor of death that partly 
      explained variations in CFR in the study population. This study provides baseline
      CFRs by viremia group, which allow appropriate adjustment when estimating
      efficacy in treatment studies. In randomized controlled trials, stratifying
      analysis on viremia groups could reduce sample size requirements by 25%. We
      hypothesize that monitoring the viremia of hospitalized patients may inform the
      ability of surveillance systems to detect EVD patients from the different
      severity strata.

TI  - The HIV Treatment Gap: Estimates of the Financial Resources Needed versus
      Available for Scale-Up of Antiretroviral Therapy in 97 Countries from 2015 to
      2020.
PG  - e1001907; discussion e1001907
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001907 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) released revised guidelines in
      2015 recommending that all people living with HIV, regardless of CD4 count,
      initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) upon diagnosis. However, few studies have
      projected the global resources needed for rapid scale-up of ART. Under the Health
      Policy Project, we conducted modeling analyses for 97 countries to estimate
      eligibility for and numbers on ART from 2015 to 2020, along with the
      facility-level financial resources required. We compared the estimated financial 
      requirements to estimated funding available. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Current
      coverage levels and future need for treatment were based on country-specific
      epidemiological and demographic data. Simulated annual numbers of individuals on 
      treatment were derived from three scenarios: (1) continuation of countries'
      current policies of eligibility for ART, (2) universal adoption of aspects of the
      WHO 2013 eligibility guidelines, and (3) expanded eligibility as per the WHO 2015
      guidelines and meeting the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS "90-90-90" 
      ART targets. We modeled uncertainty in the annual resource requirements for
      antiretroviral drugs, laboratory tests, and facility-level personnel and
      overhead. We estimate that 25.7 (95% CI 25.5, 26.0) million adults and 1.57 (95% 
      CI 1.55, 1.60) million children could receive ART by 2020 if countries maintain
      current eligibility plans and increase coverage based on historical rates, which 
      may be ambitious. If countries uniformly adopt aspects of the WHO 2013
      guidelines, 26.5 (95% CI 26.0 27.0) million adults and 1.53 (95% CI 1.52, 1.55)
      million children could be on ART by 2020. Under the 90-90-90 scenario, 30.4 (95% 
      CI 30.1, 30.7) million adults and 1.68 (95% CI 1.63, 1.73) million children could
      receive treatment by 2020. The facility-level financial resources needed for
      scaling up ART in these countries from 2015 to 2020 are estimated to be US$45.8
      (95% CI 45.4, 46.2) billion under the current scenario, US$48.7 (95% CI 47.8,
      49.6) billion under the WHO 2013 scenario, and US$52.5 (95% CI 51.4, 53.6)
      billion under the 90-90-90 scenario. After projecting recent external and
      domestic funding trends, the estimated 6-y financing gap ranges from US$19.8
      billion to US$25.0 billion, depending on the costing scenario and the U.S.
      President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief contribution level, with the gap for
      ART commodities alone ranging from US$14.0 to US$16.8 billion. The study is
      limited by excluding above-facility and other costs essential to ART service
      delivery and by the availability and quality of country- and region-specific
      data. CONCLUSIONS: The projected number of people receiving ART across three
      scenarios suggests that countries are unlikely to meet the 90-90-90 treatment
      target (81% of people living with HIV on ART by 2020) unless they adopt a
      test-and-offer approach and increase ART coverage. Our results suggest that
      future resource needs for ART scale-up are smaller than stated elsewhere but
      still significantly threaten the sustainability of the global HIV response
      without additional resource mobilization from domestic or innovative financing
      sources or efficiency gains. As the world moves towards adopting the WHO 2015
      guidelines, advances in technology, including the introduction of lower-cost,
      highly effective antiretroviral regimens, whose value are assessed here, may
      prove to be "game changers" that allow more people to be on ART with the
      resources available.

TI  - Mass HIV Treatment and Sex Disparities in Life Expectancy: Demographic
      Surveillance in Rural South Africa.
PG  - e1001905; discussion e1001905
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001905 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women have better patient outcomes in HIV care and treatment than men
      in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed--at the population level--whether and to what 
      extent mass HIV treatment is associated with changes in sex disparities in adult 
      life expectancy, a summary metric of survival capturing mortality across the full
      cascade of HIV care. We also determined sex-specific trends in HIV mortality and 
      the distribution of HIV-related deaths in men and women prior to and at each
      stage of the clinical cascade. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected on all
      deaths occurring from 2001 to 2011 in a large population-based surveillance
      cohort (52,964 women and 45,688 men, ages 15 y and older) in rural KwaZulu-Natal,
      South Africa. Cause of death was ascertained by verbal autopsy (93% response
      rate). Demographic data were linked at the individual level to clinical records
      from the public sector HIV treatment and care program that serves the region.
      Annual rates of HIV-related mortality were assessed for men and women separately,
      and female-to-male rate ratios were estimated in exponential hazard models.
      Sex-specific trends in adult life expectancy and HIV-cause-deleted adult life
      expectancy were calculated. The proportions of HIV deaths that accrued to men and
      women at different stages in the HIV cascade of care were estimated annually.
      Following the beginning of HIV treatment scale-up in 2004, HIV mortality declined
      among both men and women. Female adult life expectancy increased from 51.3 y (95%
      CI 49.7, 52.8) in 2003 to 64.5 y (95% CI 62.7, 66.4) in 2011, a gain of 13.2 y.
      Male adult life expectancy increased from 46.9 y (95% CI 45.6, 48.2) in 2003 to
      55.9 y (95% CI 54.3, 57.5) in 2011, a gain of 9.0 y. The gap between female and
      male adult life expectancy doubled, from 4.4 y in 2003 to 8.6 y in 2011, a
      difference of 4.3 y (95% CI 0.9, 7.6). For women, HIV mortality declined from
      1.60 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI 1.46, 1.75) in 2003 to 0.56 per 100
      person-years (95% CI 0.48, 0.65) in 2011. For men, HIV-related mortality declined
      from 1.71 per 100 person-years (95% CI 1.55, 1.88) to 0.76 per 100 person-years
      (95% CI 0.67, 0.87) in the same period. The female-to-male rate ratio for HIV
      mortality declined from 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.07) in 2003 to 0.73 (95% CI
      0.60-0.89) in 2011, a statistically significant decline (p = 0.046). In 2011, 57%
      and 41% of HIV-related deaths occurred among men and women, respectively, who had
      never sought care for HIV in spite of the widespread availability of free HIV
      treatment. The results presented here come from a poor rural setting in southern 
      Africa with high HIV prevalence and high HIV treatment coverage; broader
      generalizability is unknown. Additionally, factors other than HIV treatment
      scale-up may have influenced population mortality trends. CONCLUSIONS: Mass HIV
      treatment has been accompanied by faster declines in HIV mortality among women
      than men and a growing female-male disparity in adult life expectancy at the
      population level. In 2011, over half of male HIV deaths occurred in men who had
      never sought clinical HIV care. Interventions to increase HIV testing and linkage
      to care among men are urgently needed.

TI  - Selection of an HLA-C*03:04-Restricted HIV-1 p24 Gag Sequence Variant Is
      Associated with Viral Escape from KIR2DL3+ Natural Killer Cells: Data from an
      Observational Cohort in South Africa.
PG  - e1001900; discussion e1001900
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001900 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viruses can evade immune surveillance, but the underlying mechanisms 
      are insufficiently understood. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms by
      which natural killer (NK) cells recognize HIV-1-infected cells and how this virus
      can evade NK-cell-mediated immune pressure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two sequence
      mutations in p24 Gag associated with the presence of specific KIR/HLA combined
      genotypes were identified in HIV-1 clade C viruses from a large cohort of
      infected, untreated individuals in South Africa (n = 392), suggesting viral
      escape from KIR+ NK cells through sequence variations within HLA class
      I-presented epitopes. One sequence polymorphism at position 303 of p24 Gag
      (TGag303V), selected for in infected individuals with both KIR2DL3 and
      HLA-C*03:04, enabled significantly better binding of the inhibitory KIR2DL3
      receptor to HLA-C*03:04-expressing cells presenting this variant epitope compared
      to the wild-type epitope (wild-type mean 18.01 +/- 10.45 standard deviation [SD] 
      and variant mean 44.67 +/- 14.42 SD, p = 0.002). Furthermore, activation of
      primary KIR2DL3+ NK cells from healthy donors in response to HLA-C*03:04+ target 
      cells presenting the variant epitope was significantly reduced in comparison to
      cells presenting the wild-type sequence (wild-type mean 0.78 +/- 0.07 standard
      error of the mean [SEM] and variant mean 0.63 +/- 0.07 SEM, p = 0.012).
      Structural modeling and surface plasmon resonance of KIR/peptide/HLA interactions
      in the context of the different viral sequence variants studied supported these
      results. Future studies will be needed to assess processing and antigen
      presentation of the investigated HIV-1 epitope in natural infection, and the
      consequences for viral control. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide novel insights
      into how viruses can evade NK cell immunity through the selection of mutations in
      HLA-presented epitopes that enhance binding to inhibitory NK cell receptors.
      Better understanding of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 evades NK-cell-mediated
      immune pressure and the functional validation of a structural modeling approach
      will facilitate the development of novel targeted immune interventions to harness
      the antiviral activities of NK cells.

TI  - The PneuCarriage Project: A Multi-Centre Comparative Study to Identify the Best
      Serotyping Methods for Examining Pneumococcal Carriage in Vaccine Evaluation
      Studies.
PG  - e1001903; discussion e1001903
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001903 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pneumococcus is a diverse pathogen whose primary niche is the
      nasopharynx. Over 90 different serotypes exist, and nasopharyngeal carriage of
      multiple serotypes is common. Understanding pneumococcal carriage is essential
      for evaluating the impact of pneumococcal vaccines. Traditional serotyping
      methods are cumbersome and insufficient for detecting multiple serotype carriage,
      and there are few data comparing the new methods that have been developed over
      the past decade. We established the PneuCarriage project, a large, international 
      multi-centre study dedicated to the identification of the best pneumococcal
      serotyping methods for carriage studies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Reference sample
      sets were distributed to 15 research groups for blinded testing. Twenty
      pneumococcal serotyping methods were used to test 81 laboratory-prepared (spiked)
      samples. The five top-performing methods were used to test 260 nasopharyngeal
      (field) samples collected from children in six high-burden countries. Sensitivity
      and positive predictive value (PPV) were determined for the test methods and the 
      reference method (traditional serotyping of >100 colonies from each sample). For 
      the alternate serotyping methods, the overall sensitivity ranged from 1% to 99%
      (reference method 98%), and PPV from 8% to 100% (reference method 100%), when
      testing the spiked samples. Fifteen methods had >/=70% sensitivity to detect the 
      dominant (major) serotype, whilst only eight methods had >/=70% sensitivity to
      detect minor serotypes. For the field samples, the overall sensitivity ranged
      from 74.2% to 95.8% (reference method 93.8%), and PPV from 82.2% to 96.4%
      (reference method 99.6%). The microarray had the highest sensitivity (95.8%) and 
      high PPV (93.7%). The major limitation of this study is that not all of the
      available alternative serotyping methods were included. CONCLUSIONS: Most methods
      were able to detect the dominant serotype in a sample, but many performed poorly 
      in detecting the minor serotype populations. Microarray with a culture
      amplification step was the top-performing method. Results from this comprehensive
      evaluation will inform future vaccine evaluation and impact studies, particularly
      in low-income settings, where pneumococcal disease burden remains high.

TI  - Venous Thrombosis Risk after Cast Immobilization of the Lower Extremity:
      Derivation and Validation of a Clinical Prediction Score, L-TRiP(cast), in Three 
      Population-Based Case-Control Studies.
PG  - e1001899; discussion e1001899
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001899 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines and clinical practice vary considerably with respect to
      thrombosis prophylaxis during plaster cast immobilization of the lower extremity.
      Identifying patients at high risk for the development of venous thromboembolism
      (VTE) would provide a basis for considering individual thromboprophylaxis use and
      planning treatment studies. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the
      predictive value of genetic and environmental risk factors, levels of coagulation
      factors, and other biomarkers for the occurrence of VTE after cast immobilization
      of the lower extremity and (2) to develop a clinical prediction tool for the
      prediction of VTE in plaster cast patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data
      from a large population-based case-control study (MEGA study, 4,446 cases with
      VTE, 6,118 controls without) designed to identify risk factors for a first VTE.
      Cases were recruited from six anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands between 
      1999 and 2004; controls were their partners or individuals identified via random 
      digit dialing. Identification of predictor variables to be included in the model 
      was based on reported associations in the literature or on a relative risk (odds 
      ratio) > 1.2 and p </= 0.25 in the univariate analysis of all participants. Using
      multivariate logistic regression, a full prediction model was created. In
      addition to the full model (all variables), a restricted model (minimum number of
      predictors with a maximum predictive value) and a clinical model (environmental
      risk factors only, no blood draw or assays required) were created. To determine
      the discriminatory power in patients with cast immobilization (n = 230), the area
      under the curve (AUC) was calculated by means of a receiver operating
      characteristic. Validation was performed in two other case-control studies of the
      etiology of VTE: (1) the THE-VTE study, a two-center, population-based
      case-control study (conducted in Leiden, the Netherlands, and Cambridge, United
      Kingdom) with 784 cases and 523 controls included between March 2003 and December
      2008 and (2) the Milan study, a population-based case-control study with 2,117
      cases and 2,088 controls selected between December 1993 and December 2010 at the 
      Thrombosis Center, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda-Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico,
      Milan, Italy. The full model consisted of 32 predictors, including three genetic 
      factors and six biomarkers. For this model, an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.77-0.92) was
      found in individuals with plaster cast immobilization of the lower extremity. The
      AUC for the restricted model (containing 11 predictors, including two genetic
      factors and one biomarker) was 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.92). The clinical model
      (consisting of 14 environmental predictors) resulted in an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI
      0.66-0.87). The clinical model was converted into a risk score, the L-TRiP(cast) 
      score (Leiden-Thrombosis Risk Prediction for patients with cast immobilization
      score), which showed an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.66-0.86). Validation in the THE-VTE
      study data resulted in an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.58-0.96) for the L-TRiP(cast)
      score. Validation in the Milan study resulted in an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI
      0.86-1.00) for the full model, an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.76-0.87) for the
      restricted model, and an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92-0.99) for the clinical model.
      The L-TRiP(cast) score resulted in an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99). Major
      limitations of this study were that information on thromboprophylaxis was not
      available for patients who had plaster cast immobilization of the lower extremity
      and that blood was drawn 3 mo after the thrombotic event. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results show that information on environmental risk factors, coagulation factors,
      and genetic determinants in patients with plaster casts leads to high accuracy in
      the prediction of VTE risk. In daily practice, the clinical model may be the
      preferred model as its factors are most easy to determine, while the model still 
      has good predictive performance. These results may provide guidance for
      thromboprophylaxis and form the basis for a management study.

TI  - Dispersion of the HIV-1 Epidemic in Men Who Have Sex with Men in the Netherlands:
      A Combined Mathematical Model and Phylogenetic Analysis.
PG  - e1001898; discussion e1001898
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001898 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) 
      is resurgent in many countries despite the widespread use of effective
      combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In this combined mathematical and
      phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to
      which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of
      growth of already circulating strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: As of November 2011,
      the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands
      since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients.
      Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if 
      they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA
      sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a
      phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission
      clusters that included >/=10 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support
      value >/= 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile
      of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large
      MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified
      106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos 
      sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the
      Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters.
      Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already
      circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the
      present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were
      found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large
      MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the
      whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent
      years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM
      at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters
      appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high
      proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined
      application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the
      assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall
      HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval
      distribution is similar between clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The resurgent HIV epidemic
      amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent,
      self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new
      generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early
      epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.

TI  - Water supply interruptions and suspected cholera incidence: a time-series
      regression in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
PG  - e1001893
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001893 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
      been identified as endemic areas for cholera transmission, and despite continuous
      control efforts, they continue to experience regular cholera outbreaks that
      occasionally spread to the rest of the country. In a region where access to
      improved water sources is particularly poor, the question of which improvements
      in water access should be prioritized to address cholera transmission remains
      unresolved. This study aimed at investigating the temporal association between
      water supply interruptions and Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) admissions in a
      medium-sized town. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Time-series patterns of daily incidence 
      of suspected cholera cases admitted to the Cholera Treatment Centre in Uvira in
      South Kivu Province between 2009 and 2014 were examined in relation to the daily 
      variations in volume of water supplied by the town water treatment plant.
      Quasi-poisson regression and distributed lag nonlinear models up to 12 d were
      used, adjusting for daily precipitation rates, day of the week, and seasonal
      variations. A total of 5,745 patients over 5 y of age with acute watery diarrhoea
      symptoms were admitted to the CTC over the study period of 1,946 d. Following a
      day without tap water supply, the suspected cholera incidence rate increased on
      average by 155% over the next 12 d, corresponding to a rate ratio of 2.55 (95%
      CI: 1.54-4.24), compared to the incidence experienced after a day with optimal
      production (defined as the 95th percentile-4,794 m3). Suspected cholera cases
      attributable to a suboptimal tap water supply reached 23.2% of total admissions
      (95% CI 11.4%-33.2%). Although generally reporting less admissions to the CTC,
      neighbourhoods with a higher consumption of tap water were more affected by water
      supply interruptions, with a rate ratio of 3.71 (95% CI: 1.91-7.20) and an
      attributable fraction of cases of 31.4% (95% CI: 17.3%-42.5%). The analysis did
      not suggest any association between levels of residual chlorine in the water fed 
      to the distribution network and suspected cholera incidence. Laboratory
      confirmation of cholera was not available for this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A clear
      association is observed between reduced availability of tap water and increased
      incidence of suspected cholera in the entire town of Uvira in Eastern Democratic 
      Republic of the Congo. Even though access to piped water supplies is low in
      Uvira, improving the reliability of tap water supply may substantially reduce the
      incidence of suspected cholera, in particular in neighbourhoods having a higher
      access to tap water. These results argue in favour of water supply investments
      that focus on the delivery of a reliable and sustainable water supply, and not
      only on point-of-use water quality improvements, as is often seen during cholera 
      outbreaks.

TI  - Upgrading a piped water supply from intermittent to continuous delivery and
      association with waterborne illness: a matched cohort study in urban India.
PG  - e1001892
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001892 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent delivery of piped water can lead to waterborne illness
      through contamination in the pipelines or during household storage, use of unsafe
      water sources during intermittencies, and limited water availability for hygiene.
      We assessed the association between continuous versus intermittent water supply
      and waterborne diseases, child mortality, and weight for age in Hubli-Dharwad,
      India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a matched cohort study with
      multivariate matching to identify intermittent and continuous supply areas with
      comparable characteristics in Hubli-Dharwad. We followed 3,922 households in 16
      neighborhoods with children <5 y old, with four longitudinal visits over 15 mo
      (Nov 2010-Feb 2012) to record caregiver-reported health outcomes (diarrhea,
      highly credible gastrointestinal illness, bloody diarrhea, typhoid fever,
      cholera, hepatitis, and deaths of children <2 y old) and, at the final visit, to 
      measure weight for age for children <5 y old. We also collected
      caregiver-reported data on negative control outcomes (cough/cold and
      scrapes/bruises) to assess potential bias from residual confounding or
      differential measurement error. Continuous supply had no significant overall
      association with diarrhea (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 0.83-1.04, p = 0.19), bloody diarrhea (PR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.60-1.01, p =
      0.06), or weight-for-age z-scores (Deltaz = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.07-0.09, p = 0.79)
      in children <5 y old. In prespecified subgroup analyses by socioeconomic status, 
      children <5 y old in lower-income continuous supply households had 37% lower
      prevalence of bloody diarrhea (PR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.87, p-value for
      interaction = 0.03) than lower-income intermittent supply households; in
      higher-income households, there was no significant association between continuous
      versus intermittent supply and child diarrheal illnesses. Continuous supply areas
      also had 42% fewer households with >/=1 reported case of typhoid fever
      (cumulative incidence ratio [CIR] = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.41-0.78, p = 0.001) than
      intermittent supply areas. There was no significant association with hepatitis,
      cholera, or mortality of children <2 y old; however, our results were indicative 
      of lower mortality of children <2 y old (CIR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.22-1.07, p = 0.10)
      in continuous supply areas. The major limitations of our study were the potential
      for unmeasured confounding given the observational design and measurement bias
      from differential reporting of health symptoms given the nonblinded treatment.
      However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of the negative
      control outcomes between study groups that would suggest undetected confounding
      or measurement bias. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous water supply had no significant
      overall association with diarrheal disease or ponderal growth in children <5 y
      old in Hubli-Dharwad; this might be due to point-of-use water contamination from 
      continuing household storage and exposure to diarrheagenic pathogens through
      nonwaterborne routes. Continuous supply was associated with lower prevalence of
      dysentery in children in low-income households and lower typhoid fever incidence,
      suggesting that intermittently operated piped water systems are a significant
      transmission mechanism for Salmonella typhi and dysentery-causing pathogens in
      this urban population, despite centralized water treatment. Continuous supply was
      associated with reduced transmission, especially in the poorer higher-risk
      segments of the population.

TI  - Strategies for understanding and reducing the Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium
      ovale hypnozoite reservoir in Papua New Guinean children: a randomised
      placebo-controlled trial and mathematical model.
PG  - e1001891
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The undetectable hypnozoite reservoir for relapsing Plasmodium vivax 
      and P. ovale malarias presents a major challenge for malaria control and
      elimination in endemic countries. This study aims to directly determine the
      contribution of relapses to the burden of P. vivax and P. ovale infection,
      illness, and transmission in Papua New Guinean children. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      From 17 August 2009 to 20 May 2010, 524 children aged 5-10 y from East Sepik
      Province in Papua New Guinea (PNG) participated in a randomised double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial of blood- plus liver-stage drugs (chloroquine [CQ], 3 d;
      artemether-lumefantrine [AL], 3 d; and primaquine [PQ], 20 d, 10 mg/kg total
      dose) (261 children) or blood-stage drugs only (CQ, 3 d; AL, 3 d; and placebo
      [PL], 20 d) (263 children). Participants, study staff, and investigators were
      blinded to the treatment allocation. Twenty children were excluded during the
      treatment phase (PQ arm: 14, PL arm: 6), and 504 were followed actively for 9 mo.
      During the follow-up time, 18 children (PQ arm: 7, PL arm: 11) were lost to
      follow-up. Main primary and secondary outcome measures were time to first P.
      vivax infection (by qPCR), time to first clinical episode, force of infection,
      gametocyte positivity, and time to first P. ovale infection (by PCR). A basic
      stochastic transmission model was developed to estimate the potential effect of
      mass drug administration (MDA) for the prevention of recurrent P. vivax
      infections. Targeting hypnozoites through PQ treatment reduced the risk of having
      at least one qPCR-detectable P. vivax or P. ovale infection during 8 mo of
      follow-up (P. vivax: PQ arm 0.63/y versus PL arm 2.62/y, HR = 0.18 [95% CI 0.14, 
      0.25], p < 0.001; P. ovale: 0.06 versus 0.14, HR = 0.31 [95% CI 0.13, 0.77], p = 
      0.011) and the risk of having at least one clinical P. vivax episode (HR = 0.25
      [95% CI 0.11, 0.61], p = 0.002). PQ also reduced the molecular force of P. vivax 
      blood-stage infection in the first 3 mo of follow-up (PQ arm 1.90/y versus PL arm
      7.75/y, incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.21 [95% CI 0.15, 0.28], p < 0.001).
      Children who received PQ were less likely to carry P. vivax gametocytes (IRR =
      0.27 [95% CI 0.19, 0.38], p < 0.001). PQ had a comparable effect irrespective of 
      the presence of P. vivax blood-stage infection at the time of treatment (p =
      0.14). Modelling revealed that mass screening and treatment with highly sensitive
      quantitative real-time PCR, or MDA with blood-stage treatment alone, would have
      only a transient effect on P. vivax transmission levels, while MDA that includes 
      liver-stage treatment is predicted to be a highly effective strategy for P. vivax
      elimination. The inclusion of a directly observed 20-d treatment regime maximises
      the efficiency of hypnozoite clearance but limits the generalisability of results
      to real-world MDA programmes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that relapses
      cause approximately four of every five P. vivax infections and at least three of 
      every five P. ovale infections in PNG children and are important in sustaining
      transmission. MDA campaigns combining blood- and liver-stage treatment are
      predicted to be a highly efficacious intervention for reducing P. vivax and P.
      ovale transmission. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02143934.

TI  - Effect of health risk assessment and counselling on health behaviour and survival
      in older people: a pragmatic randomised trial.
PG  - e1001889
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001889 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Potentially avoidable risk factors continue to cause unnecessary
      disability and premature death in older people. Health risk assessment (HRA), a
      method successfully used in working-age populations, is a promising method for
      cost-effective health promotion and preventive care in older individuals, but the
      long-term effects of this approach are unknown. The objective of this study was
      to evaluate the effects of an innovative approach to HRA and counselling in older
      individuals for health behaviours, preventive care, and long-term survival.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was a pragmatic, single-centre randomised
      controlled clinical trial in community-dwelling individuals aged 65 y or older
      registered with one of 19 primary care physician (PCP) practices in a mixed rural
      and urban area in Switzerland. From November 2000 to January 2002, 874
      participants were randomly allocated to the intervention and 1,410 to usual care.
      The intervention consisted of HRA based on self-administered questionnaires and
      individualised computer-generated feedback reports, combined with nurse and PCP
      counselling over a 2-y period. Primary outcomes were health behaviours and
      preventive care use at 2 y and all-cause mortality at 8 y. At baseline,
      participants in the intervention group had a mean +/- standard deviation of 6.9
      +/- 3.7 risk factors (including unfavourable health behaviours, health and
      functional impairments, and social risk factors) and 4.3 +/- 1.8 deficits in
      recommended preventive care. At 2 y, favourable health behaviours and use of
      preventive care were more frequent in the intervention than in the control group 
      (based on z-statistics from generalised estimating equation models). For example,
      70% compared to 62% were physically active (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.16-1.77, p 
      = 0.001), and 66% compared to 59% had influenza vaccinations in the past year
      (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66, p = 0.005). At 8 y, based on an
      intention-to-treat analysis, the estimated proportion alive was 77.9% in the
      intervention and 72.8% in the control group, for an absolute mortality difference
      of 4.9% (95% CI 1.3%-8.5%, p = 0.009; based on z-test for risk difference). The
      hazard ratio of death comparing intervention with control was 0.79 (95% CI
      0.66-0.94, p = 0.009; based on Wald test from Cox regression model), and the
      number needed to receive the intervention to prevent one death was 21 (95% CI
      12-79). The main limitations of the study include the single-site study design,
      the use of a brief self-administered questionnaire for 2-y outcome data
      collection, the unavailability of other long-term outcome data (e.g., functional 
      status, nursing home admissions), and the availability of long-term follow-up
      data on mortality for analysis only in 2014. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial
      to our knowledge demonstrating that a collaborative care model of HRA in
      community-dwelling older people not only results in better health behaviours and 
      increased use of recommended preventive care interventions, but also improves
      survival. The intervention tested in our study may serve as a model of how to
      implement a relatively low-cost but effective programme of disease prevention and
      health promotion in older individuals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard
      Randomized Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN 28458424.

TI  - Monitoring pharmacologically induced immunosuppression by immune repertoire
      sequencing to detect acute allograft rejection in heart transplant patients: a
      proof-of-concept diagnostic accuracy study.
PG  - e1001890
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains difficult to predict and to measure the efficacy of
      pharmacological immunosuppression. We hypothesized that measuring the B-cell
      repertoire would enable assessment of the overall level of immunosuppression
      after heart transplantation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this proof-of-concept
      study, we implemented a molecular-barcode-based immune repertoire sequencing
      assay that sensitively and accurately measures the isotype and clonal composition
      of the circulating B cell repertoire. We used this assay to measure the temporal 
      response of the B cell repertoire to immunosuppression after heart
      transplantation. We selected a subset of 12 participants from a larger
      prospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01985412) that is ongoing at
      Stanford Medical Center and for which enrollment started in March 2010. This
      subset of 12 participants was selected to represent post-heart-transplant events,
      with and without acute rejection (six participants with moderate-to-severe
      rejection and six without). We analyzed 130 samples from these patients, with an 
      average follow-up period of 15 mo. Immune repertoire sequencing enables the
      measurement of a patient's net state of immunosuppression (correlation with
      tacrolimus level, r = -0.867, 95% CI -0.968 to -0.523, p = 0.0014), as well as
      the diagnosis of acute allograft rejection, which is preceded by increased immune
      activity with a sensitivity of 71.4% (95% CI 30.3% to 94.9%) and a specificity of
      82.0% (95% CI 72.1% to 89.1%) (cell-free donor-derived DNA as noninvasive gold
      standard). To illustrate the potential of immune repertoire sequencing to monitor
      atypical post-transplant trajectories, we analyzed two more patients, one with
      chronic infections and one with amyloidosis. A larger, prospective study will be 
      needed to validate the power of immune repertoire sequencing to predict rejection
      events, as this proof-of-concept study is limited to a small number of patients
      who were selected based on several criteria including the availability of a large
      number of samples and the absence or presence of rejection events. CONCLUSIONS:
      If confirmed in larger, prospective studies, the method described here has
      potential applications in the tailored management of post-transplant
      immunosuppression and, more broadly, as a method for assessing the overall
      activity of the immune system.

TI  - P2RX7 purinoceptor: a therapeutic target for ameliorating the symptoms of
      duchenne muscular dystrophy.
PG  - e1001888
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001888 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common inherited muscle
      disease, leading to severe disability and death in young men. Death is caused by 
      the progressive degeneration of striated muscles aggravated by sterile
      inflammation. The pleiotropic effects of the mutant gene also include cognitive
      and behavioral impairments and low bone density. Current interventions in DMD are
      palliative only as no treatment improves the long-term outcome. Therefore,
      approaches with a translational potential should be investigated, and key
      abnormalities downstream from the absence of the DMD product, dystrophin, appear 
      to be strong therapeutic targets. We and others have demonstrated that DMD
      mutations alter ATP signaling and have identified P2RX7 purinoceptor
      up-regulation as being responsible for the death of muscles in the mdx mouse
      model of DMD and human DMD lymphoblasts. Moreover, the ATP-P2RX7 axis, being a
      crucial activator of innate immune responses, can contribute to DMD pathology by 
      stimulating chronic inflammation. We investigated whether ablation of P2RX7
      attenuates the DMD model mouse phenotype to assess receptor suitability as a
      therapeutic target. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a combination of molecular,
      histological, and biochemical methods and behavioral analyses in vivo we
      demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that genetic ablation of P2RX7 
      in the DMD model mouse produces a widespread functional attenuation of both
      muscle and non-muscle symptoms. In dystrophic muscles at 4 wk there was an
      evident recovery in key functional and molecular parameters such as improved
      muscle structure (minimum Feret diameter, p < 0.001), increased muscle strength
      in vitro (p < 0.001) and in vivo (p = 0.012), and pro-fibrotic molecular
      signatures. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were lower (p = 0.025), and reduced
      cognitive impairment (p = 0.006) and bone structure alterations (p < 0.001) were 
      also apparent. Reduction of inflammation and fibrosis persisted at 20 mo in leg
      (p = 0.038), diaphragm (p = 0.042), and heart muscles (p < 0.001). We show that
      the amelioration of symptoms was proportional to the extent of receptor depletion
      and that improvements were observed following administration of two P2RX7
      antagonists (CK, p = 0.030 and p = 0.050) without any detectable side effects.
      However, approaches successful in animal models still need to be proved effective
      in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: These results are, to our knowledge, the first
      to establish that a single treatment can improve muscle function both short and
      long term and also correct cognitive impairment and bone loss in DMD model mice. 
      The wide-ranging improvements reflect the convergence of P2RX7 ablation on
      multiple disease mechanisms affecting skeletal and cardiac muscles, inflammatory 
      cells, brain, and bone. Given the impact of P2RX7 blockade in the DMD mouse
      model, this receptor is an attractive target for translational research: existing
      drugs with established safety records could potentially be repurposed for
      treatment of this lethal disease.

AB  - Routinely collected health data, obtained for administrative and clinical
      purposes without specific a priori research goals, are increasingly used for
      research. The rapid evolution and availability of these data have revealed issues
      not addressed by existing reporting guidelines, such as Strengthening the
      Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). The REporting of
      studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD)
      statement was created to fill these gaps. RECORD was created as an extension to
      the STROBE statement to address reporting items specific to observational studies
      using routinely collected health data. RECORD consists of a checklist of 13 items
      related to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion
      section of articles, and other information required for inclusion in such
      research reports. This document contains the checklist and explanatory and
      elaboration information to enhance the use of the checklist. Examples of good
      reporting for each RECORD checklist item are also included herein. This document,
      as well as the accompanying website and message board
      (http://www.record-statement.org), will enhance the implementation and
      understanding of RECORD. Through implementation of RECORD, authors, journals
      editors, and peer reviewers can encourage transparency of research reporting.

TI  - Derivation and validation of two decision instruments for selective chest CT in
      blunt trauma: a multicenter prospective observational study (NEXUS Chest CT).
PG  - e1001883
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unnecessary diagnostic imaging leads to higher costs, longer
      emergency department stays, and increased patient exposure to ionizing radiation.
      We sought to prospectively derive and validate two decision instruments (DIs) for
      selective chest computed tomography (CT) in adult blunt trauma patients. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: From September 2011 to May 2014, we prospectively enrolled blunt
      trauma patients over 14 y of age presenting to eight US, urban level 1 trauma
      centers in this observational study. During the derivation phase, physicians
      recorded the presence or absence of 14 clinical criteria before viewing chest
      imaging results. We determined injury outcomes by CT radiology readings and
      categorized injuries as major or minor according to an expert-panel-derived
      clinical classification scheme. We then employed recursive partitioning to derive
      two DIs: Chest CT-All maximized sensitivity for all injuries, and Chest CT-Major 
      maximized sensitivity for only major thoracic injuries (while increasing
      specificity). In the validation phase, we employed similar methodology to
      prospectively test the performance of both DIs. We enrolled 11,477 patients-6,002
      patients in the derivation phase and 5,475 patients in the validation phase. The 
      derived Chest CT-All DI consisted of (1) abnormal chest X-ray, (2) rapid
      deceleration mechanism, (3) distracting injury, (4) chest wall tenderness, (5)
      sternal tenderness, (6) thoracic spine tenderness, and (7) scapular tenderness.
      The Chest CT-Major DI had the same criteria without rapid deceleration mechanism.
      In the validation phase, Chest CT-All had a sensitivity of 99.2% (95% CI
      95.4%-100%), a specificity of 20.8% (95% CI 19.2%-22.4%), and a negative
      predictive value (NPV) of 99.8% (95% CI 98.9%-100%) for major injury, and a
      sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI 93.6%-96.9%), a specificity of 25.5% (95% CI
      23.5%-27.5%), and a NPV of 93.9% (95% CI 91.5%-95.8%) for either major or minor
      injury. Chest CT-Major had a sensitivity of 99.2% (95% CI 95.4%-100%), a
      specificity of 31.7% (95% CI 29.9%-33.5%), and a NPV of 99.9% (95% CI 99.3%-100%)
      for major injury and a sensitivity of 90.7% (95% CI 88.3%-92.8%), a specificity
      of 37.9% (95% CI 35.8%-40.1%), and a NPV of 91.8% (95% CI 89.7%-93.6%) for either
      major or minor injury. Regarding the limitations of our work, some clinicians may
      disagree with our injury classification and sensitivity thresholds for injury
      detection. CONCLUSIONS: We prospectively derived and validated two DIs (Chest
      CT-All and Chest CT-Major) that identify blunt trauma patients with clinically
      significant thoracic injuries with high sensitivity, allowing for a safe
      reduction of approximately 25%-37% of unnecessary chest CTs. Trauma evaluation
      protocols that incorporate these DIs may decrease unnecessary costs and radiation
      exposure in the disproportionately young trauma population.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Home-Based Counselling Strategy on Neonatal Care and Survival:
      A Cluster-Randomised Trial in Six Districts of Rural Southern Tanzania.
PG  - e1001881
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001881 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report a cluster-randomised trial of a home-based counselling
      strategy, designed for large-scale implementation, in a population of 1.2 million
      people in rural southern Tanzania. We hypothesised that the strategy would
      improve neonatal survival by around 15%. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 2010 we trained
      824 female volunteers to make three home visits to women and their families
      during pregnancy and two visits to them in the first few days of the infant's
      life in 65 wards, selected randomly from all 132 wards in six districts in Mtwara
      and Lindi regions, constituting typical rural areas in Southern Tanzania. The
      remaining wards were comparison areas. Participants were not blinded to the
      intervention. The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis comparing
      the neonatal mortality (day 0-27) per 1,000 live births in intervention and
      comparison wards based on a representative survey in 185,000 households in 2013
      with a response rate of 90%. We included 24,381 and 23,307 live births between
      July 2010 and June 2013 and 7,823 and 7,555 live births in the last year in
      intervention and comparison wards, respectively. We also compared changes in
      neonatal mortality and newborn care practices in intervention and comparison
      wards using baseline census data from 2007 including 225,000 households and
      22,243 births in five of the six intervention districts. Amongst the 7,823 women 
      with a live birth in the year prior to survey in intervention wards, 59% and 41% 
      received at least one volunteer visit during pregnancy and postpartum,
      respectively. Neonatal mortality reduced from 35.0 to 30.5 deaths per 1,000 live 
      births between 2007 and 2013 in the five districts, respectively. There was no
      evidence of an impact of the intervention on neonatal survival (odds ratio [OR]
      1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-1.2, p = 0.339). Newborn care practices
      reported by mothers were better in intervention than in comparison wards,
      including immediate breastfeeding (42% of 7,287 versus 35% of 7,008, OR 1.4, CI
      1.3-1.6, p < 0.001), feeding only breast milk for the first 3 d (90% of 7,557
      versus 79% of 7,307, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.7, p < 0.001), and clean hands for home
      delivery (92% of 1,351 versus 88% of 1,799, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.3, p = 0.033).
      Facility delivery improved dramatically in both groups from 41% of 22,243 in 2007
      and was 82% of 7,820 versus 75% of 7,553 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.0, p = 0.002) in
      intervention and comparison wards in 2013. Methodological limitations include our
      inability to rule out some degree of leakage of the intervention into the
      comparison areas and response bias for newborn care behaviours. CONCLUSION:
      Neonatal mortality remained high despite better care practices and childbirth in 
      facilities becoming common. Public health action to improve neonatal survival in 
      this setting should include a focus on improving the quality of facility-based
      childbirth care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01022788.

TI  - Evolution of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis over Four Decades: Whole
      Genome Sequencing and Dating Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from
      KwaZulu-Natal.
PG  - e1001880
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001880 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The continued advance of antibiotic resistance threatens the
      treatment and control of many infectious diseases. This is exemplified by the
      largest global outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB)
      identified in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005 that continues
      today. It is unclear whether the emergence of XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal was due to 
      recent inadequacies in TB control in conjunction with HIV or other factors.
      Understanding the origins of drug resistance in this fatal outbreak of XDR will
      inform the control and prevention of drug-resistant TB in other settings. In this
      study, we used whole genome sequencing and dating analysis to determine if XDR-TB
      had emerged recently or had ancient antecedents. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
      performed whole genome sequencing and drug susceptibility testing on 337 clinical
      isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis collected in KwaZulu-Natal from 2008 to
      2013, in addition to three historical isolates, collected from patients in the
      same province and including an isolate from the 2005 Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak, a
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate from 1994, and a pansusceptible isolate from
      1995. We utilized an array of whole genome comparative techniques to assess the
      relatedness among strains, to establish the order of acquisition of drug
      resistance mutations, including the timing of acquisitions leading to XDR-TB in
      the LAM4 spoligotype, and to calculate the number of independent evolutionary
      emergences of MDR and XDR. Our sequencing and analysis revealed a 50-member clone
      of XDR M. tuberculosis that was highly related to the Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak
      strain. We estimated that mutations conferring isoniazid and streptomycin
      resistance in this clone were acquired 50 y prior to the Tugela Ferry outbreak
      (katG S315T [isoniazid]; gidB 130 bp deletion [streptomycin]; 1957 [95% highest
      posterior density (HPD): 1937-1971]), with the subsequent emergence of MDR and
      XDR occurring 20 y (rpoB L452P [rifampicin]; pncA 1 bp insertion [pyrazinamide]; 
      1984 [95% HPD: 1974-1992]) and 10 y (rpoB D435G [rifampicin]; rrs 1400
      [kanamycin]; gyrA A90V [ofloxacin]; 1995 [95% HPD: 1988-1999]) prior to the
      outbreak, respectively. We observed frequent de novo evolution of MDR and XDR,
      with 56 and nine independent evolutionary events, respectively. Isoniazid
      resistance evolved before rifampicin resistance 46 times, whereas rifampicin
      resistance evolved prior to isoniazid only twice. We identified additional
      putative compensatory mutations to rifampicin in this dataset. One major
      limitation of this study is that the conclusions with respect to ordering and
      timing of acquisition of mutations may not represent universal patterns of drug
      resistance emergence in other areas of the globe. CONCLUSIONS: In the first whole
      genome-based analysis of the emergence of drug resistance among clinical isolates
      of M. tuberculosis, we show that the ancestral precursor of the LAM4 XDR outbreak
      strain in Tugela Ferry gained mutations to first-line drugs at the beginning of
      the antibiotic era. Subsequent accumulation of stepwise resistance mutations,
      occurring over decades and prior to the explosion of HIV in this region, yielded 
      MDR and XDR, permitting the emergence of compensatory mutations. Our results
      suggest that drug-resistant strains circulating today reflect not only
      vulnerabilities of current TB control efforts but also those that date back 50 y.
      In drug-resistant TB, isoniazid resistance was overwhelmingly the initial
      resistance mutation to be acquired, which would not be detected by current rapid 
      molecular diagnostics employed in South Africa that assess only rifampicin
      resistance.

TI  - Changes in Intake of Fruits and Vegetables and Weight Change in United States Men
      and Women Followed for Up to 24 Years: Analysis from Three Prospective Cohort
      Studies.
PG  - e1001878
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001878 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current dietary guidelines recommend eating a variety of fruits and
      vegetables. However, based on nutrient composition, some particular fruits and
      vegetables may be more or less beneficial for maintaining or achieving a healthy 
      weight. We hypothesized that greater consumption of fruits and vegetables with a 
      higher fiber content or lower glycemic load would be more strongly associated
      with a healthy weight. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined the association between 
      change in intake of specific fruits and vegetables and change in weight in three 
      large, prospective cohorts of 133,468 United States men and women. From 1986 to
      2010, these associations were examined within multiple 4-y time intervals,
      adjusting for simultaneous changes in other lifestyle factors, including other
      aspects of diet, smoking status, and physical activity. Results were combined
      using a random effects meta-analysis. Increased intake of fruits was inversely
      associated with 4-y weight change: total fruits -0.53 lb per daily serving (95%
      CI -0.61, -0.44), berries -1.11 lb (95% CI -1.45, -0.78), and apples/pears -1.24 
      lb (95% CI -1.62, -0.86). Increased intake of several vegetables was also
      inversely associated with weight change: total vegetables -0.25 lb per daily
      serving (95% CI -0.35, -0.14), tofu/soy -2.47 lb (95% CI, -3.09 to -1.85 lb) and 
      cauliflower -1.37 lb (95% CI -2.27, -0.47). On the other hand, increased intake
      of starchy vegetables, including corn, peas, and potatoes, was associated with
      weight gain. Vegetables having both higher fiber and lower glycemic load were
      more strongly inversely associated with weight change compared with lower-fiber, 
      higher-glycemic-load vegetables (p < 0.0001). Despite the measurement of key
      confounders in our analyses, the potential for residual confounding cannot be
      ruled out, and although our food frequency questionnaire specified portion size, 
      the assessment of diet using any method will have measurement error. CONCLUSIONS:
      Increased consumption of fruits and non-starchy vegetables is inversely
      associated with weight change, with important differences by type suggesting that
      other characteristics of these foods influence the magnitude of their association
      with weight change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile text messaging and medication monitors (medication monitor
      boxes) have the potential to improve adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment and
      reduce the need for directly observed treatment (DOT), but to our knowledge they 
      have not been properly evaluated in TB patients. We assessed the effectiveness of
      text messaging and medication monitors to improve medication adherence in TB
      patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a pragmatic cluster-randomised trial, 36
      districts/counties (each with at least 300 active pulmonary TB patients
      registered in 2009) within the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and
      Chongqing, China, were randomised using stratification and restriction to one of 
      four case-management approaches in which patients received reminders via text
      messages, a medication monitor, combined, or neither (control). Patients in the
      intervention arms received reminders to take their drugs and reminders for
      monthly follow-up visits, and the managing doctor was recommended to switch
      patients with adherence problems to more intensive management or DOT. In all
      arms, patients took medications out of a medication monitor box, which recorded
      when the box was opened, but the box gave reminders only in the medication
      monitor and combined arms. Patients were followed up for 6 mo. The primary
      endpoint was the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where at least 20% 
      of doses were missed as measured by pill count and failure to open the medication
      monitor box. Secondary endpoints included additional adherence and standard
      treatment outcome measures. Interventions were not masked to study staff and
      patients. From 1 June 2011 to 7 March 2012, 4,292 new pulmonary TB patients were 
      enrolled across the 36 clusters. A total of 119 patients (by arm: 33 control, 33 
      text messaging, 23 medication monitor, 30 combined) withdrew from the study in
      the first month because they were reassessed as not having TB by their managing
      doctor (61 patients) or were switched to a different treatment model because of
      hospitalisation or travel (58 patients), leaving 4,173 TB patients (by arm: 1,104
      control, 1,008 text messaging, 997 medication monitor, 1,064 combined). The
      cluster geometric mean of the percentage of patient-months on TB treatment where 
      at least 20% of doses were missed was 29.9% in the control arm; in comparison,
      this percentage was 27.3% in the text messaging arm (adjusted mean ratio [aMR]
      0.94, 95% CI 0.71, 1.24), 17.0% in the medication monitor arm (aMR 0.58, 95% CI
      0.42, 0.79), and 13.9% in the combined arm (aMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.88). Patient
      loss to follow-up was lower in the text messaging arm than the control arm (aMR
      0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.98). Equipment malfunction or operation error was reported in
      all study arms. Analyses separating patients with and without medication monitor 
      problems did not change the results. Initiation of intensive management was
      underutilised. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to our knowledge to utilise a
      randomised trial design to demonstrate the effectiveness of a medication monitor 
      to improve medication adherence in TB patients. Reminders from medication
      monitors improved medication adherence in TB patients, but text messaging
      reminders did not. In a setting such as China where universal use of DOT is not
      feasible, innovative approaches to support patients in adhering to TB treatment, 
      such as this, are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials,

TI  - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Violent Crime: A Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001875
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001875 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely
      prescribed, associations with violence are uncertain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: From 
      Swedish national registers we extracted information on 856,493 individuals who
      were prescribed SSRIs, and subsequent violent crimes during 2006 through 2009. We
      used stratified Cox regression analyses to compare the rate of violent crime
      while individuals were prescribed these medications with the rate in the same
      individuals while not receiving medication. Adjustments were made for other
      psychotropic medications. Information on all medications was extracted from the
      Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, with complete national data on all dispensed
      medications. Information on violent crime convictions was extracted from the
      Swedish national crime register. Using within-individual models, there was an
      overall association between SSRIs and violent crime convictions (hazard ratio
      [HR] = 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.32, p < 0.001, absolute risk = 1.0%). With age
      stratification, there was a significant association between SSRIs and violent
      crime convictions for individuals aged 15 to 24 y (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.19-1.73, p
      < 0.001, absolute risk = 3.0%). However, there were no significant associations
      in those aged 25-34 y (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.95-1.52, p = 0.125, absolute risk =
      1.6%), in those aged 35-44 y (HR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.83-1.35, p = 0.666, absolute
      risk = 1.2%), or in those aged 45 y or older (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.84-1.35, p =
      0.594, absolute risk = 0.3%). Associations in those aged 15 to 24 y were also
      found for violent crime arrests with preliminary investigations (HR = 1.28, 95%
      CI 1.16-1.41, p < 0.001), non-violent crime convictions (HR = 1.22, 95% CI
      1.10-1.34, p < 0.001), non-violent crime arrests (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.20, p 
      < 0.001), non-fatal injuries from accidents (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.22-1.36, p <
      0.001), and emergency inpatient or outpatient treatment for alcohol intoxication 
      or misuse (HR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.76-2.21, p < 0.001). With age and sex
      stratification, there was a significant association between SSRIs and violent
      crime convictions for males aged 15 to 24 y (HR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73, p =
      0.002) and females aged 15 to 24 y (HR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.08-2.84, p = 0.023).
      However, there were no significant associations in those aged 25 y or older. One 
      important limitation is that we were unable to fully account for time-varying
      factors. CONCLUSIONS: The association between SSRIs and violent crime convictions
      and violent crime arrests varied by age group. The increased risk we found in
      young people needs validation in other studies.

TI  - Simplified HIV Testing and Treatment in China: Analysis of Mortality Rates Before
      and After a Structural Intervention.
PG  - e1001874
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001874 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multistage stepwise HIV testing and treatment initiation procedures
      can result in lost opportunities to provide timely antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
      Incomplete patient engagement along the continuum of HIV care translates into
      high levels of preventable mortality. We aimed to evaluate the ability of a
      simplified test and treat structural intervention to reduce mortality. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: In the "pre-intervention 2010" (from January 2010 to December 2010)
      and "pre-intervention 2011" (from January 2011 to December 2011) phases, patients
      who screened HIV-positive at health care facilities in Zhongshan and Pubei
      counties in Guangxi, China, followed the standard-of-care process. In the
      "post-intervention 2012" (from July 2012 to June 2013) and "post-intervention
      2013" (from July 2013 to June 2014) phases, patients who screened HIV-positive at
      the same facilities were offered a simplified test and treat intervention, i.e., 
      concurrent HIV confirmatory and CD4 testing and immediate initiation of ART,
      irrespective of CD4 count. Participants were followed for 6-18 mo until the end
      of their study phase period. Mortality rates in the pre-intervention and
      post-intervention phases were compared for all HIV cases and for
      treatment-eligible HIV cases. A total of 1,034 HIV-positive participants (281 and
      339 in the two pre-intervention phases respectively, and 215 and 199 in the two
      post-intervention phases respectively) were enrolled. Following the structural
      intervention, receipt of baseline CD4 testing within 30 d of HIV confirmation
      increased from 67%/61% (pre-intervention 2010/pre-intervention 2011) to 98%/97%
      (post-intervention 2012/post-intervention 2013) (all p < 0.001 [i.e., for all
      comparisons between a pre- and post-intervention phase]), and the time from HIV
      confirmation to ART initiation decreased from 53 d (interquartile range [IQR]
      27-141)/43 d (IQR 15-113) to 5 d (IQR 2-12)/5 d (IQR 2-13) (all p < 0.001).
      Initiation of ART increased from 27%/49% to 91%/89% among all cases (all p <
      0.001) and from 39%/62% to 94%/90% among individuals with CD4 count </= 350
      cells/mm3 or AIDS (all p < 0.001). Mortality decreased from 27%/27% to 10%/10%
      for all cases (all p < 0.001) and from 40%/35% to 13%/13% for cases with CD4
      count </= 350 cells/mm3 or AIDS (all p < 0.001). The simplified test and treat
      intervention was significantly associated with decreased mortality rates compared
      to pre-intervention 2011 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.385 [95% CI 0.239-0.620] 
      and 0.380 [95% CI 0.233-0.618] for the two post-intervention phases,
      respectively, for all newly diagnosed HIV cases [both p < 0.001], and aHR 0.369
      [95% CI 0.226-0.603] and 0.361 [95% CI 0.221-0.590] for newly diagnosed
      treatment-eligible HIV cases [both p < 0.001]). The unit cost of an additional
      patient receiving ART attributable to the intervention was US$83.80. The unit
      cost of a death prevented because of the intervention was US$234.52. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our results demonstrate that the simplified HIV test and treat intervention
      promoted successful engagement in care and was associated with a 62% reduction in
      mortality. Our findings support the implementation of integrated HIV testing and 
      immediate access to ART irrespective of CD4 count, in order to optimize the
      impact of ART.

TI  - Uptake, Accuracy, Safety, and Linkage into Care over Two Years of Promoting
      Annual Self-Testing for HIV in Blantyre, Malawi: A Community-Based Prospective
      Study.
PG  - e1001873
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001873 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC) achieves high uptake,
      but is difficult and expensive to implement and sustain. We investigated a novel 
      alternative based on HIV self-testing (HIVST). The aim was to evaluate the uptake
      of testing, accuracy, linkage into care, and health outcomes when highly
      convenient and flexible but supported access to HIVST kits was provided to a
      well-defined and closely monitored population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following
      enumeration of 14 neighbourhoods in urban Blantyre, Malawi, trained resident
      volunteer-counsellors offered oral HIVST kits (OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2
      Antibody Test) to adult (>/=16 y old) residents (n = 16,660) and reported
      community events, with all deaths investigated by verbal autopsy. Written and
      demonstrated instructions, pre- and post-test counselling, and facilitated HIV
      care assessment were provided, with a request to return kits and a self-completed
      questionnaire. Accuracy, residency, and a study-imposed requirement to limit
      HIVST to one test per year were monitored by home visits in a systematic quality 
      assurance (QA) sample. Overall, 14,004 (crude uptake 83.8%, revised to 76.5% to
      account for population turnover) residents self-tested during months 1-12, with
      adolescents (16-19 y) most likely to test. 10,614/14,004 (75.8%) participants
      shared results with volunteer-counsellors. Of 1,257 (11.8%) HIV-positive
      participants, 26.0% were already on antiretroviral therapy, and 524 (linkage
      56.3%) newly accessed care with a median CD4 count of 250 cells/mul
      (interquartile range 159-426). HIVST uptake in months 13-24 was more rapid (70.9%
      uptake by 6 mo), with fewer (7.3%, 95% CI 6.8%-7.8%) positive participants. Being
      "forced to test", usually by a main partner, was reported by 2.9% (95% CI
      2.6%-3.2%) of 10,017 questionnaire respondents in months 1-12, but satisfaction
      with HIVST (94.4%) remained high. No HIVST-related partner violence or suicides
      were reported. HIVST and repeat HTC results agreed in 1,639/1,649 systematically 
      selected (1 in 20) QA participants (99.4%), giving a sensitivity of 93.6% (95% CI
      88.2%-97.0%) and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.6%-100%). Key limitations
      included use of aggregate data to report uptake of HIVST and being unable to
      adjust for population turnover. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based HIVST achieved high 
      coverage in two successive years and was safe, accurate, and acceptable.
      Proactive HIVST strategies, supported and monitored by communities, could
      substantially complement existing approaches to providing early HIV diagnosis and
      periodic repeat testing to adolescents and adults in high-HIV settings.

TI  - Asporin Is a Fibroblast-Derived TGF-beta1 Inhibitor and a Tumor Suppressor
      Associated with Good Prognosis in Breast Cancer.
PG  - e1001871
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001871 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a leading malignancy affecting the female population
      worldwide. Most morbidity is caused by metastases that remain incurable to date. 
      TGF-beta1 has been identified as a key driving force behind metastatic breast
      cancer, with promising therapeutic implications. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Employing 
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, we report, to our knowledge for the first
      time, that asporin is overexpressed in the stroma of most human breast cancers
      and is not expressed in normal breast tissue. In vitro, asporin is secreted by
      breast fibroblasts upon exposure to conditioned medium from some but not all
      human breast cancer cells. While hormone receptor (HR) positive cells cause
      strong asporin expression, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells suppress
      it. Further, our findings show that soluble IL-1beta, secreted by TNBC cells, is 
      responsible for inhibiting asporin in normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts.
      Using recombinant protein, as well as a synthetic peptide fragment, we
      demonstrate the ability of asporin to inhibit TGF-beta1-mediated SMAD2
      phosphorylation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and stemness in breast
      cancer cells. In two in vivo murine models of TNBC, we observed that tumors
      expressing asporin exhibit significantly reduced growth (2-fold; p = 0.01) and
      metastatic properties (3-fold; p = 0.045). A retrospective IHC study performed on
      human breast carcinoma (n = 180) demonstrates that asporin expression is lowest
      in TNBC and HER2+ tumors, while HR+ tumors have significantly higher asporin
      expression (4-fold; p = 0.001). Assessment of asporin expression and patient
      outcome (n = 60; 10-y follow-up) shows that low protein levels in the primary
      breast lesion significantly delineate patients with bad outcome regardless of the
      tumor HR status (area under the curve = 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.96; p = 0.0001).
      Survival analysis, based on gene expression (n = 375; 25-y follow-up), confirmed 
      that low asporin levels are associated with a reduced likelihood of survival
      (hazard ratio = 0.58; 95% CI 0.37-0.91; p = 0.017). Although these data highlight
      the potential of asporin to serve as a prognostic marker, confirmation of the
      clinical value would require a prospective study on a much larger patient cohort.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that asporin is a stroma-derived inhibitor of
      TGF-beta1 and a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. High asporin expression is
      significantly associated with less aggressive tumors, stratifying patients
      according to the clinical outcome. Future pre-clinical studies should consider
      options for increasing asporin expression in TNBC as a promising strategy for
      targeted therapy.

TI  - The Impact of Company-Level ART Provision to a Mining Workforce in South Africa: 
      A Cost-Benefit Analysis.
PG  - e1001869
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001869 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV impacts heavily on the operating costs of companies in
      sub-Saharan Africa, with many companies now providing antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) programmes in the workplace. A full cost-benefit analysis of workplace ART 
      provision has not been conducted using primary data. We developed a dynamic
      health-state transition model to estimate the economic impact of HIV and the
      cost-benefit of ART provision in a mining company in South Africa between 2003
      and 2022. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A dynamic health-state transition model, called
      the Workplace Impact Model (WIM), was parameterised with workplace data on
      workforce size, composition, turnover, HIV incidence, and CD4 cell count
      development. Bottom-up cost analyses from the employer perspective supplied data 
      on inpatient and outpatient resource utilisation and the costs of absenteeism and
      replacement of sick workers. The model was fitted to workforce HIV prevalence and
      separation data while incorporating parameter uncertainty; univariate sensitivity
      analyses were used to assess the robustness of the model findings. As ART
      coverage increases from 10% to 97% of eligible employees, increases in survival
      and retention of HIV-positive employees and associated reductions in absenteeism 
      and benefit payments lead to cost savings compared to a scenario of no treatment 
      provision, with the annual cost of HIV to the company decreasing by 5% (90%
      credibility interval [CrI] 2%-8%) and the mean cost per HIV-positive employee
      decreasing by 14% (90% CrI 7%-19%) by 2022. This translates into an average
      saving of US$950,215 (90% CrI US$220,879-US$1.6 million) per year; 80% of these
      cost savings are due to reductions in benefit payments and inpatient care costs. 
      Although findings are sensitive to assumptions regarding incidence and
      absenteeism, ART is cost-saving under considerable parameter uncertainty and in
      all tested scenarios, including when prevalence is reduced to 1%-except when no
      benefits were paid out to employees leaving the workforce and when absenteeism
      rates were half of what data suggested. Scaling up ART further through a
      universal test and treat strategy doubles savings; incorporating ART for family
      members reduces savings but is still marginally cost-saving compared to no
      treatment. Our analysis was limited to the direct cost of HIV to companies and
      did not examine the impact of HIV prevention policies on the miners or their
      families, and a few model inputs were based on limited data, though in
      sensitivity analysis our results were found to be robust to changes to these
      inputs along plausible ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace ART provision can be
      cost-saving for companies in high HIV prevalence settings due to reductions in
      healthcare costs, absenteeism, and staff turnover. Company-sponsored HIV
      counselling and voluntary testing with ensuing treatment of all HIV-positive
      employees and family members should be implemented universally at workplaces in
      countries with high HIV prevalence.

TI  - The Impact of a One-Dose versus Two-Dose Oral Cholera Vaccine Regimen in Outbreak
      Settings: A Modeling Study.
PG  - e1001867
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001867 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2013, a stockpile of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) was created for
      use in outbreak response, but vaccine availability remains severely limited.
      Innovative strategies are needed to maximize the health impact and minimize the
      logistical barriers to using available vaccine. Here we ask under what conditions
      the use of one dose rather than the internationally licensed two-dose protocol
      may do both. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using mathematical models we determined the
      minimum relative single-dose efficacy (MRSE) at which single-dose reactive
      campaigns are expected to be as or more effective than two-dose campaigns with
      the same amount of vaccine. Average one- and two-dose OCV effectiveness was
      estimated from published literature and compared to the MRSE. Results were
      applied to recent outbreaks in Haiti, Zimbabwe, and Guinea using stochastic
      simulations to illustrate the potential impact of one- and two-dose campaigns. At
      the start of an epidemic, a single dose must be 35%-56% as efficacious as two
      doses to avert the same number of cases with a fixed amount of vaccine (i.e.,
      MRSE between 35% and 56%). This threshold decreases as vaccination is delayed.
      Short-term OCV effectiveness is estimated to be 77% (95% CI 57%-88%) for two
      doses and 44% (95% CI -27% to 76%) for one dose. This results in a one-dose
      relative efficacy estimate of 57% (interquartile range 13%-88%), which is above
      conservative MRSE estimates. Using our best estimates of one- and two-dose
      efficacy, we projected that a single-dose reactive campaign could have prevented 
      70,584 (95% prediction interval [PI] 55,943-86,205) cases in Zimbabwe, 78,317
      (95% PI 57,435-100,150) in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and 2,826 (95% PI 2,490-3,170) 
      cases in Conakry, Guinea: 1.1 to 1.2 times as many as a two-dose campaign. While 
      extensive sensitivity analyses were performed, our projections of cases averted
      in past epidemics are based on severely limited single-dose efficacy data and may
      not fully capture uncertainty due to imperfect surveillance data and uncertainty 
      about the transmission dynamics of cholera in each setting. CONCLUSIONS: Reactive
      vaccination campaigns using a single dose of OCV may avert more cases and deaths 
      than a standard two-dose campaign when vaccine supplies are limited, while at the
      same time reducing logistical complexity. These findings should motivate
      consideration of the trade-offs between one- and two-dose campaigns in
      resource-constrained settings, though further field efficacy data are needed and 
      should be a priority in any one-dose campaign.

TI  - Vitamin D and Risk of Multiple Sclerosis: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
PG  - e1001866
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001866 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have demonstrated an association between
      decreased vitamin D level and risk of multiple sclerosis (MS); however, it
      remains unclear whether this relationship is causal. We undertook a Mendelian
      randomization (MR) study to evaluate whether genetically lowered vitamin D level 
      influences the risk of MS. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level from
      SUNLIGHT, the largest (n = 33,996) genome-wide association study to date for
      vitamin D. Four SNPs were genome-wide significant for 25OHD level (p-values
      ranging from 6 x 10-10 to 2 x 10-109), and all four SNPs lay in, or near, genes
      strongly implicated in separate mechanisms influencing 25OHD. We then ascertained
      their effect on 25OHD level in 2,347 participants from a population-based cohort,
      the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, and tested the extent to which the
      25OHD-decreasing alleles explained variation in 25OHD level. We found that the
      count of 25OHD-decreasing alleles across these four SNPs was strongly associated 
      with lower 25OHD level (n = 2,347, F-test statistic = 49.7, p = 2.4 x 10-12).
      Next, we conducted an MR study to describe the effect of genetically lowered
      25OHD on the odds of MS in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics
      Consortium study, the largest genetic association study to date for MS (including
      up to 14,498 cases and 24,091 healthy controls). Alleles were weighted by their
      relative effect on 25OHD level, and sensitivity analyses were performed to test
      MR assumptions. MR analyses found that each genetically determined
      one-standard-deviation decrease in log-transformed 25OHD level conferred a
      2.0-fold increase in the odds of MS (95% CI: 1.7-2.5; p = 7.7 x 10-12; I2 = 63%, 
      95% CI: 0%-88%). This result persisted in sensitivity analyses excluding SNPs
      possibly influenced by population stratification or pleiotropy (odds ratio [OR] =
      1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.2; p = 2.3 x 10-5; I2 = 47%, 95% CI: 0%-85%) and including
      only SNPs involved in 25OHD synthesis or metabolism (ORsynthesis = 2.1, 95% CI:
      1.6-2.6, p = 1 x 10-9; ORmetabolism = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7, p = 0.002). While
      these sensitivity analyses decreased the possibility that pleiotropy may have
      biased the results, residual pleiotropy is difficult to exclude entirely.
      CONCLUSIONS: A genetically lowered 25OHD level is strongly associated with
      increased susceptibility to MS. Whether vitamin D sufficiency can delay, or
      prevent, MS onset merits further investigation in long-term randomized controlled
      trials.

TI  - Assessing the Causal Relationship of Maternal Height on Birth Size and
      Gestational Age at Birth: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.
PG  - e1001865
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational epidemiological studies indicate that maternal height
      is associated with gestational age at birth and fetal growth measures (i.e.,
      shorter mothers deliver infants at earlier gestational ages with lower birth
      weight and birth length). Different mechanisms have been postulated to explain
      these associations. This study aimed to investigate the casual relationships
      behind the strong association of maternal height with fetal growth measures
      (i.e., birth length and birth weight) and gestational age by a Mendelian
      randomization approach. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a Mendelian
      randomization analysis using phenotype and genome-wide single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) data of 3,485 mother/infant pairs from birth cohorts collected
      from three Nordic countries (Finland, Denmark, and Norway). We constructed a
      genetic score based on 697 SNPs known to be associated with adult height to index
      maternal height. To avoid confounding due to genetic sharing between mother and
      infant, we inferred parental transmission of the height-associated SNPs and
      utilized the haplotype genetic score derived from nontransmitted alleles as a
      valid genetic instrument for maternal height. In observational analysis, maternal
      height was significantly associated with birth length (p = 6.31 x 10-9), birth
      weight (p = 2.19 x 10-15), and gestational age (p = 1.51 x 10-7). Our
      parental-specific haplotype score association analysis revealed that birth length
      and birth weight were significantly associated with the maternal transmitted
      haplotype score as well as the paternal transmitted haplotype score. Their
      association with the maternal nontransmitted haplotype score was far less
      significant, indicating a major fetal genetic influence on these fetal growth
      measures. In contrast, gestational age was significantly associated with the
      nontransmitted haplotype score (p = 0.0424) and demonstrated a significant (p =
      0.0234) causal effect of every 1 cm increase in maternal height resulting in ~0.4
      more gestational d. Limitations of this study include potential influences in
      causal inference by biological pleiotropy, assortative mating, and the nonrandom 
      sampling of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the
      observed association between maternal height and fetal growth measures (i.e.,
      birth length and birth weight) is mainly defined by fetal genetics. In contrast, 
      the association between maternal height and gestational age is more likely to be 
      causal. In addition, our approach that utilizes the genetic score derived from
      the nontransmitted maternal haplotype as a genetic instrument is a novel
      extension to the Mendelian randomization methodology in casual inference between 
      parental phenotype (or exposure) and outcomes in offspring.

TI  - Retained in HIV Care But Not on Antiretroviral Treatment: A Qualitative
      Patient-Provider Dyadic Study.
PG  - e1001863
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001863 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients retained in HIV care but not on antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      represent an important part of the HIV care cascade in the United States. Even in
      an era of more tolerable and efficacious ART, decision making in regards to ART
      offer and uptake remains complex and calls for exploration of both patient and
      provider perspectives. We sought to understand reasons for lack of ART usage in
      patients meeting the Health Resources Services Administration definition of
      retention as well as what motivated HIV primary care appointment attendance in
      the absence of ART. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a qualitative study
      consisting of 70 in-depth interviews with ART-naive and ART-experienced patients 
      off ART and their primary care providers in two urban safety-net HIV clinics in
      San Francisco and New York. Twenty patients and their providers were interviewed 
      separately at baseline, and 15 dyads were interviewed again after at least 3 mo
      and another clinic visit in order to understand any ART use in the interim. We
      applied dyadic analysis to our data. Nearly all patients were willing to consider
      ART, and 40% of the sample went on ART, citing education on newer antiretroviral 
      drugs, acceptance of HIV diagnosis, social support, and increased confidence in
      their ability to adhere as facilitators. However, the strength of the provider
      recommendation of ART played an important role. Many patients had internalized
      messages from providers that their health was too good to warrant ART. In
      addition, providers, while demonstrating patient-centered care through
      sensitivity to patients experiencing psychosocial instability, frequently muted
      the offer of ART, at times unintentionally. In the absence of ART, lab
      monitoring, provider relationships, access to social services, opiate pain
      medications, and acute symptoms motivated care. The main limitations of this
      study were that treatment as prevention was not explored in depth and that
      participants were recruited from academic HIV clinics in the US, making the
      findings most generalizable to this setting. CONCLUSIONS: Provider communication 
      with regard to ART is a key focus for further exploration and intervention in
      order to increase ART uptake for those retained in HIV care.

TI  - The Cost-Effectiveness of Low-Cost Essential Antihypertensive Medicines for
      Hypertension Control in China: A Modelling Study.
PG  - e1001860
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001860 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is China's leading cardiovascular disease risk factor.
      Improved hypertension control in China would result in result in enormous health 
      gains in the world's largest population. A computer simulation model projected
      the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Chinese adults, assuming a
      range of essential medicines list drug costs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The
      Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-China, a Markov-style computer simulation
      model, simulated hypertension screening, essential medicines program
      implementation, hypertension control program administration, drug treatment and
      monitoring costs, disease-related costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
      gained by preventing cardiovascular disease or lost because of drug side effects 
      in untreated hypertensive adults aged 35-84 y over 2015-2025. Cost-effectiveness 
      was assessed in cardiovascular disease patients (secondary prevention) and for
      two blood pressure ranges in primary prevention (stage one, 140-159/90-99 mm Hg; 
      stage two, >/=160/>/=100 mm Hg). Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and 
      combined systolic and diastolic hypertension were modeled as a reduction in
      systolic blood pressure; treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension was modeled
      as a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity
      analyses explored ranges of antihypertensive drug effectiveness and costs,
      monitoring frequency, medication adherence, side effect severity, background
      hypertension prevalence, antihypertensive medication treatment, case fatality,
      incidence and prevalence, and cardiovascular disease treatment costs. Median
      antihypertensive costs from Shanghai and Yunnan province were entered into the
      model in order to estimate the effects of very low and high drug prices.
      Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than the per capita gross domestic
      product of China (11,900 international dollars [Int$] in 2015) were considered
      cost-effective. Treating hypertensive adults with prior cardiovascular disease
      for secondary prevention was projected to be cost saving in the main simulation
      and 100% of probabilistic simulation results. Treating all hypertension for
      primary and secondary prevention would prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular
      disease events annually (95% uncertainty interval, 0.6 to 1.0 million) and was
      borderline cost-effective incremental to treating only cardiovascular disease and
      stage two patients (2015 Int$13,000 per QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval,
      Int$10,000 to Int$18,000]). Of all one-way sensitivity analyses, assuming
      adherence to taking medications as low as 25%, high Shanghai drug costs, or low
      medication efficacy led to the most unfavorable results (treating all
      hypertension, about Int$47,000, Int$37,000, and Int$27,000 per QALY were gained, 
      respectively). The strengths of this study were the use of a recent Chinese
      national health survey, vital statistics, health care costs, and cohort study
      outcomes data as model inputs and reliance on clinical-trial-based estimates of
      coronary heart disease and stroke risk reduction due to antihypertensive
      medication treatment. The limitations of the study were the use of several
      sources of data, limited clinical trial evidence for medication effectiveness and
      harms in the youngest and oldest age groups, lack of information about geographic
      and ethnic subgroups, lack of specific information about indirect costs borne by 
      patients, and uncertainty about the future epidemiology of cardiovascular
      diseases in China. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded hypertension treatment has the potential
      to prevent about 800,000 cardiovascular disease events annually and be borderline
      cost-effective in China, provided low-cost essential antihypertensive medicines
      programs can be implemented.

      Multistate Life Table Modeling in New Zealand.
PG  - e1001856
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001856 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Countries are increasingly considering how to reduce or even end
      tobacco consumption, and raising tobacco taxes is a potential strategy to achieve
      these goals. We estimated the impacts on health, health inequalities, and health 
      system costs of ongoing tobacco tax increases (10% annually from 2011 to 2031,
      compared to no tax increases from 2011 ["business as usual," BAU]), in a country 
      (New Zealand) with large ethnic inequalities in smoking-related and
      noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We modeled 16
      tobacco-related diseases in parallel, using rich national data by sex, age, and
      ethnicity, to estimate undiscounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained
      and net health system costs over the remaining life of the 2011 population (n =
      4.4 million). A total of 260,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 155,000-419,000)
      QALYs were gained among the 2011 cohort exposed to annual tobacco tax increases, 
      compared to BAU, and cost savings were US$2,550 million (95% UI: US$1,480 to
      US$4,000). QALY gains and cost savings took 50 y to peak, owing to such factors
      as the price sensitivity of youth and young adult smokers. The QALY gains per
      capita were 3.7 times greater for Maori (indigenous population) compared to
      non-Maori because of higher background smoking prevalence and price sensitivity
      in Maori. Health inequalities measured by differences in 45+ y-old standardized
      mortality rates between Maori and non-Maori were projected to be 2.31% (95% UI:
      1.49% to 3.41%) less in 2041 with ongoing tax rises, compared to BAU. Percentage 
      reductions in inequalities in 2041 were maximal for 45-64-y-old women (3.01%). As
      with all such modeling, there were limitations pertaining to the model structure 
      and input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing tobacco tax increases deliver sizeable
      health gains and health sector cost savings and are likely to reduce health
      inequalities. However, if policy makers are to achieve more rapid reductions in
      the NCD burden and health inequalities, they will also need to complement tobacco
      tax increases with additional tobacco control interventions focused on cessation.

TI  - Glitazone Treatment and Incidence of Parkinson's Disease among People with
      Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001854
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001854 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent in vitro and animal experiments suggest that peroxisome
      proliferation-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) agonist medications, such as
      antidiabetic glitazone (GTZ) drugs, are neuroprotective in models of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). These findings have not been tested in humans. We hypothesized that
      individuals prescribed GTZ drugs would have a lower incidence of PD compared to
      individuals prescribed other treatments for diabetes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using
      primary care data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink
      (CPRD), we conducted a retrospective cohort study in which individuals with
      diabetes who were newly prescribed GTZ (GTZ-exposed group) were matched by age,
      sex, practice, and diabetes treatment stage with up to five individuals
      prescribed other diabetes treatments (other antidiabetic drug-exposed group).
      Patients were followed up from 1999 until the first recording of a PD diagnosis, 
      end of observation in the database, or end of the study (1 August 2013). An
      incidence rate ratio (IRR) was calculated using conditional Poisson regression,
      adjusted for possible confounders. 44,597 GTZ exposed individuals were matched to
      120,373 other antidiabetic users. 175 GTZ-exposed individuals were diagnosed with
      PD compared to 517 individuals in the other antidiabetic drug-exposed group. The 
      incidence rate (IR) of PD in the GTZ-exposed group was 6.4 per 10,000 patient
      years compared with 8.8 per 10,000 patient years in those prescribed other
      antidiabetic treatments (IRR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.87).
      Adjustments for potential confounding variables, including smoking, other
      medications, head injury, and disease severity, had no material impact (fully
      adjusted IRR 0.75, 0.59-0.94). The risk was reduced in those with current GTZ
      prescriptions (current GTZ-exposed IRR 0.59, 0.46-0.77) but not reduced among
      those with past prescriptions (past GTZ-exposed IRR 0.85, 0.65-1.10). Our study
      only included patients with diabetes who did not have a PD diagnosis when they
      were first prescribed GTZ, and thus, it cannot establish whether GTZ use prevents
      or slows the progression of PD. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes, a current
      prescription for GTZ is associated with a reduction in incidence of PD. This
      suggests PPAR gamma pathways may be a fruitful drug target in PD.

TI  - HHEX_23 AA Genotype Exacerbates Effect of Diabetes on Dementia and Alzheimer
      Disease: A Population-Based Longitudinal Study.
PG  - e1001853
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001853 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has suggested that variations within the IDE/HHEX gene
      region may underlie the association of type 2 diabetes with Alzheimer disease
      (AD). We sought to explore whether IDE genes play a role in the association of
      diabetes with dementia, AD, and structural brain changes using data from two
      community-based cohorts of older adults and a subsample with structural MRI.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The first cohort, which included dementia-free adults aged 
      >/=75 y (n = 970) at baseline, was followed for 9 y to detect incident dementia
      (n = 358) and AD (n = 271) cases. The second cohort (for replication), which
      included 2,060 dementia-free participants aged >/=60 y at baseline, was followed 
      for 6 y to identify incident dementia (n = 166) and AD (n = 121) cases. A
      subsample (n = 338) of dementia-free participants from the second cohort
      underwent MRI. HHEX_23 and IDE_9 were genotyped, and diabetes (here including
      type 2 diabetes and prediabetes) was assessed. In the first cohort, diabetes led 
      to an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.32) and 1.66 (95% CI
      1.06-2.40) for dementia and AD, respectively, among all participants. Compared to
      people carrying the GG genotype without diabetes, AA genotype carriers with
      diabetes had an adjusted HR of 5.54 (95% CI 2.40-7.18) and 4.81 (95% CI
      1.88-8.50) for dementia and AD, respectively. There was a significant interaction
      between HHEX_23-AA and diabetes on dementia (HR 4.79, 95% CI 1.63-8.90, p =
      0.013) and AD (HR 3.55, 95% CI 1.45-9.91, p = 0.025) compared to the GG genotype 
      without diabetes. In the second cohort, the HRs were 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.99) and 
      1.64 (1.02-2.33) for the diabetes-AD and dementia-AD associations, respectively, 
      and 4.06 (95% CI 1.06-7.58, p = 0.039) and 3.29 (95% CI 1.02-8.33, p = 0.044) for
      the interactions, respectively. MRI data showed that HHEX_23-AA carriers with
      diabetes had significant structural brain changes compared to HHEX_23-GG carriers
      without diabetes. No joint effects of IDE_9 and diabetes on dementia were shown. 
      As a limitation, the sample sizes were small for certain subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A variant in the HHEX_23 gene interacts with diabetes to be associated with a
      substantially increased risk of dementia and AD, and with structural brain
      changes among dementia-free elderly people.

TI  - Risk of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes among Women Practicing Poor Sanitation in
      Rural India: A Population-Based Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001851
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001851 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of maternal sanitation behaviour during pregnancy for 
      birth outcomes remains unclear. Poor sanitation practices can promote infection
      and induce stress during pregnancy and may contribute to adverse pregnancy
      outcomes (APOs). We aimed to assess whether poor sanitation practices were
      associated with increased risk of APOs such as preterm birth and low birth weight
      in a population-based study in rural India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective
      cohort of pregnant women (n = 670) in their first trimester of pregnancy was
      enrolled and followed until birth. Socio-demographic, clinical, and
      anthropometric factors, along with access to toilets and sanitation practices,
      were recorded at enrolment (12th week of gestation). A trained community health
      volunteer conducted home visits to ensure retention in the study and learn about 
      study outcomes during the course of pregnancy. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and
      adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals for APOs were estimated 
      by logistic regression models. Of the 667 women who were retained at the end of
      the study, 58.2% practiced open defecation and 25.7% experienced APOs, including 
      130 (19.4%) preterm births, 95 (14.2%) births with low birth weight, 11 (1.7%)
      spontaneous abortions, and six (0.9%) stillbirths. Unadjusted ORs for APOs (OR:
      2.53; 95% CI: 1.72-3.71), preterm birth (OR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.54-3.62), and low
      birth weight (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.24-3.23) were found to be significantly
      associated with open defecation practices. After adjustment for potential
      confounders such as maternal socio-demographic and clinical factors, open
      defecation was still significantly associated with increased odds of APOs (AOR:
      2.38; 95% CI: 1.49-3.80) and preterm birth (AOR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.29-3.79) but not
      low birth weight (AOR: 1.61; 95% CI: 0.94-2.73). The association between APOs and
      open defecation was independent of poverty and caste. Even though we accounted
      for several key confounding factors in our estimates, the possibility of residual
      confounding should not be ruled out. We did not identify specific exposure
      pathways that led to the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first
      evidence, to our knowledge, that poor sanitation is associated with a higher risk
      of APOs. Additional studies are required to elucidate the socio-behavioural
      and/or biological basis of this association so that appropriate targeted
      interventions might be designed to support improved birth outcomes in vulnerable 
      populations. While it is intuitive to expect that caste and poverty are
      associated with poor sanitation practice driving APOs, and we cannot rule out
      additional confounders, our results demonstrate that the association of poor
      sanitation practices (open defecation) with these outcomes is independent of
      poverty. Our results support the need to assess the mechanisms, both biological
      and behavioural, by which limited access to improved sanitation leads to APOs.

TI  - The Mistreatment of Women during Childbirth in Health Facilities Globally: A
      Mixed-Methods Systematic Review.
PG  - e1001847; discussion e1001847
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001847 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite growing recognition of neglectful, abusive, and disrespectful
      treatment of women during childbirth in health facilities, there is no consensus 
      at a global level on how these occurrences are defined and measured. This
      mixed-methods systematic review aims to synthesize qualitative and quantitative
      evidence on the mistreatment of women during childbirth in health facilities to
      inform the development of an evidence-based typology of the phenomenon. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases and grey
      literature using a predetermined search strategy to identify qualitative,
      quantitative, and mixed-methods studies on the mistreatment of women during
      childbirth across all geographical and income-level settings. We used a thematic 
      synthesis approach to synthesize the qualitative evidence and assessed the
      confidence in the qualitative review findings using the CERQual approach. In
      total, 65 studies were included from 34 countries. Qualitative findings were
      organized under seven domains: (1) physical abuse, (2) sexual abuse, (3) verbal
      abuse, (4) stigma and discrimination, (5) failure to meet professional standards 
      of care, (6) poor rapport between women and providers, and (7) health system
      conditions and constraints. Due to high heterogeneity of the quantitative data,
      we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis; instead, we present descriptions of
      study characteristics, outcome measures, and results. Additional themes
      identified in the quantitative studies are integrated into the typology.
      CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review presents a comprehensive, evidence-based
      typology of the mistreatment of women during childbirth in health facilities, and
      demonstrates that mistreatment can occur at the level of interaction between the 
      woman and provider, as well as through systemic failures at the health facility
      and health system levels. We propose this typology be adopted to describe the
      phenomenon and be used to develop measurement tools and inform future research,
      programs, and interventions.

TI  - Transmission of Multidrug-Resistant and Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis within
      Households: A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001843; discussion e1001843
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001843 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The "fitness" of an infectious pathogen is defined as the ability of 
      the pathogen to survive, reproduce, be transmitted, and cause disease. The
      fitness of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) relative to drug-susceptible 
      tuberculosis is cited as one of the most important determinants of MDRTB spread
      and epidemic size. To estimate the relative fitness of drug-resistant
      tuberculosis cases, we compared the incidence of tuberculosis disease among the
      household contacts of MDRTB index patients to that among the contacts of
      drug-susceptible index patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This 3-y (2010-2013)
      prospective cohort household follow-up study in South Lima and Callao, Peru,
      measured the incidence of tuberculosis disease among 1,055 household contacts of 
      213 MDRTB index cases and 2,362 household contacts of 487 drug-susceptible index 
      cases. A total of 35/1,055 (3.3%) household contacts of 213 MDRTB index cases
      developed tuberculosis disease, while 114/2,362 (4.8%) household contacts of 487 
      drug-susceptible index patients developed tuberculosis disease. The total
      follow-up time for drug-susceptible tuberculosis contacts was 2,620 person-years,
      while the total follow-up time for MDRTB contacts was 1,425 person-years. Using
      multivariate Cox regression to adjust for confounding variables including contact
      HIV status, contact age, socio-economic status, and index case sputum smear
      grade, the hazard ratio for tuberculosis disease among MDRTB household contacts
      was found to be half that for drug-susceptible contacts (hazard ratio 0.56, 95%
      CI 0.34-0.90, p = 0.017). The inference of transmission in this study was limited
      by the lack of genotyping data for household contacts. Capturing incident disease
      only among household contacts may also limit the extrapolation of these findings 
      to the community setting. CONCLUSIONS: The low relative fitness of MDRTB
      estimated by this study improves the chances of controlling drug-resistant
      tuberculosis. However, fitter multidrug-resistant strains that emerge over time
      may make this increasingly difficult.

TI  - Associations between Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors and Alzheimer Disease: A
      Mendelian Randomization Study.
PG  - e1001841; discussion e1001841
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Potentially modifiable risk factors including obesity, diabetes,
      hypertension, and smoking are associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and
      represent promising targets for intervention. However, the causality of these
      associations is unclear. We sought to assess the causal nature of these
      associations using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used
      SNPs associated with each risk factor as instrumental variables in MR analyses.
      We considered type 2 diabetes (T2D, NSNPs = 49), fasting glucose (NSNPs = 36),
      insulin resistance (NSNPs = 10), body mass index (BMI, NSNPs = 32), total
      cholesterol (NSNPs = 73), HDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 71), LDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 
      57), triglycerides (NSNPs = 39), systolic blood pressure (SBP, NSNPs = 24),
      smoking initiation (NSNPs = 1), smoking quantity (NSNPs = 3), university
      completion (NSNPs = 2), and years of education (NSNPs = 1). We calculated MR
      estimates of associations between each exposure and AD risk using an
      inverse-variance weighted approach, with summary statistics of SNP-AD
      associations from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, comprising a
      total of 17,008 individuals with AD and 37,154 cognitively normal elderly
      controls. We found that genetically predicted higher SBP was associated with
      lower AD risk (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [15.4 mm Hg] of SBP [95%
      CI]: 0.75 [0.62-0.91]; p = 3.4 x 10(-3)). Genetically predicted higher SBP was
      also associated with a higher probability of taking antihypertensive medication
      (p = 6.7 x 10(-8)). Genetically predicted smoking quantity was associated with
      lower AD risk (OR per ten cigarettes per day [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.51-0.89]; p = 6.5 
      x 10(-3)), although we were unable to stratify by smoking history; genetically
      predicted smoking initiation was not associated with AD risk (OR = 0.70 [0.37,
      1.33]; p = 0.28). We saw no evidence of causal associations between glycemic
      traits, T2D, BMI, or educational attainment and risk of AD (all p > 0.1).
      Potential limitations of this study include the small proportion of intermediate 
      trait variance explained by genetic variants and other implicit limitations of MR
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Inherited lifetime exposure to higher SBP is associated
      with lower AD risk. These findings suggest that higher blood pressure--or some
      environmental exposure associated with higher blood pressure, such as use of
      antihypertensive medications--may reduce AD risk.

TI  - HIV Programs for Sex Workers: Lessons and Challenges for Developing and
      Delivering Programs.
PG  - e1001808
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001808 [doi]
AB  - There is evidence that HIV prevention programs for sex workers, especially female
      sex workers, are cost-effective in several contexts, including many western
      countries, Thailand, India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and
      Zimbabwe. The evidence that sex worker HIV prevention programs work must not
      inspire complacency but rather a renewed effort to expand, intensify, and
      maximize their impact. The PLOS Collection "Focus on Delivery and Scale:
      Achieving HIV Impact with Sex Workers" highlights major challenges to scaling-up 
      sex worker HIV prevention programs, noting the following: sex worker HIV
      prevention programs are insufficiently guided by understanding of epidemic
      transmission dynamics, situation analyses, and programmatic mapping; sex worker
      HIV and sexually transmitted infection services receive limited domestic
      financing in many countries; many sex worker HIV prevention programs are
      inadequately codified to ensure consistency and quality; and many sex worker HIV 
      prevention programs have not evolved adequately to address informal sex workers, 
      male and transgender sex workers, and mobile- and internet-based sex workers.
      Based on the wider collection of papers, this article presents three major
      clusters of recommendations: (i) HIV programs focused on sex workers should be
      prioritized, developed, and implemented based on robust evidence; (ii) national
      political will and increased funding are needed to increase coverage of effective
      sex worker HIV prevention programs in low and middle income countries; and (iii) 
      comprehensive, integrated, and rapidly evolving HIV programs are needed to ensure
      equitable access to health services for individuals involved in all forms of sex 
      work.

TI  - Shifts in the Antibiotic Susceptibility, Serogroups, and Clonal Complexes of
      Neisseria meningitidis in Shanghai, China: A Time Trend Analysis of the
      Pre-Quinolone and Quinolone Eras.
PG  - e1001838; discussion e1001838
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001838 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones have been used broadly since the end of the 1980s
      and have been recommended for Neisseria meningitidis prophylaxis since 2005 in
      China. The aim of this study was to determine whether and how N. meningitidis
      antimicrobial susceptibility, serogroup prevalence, and clonal complex (CC)
      prevalence shifted in association with the introduction and expanding use of
      quinolones in Shanghai, a region with a traditionally high incidence of invasive 
      disease due to N. meningitidis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 374 N.
      meningitidis isolates collected by the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease
      Control and Prevention between 1965 and 2013 were studied. Shifts in the
      serogroups and CCs were observed, from predominantly serogroup A CC5 (84%) in
      1965-1973 to serogroup A CC1 (58%) in 1974-1985, then to serogroup C or B CC4821 
      (62%) in 2005-2013. The rates of ciprofloxacin nonsusceptibility in N.
      meningitidis disease isolates increased from 0% in 1965-1985 to 84% (31/37) in
      2005-2013 (p < 0.001). Among the ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates, 87%
      (27/31) were assigned to either CC4821 (n = 20) or CC5 (n = 7). The two
      predominant ciprofloxacin-resistant clones were designated ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B and
      ChinaCC5-R14-A. The ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B clone acquired ciprofloxacin resistance by
      a point mutation, and was present in 52% (16/31) of the
      ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible disease isolates. The ChinaCC5-R14-A clone acquired 
      ciprofloxacin resistance by horizontal gene transfer, and was found in 23% (7/31)
      of the ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible disease isolates. The ciprofloxacin
      nonsusceptibility rate was 47% (7/15) among isolates from asymptomatic carriers, 
      and nonsusceptibility was associated with diverse multi-locus sequence typing
      profiles and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. As detected after 2005,
      ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible strains were shared between some of the patients and
      their close contacts. A limitation of this study is that isolates from 1986-2004 
      were not available and that only a small sample of convenience isolates from
      1965-1985 were available. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing prevalence of ciprofloxacin
      resistance since 2005 in Shanghai was associated with the spread of hypervirulent
      lineages CC4821 and CC5. Two resistant meningococcal clones ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B
      and ChinaCC5-R14-A have emerged in Shanghai during the quinolone era.
      Ciprofloxacin should be utilized with caution for the chemoprophylaxis of N.
      meningitidis in China.

TI  - Efficacy of Handwashing with Soap and Nail Clipping on Intestinal Parasitic
      Infections in School-Aged Children: A Factorial Cluster Randomized Controlled
      Trial.
PG  - e1001837; discussion e1001837
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001837 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal parasitic infections are highly endemic among school-aged 
      children in resource-limited settings. To lower their impact, preventive measures
      should be implemented that are sustainable with available resources. The aim of
      this study was to assess the impact of handwashing with soap and nail clipping on
      the prevention of intestinal parasite reinfections. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this
      trial, 367 parasite-negative school-aged children (aged 6-15 y) were randomly
      assigned to receive both, one or the other, or neither of the interventions in a 
      2 x 2 factorial design. Assignment sequence was concealed. After 6 mo of
      follow-up, stool samples were examined using direct, concentration, and Kato-Katz
      methods. Hemoglobin levels were determined using a HemoCue spectrometer. The
      primary study outcomes were prevalence of intestinal parasite reinfection and
      infection intensity. The secondary outcome was anemia prevalence. Analysis was by
      intention to treat. Main effects were adjusted for sex, age, drinking water
      source, latrine use, pre-treatment parasites, handwashing with soap and nail
      clipping at baseline, and the other factor in the additive model. Fourteen
      percent (95% CI: 9% to 19%) of the children in the handwashing with soap
      intervention group were reinfected versus 29% (95% CI: 22% to 36%) in the groups 
      with no handwashing with soap (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.32, 95% CI: 0.17 to
      0.62). Similarly, 17% (95% CI: 12% to 22%) of the children in the nail clipping
      intervention group were reinfected versus 26% (95% CI: 20% to 32%) in the groups 
      with no nail clipping (AOR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.95). Likewise, following the
      intervention, 13% (95% CI: 8% to 18%) of the children in the handwashing group
      were anemic versus 23% (95% CI: 17% to 29%) in the groups with no handwashing
      with soap (AOR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.78). The prevalence of anemia did not
      differ significantly between children in the nail clipping group and those in the
      groups with no nail clipping (AOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.04). The intensive
      follow-up and monitoring during this study made it such that the assessment of
      the observed intervention benefits was under rather ideal circumstances, and
      hence the study could possibly overestimate the effects when compared to usual
      conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Handwashing with soap at key times and weekly nail
      clipping significantly decreased intestinal parasite reinfection rates.
      Furthermore, the handwashing intervention significantly reduced anemia prevalence
      in children. The next essential step should be implementing pragmatic studies and
      developing more effective approaches to promote and implement handwashing with
      soap and nail clipping at larger scales.

TI  - Exposure to second-hand smoke and the risk of tuberculosis in children and
      adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 observational studies.
PG  - e1001835; discussion e1001835
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to WHO Global Health Estimates, tuberculosis (TB) is among 
      the top ten causes of global mortality and ranks second after cardiovascular
      disease in most high-burden regions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis,
      we investigated the role of second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure as a risk factor for
      TB among children and adults. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a systematic
      literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar
      up to August 31, 2014. Our a priori inclusion criteria encompassed only original 
      studies where latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease were diagnosed
      microbiologically, clinically, histologically, or radiologically. Effect
      estimates were pooled using fixed- and random-effects models. We identified 18
      eligible studies, with 30,757 children and 44,432 adult non-smokers, containing
      SHS exposure and TB outcome data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Twelve
      studies assessed children and eight studies assessed adult non-smokers; two
      studies assessed both populations. Summary relative risk (RR) of LTBI associated 
      with SHS exposure in children was similar to the overall effect size, with high
      heterogeneity (pooled RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.00-2.83). Children showed a more than
      3-fold increased risk of SHS-associated active TB (pooled RR 3.41, 95% CI
      1.81-6.45), which was higher than the risk in adults exposed to SHS (summary RR
      1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.68). Positive and significant exposure-response relationships
      were observed among children under 5 y (RR 5.88, 95% CI 2.09-16.54), children
      exposed to SHS through any parent (RR 4.20, 95% CI 1.92-9.20), and children
      living under the most crowded household conditions (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.36-12.98). 
      Associations for LTBI and active TB disease remained significant after adjustment
      for age, biomass fuel (BMF) use, and presence of a TB patient in the household,
      although the meta-analysis was limited to a subset of studies that adjusted for
      these variables. There was a loss of association with increased risk of LTBI (but
      not active TB) after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES) and study quality.
      The major limitation of this analysis is the high heterogeneity in outcomes among
      studies of pediatric cases of LTBI and TB disease. CONCLUSIONS: We found that SHS
      exposure is associated with an increase in the relative risk of LTBI and active
      TB after controlling for age, BMF use, and contact with a TB patient, and there
      was no significant association of SHS exposure with LTBI after adjustment for SES
      and study quality. Given the high heterogeneity among the primary studies, our
      analysis may not show sufficient evidence to confirm an association. In addition,
      considering that the TB burden is highest in countries with increasing SHS
      exposure, it is important to confirm these results with higher quality studies.
      Research in this area may have important implications for TB and tobacco control 
      programs, especially for children in settings with high SHS exposure and TB
      burden.

TI  - Effects of Hormone Therapy on Cognition and Mood in Recently Postmenopausal
      Women: Findings from the Randomized, Controlled KEEPS-Cognitive and Affective
      Study.
PG  - e1001833; discussion e1001833
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001833 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) reportedly increases the risk of
      cognitive decline in women over age 65 y. It is unknown whether similar risks
      exist for recently postmenopausal women, and whether MHT affects mood in younger 
      women. The ancillary Cognitive and Affective Study (KEEPS-Cog) of the Kronos
      Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) examined the effects of up to 4 y of MHT 
      on cognition and mood in recently postmenopausal women. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      KEEPS, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, was
      conducted at nine US academic centers. Of the 727 women enrolled in KEEPS, 693
      (95.3%) participated in the ancillary KEEPS-Cog, with 220 women randomized to
      receive 4 y of 0.45 mg/d oral conjugated equine estrogens (o-CEE) plus 200 mg/d
      micronized progesterone (m-P) for the first 12 d of each month, 211 women
      randomized to receive 50 mug/d transdermal estradiol (t-E2) plus 200 mg/d m-P for
      the first 12 d of each month, and 262 women randomized to receive placebo pills
      and patches. Primary outcomes included the Modified Mini-Mental State
      examination; four cognitive factors: verbal learning/memory, auditory
      attention/working memory, visual attention/executive function, and speeded
      language/mental flexibility; and a mood measure, the Profile of Mood States
      (POMS). MHT effects were analyzed using linear mixed-effects (LME) models, which 
      make full use of all available data from each participant, including those with
      missing data. Data from those with and without full data were compared to assess 
      for potential biases resulting from missing observations. For statistically
      significant results, we calculated effect sizes (ESs) to evaluate the magnitude
      of changes. On average, participants were 52.6 y old, and 1.4 y past their last
      menstrual period. By month 48, 169 (24.4%) and 158 (22.8%) of the 693 women who
      consented for ancillary KEEPS-Cog were lost to follow-up for cognitive assessment
      (3MS and cognitive factors) and mood evaluations (POMS), respectively. However,
      because LME models make full use all available data, including data from women
      with missing data, 95.5% of participants were included in the final analysis (n =
      662 in cognitive analyses, and n = 661 in mood analyses). To be included in
      analyses, women must have provided baseline data, and data from at least one
      post-baseline visit. The mean length of follow-up was 2.85 y (standard deviation 
      [SD] = 0.49) for cognitive outcomes and 2.76 (SD = 0.57) for mood outcomes. No
      treatment-related benefits were found on cognitive outcomes. For mood, model
      estimates indicated that women treated with o-CEE showed improvements in
      depression and anxiety symptoms over the 48 mo of treatment, compared to women on
      placebo. The model estimate for the depression subscale was -5.36 x 10(-2) (95%
      CI, -8.27 x 10(-2) to -2.44 x 10(-2); ES = 0.49, p < 0.001) and for the anxiety
      subscale was -3.01 x 10(-2) (95% CI, -5.09 x 10(-2) to -9.34 x 10(-3); ES = 0.26,
      p < 0.001). Mood outcomes for women randomized to t-E2 were similar to those for 
      women on placebo. Importantly, the KEEPS-Cog results cannot be extrapolated to
      treatment longer than 4 y. CONCLUSIONS: The KEEPS-Cog findings suggest that for
      recently postmenopausal women, MHT did not alter cognition as hypothesized.
      However, beneficial mood effects with small to medium ESs were noted with 4 y of 
      o-CEE, but not with 4 y of t-E2. The generalizability of these findings is
      limited to recently postmenopausal women with low cardiovascular risk profiles.

TI  - Healthy Eating and Risks of Total and Cause-Specific Death among Low-Income
      Populations of African-Americans and Other Adults in the Southeastern United
      States: A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1001830; discussion e1001830
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001830 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A healthy diet, as defined by the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans
      (DGA), has been associated with lower morbidity and mortality from major chronic 
      diseases in studies conducted in predominantly non-Hispanic white individuals. It
      is unknown whether this association can be extrapolated to African-Americans and 
      low-income populations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined the associations of
      adherence to the DGA with total and cause-specific mortality in the Southern
      Community Cohort Study, a prospective study that recruited 84,735 American
      adults, aged 40-79 y, from 12 southeastern US states during 2002-2009, mostly
      through community health centers that serve low-income populations. The present
      analysis included 50,434 African-Americans, 24,054 white individuals, and 3,084
      individuals of other racial/ethnic groups, among whom 42,759 participants had an 
      annual household income less than US$15,000. Usual dietary intakes were assessed 
      using a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Adherence to the DGA 
      was measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), 2010 and 2005 editions (HEI-2010 
      and HEI-2005, respectively). During a mean follow-up of 6.2 y, 6,906 deaths were 
      identified, including 2,244 from cardiovascular disease, 1,794 from cancer, and
      2,550 from other diseases. A higher HEI-2010 score was associated with lower
      risks of disease death, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.80 (95% CI,
      0.73-0.86) for all-disease mortality, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.94) for cardiovascular
      disease mortality, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69-0.95) for cancer mortality, and 0.77 (95%
      CI, 0.67-0.88) for other disease mortality, when comparing the highest quintile
      with the lowest (all p-values for trend < 0.05). Similar inverse associations
      between HEI-2010 score and mortality were observed regardless of sex, race, and
      income (all p-values for interaction > 0.50). Several component scores in the
      HEI-2010, including whole grains, dairy, seafood and plant proteins, and ratio of
      unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, showed significant inverse associations
      with total mortality. HEI-2005 score was also associated with lower disease
      mortality, with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.93) when comparing extreme
      quintiles. Given the observational study design, however, residual confounding
      cannot be completely ruled out. In addition, future studies are needed to
      evaluate the generalizability of these findings to African-Americans of other
      socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed, to our knowledge for the
      first time, that adherence to the DGA was associated with lower total and
      cause-specific mortality in a low-income population, including a large proportion
      of African-Americans, living in the southeastern US.

TI  - Seasonal influenza vaccination for children in Thailand: a cost-effectiveness
      analysis.
PG  - e1001829; discussion e1001829
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Routine
      immunization of children has the potential to reduce this mortality through both 
      direct and indirect protection, but has not been adopted by any low- or
      middle-income countries. We developed a framework to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination policies in developing countries and 
      used it to consider annual vaccination of school- and preschool-aged children
      with either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or trivalent
      live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in Thailand. We also compared these
      approaches with a policy of expanding TIV coverage in the elderly. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We developed an age-structured model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
      of eight vaccination policies parameterized using country-level data from
      Thailand. For policies using LAIV, we considered five different age groups of
      children to vaccinate. We adopted a Bayesian evidence-synthesis framework,
      expressing uncertainty in parameters through probability distributions derived by
      fitting the model to prospectively collected laboratory-confirmed influenza data 
      from 2005-2009, by meta-analysis of clinical trial data, and by using prior
      probability distributions derived from literature review and elicitation of
      expert opinion. We performed sensitivity analyses using alternative assumptions
      about prior immunity, contact patterns between age groups, the proportion of
      infections that are symptomatic, cost per unit vaccine, and vaccine
      effectiveness. Vaccination of children with LAIV was found to be highly
      cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between about 2,000
      and 5,000 international dollars per disability-adjusted life year averted, and
      was consistently preferred to TIV-based policies. These findings were robust to
      extensive sensitivity analyses. The optimal age group to vaccinate with LAIV,
      however, was sensitive both to the willingness to pay for health benefits and to 
      assumptions about contact patterns between age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating
      school-aged children with LAIV is likely to be cost-effective in Thailand in the 
      short term, though the long-term consequences of such a policy cannot be reliably
      predicted given current knowledge of influenza epidemiology and immunology. Our
      work provides a coherent framework that can be used for similar analyses in other
      low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - How Has the Age-Related Process of Overweight or Obesity Development Changed over
      Time? Co-ordinated Analyses of Individual Participant Data from Five United
      Kingdom Birth Cohorts.
PG  - e1001828; discussion e1001828
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information on secular trends in the
      age-related process by which people develop overweight or obesity. Utilizing
      longitudinal data in the United Kingdom birth cohort studies, we investigated
      shifts over the past nearly 70 years in the distribution of body mass index (BMI)
      and development of overweight or obesity across childhood and adulthood. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: The sample comprised 56,632 participants with 273,843 BMI
      observations in the 1946 Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and
      Development (NSHD; ages 2-64 years), 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS;
      7-50), 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS; 10-42), 1991 Avon Longitudinal Study of
      Parents and Children (ALSPAC; 7-18), or 2001 Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; 3-11).
      Growth references showed a secular trend toward positive skewing of the BMI
      distribution at younger ages. During childhood, the 50th centiles for all studies
      lay in the middle of the International Obesity Task Force normal weight range,
      but during adulthood, the age when a 50th centile first entered the overweight
      range (i.e., 25-29.9 kg/m2) decreased across NSHD, NCDS, and BCS from 41 to 33 to
      30 years in males and 48 to 44 to 41 years in females. Trajectories of overweight
      or obesity showed that more recently born cohorts developed greater probabilities
      of overweight or obesity at younger ages. Overweight or obesity became more
      probable in NCDS than NSHD in early adulthood, but more probable in BCS than NCDS
      and NSHD in adolescence, for example. By age 10 years, the estimated
      probabilities of overweight or obesity in cohorts born after the 1980s were 2-3
      times greater than those born before the 1980s (e.g., 0.229 [95% CI 0.219-0.240] 
      in MCS males; 0.071 [0.065-0.078] in NSHD males). It was not possible to (1)
      model separate trajectories for overweight and obesity, because there were few
      obesity cases at young ages in the earliest-born cohorts, or (2) consider ethnic 
      minority groups. The end date for analyses was August 2014. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results demonstrate how younger generations are likely to accumulate greater
      exposure to overweight or obesity throughout their lives and, thus, increased
      risk for chronic health conditions such as coronary heart disease and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. In the absence of effective intervention, overweight and
      obesity will have severe public health consequences in decades to come.

TI  - The health system and population health implications of large-scale diabetes
      screening in India: a microsimulation model of alternative approaches.
PG  - e1001827; discussion e1001827
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001827 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Like a growing number of rapidly developing countries, India has
      begun to develop a system for large-scale community-based screening for diabetes.
      We sought to identify the implications of using alternative screening instruments
      to detect people with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes among diverse populations
      across India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed and validated a microsimulation 
      model that incorporated data from 58 studies from across the country into a
      nationally representative sample of Indians aged 25-65 y old. We estimated the
      diagnostic and health system implications of three major survey-based screening
      instruments and random glucometer-based screening. Of the 567 million Indians
      eligible for screening, depending on which of four screening approaches is
      utilized, between 158 and 306 million would be expected to screen as "high risk" 
      for type 2 diabetes, and be referred for confirmatory testing. Between 26 million
      and 37 million of these people would be expected to meet international diagnostic
      criteria for diabetes, but between 126 million and 273 million would be "false
      positives." The ratio of false positives to true positives varied from 3.9 (when 
      using random glucose screening) to 8.2 (when using a survey-based screening
      instrument) in our model. The cost per case found would be expected to be from
      US$5.28 (when using random glucose screening) to US$17.06 (when using a
      survey-based screening instrument), presenting a total cost of between US$169 and
      US$567 million. The major limitation of our analysis is its dependence on
      published cohort studies that are unlikely fully to capture the poorest and most 
      rural areas of the country. Because these areas are thought to have the lowest
      diabetes prevalence, this may result in overestimation of the efficacy and health
      benefits of screening. CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale community-based screening is
      anticipated to produce a large number of false-positive results, particularly if 
      using currently available survey-based screening instruments. Resource allocators
      should consider the health system burden of screening and confirmatory testing
      when instituting large-scale community-based screening for diabetes.

TI  - Use of Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Drugs in India: Central Regulatory Approval
      and Sales of FDCs Containing Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs),
      Metformin, or Psychotropic Drugs.
PG  - e1001826; discussion e1001826
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001826 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2012, an Indian parliamentary committee reported that
      manufacturing licenses for large numbers of fixed dose combination (FDC) drugs
      had been issued by state authorities without prior approval of the Central Drugs 
      Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in violation of rules, and considered that 
      some ambiguity until 1 May 2002 about states' powers might have contributed. To
      our knowledge, no systematic enquiry has been undertaken to determine if evidence
      existed to support these findings. We investigated CDSCO approvals for and
      availability of oral FDC drugs in four therapeutic areas: analgesia
      (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), diabetes (metformin),
      depression/anxiety (anti-depressants/benzodiazepines), and psychosis
      (anti-psychotics). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was an ecologic study with a
      time-trend analysis of FDC sales volumes (2007-2012) and a cross-sectional
      examination of 2011-2012 data to establish the numbers of formulations on the
      market with and without a record of CDSCO approval ("approved" and "unapproved"),
      their branded products, and sales volumes. Data from the CDSCO on approved FDC
      formulations were compared with sales data from PharmaTrac, a database of
      national drug sales. We determined the proportions of FDC sales volumes
      (2011-2012) arising from centrally approved and unapproved formulations and from 
      formulations including drugs banned/restricted internationally. We also
      determined the proportions of centrally approved and unapproved formulations
      marketed before and after 1 May 2002, when amendments were made to the drug
      rules. FDC approvals in India, the United Kingdom (UK), and United States of
      America (US) were compared. For NSAID FDCs, 124 formulations were marketed, of
      which 34 (27%) were centrally approved and 90 (73%) were unapproved; metformin:
      25 formulations, 20 (80%) approved, five (20%) unapproved;
      anti-depressants/benzodiazepines: 16 formulations, three (19%) approved, 13 (81%)
      unapproved; anti-psychotics: ten formulations, three (30%) approved, seven (70%) 
      unapproved. After 1 May 2002, the proportions of approved FDC formulations
      increased for NSAIDs (26%/28%) and anti-psychotics (0%/38%) and decreased for
      metformin (100%/75%) and anti-depressants/benzodiazepines (20%/18%), and the
      overall proportion approved remained similar before and after that date. FDC
      formulations gave rise to multiple branded products, ranging from 211
      anti-psychotic FDC products from ten formulations to 2,739 NSAID FDC products
      from 124 formulations. The proportions of FDC sales volumes arising from
      unapproved formulations were as follows: anti-depressants/benzodiazepines, 69%;
      anti-psychotics, 43%; NSAIDs, 28%; and metformin, 0.4%. Formulations including
      drugs banned/restricted internationally comprised over 12% of NSAID FDC sales and
      53% of anti-psychotic FDC sales. Across the four therapeutic areas, 14 FDC
      formulations were approved in the UK and 22 in the US. CONCLUSIONS: There was
      evidence supporting concerns about FDCs. Metformin excepted, substantial numbers 
      of centrally unapproved formulations for NSAID, anti-depressant/benzodiazepine,
      and anti-psychotic FDCs were marketed; sales volumes were high. The legal need
      for central approval of new drugs before manufacture has been in place
      continuously since 1961, including for FDCs meeting the applicable legal test.
      Proportions of centrally unapproved formulations after 1 May 2002 did not
      decrease overall, and no ambiguity was found about states' licensing powers.
      Unapproved formulations should be banned immediately, prioritising those
      withdrawn/banned internationally and undertaking a review of benefits and risks
      for patients in ceasing or switching to other medicines. Drug laws need to be
      amended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medicines marketed in India.

TI  - Defining the in vivo phenotype of artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria: a
      modelling approach.
PG  - e1001823
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria has emerged in Southeast
      Asia, posing a major threat to malaria control. It is characterised by delayed
      asexual-stage parasite clearance, which is the reference comparator for the
      molecular marker 'Kelch 13' and in vitro sensitivity tests. However, current
      cut-off values denoting slow clearance based on the proportion of individuals
      remaining parasitaemic on the third day of treatment ('day-3'), or on peripheral 
      blood parasite half-life, are not well supported. We here explore the parasite
      clearance distributions in an area of artemisinin resistance with the aim
      refining the in vivo phenotypic definitions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from
      1,518 patients on the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodian borders with parasite
      half-life assessments after artesunate treatment were analysed. Half-lives
      followed a bimodal distribution. A statistical approach was developed to infer
      the characteristics of the component distributions and their relative
      contribution to the composite mixture. A model representing two parasite
      subpopulations with geometric mean (IQR) parasite half-lives of 3.0 (2.4-3.9)
      hours and 6.50 (5.7-7.4) hours was consistent with the data. For individual
      patients, the parasite half-life provided a predicted likelihood of an
      artemisinin-resistant infection which depends on the population prevalence of
      resistance in that area. Consequently, a half-life where the probability is 0.5
      varied between 3.5 and 5.5 hours. Using this model, the current 'day-3' cut-off
      value of 10% predicts the potential presence of artemisinin-resistant infections 
      in most but not all scenarios. These findings are relevant to the
      low-transmission setting of Southeast Asia. Generalisation to a high transmission
      setting as in regions of Sub-Saharan Africa will need additional evaluation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Characterisation of overlapping distributions of parasite half-lives
      provides quantitative insight into the relationship between parasite clearance
      and artemisinin resistance, as well as the predictive value of the 10% cut-off in
      'day-3' parasitaemia. The findings are important for the interpretation of in
      vitro sensitivity tests and molecular markers for artemisinin resistance and for 
      contextualising the 'day 3' threshold to account for initial parasitaemia and
      sample size.

      cohort study.
PG  - e1001820
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomized trial of voluntary medical male circumcision (MC) of
      HIV-infected men reported increased HIV transmission to female partners among men
      who resumed sexual intercourse prior to wound healing. We conducted a prospective
      observational study to assess penile HIV shedding after MC. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      HIV shedding was evaluated among 223 HIV-infected men (183 self-reported not
      receiving antiretroviral therapy [ART], 11 self-reported receiving ART and had a 
      detectable plasma viral load [VL], and 29 self-reported receiving ART and had an 
      undetectable plasma VL [<400 copies/ml]) in Rakai, Uganda, between June 2009 and 
      April 2012. Preoperative and weekly penile lavages collected for 6 wk and then at
      12 wk were tested for HIV shedding and VL using a real-time quantitative PCR
      assay. Unadjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) and adjusted PRRs (adjPRRs) of
      HIV shedding were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust
      variance. HIV shedding was detected in 9.3% (17/183) of men not on ART prior to
      surgery and 39.3% (72/183) of these men during the entire study. Relative to
      baseline, the proportion shedding was significantly increased after MC at 1 wk
      (PRR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.12-3.14, p = 0.012), 2 wk (PRR = 3.16, 95% CI =
      1.94-5.13, p < 0.001), and 3 wk (PRR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.19-3.28, p = 0.008) after
      MC. However, compared to baseline, HIV shedding was decreased by 6 wk after MC
      (PRR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.09-0.83, p = 0.023) and remained suppressed at 12 wk
      after MC (PRR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06-0.64, p = 0.008). Detectable HIV shedding
      from MC wounds occurred in more study visits among men with an HIV plasma VL >
      50,000 copies/ml than among those with an HIV plasma VL < 400 copies/ml (adjPRR =
      10.3, 95% CI = 4.25-24.90, p < 0.001). Detectable HIV shedding was less common in
      visits from men with healed MC wounds compared to visits from men without healed 
      wounds (adjPRR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.07-0.23, p < 0.001) and in visits from men on
      ART with undetectable plasma VL compared to men not on ART (PRR = 0.15, 95% CI = 
      0.05-0.43, p = 0.001). Among men with detectable penile HIV shedding, the median 
      log10 HIV copies/milliliter of lavage fluid was significantly lower in men with
      ART-induced undetectable plasma VL (1.93, interquartile range [IQR] = 1.83-2.14) 
      than in men not on ART (2.63, IQR = 2.28-3.22, p < 0.001). Limitations of this
      observational study include significant differences in baseline covariates, lack 
      of confirmed receipt of ART for individuals who reported ART use, and lack of
      information on potential ART initiation during follow-up for those who were not
      on ART at enrollment. CONCLUSION: Penile HIV shedding is significantly reduced
      after healing of MC wounds. Lower plasma VL is associated with decreased
      frequency and quantity of HIV shedding from MC wounds. Starting ART prior to MC
      should be considered to reduce male-to-female HIV transmission risk. Research is 
      needed to assess the time on ART required to decrease shedding, and the
      acceptability and feasibility of initiating ART at the time of MC.

TI  - Evaluating clinical trial designs for investigational treatments of Ebola virus
      disease.
PG  - e1001815
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001815 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental treatments for Ebola virus disease (EVD) might reduce
      EVD mortality. There is uncertainty about the ability of different clinical trial
      designs to identify effective treatments, and about the feasibility of
      implementing individually randomised controlled trials during an Ebola epidemic. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: A treatment evaluation programme for use in EVD was devised
      using a multi-stage approach (MSA) with two or three stages, including both
      non-randomised and randomised elements. The probabilities of rightly or wrongly
      recommending the experimental treatment, the required sample size, and the
      consequences for epidemic outcomes over 100 d under two epidemic scenarios were
      compared for the MSA, a sequential randomised controlled trial (SRCT) with up to 
      20 interim analyses, and, as a reference case, a conventional randomised
      controlled trial (RCT) without interim analyses. Assuming 50% 14-d survival in
      the population treated with the current standard of supportive care, all designs 
      had similar probabilities of identifying effective treatments correctly, while
      the MSA was less likely to recommend treatments that were ineffective. The MSA
      led to a smaller number of cases receiving ineffective treatments and faster
      roll-out of highly effective treatments. For less effective treatments, the MSA
      had a high probability of including an RCT component, leading to a somewhat
      longer time to roll-out or rejection. Assuming 100 new EVD cases per day, the MSA
      led to between 6% and 15% greater reductions in epidemic mortality over the first
      100 d for highly effective treatments compared to the SRCT. Both the MSA and SRCT
      led to substantially fewer deaths than a conventional RCT if the tested
      interventions were either highly effective or harmful. In the proposed MSA, the
      major threat to the validity of the results of the non-randomised components is
      that referral patterns, standard of care, or the virus itself may change during
      the study period in ways that affect mortality. Adverse events are also harder to
      quantify without a concurrent control group. CONCLUSIONS: The MSA discards
      ineffective treatments quickly, while reliably providing evidence concerning
      effective treatments. The MSA is appropriate for the clinical evaluation of EVD
      treatments.

TI  - Geographic and temporal trends in the molecular epidemiology and genetic
      mechanisms of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance: an individual-patient- and
      sequence-level meta-analysis.
PG  - e1001810
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001810 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regional and subtype-specific mutational patterns of HIV-1
      transmitted drug resistance (TDR) are essential for informing first-line
      antiretroviral (ARV) therapy guidelines and designing diagnostic assays for use
      in regions where standard genotypic resistance testing is not affordable. We
      sought to understand the molecular epidemiology of TDR and to identify the HIV-1 
      drug-resistance mutations responsible for TDR in different regions and virus
      subtypes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed all GenBank submissions of HIV-1
      reverse transcriptase sequences with or without protease and identified 287
      studies published between March 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, with more than 25
      recently or chronically infected ARV-naive individuals. These studies comprised
      50,870 individuals from 111 countries. Each set of study sequences was analyzed
      for phylogenetic clustering and the presence of 93 surveillance drug-resistance
      mutations (SDRMs). The median overall TDR prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
      south/southeast Asia (SSEA), upper-income Asian countries, Latin
      America/Caribbean, Europe, and North America was 2.8%, 2.9%, 5.6%, 7.6%, 9.4%,
      and 11.5%, respectively. In SSA, there was a yearly 1.09-fold (95% CI: 1.05-1.14)
      increase in odds of TDR since national ARV scale-up attributable to an increase
      in non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance. The odds of
      NNRTI-associated TDR also increased in Latin America/Caribbean (odds ratio [OR] =
      1.16; 95% CI: 1.06-1.25), North America (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.26), Europe
      (OR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13), and upper-income Asian countries (OR = 1.33; 95% 
      CI: 1.12-1.55). In SSEA, there was no significant change in the odds of TDR since
      national ARV scale-up (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.92-1.02). An analysis limited to
      sequences with mixtures at less than 0.5% of their nucleotide positions-a proxy
      for recent infection-yielded trends comparable to those obtained using the
      complete dataset. Four NNRTI SDRMs-K101E, K103N, Y181C, and G190A-accounted for
      >80% of NNRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. Sixteen nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) SDRMs accounted for >69% of
      NRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. In SSA and SSEA, 89% of NNRTI
      SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to nevirapine or efavirenz,
      whereas only 27% of NRTI SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to
      zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir, or abacavir. Of 763 viruses with TDR in SSA
      and SSEA, 725 (95%) were genetically dissimilar; 38 (5%) formed 19 sequence
      pairs. Inherent limitations of this study are that some cohorts may not represent
      the broader regional population and that studies were heterogeneous with respect 
      to duration of infection prior to sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Most TDR strains in SSA 
      and SSEA arose independently, suggesting that ARV regimens with a high genetic
      barrier to resistance combined with improved patient adherence may mitigate TDR
      increases by reducing the generation of new ARV-resistant strains. A small number
      of NNRTI-resistance mutations were responsible for most cases of high-level
      resistance, suggesting that inexpensive point-mutation assays to detect these
      mutations may be useful for pre-therapy screening in regions with high levels of 
      TDR. In the context of a public health approach to ARV therapy, a reliable
      point-of-care genotypic resistance test could identify which patients should
      receive standard first-line therapy and which should receive a
      protease-inhibitor-containing regimen.

TI  - Development and validation of a risk score for chronic kidney disease in HIV
      infection using prospective cohort data from the D:A:D study.
PG  - e1001809
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue for HIV-positive
      individuals, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Development and
      implementation of a risk score model for CKD would allow comparison of the risks 
      and benefits of adding potentially nephrotoxic antiretrovirals to a treatment
      regimen and would identify those at greatest risk of CKD. The aims of this study 
      were to develop a simple, externally validated, and widely applicable long-term
      risk score model for CKD in HIV-positive individuals that can guide decision
      making in clinical practice. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 17,954 HIV-positive
      individuals from the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) 
      study with >/=3 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values after 1
      January 2004 were included. Baseline was defined as the first eGFR > 60
      ml/min/1.73 m2 after 1 January 2004; individuals with exposure to tenofovir,
      atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, other boosted protease
      inhibitors before baseline were excluded. CKD was defined as confirmed (>3 mo
      apart) eGFR </= 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Poisson regression was used to develop a risk 
      score, externally validated on two independent cohorts. In the D:A:D study, 641
      individuals developed CKD during 103,185 person-years of follow-up (PYFU;
      incidence 6.2/1,000 PYFU, 95% CI 5.7-6.7; median follow-up 6.1 y, range 0.3-9.1
      y). Older age, intravenous drug use, hepatitis C coinfection, lower baseline
      eGFR, female gender, lower CD4 count nadir, hypertension, diabetes, and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) predicted CKD. The adjusted incidence rate ratios of
      these nine categorical variables were scaled and summed to create the risk score.
      The median risk score at baseline was -2 (interquartile range -4 to 2). There was
      a 1:393 chance of developing CKD in the next 5 y in the low risk group (risk
      score < 0, 33 events), rising to 1:47 and 1:6 in the medium (risk score 0-4, 103 
      events) and high risk groups (risk score >/= 5, 505 events), respectively. Number
      needed to harm (NNTH) at 5 y when starting unboosted atazanavir or
      lopinavir/ritonavir among those with a low risk score was 1,702 (95% CI
      1,166-3,367); NNTH was 202 (95% CI 159-278) and 21 (95% CI 19-23), respectively, 
      for those with a medium and high risk score. NNTH was 739 (95% CI 506-1462), 88
      (95% CI 69-121), and 9 (95% CI 8-10) for those with a low, medium, and high risk 
      score, respectively, starting tenofovir, atazanavir/ritonavir, or another boosted
      protease inhibitor. The Royal Free Hospital Clinic Cohort included 2,548
      individuals, of whom 94 individuals developed CKD (3.7%) during 18,376 PYFU
      (median follow-up 7.4 y, range 0.3-12.7 y). Of 2,013 individuals included from
      the SMART/ESPRIT control arms, 32 individuals developed CKD (1.6%) during 8,452
      PYFU (median follow-up 4.1 y, range 0.6-8.1 y). External validation showed that
      the risk score predicted well in these cohorts. Limitations of this study
      included limited data on race and no information on proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS:
      Both traditional and HIV-related risk factors were predictive of CKD. These
      factors were used to develop a risk score for CKD in HIV infection, externally
      validated, that has direct clinical relevance for patients and clinicians to
      weigh the benefits of certain antiretrovirals against the risk of CKD and to
      identify those at greatest risk of CKD.

TI  - Broad blockade antibody responses in human volunteers after immunization with a
      multivalent norovirus VLP candidate vaccine: immunological analyses from a phase 
      I clinical trial.
PG  - e1001807
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001807 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human noroviruses (NoVs) are the primary cause of acute
      gastroenteritis and are characterized by antigenic variation between genogroups
      and genotypes and antigenic drift of strains within the predominant GII.4
      genotype. In the context of this diversity, an effective NoV vaccine must elicit 
      broadly protective immunity. We used an antibody (Ab) binding blockade assay to
      measure the potential cross-strain protection provided by a multivalent NoV
      virus-like particle (VLP) candidate vaccine in human volunteers. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: Sera from ten human volunteers immunized with a multivalent NoV VLP
      vaccine (genotypes GI.1/GII.4) were analyzed for IgG and Ab blockade of VLP
      interaction with carbohydrate ligand, a potential correlate of protective
      immunity to NoV infection and illness. Immunization resulted in rapid rises in
      IgG and blockade Ab titers against both vaccine components and additional VLPs
      representing diverse strains and genotypes not represented in the vaccine.
      Importantly, vaccination induced blockade Ab to two novel GII.4 strains not in
      circulation at the time of vaccination or sample collection. GII.4 cross-reactive
      blockade Ab titers were more potent than responses against non-GII.4 VLPs,
      suggesting that previous exposure history to this dominant circulating genotype
      may impact the vaccine Ab response. Further, antigenic cartography indicated that
      vaccination preferentially activated preexisting Ab responses to epitopes
      associated with GII.4.1997. Study interpretations may be limited by the relevance
      of the surrogate neutralization assay and the number of immunized participants
      evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with a multivalent NoV VLP vaccine induces a 
      broadly blocking Ab response to multiple epitopes within vaccine and non-vaccine 
      NoV strains and to novel antigenic variants not yet circulating at the time of
      vaccination. These data reveal new information about complex NoV immune responses
      to both natural exposure and to vaccination, and support the potential
      feasibility of an efficacious multivalent NoV VLP vaccine for future use in human
      populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01168401.

TI  - Reassessment of HIV-1 acute phase infectivity: accounting for heterogeneity and
      study design with simulated cohorts.
PG  - e1001801
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001801 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The infectivity of the HIV-1 acute phase has been directly measured
      only once, from a retrospectively identified cohort of serodiscordant
      heterosexual couples in Rakai, Uganda. Analyses of this cohort underlie the
      widespread view that the acute phase is highly infectious, even more so than
      would be predicted from its elevated viral load, and that transmission occurring 
      shortly after infection may therefore compromise interventions that rely on
      diagnosis and treatment, such as antiretroviral treatment as prevention (TasP).
      Here, we re-estimate the duration and relative infectivity of the acute phase,
      while accounting for several possible sources of bias in published estimates,
      including the retrospective cohort exclusion criteria and unmeasured
      heterogeneity in risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated acute phase infectivity
      using two approaches. First, we combined viral load trajectories and viral
      load-infectivity relationships to estimate infectivity trajectories over the
      course of infection, under the assumption that elevated acute phase infectivity
      is caused by elevated viral load alone. Second, we estimated the relative hazard 
      of transmission during the acute phase versus the chronic phase (RHacute) and the
      acute phase duration (dacute) by fitting a couples transmission model to the
      Rakai retrospective cohort using approximate Bayesian computation. Our model fit 
      the data well and accounted for characteristics overlooked by previous analyses, 
      including individual heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility and the
      retrospective cohort's exclusion of couples that were recorded as serodiscordant 
      only once before being censored by loss to follow-up, couple dissolution, or
      study termination. Finally, we replicated two highly cited analyses of the Rakai 
      data on simulated data to identify biases underlying the discrepancies between
      previous estimates and our own. From the Rakai data, we estimated RHacute = 5.3
      (95% credibility interval [95% CrI]: 0.79-57) and dacute = 1.7 mo (95% CrI:
      0.55-6.8). The wide credibility intervals reflect an inability to distinguish a
      long, mildly infectious acute phase from a short, highly infectious acute phase, 
      given the 10-mo Rakai observation intervals. The total additional risk, measured 
      as excess hazard-months attributable to the acute phase (EHMacute) can be
      estimated more precisely: EHMacute = (RHacute - 1) x dacute, and should be
      interpreted with respect to the 120 hazard-months generated by a constant
      untreated chronic phase infectivity over 10 y of infection. From the Rakai data, 
      we estimated that EHMacute = 8.4 (95% CrI: -0.27 to 64). This estimate is
      considerably lower than previously published estimates, and consistent with our
      independent estimate from viral load trajectories, 5.6 (95% confidence interval: 
      3.3-9.1). We found that previous overestimates likely stemmed from failure to
      account for risk heterogeneity and bias resulting from the retrospective cohort
      study design. Our results reflect the interaction between the retrospective
      cohort exclusion criteria and high (47%) rates of censorship amongst incident
      serodiscordant couples in the Rakai study due to loss to follow-up, couple
      dissolution, or study termination. We estimated excess physiological infectivity 
      during the acute phase from couples data, but not the proportion of transmission 
      attributable to the acute phase, which would require data on the broader
      population's sexual network structure. CONCLUSIONS: Previous EHMacute estimates
      relying on the Rakai retrospective cohort data range from 31 to 141. Our results 
      indicate that these are substantial overestimates of HIV-1 acute phase
      infectivity, biased by unmodeled heterogeneity in transmission rates between
      couples and by inconsistent censoring. Elevated acute phase infectivity is
      therefore less likely to undermine TasP interventions than previously thought.
      Heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility may still play an important
      role in intervention success and deserves attention in future analyses.

TI  - Sugar industry influence on the scientific agenda of the National Institute of
      Dental Research's 1971 National Caries Program: a historical analysis of internal
      documents.
PG  - e1001798
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1966, the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) began
      planning a targeted research program to identify interventions for widespread
      application to eradicate dental caries (tooth decay) within a decade. In 1971,
      the NIDR launched the National Caries Program (NCP). The objective of this paper 
      is to explore the sugar industry's interaction with the NIDR to alter the
      research priorities of the NIDR NCP. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used internal cane 
      and beet sugar industry documents from 1959 to 1971 to analyze industry actions
      related to setting research priorities for the NCP. The sugar industry could not 
      deny the role of sucrose in dental caries given the scientific evidence. They
      therefore adopted a strategy to deflect attention to public health interventions 
      that would reduce the harms of sugar consumption rather than restricting intake. 
      Industry tactics included the following: funding research in collaboration with
      allied food industries on enzymes to break up dental plaque and a vaccine against
      tooth decay with questionable potential for widespread application, cultivation
      of relationships with the NIDR leadership, consulting of members on an NIDR
      expert panel, and submission of a report to the NIDR that became the foundation
      of the first request for proposals issued for the NCP. Seventy-eight percent of
      the sugar industry submission was incorporated into the NIDR's call for research 
      applications. Research that could have been harmful to sugar industry interests
      was omitted from priorities identified at the launch of the NCP. Limitations are 
      that this analysis relies on one source of sugar industry documents and that we
      could not interview key actors. CONCLUSIONS: The NCP was a missed opportunity to 
      develop a scientific understanding of how to restrict sugar consumption to
      prevent tooth decay. A key factor was the alignment of research agendas between
      the NIDR and the sugar industry. This historical example illustrates how industry
      protects itself from potentially damaging research, which can inform policy
      makers today. Industry opposition to current policy proposals-including a World
      Health Organization guideline on sugars proposed in 2014 and changes to the
      nutrition facts panel on packaged food in the US proposed in 2014 by the US Food 
      and Drug Administration-should be carefully scrutinized to ensure that industry
      interests do not supersede public health goals.

TI  - CD47 agonist peptides induce programmed cell death in refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia B cells via PLCgamma1 activation: evidence from mice and
      humans.
PG  - e1001796
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001796 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common adulthood
      leukemia, is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal CD5+ B lymphocytes,
      which results in a progressive failure of the immune system. Despite intense
      research efforts, drug resistance remains a major cause of treatment failure in
      CLL, particularly in patients with dysfunctional TP53. The objective of our work 
      was to identify potential approaches that might overcome CLL drug refractoriness 
      by examining the pro-apoptotic potential of targeting the cell surface receptor
      CD47 with serum-stable agonist peptides. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In peripheral
      blood samples collected from 80 patients with CLL with positive and adverse
      prognostic features, we performed in vitro genetic and molecular analyses that
      demonstrate that the targeting of CD47 with peptides derived from the C-terminal 
      domain of thrombospondin-1 efficiently kills the malignant CLL B cells, including
      those from high-risk individuals with a dysfunctional TP53 gene, while sparing
      the normal T and B lymphocytes from the CLL patients. Further studies reveal that
      the differential response of normal B lymphocytes, collected from 20 healthy
      donors, and leukemic B cells to CD47 peptide targeting results from the sustained
      activation in CLL B cells of phospholipase C gamma-1 (PLCgamma1), a protein that 
      is significantly over-expressed in CLL. Once phosphorylated at tyrosine 783,
      PLCgamma1 enables a Ca2+-mediated, caspase-independent programmed cell death
      (PCD) pathway that is not down-modulated by the lymphocyte microenvironment.
      Accordingly, down-regulation of PLCgamma1 or pharmacological inhibition of
      PLCgamma1 phosphorylation abolishes CD47-mediated killing. Additionally, in a
      CLL-xenograft model developed in NOD/scid gamma mice, we demonstrate that the
      injection of CD47 agonist peptides reduces tumor burden without inducing anemia
      or toxicity in blood, liver, or kidney. The limitations of our study are mainly
      linked to the affinity of the peptides targeting CD47, which might be improved to
      reach the standard requirements in drug development, and the lack of a CLL animal
      model that fully mimics the human disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides
      substantial progress in (i) the development of serum-stable CD47 agonist peptides
      that are highly effective at inducing PCD in CLL, (ii) the understanding of the
      molecular events regulating a novel PCD pathway that overcomes CLL apoptotic
      avoidance, (iii) the identification of PLCgamma1 as an over-expressed protein in 
      CLL B cells, and (iv) the description of a novel peptide-based strategy against
      CLL.

TI  - Association between traffic-related air pollution in schools and cognitive
      development in primary school children: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - e1001792
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001792 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Air pollution is a suspected developmental neurotoxicant. Many
      schools are located in close proximity to busy roads, and traffic air pollution
      peaks when children are at school. We aimed to assess whether exposure of
      children in primary school to traffic-related air pollutants is associated with
      impaired cognitive development. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective 
      study of children (n = 2,715, aged 7 to 10 y) from 39 schools in Barcelona
      (Catalonia, Spain) exposed to high and low traffic-related air pollution, paired 
      by school socioeconomic index; children were tested four times (i.e., to assess
      the 12-mo developmental trajectories) via computerized tests (n = 10,112).
      Chronic traffic air pollution (elemental carbon [EC], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and
      ultrafine particle number [UFP; 10-700 nm]) was measured twice during 1-wk
      campaigns both in the courtyard (outdoor) and inside the classroom (indoor)
      simultaneously in each school pair. Cognitive development was assessed with the
      n-back and the attentional network tests, in particular, working memory (two-back
      detectability), superior working memory (three-back detectability), and
      inattentiveness (hit reaction time standard error). Linear mixed effects models
      were adjusted for age, sex, maternal education, socioeconomic status, and air
      pollution exposure at home. Children from highly polluted schools had a smaller
      growth in cognitive development than children from the paired lowly polluted
      schools, both in crude and adjusted models (e.g., 7.4% [95% CI 5.6%-8.8%] versus 
      11.5% [95% CI 8.9%-12.5%] improvement in working memory, p = 0.0024). Cogently,
      children attending schools with higher levels of EC, NO2, and UFP both indoors
      and outdoors experienced substantially smaller growth in all the cognitive
      measurements; for example, a change from the first to the fourth quartile in
      indoor EC reduced the gain in working memory by 13.0% (95% CI 4.2%-23.1%).
      Residual confounding for social class could not be discarded completely; however,
      the associations remained in stratified analyses (e.g., for type of school or
      high-/low-polluted area) and after additional adjustments (e.g., for commuting,
      educational quality, or smoking at home), contradicting a potential residual
      confounding explanation. CONCLUSIONS: Children attending schools with higher
      traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.

TI  - Ultra-sensitive detection of Plasmodium falciparum by amplification of multi-copy
      subtelomeric targets.
PG  - e1001788
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001788 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Planning and evaluating malaria control strategies relies on accurate
      definition of parasite prevalence in the population. A large proportion of
      asymptomatic parasite infections can only be identified by surveillance with
      molecular methods, yet these infections also contribute to onward transmission to
      mosquitoes. The sensitivity of molecular detection by PCR is limited by the
      abundance of the target sequence in a DNA sample; thus, detection becomes
      imperfect at low densities. We aimed to increase PCR diagnostic sensitivity by
      targeting multi-copy genomic sequences for reliable detection of low-density
      infections, and investigated the impact of these PCR assays on community
      prevalence data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were
      developed for ultra-sensitive detection of Plasmodium falciparum, targeting the
      high-copy telomere-associated repetitive element 2 (TARE-2, approximately 250
      copies/genome) and the var gene acidic terminal sequence (varATS, 59
      copies/genome). Our assays reached a limit of detection of 0.03 to 0.15
      parasites/mul blood and were 10x more sensitive than standard 18S rRNA qPCR. In a
      population cross-sectional study in Tanzania, 295/498 samples tested positive
      using ultra-sensitive assays. Light microscopy missed 169 infections (57%). 18S
      rRNA qPCR failed to identify 48 infections (16%), of which 40% carried
      gametocytes detected by pfs25 quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. To judge
      the suitability of the TARE-2 and varATS assays for high-throughput screens,
      their performance was tested on sample pools. Both ultra-sensitive assays
      correctly detected all pools containing one low-density P. falciparum-positive
      sample, which went undetected by 18S rRNA qPCR, among nine negatives. TARE-2 and 
      varATS qPCRs improve estimates of prevalence rates, yet other infections might
      still remain undetected when absent in the limited blood volume sampled.
      CONCLUSIONS: Measured malaria prevalence in communities is largely determined by 
      the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used. Even when applying standard
      molecular diagnostics, prevalence in our study population was underestimated by
      8% compared to the new assays. Our findings highlight the need for highly
      sensitive tools such as TARE-2 and varATS qPCR in community surveillance and for 
      monitoring interventions to better describe malaria epidemiology and inform
      malaria elimination efforts.

TI  - Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer: a
      phylogenetic analysis.
PG  - e1001789
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001789 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major clinical challenge in the treatment of high-grade serous
      ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the development of progressive resistance to
      platinum-based chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to determine whether
      intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity resulting from clonal evolution and the
      emergence of subclonal tumour populations in HGSOC was associated with the
      development of resistant disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Evolutionary inference
      and phylogenetic quantification of heterogeneity was performed using the MEDICC
      algorithm on high-resolution whole genome copy number profiles and selected
      genome-wide sequencing of 135 spatially and temporally separated samples from 14 
      patients with HGSOC who received platinum-based chemotherapy. Samples were
      obtained from the clinical CTCR-OV03/04 studies, and patients were enrolled
      between 20 July 2007 and 22 October 2009. Median follow-up of the cohort was 31
      mo (interquartile range 22-46 mo), censored after 26 October 2013. Outcome
      measures were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). There
      were marked differences in the degree of clonal expansion (CE) between patients
      (median 0.74, interquartile range 0.66-1.15), and dichotimization by median CE
      showed worse survival in CE-high cases (PFS 12.7 versus 10.1 mo, p = 0.009; OS
      42.6 versus 23.5 mo, p = 0.003). Bootstrap analysis with resampling showed that
      the 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratios for PFS and OS in the CE-high 
      group were greater than 1.0. These data support a relationship between
      heterogeneity and survival but do not precisely determine its effect size.
      Relapsed tissue was available for two patients in the CE-high group, and
      phylogenetic analysis showed that the prevalent clonal population at clinical
      recurrence arose from early divergence events. A subclonal population marked by a
      NF1 deletion showed a progressive increase in tumour allele fraction during
      chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that quantitative measures of 
      intra-tumour heterogeneity may have predictive value for survival after
      chemotherapy treatment in HGSOC. Subclonal tumour populations are present in
      pre-treatment biopsies in HGSOC and can undergo expansion during chemotherapy,
      causing clinical relapse.

TI  - Complaints, complainants, and rulings regarding drug promotion in the United
      Kingdom and Sweden 2004-2012: a quantitative and qualitative study of
      pharmaceutical industry self-regulation.
PG  - e1001785
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In many European countries, medicines promotion is governed by
      voluntary codes of practice administered by the pharmaceutical industry under its
      own system of self-regulation. Involvement of industry organizations in policing 
      promotion has been proposed to deter illicit conduct, but few detailed studies on
      self-regulation have been carried out to date. The objective of this study was to
      examine the evidence for promotion and self-regulation in the UK and Sweden, two 
      countries frequently cited as examples of effective self-regulation. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We performed a qualitative content analysis of documents outlining the 
      constitutions and procedures of these two systems. We also gathered data from
      self-regulatory bodies on complaints, complainants, and rulings for the period
      2004-2012. The qualitative analysis revealed similarities and differences between
      the countries. For example, self-regulatory bodies in both countries are required
      to actively monitor promotional items and impose sanctions on violating
      companies, but the range of sanctions is greater in the UK where companies may,
      for instance, be audited or publicly reprimanded. In total, Swedish and UK bodies
      ruled that 536 and 597 cases, respectively, were in breach, equating to an
      average of more than one case/week for each country. In Sweden, 430 (47%)
      complaints resulted from active monitoring, compared with only two complaints
      (0.2%) in the UK. In both countries, a majority of violations concerned
      misleading promotion. Charges incurred on companies averaged euro447,000 and
      euro765,000 per year in Sweden and the UK, respectively, equivalent to about
      0.014% and 0.0051% of annual sales revenues, respectively. One hundred cases in
      the UK (17% of total cases in breach) and 101 (19%) in Sweden were highlighted as
      particularly serious. A total of 46 companies were ruled in breach of code for a 
      serious offence at least once in the two countries combined (n = 36 in the UK; n 
      = 27 in Sweden); seven companies were in serious violation more than ten times
      each. A qualitative content analysis of serious violations pertaining to diabetes
      drugs (UK, n = 15; Sweden, n = 6; 10% of serious violations) and urologics (UK, n
      = 6; Sweden, n = 13; 9%) revealed various types of violations: misleading claims 
      (n = 23; 58%); failure to comply with undertakings (n = 9; 23%); pre-licensing (n
      = 7; 18%) or off-label promotion (n = 2; 5%); and promotion of prescription drugs
      to the public (n = 6; 15%). Violations that go undetected or unpunished by
      self-regulatory bodies are the main limitation of this study, since they are
      likely to lead to an underestimate of industry misconduct. CONCLUSIONS: The
      prevalence and severity of breaches testifies to a discrepancy between the
      ethical standard codified in industry Codes of Conduct and the actual conduct of 
      the industry. We discuss regulatory reforms that may improve the quality of
      medicines information, such as pre-vetting and intensified active monitoring of
      promotion, along with larger fines, and giving greater publicity to rulings. But 
      despite the importance of improving regulatory arrangements in an attempt to
      ensure unbiased medicines information, such efforts alone are insufficient
      because simply improving oversight and increasing penalties fail to address
      additional layers of industry bias.

TI  - A primary care nurse-delivered walking intervention in older adults: PACE
      (pedometer accelerometer consultation evaluation)-Lift cluster randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - e1001783
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brisk walking in older people can increase step-counts and moderate
      to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) in >/=10-minute bouts, as advised 
      in World Health Organization guidelines. Previous interventions have reported
      step-count increases, but not change in objectively measured MVPA in older
      people. We assessed whether a primary care nurse-delivered complex intervention
      increased objectively measured step-counts and MVPA. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A
      total of 988 60-75 year olds, able to increase walking and randomly selected from
      three UK family practices, were invited to participate in a parallel two-arm
      cluster randomised trial; randomisation was by household.
      Two-hundred-ninety-eight people from 250 households were randomised between 2011 
      and 2012; 150 individuals to the intervention group, 148 to the usual care
      control group. Intervention participants received four primary care nurse
      physical activity (PA) consultations over 3 months, incorporating behaviour
      change techniques, pedometer step-count and accelerometer PA intensity feedback, 
      and an individual PA diary and plan. Assessors were not blinded to group status, 
      but statistical analyses were conducted blind. The primary outcome was change in 
      accelerometry assessed average daily step-counts between baseline and 3 months,
      with change at 12 months a secondary outcome. Other secondary outcomes were
      change from baseline in time in MVPA weekly in >/=10-minute bouts, accelerometer 
      counts, and counts/minute at 3 months and 12 months. Other outcomes were adverse 
      events, anthropometric measures, mood, and pain. Qualitative evaluations of
      intervention participants and practice nurses assessed the intervention's
      acceptability. At 3 months, eight participants had withdrawn or were lost to
      follow-up, 280 (94%) individuals provided primary outcome data. At 3 months
      changes in both average daily step-counts and weekly MVPA in >/=10-minute bouts
      were significantly higher in the intervention than control group: by 1,037 (95%
      CI 513-1,560) steps/day and 63 (95% CI 40-87) minutes/week, respectively. At 12
      months corresponding differences were 609 (95% CI 104-1,115) steps/day and 40
      (95% CI 17-63) minutes/week. Counts and counts/minute showed similar effects to
      steps and MVPA. Adverse events, anthropometry, mood, and pain were similar in the
      two groups. Participants and practice nurses found the intervention acceptable
      and enjoyable. CONCLUSIONS: The PACE-Lift trial increased both step-counts and
      objectively measured MVPA in >/=10-minute bouts in 60-75 year olds at 3 and 12
      months, with no effect on adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first
      trial in this age group to demonstrate objective MVPA increases and highlights
      the value of individualised support incorporating objective PA assessment in a
      primary care setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN42122561.

TI  - Intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity and mortality in head and neck cancer: analysis
      of data from the Cancer Genome Atlas.
PG  - e1001786
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the involvement of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in
      tumor progression, treatment resistance, and metastasis is established, genetic
      heterogeneity is seldom examined in clinical trials or practice. Many studies of 
      heterogeneity have had prespecified markers for tumor subpopulations, limiting
      their generalizability, or have involved massive efforts such as separate
      analysis of hundreds of individual cells, limiting their clinical use. We
      recently developed a general measure of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity based
      on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of bulk tumor DNA, called mutant-allele tumor
      heterogeneity (MATH). Here, we examine data collected as part of a large,
      multi-institutional study to validate this measure and determine whether
      intra-tumor heterogeneity is itself related to mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
      Clinical and WES data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas in October 2013 
      for 305 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), from 14
      institutions. Initial pathologic diagnoses were between 1992 and 2011 (median,
      2008). Median time to death for 131 deceased patients was 14 mo; median follow-up
      of living patients was 22 mo. Tumor MATH values were calculated from WES results.
      Despite the multiple head and neck tumor subsites and the variety of treatments, 
      we found in this retrospective analysis a substantial relation of high MATH
      values to decreased overall survival (Cox proportional hazards analysis: hazard
      ratio for high/low heterogeneity, 2.2; 95% CI 1.4 to 3.3). This relation of
      intra-tumor heterogeneity to survival was not due to intra-tumor heterogeneity's 
      associations with other clinical or molecular characteristics, including age,
      human papillomavirus status, tumor grade and TP53 mutation, and N classification.
      MATH improved prognostication over that provided by traditional clinical and
      molecular characteristics, maintained a significant relation to survival in
      multivariate analyses, and distinguished outcomes among patients having
      oral-cavity or laryngeal cancers even when standard disease staging was taken
      into account. Prospective studies, however, will be required before MATH can be
      used prognostically in clinical trials or practice. Such studies will need to
      examine homogeneously treated HNSCC at specific head and neck subsites, and
      determine the influence of cancer therapy on MATH values. Analysis of MATH and
      outcome in human-papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is
      particularly needed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this study is the first to
      combine data from hundreds of patients, treated at multiple institutions, to
      document a relation between intra-tumor heterogeneity and overall survival in any
      type of cancer. We suggest applying the simply calculated MATH metric of
      heterogeneity to prospective studies of HNSCC and other tumor types.

TI  - The role of Abcb5 alleles in susceptibility to haloperidol-induced toxicity in
      mice and humans.
PG  - e1001782
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We know very little about the genetic factors affecting
      susceptibility to drug-induced central nervous system (CNS) toxicities, and this 
      has limited our ability to optimally utilize existing drugs or to develop new
      drugs for CNS disorders. For example, haloperidol is a potent dopamine antagonist
      that is used to treat psychotic disorders, but 50% of treated patients develop
      characteristic extrapyramidal symptoms caused by haloperidol-induced toxicity
      (HIT), which limits its clinical utility. We do not have any information about
      the genetic factors affecting this drug-induced toxicity. HIT in humans is
      directly mirrored in a murine genetic model, where inbred mouse strains are
      differentially susceptible to HIT. Therefore, we genetically analyzed this murine
      model and performed a translational human genetic association study. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: A whole genome SNP database and computational genetic mapping were used
      to analyze the murine genetic model of HIT. Guided by the mouse genetic analysis,
      we demonstrate that genetic variation within an ABC-drug efflux transporter
      (Abcb5) affected susceptibility to HIT. In situ hybridization results reveal that
      Abcb5 is expressed in brain capillaries, and by cerebellar Purkinje cells. We
      also analyzed chromosome substitution strains, imaged haloperidol abundance in
      brain tissue sections and directly measured haloperidol (and its metabolite)
      levels in brain, and characterized Abcb5 knockout mice. Our results demonstrate
      that Abcb5 is part of the blood-brain barrier; it affects susceptibility to HIT
      by altering the brain concentration of haloperidol. Moreover, a genetic
      association study in a haloperidol-treated human cohort indicates that human
      ABCB5 alleles had a time-dependent effect on susceptibility to individual and
      combined measures of HIT. Abcb5 alleles are pharmacogenetic factors that affect
      susceptibility to HIT, but it is likely that additional pharmacogenetic
      susceptibility factors will be discovered. CONCLUSIONS: ABCB5 alleles alter
      susceptibility to HIT in mouse and humans. This discovery leads to a new model
      that (at least in part) explains inter-individual differences in susceptibility
      to a drug-induced CNS toxicity.

TI  - Evaluation of a minimally invasive cell sampling device coupled with assessment
      of trefoil factor 3 expression for diagnosing Barrett's esophagus: a multi-center
      case-control study.
PG  - e1001780
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001780 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a commonly undiagnosed condition that
      predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Routine endoscopic screening for BE is 
      not recommended because of the burden this would impose on the health care
      system. The objective of this study was to determine whether a novel approach
      using a minimally invasive cell sampling device, the Cytosponge, coupled with
      immunohistochemical staining for the biomarker Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3), could be 
      used to identify patients who warrant endoscopy to diagnose BE. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: A case-control study was performed across 11 UK hospitals between July 
      2011 and December 2013. In total, 1,110 individuals comprising 463 controls with 
      dyspepsia and reflux symptoms and 647 BE cases swallowed a Cytosponge prior to
      endoscopy. The primary outcome measures were to evaluate the safety,
      acceptability, and accuracy of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test compared with endoscopy
      and biopsy. In all, 1,042 (93.9%) patients successfully swallowed the Cytosponge,
      and no serious adverse events were attributed to the device. The Cytosponge was
      rated favorably, using a visual analogue scale, compared with endoscopy (p <
      0.001), and patients who were not sedated for endoscopy were more likely to rate 
      the Cytosponge higher than endoscopy (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.001). The overall 
      sensitivity of the test was 79.9% (95% CI 76.4%-83.0%), increasing to 87.2% (95% 
      CI 83.0%-90.6%) for patients with >/=3 cm of circumferential BE, known to confer 
      a higher cancer risk. The sensitivity increased to 89.7% (95% CI 82.3%-94.8%) in 
      107 patients who swallowed the device twice during the study course. There was no
      loss of sensitivity in patients with dysplasia. The specificity for diagnosing BE
      was 92.4% (95% CI 89.5%-94.7%). The case-control design of the study means that
      the results are not generalizable to a primary care population. Another
      limitation is that the acceptability data were limited to a single measure.
      CONCLUSIONS: The Cytosponge-TFF3 test is safe and acceptable, and has accuracy
      comparable to other screening tests. This test may be a simple and inexpensive
      approach to identify patients with reflux symptoms who warrant endoscopy to
      diagnose BE.

TI  - Hormonal contraception and the risk of HIV acquisition: an individual participant
      data meta-analysis.
PG  - e1001778
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001778 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies of a putative association between hormonal
      contraception (HC) and HIV acquisition have produced conflicting results. We
      conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies from
      sub-Saharan Africa to compare the incidence of HIV infection in women using
      combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or the injectable progestins
      depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN)
      with women not using HC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Eligible studies measured HC
      exposure and incident HIV infection prospectively using standardized measures,
      enrolled women aged 15-49 y, recorded >/=15 incident HIV infections, and measured
      prespecified covariates. Our primary analysis estimated the adjusted hazard ratio
      (aHR) using two-stage random effects meta-analysis, controlling for region,
      marital status, age, number of sex partners, and condom use. We included 18
      studies, including 37,124 women (43,613 woman-years) and 1,830 incident HIV
      infections. Relative to no HC use, the aHR for HIV acquisition was 1.50 (95% CI
      1.24-1.83) for DMPA use, 1.24 (95% CI 0.84-1.82) for NET-EN use, and 1.03 (95% CI
      0.88-1.20) for COC use. Between-study heterogeneity was mild (I(2) < 50%). DMPA
      use was associated with increased HIV acquisition compared with COC use (aHR
      1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.67) and NET-EN use (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61). Effect
      estimates were attenuated for studies at lower risk of methodological bias
      (compared with no HC use, aHR for DMPA use 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.50; for NET-EN use
      0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96; and for COC use 0.91, 95% CI 0.73-1.41) compared to those
      at higher risk of bias (p(interaction) = 0.003). Neither age nor herpes simplex
      virus type 2 infection status modified the HC-HIV relationship. CONCLUSIONS: This
      IPD meta-analysis found no evidence that COC or NET-EN use increases women's risk
      of HIV but adds to the evidence that DMPA may increase HIV risk, underscoring the
      need for additional safe and effective contraceptive options for women at high
      HIV risk. A randomized controlled trial would provide more definitive evidence
      about the effects of hormonal contraception, particularly DMPA, on HIV risk.

TI  - Uptake and population-level impact of expedited partner therapy (EPT) on
      Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the Washington State
      community-level randomized trial of EPT.
PG  - e1001777
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001777 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expedited partner therapy (EPT), the practice of treating the sex
      partners of persons with sexually transmitted infections without their medical
      evaluation, increases partner treatment and decreases gonorrhea and chlamydia
      reinfection rates. We conducted a stepped-wedge, community-level randomized trial
      to determine whether a public health intervention promoting EPT could increase
      its use and decrease chlamydia test positivity and gonorrhea incidence in women. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: The trial randomly assigned local health jurisdictions
      (LHJs) in Washington State, US, into four study waves. Waves instituted the
      intervention in randomly assigned order at intervals of 6-8 mo. Of the state's 25
      LHJs, 24 were eligible and 23 participated. Heterosexual individuals with
      gonorrhea or chlamydial infection were eligible for the intervention. The study
      made free patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) available to clinicians, and
      provided public health partner services based on clinician referral. The main
      study outcomes were chlamydia test positivity among women ages 14-25 y in 219
      sentinel clinics, and incidence of reported gonorrhea in women, both measured at 
      the community level. Receipt of PDPT from clinicians was evaluated among randomly
      selected patients. 23 and 22 LHJs provided data on gonorrhea and chlamydia
      outcomes, respectively. The intervention increased the percentage of persons
      receiving PDPT from clinicians (from 18% to 34%, p < 0.001) and the percentage
      receiving partner services (from 25% to 45%, p < 0.001). Chlamydia test
      positivity and gonorrhea incidence in women decreased over the study period, from
      8.2% to 6.5% and from 59.6 to 26.4 per 100,000, respectively. After adjusting for
      temporal trends, the intervention was associated with an approximately 10%
      reduction in both chlamydia positivity and gonorrhea incidence, though the
      confidence bounds on these outcomes both crossed one (chlamydia positivity
      prevalence ratio = 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.04, p = 0.15; gonorrhea incidence rate
      ratio = 0.91, 95% CI .71-1.16, p = 0.45). Study findings were potentially limited
      by inadequate statistical power, by the institution of some aspects of the study 
      intervention outside of the research randomization sequence, and by the fact that
      LHJs did not constitute truly isolated sexual networks. CONCLUSIONS: A public
      health intervention promoting the use of free PDPT substantially increased its
      use and may have resulted in decreased chlamydial and gonococcal infections at
      the population level. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01665690.

TI  - Association between respiratory syncytial virus activity and pneumococcal disease
      in infants: a time series analysis of US hospitalization data.
PG  - e1001776
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001776 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of bacterial infections following respiratory
      syncytial virus (RSV) remains unclear. We evaluated whether variations in RSV
      epidemic timing and magnitude are associated with variations in pneumococcal
      disease epidemics and whether changes in pneumococcal disease following the
      introduction of seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) were
      associated with changes in the rate of hospitalizations coded as RSV. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: We used data from the State Inpatient Databases (Agency for Healthcare 
      Research and Quality), including >700,000 RSV hospitalizations and >16,000
      pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations in 36 states (1992/1993-2008/2009).
      Harmonic regression was used to estimate the timing of the average seasonal peak 
      of RSV, pneumococcal pneumonia, and pneumococcal septicemia. We then estimated
      the association between the incidence of pneumococcal disease in children and the
      activity of RSV and influenza (where there is a well-established association)
      using Poisson regression models that controlled for shared seasonal variations.
      Finally, we estimated changes in the rate of hospitalizations coded as RSV
      following the introduction of PCV7. RSV and pneumococcal pneumonia shared a
      distinctive spatiotemporal pattern (correlation of peak timing: rho = 0.70, 95%
      CI: 0.45, 0.84). RSV was associated with a significant increase in the incidence 
      of pneumococcal pneumonia in children aged <1 y (attributable percent [AP]:
      20.3%, 95% CI: 17.4%, 25.1%) and among children aged 1-2 y (AP: 10.1%, 95% CI:
      7.6%, 13.9%). Influenza was also associated with an increase in pneumococcal
      pneumonia among children aged 1-2 y (AP: 3.2%, 95% CI: 1.7%, 4.7%). Finally, we
      observed a significant decline in RSV-coded hospitalizations in children aged <1 
      y following PCV7 introduction (-18.0%, 95% CI: -22.6%, -13.1%, for
      2004/2005-2008/2009 versus 1997/1998-1999/2000). This study used aggregated
      hospitalization data, and studies with individual-level, laboratory-confirmed
      data could help to confirm these findings. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide
      evidence for an interaction between RSV and pneumococcal pneumonia. Future work
      should evaluate whether treatment for secondary bacterial infections could be
      considered for pneumonia cases even if a child tests positive for RSV. Please see
      later in the article for the Editors' Summary.
