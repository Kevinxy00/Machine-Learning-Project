AB  - A deficit of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transmission will lead to epilepsy
      and other cognitive disorders. Recent evidence has shown that neuronal miRNAs
      affect various synapses, including GABAergic synapses. However, the miRNAs that
      control GABAergic synapses remain not fully understood. Here, we identified
      miR-51, a member of Caenorhabditis elegans miR-99/100 family, as a key regulator 
      of GABAergic synapses. Loss of mir-51 increased PTZ (Pentylenetetrazole) and
      aldicarb hypersensitivities, and decreased the number of GABAergic synapses and
      abundance of GABAA receptors. A Rab guaninenucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
      GLO-4, a well-known component in lysosomal trafficking-related GLO-4/GLO-1/AP-3
      (GLO/AP-3) pathway, was discovered to be the direct target of miR-51. Rescue
      experiments showed that GLO-4 expressed in GABAergic motor neurons functioned as 
      a suppressor of miR-51. Disruption of glo-1 or AP-3 gene apm-3 attenuated the
      defects of GABAergic synapse in mir-51 mutants, suggesting miR-51 regulated
      GABAergic synapses through GLO/AP-3 pathway. The present study implies the
      essential roles of miRNAs on the nervous pathologies characterized by
      mis-regulated GABA signaling, such as epilepsy.

AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are signal transducers of many biological 
      processes. Class 1A PI3Ks are hetero dimers formed by a regulatory and a
      catalytic subunit. We have used the developing chicken neural tube (NT) to study 
      the roles played by PI3K during the process of cell proliferation and
      differentiation. Notably, we have observed that in addition to its well
      characterized anti apoptotic activity, PI3K also plays a crucial role in intra
      epithelial cell positioning, and unlike its role in survival that mainly depends 
      on AKT, the activity in cell positioning is mediated by Rho GTPase family
      members. Additionally, we have observed that activating mutations of PI3K that
      are remarkably frequent in many human cancers, cause an unrestrained basal
      migration of the neuroepithelial cells that end up breaking through the basal
      membrane invading the surrounding mesenchymal tissue. The mechanism described in 
      this work contribute not only to acquire a greater knowledge of the
      intraepithelial cell positioning process, but also give new clues on how
      activating mutations of PI3K contribute to cell invasion during the first stages 
      of tumour dissemination.

TI  - GATA6 phosphorylation by Erk1/2 propels exit from pluripotency and commitment to

AB  - The transcription factor GATA6 and the Fgf/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway are
      essential for the development of the primitive endoderm (PrE), one of the two
      lineages derived from the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) of mammalian
      blastocysts. A mutant mouse line in which Gata6-coding exons are replaced with
      H2BGFP (histone H2B Green Fluorescence Protein fusion protein) was developed to
      monitor Gata6 promoter activity. In the Gata6-H2BGFP heterozygous blastocysts,
      the ICM cells that initially had uniform GFP fluorescence signal at E3.5 diverged
      into two populations by the 64-cell stage, either as the GFP-high PrE or the
      GFP-low epiblasts (Epi). However in the GATA6-null blastocysts, the originally
      moderate GFP expression subsided in all ICM cells, indicating that the GATA6
      protein is required to maintain its own promoter activity during PrE linage
      commitment. In embryonic stem cells, expressed GATA6 was shown to bind and
      activate the Gata6 promoter in PrE differentiation. Mutations of a conserved
      serine residue (S264) for Erk1/2 phosphorylation in GATA6 protein drastically
      impacted its ability to activate its own promoter. We conclude that
      phosphorylation of GATA6 by Erk1/2 compels exit from pluripotent state, and the
      phosphorylation propels a GATA6 positive feedback regulatory circuit to compel
      PrE differentiation. Our findings resolve the longstanding question on the dual
      requirements of GATA6 and Ras/MAPK pathway for PrE commitment of the pluripotent 
      ICM.

TI  - Cell death in neural precursor cells and neurons before neurite formation
      prevents the emergence of abnormal neural structures in the Drosophila optic
      lobe.

AB  - Programmed cell death is a conserved strategy for neural development both in
      vertebrates and invertebrates and is recognized at various developmental stages
      in the brain from neurogenesis to adulthood. To understand the development of the
      central nervous system, it is essential to reveal not only molecular mechanisms
      but also the role of neural cell death (Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2016). To
      understand the role of cell death in neural development, we investigated the
      effect of inhibition of cell death on optic lobe development. Our data
      demonstrate that, in the optic lobe of Drosophila, cell death occurs in neural
      precursor cells and neurons before neurite formation and functions to prevent
      various developmental abnormalities. When neuronal cell death was inhibited by an
      effector caspase inhibitor, p35, multiple abnormal neuropil structures arose
      during optic lobe development-e.g., enlarged or fused neuropils, misrouted
      neurons and abnormal neurite lumps. Inhibition of cell death also induced
      morphogenetic defects in the lamina and medulla development-e.g., failures in the
      separation of the lamina and medulla cortices and the medulla rotation. These
      defects were reproduced in the mutant of an initiator caspase, dronc. If cell
      death was a mechanism for removing the abnormal neuropil structures, we would
      also expect to observe them in mutants defective for corpse clearance. However,
      they were not observed in these mutants. When dead cell-membranes were visualized
      with Apoliner, they were observed only in cortices and not in neuropils. These
      results suggest that the cell death occurs before mature neurite formation.
      Moreover, we found that inhibition of cell death induced ectopic neuroepithelial 
      cells, neuroblasts and ganglion mother cells in late pupal stages, at sites where
      the outer and inner proliferation centers were located at earlier developmental
      stages. Caspase-3 activation was observed in the neuroepithelial cells and
      neuroblasts in the proliferation centers. These results indicate that cell death 
      is required for elimination of the precursor cells composing the proliferation
      centers. This study substantiates an essential role of early neural cell death
      for ensuring normal development of the central nervous system.

AB  - Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a common congenital disorder in which the
      cartilaginous rings of the trachea are weakened or missing. Despite the high
      prevalence and clinical issues associated with TBM, the etiology is largely
      unknown. Our previous studies demonstrated that Wntless (Wls) and its associated 
      Wnt pathways are critical for patterning of the upper airways. Deletion of Wls in
      respiratory endoderm caused TBM and ectopic trachealis muscle. To understand
      mechanisms by which Wls mediates tracheal patterning, we performed RNA sequencing
      in prechondrogenic tracheal tissue of Wls(f/f);Shh(Cre/wt) embryos. Chondrogenic 
      Bmp4, and Sox9 were decreased, while expression of myogenic genes was increased. 
      We identified Notum, a deacylase that inactivates Wnt ligands, as a target of Wls
      induced Wnt signaling. Notum's mesenchymal ventral expression in prechondrogenic 
      trachea overlaps with expression of Axin2, a Wnt/beta-catenin target and
      inhibitor. Notum is induced by Wnt/beta-catenin in developing trachea. Deletion
      of Notum activated mesenchymal Wnt/beta-catenin and caused tracheal mispatterning
      of trachealis muscle and cartilage as well as tracheal stenosis. Notum is
      required for tracheal morphogenesis, influencing mesenchymal condensations
      critical for patterning of tracheal cartilage and muscle. We propose that Notum
      influences mesenchymal cell differentiation by generating a barrier for Wnt
      ligands produced and secreted by airway epithelial cells to attenuate Wnt
      signaling.

AB  - Orofacial muscles are critical for life-sustaining behaviors, such as feeding and
      breathing. Centuries of work by neuroanatomists and surgeons resulted in the
      mapping of bulbar motor neurons in the brainstem and the course of the cranial
      nerves that carry their axons. Despite the sophisticated understanding of the
      anatomy of the region, the molecular mechanisms that dictate the development and 
      maturation of facial motor neurons remain poorly understood. This fundamental
      problem has been recently revisited by physiologists with novel techniques of
      studying the rhythmic contraction of orofacial muscles in relationship to
      breathing. The molecular understanding of facial motor neuron development will
      not only lead to the comprehension of the neural basis of facial expression but
      may also unlock new avenues to generate stem cell-derived replacements. This
      review summarizes the current understanding of molecular programs involved in
      facial motor neuron generation, migration, and maturation, including neural
      circuit assembly.

AB  - In the neural primordium of vertebrate embryos, the neural crest (NC) displays a 
      unique character: the capacity of its component cells to leave the neural
      primordium, migrate along definite (and, for long, not identified) routes in the 
      developing embryo and invade virtually all tissues and organs, while producing a 
      large array of differentiated cell types. The most striking diversity of the NC
      derivatives is found in its cephalic domain that produces, not only melanocytes
      and peripheral nerves and ganglia, but also various mesenchymal derivatives
      (connective tissues, bones, cartilages...) which, in other parts of the body, are
      mesoderm-derived. The aim of this article was to review the large amount of work 
      that has been devoted to solving the problem of the differentiation capacities of
      individual NC cells (NCC) arising from both the cephalic and trunk levels of the 
      neural axis. A variety of experimental designs applied to NCC either in vivo or
      in vitro are evaluated, including the possibility to culture them in
      crestospheres, a technique previously designed for cells of the CNS, and which
      reinforces the notion, previously put forward, of the existence of NC stem cells.
      At the trunk level, the developmental potentialities of the NCC are more
      restricted than in their cephalic counterparts, but, in addition to the
      neural-melanocytic fate that they exclusively express in vivo, it was clearly
      shown that they harbor mesenchymal capacities that can be revealed in vitro.
      Finally, a large amount of evidence has been obtained that, during the migration 
      process, most of the NCC are multipotent with a variable array of potentialities 
      among the cells considered. Investigations carried out in adults have shown that 
      multipotent NC stem cells persist in the various sites of the body occupied by
      NCC. Enlightening new developments concerning the invasive capacity of NCC, the
      growing peripheral nerves were revealed as migration routes for NCC travelling to
      distant ventrolateral regions of the body. Designated "Schwann cell precursors"
      in the mouse embryo, these NCC can leave the nerves and are able to convert to a 
      novel fate. The convertibility of the NC-derived cells, particularly evident in
      the Schwann cell-melanocyte lineage transition, has also been demonstrated for
      neuroendocrine cells of the adult carotid body and for the differentiation of
      parasympathetic neurons of ganglia distant from their origin, the NC. All these
      new developments attest the vitality of the research on the NC, a field that
      characterizes vertebrate development and for which the interest has constantly
      increased during the last decades.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable
      neurodevelopmental disorder of childhood. It is primarily characterised by high
      levels of activity, inattention, and impulsivity, and has strong negative impacts
      on academic functioning. Children with ADHD show a reduction in volume, and
      hypoactivity, in a range of brain regions. The underlying mechanisms behind these
      phenotypes are unknown, however, variants in several genes with known roles in
      neurodevelopment are associated with ADHD. In this review we discuss how these
      ADHD associated genes contribute to neurodevelopment, and how variants in these
      genes could give rise to the neurological phenotypes seen in ADHD.

TI  - Requirement of zebrafish pcdh10a and pcdh10b in melanocyte precursor migration.

LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.022 [doi]
AB  - Melanocytes derive from neural crest cells, which are a highly migratory
      population of cells that play an important role in pigmentation of the skin and
      epidermal appendages. In most vertebrates, melanocyte precursor cells migrate
      solely along the dorsolateral pathway to populate the skin. However, zebrafish
      melanocyte precursors also migrate along the ventromedial pathway, in route to
      the yolk, where they interact with other neural crest derivative populations.
      Here, we demonstrate the requirement for zebrafish paralogs pcdh10a and pcdh10b
      in zebrafish melanocyte precursor migration. pcdh10a and pcdh10b are expressed in
      a subset of melanocyte precursor and somatic cells respectively, and knockdown
      and TALEN mediated gene disruption of pcdh10a results in aberrant migration of
      melanocyte precursors resulting in fully melanized melanocytes that differentiate
      precociously in the ventromedial pathway. Live cell imaging analysis demonstrates
      that loss of pchd10a results in a reduction of directed cell migration of
      melanocyte precursors, caused by both increased adhesion and a loss of cell-cell 
      contact with other migratory neural crest cells. Also, we determined that the
      paralog pcdh10b is upregulated and can compensate for the genetic loss of
      pcdh10a. Disruption of pcdh10b alone by CRISPR mutagenesis results in somite
      defects, while the loss of both paralogs results in enhanced migratory melanocyte
      precursor phenotype and embryonic lethality. These results reveal a novel role
      for pcdh10a and pcdh10b in zebrafish melanocyte precursor migration and suggest
      that pcdh10 paralogs potentially interact for proper transient migration along
      the ventromedial pathway.

      morphogenesis in Xenopus laevis.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved small non-coding RNA molecules that
      post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in multicellular organisms.
      Within the set of muscle-specific miRNAs, miR-206 expression is largely
      restricted to skeletal muscle and is found exclusively within the bony fish
      lineage. Although many studies have implicated miR-206 in muscle maintenance and 
      disease, its role in skeletal muscle development remains largely unknown. Here,
      we examine the role of miR-206 during Xenopus laevis somitogenesis. In Xenopus
      laevis, miR-206 expression coincides with the onset of somitogenesis. We show
      that both knockdown and over-expression of miR-206 result in abnormal somite
      formation affecting muscle cell rotation, attachment, and elongation. In
      particular, our data suggests that miR-206 regulates changes in cell adhesion
      that affect the ability of newly formed somites to adhere to the notochord as
      well as to the intersomitic boundaries. Additionally, we show that
      beta-dystroglycan and F-actin expression levels are significantly reduced,
      suggesting that knockdown of miR-206 levels affects cellular mechanics necessary 
      for cell shape changes and attachments that are required for proper muscle
      formation.

      infidelity.

AB  - Hox genes can function as key drivers of segment identity, with Hox mutations in 
      Drosophila often resulting in dramatic homeotic transformations. In addition,
      however, they can serve other essential functions. In mammals, the study of Hox
      gene roles in development is complicated by the presence of four Hox clusters
      with a total of 39 genes showing extensive functional overlap. In this study, in 
      order to better understand shared core Hox functions, we examined kidney
      development in mice with frameshift mutations of multiple Abd-B type Hox genes.
      The resulting phenotypes included dramatically reduced branching morphogenesis of
      the ureteric bud, premature depletion of nephron progenitors and abnormal
      development of the stromal compartment. Most unexpected, however, we also
      observed a cellular level lineage infidelity in nephron segments. Scattered cells
      within the proximal tubules, for example, expressed genes normally expressed only
      in collecting ducts. Multiple combinations of inappropriate nephron segment
      specific marker expression were found. In some cases, cells within a tubule
      showed incorrect identity, while in other cases cells showed ambiguous character,
      with simultaneous expression of genes associated with more than one nephron
      segment. These results give evidence that Hox genes have an overlapping core
      function at the cellular level in driving and/or maintaining correct
      differentiation decisions.

      morphogenesis.

AB  - Wolffian duct morphogenesis must be highly coordinated with its specialized
      function of providing an optimal microenvironment for sperm maturation. Without
      normal Wolffian duct morphogenesis, male infertility will result. Our previous
      study showed that mediolateral and radial intercalation of epithelial and
      mesenchymal cells respectively, were major drivers of ductal elongation and were 
      regulated by protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), a member of the planar cell
      polarity (PCP) non-canonical Wnt pathway. To understand the mechanism by which
      PTK7 regulates cell rearrangement/intercalation, we investigated the integrity of
      the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the activity of intracellular cytoskeleton
      mediators following loss of Ptk7. Abnormal assembly of nephronectin, laminin, and
      collagen IV at the basement membrane and fibrosis-like deposition of fibrilla
      collagen in the interstitium were observed in Ptk7 knockout Wolffian ducts.
      Further, the activity levels of RAC1 and myosin II, two cytoskeleton mediators,
      decreased in the Ptk7 knockout mesenchyme compared to controls. In addition,
      in-vitro experiments suggested that alterations of ECM and cytoskeleton mediators
      resulted in changes in Wolffian duct morphogenesis. When in-vitro-cultured
      Wolffian ducts were treated with collagenase IV, the degree of cross-linked
      fibrilla collagen was reduced, Wolffian duct elongation and coiling were
      significantly reduced, and an expanded cyst-like duct was observed. When Wolffian
      ducts were treated with RAC1 inhibitor NSC23766, mesenchymal fibrilla collagen
      was disassembled, and Wolffian duct elongation was significantly reduced. Our
      findings provide evidence that PTK7 regulates ECM integrity and the activity
      levels of RAC1 and myosin II, which in turn regulates Wolffian duct morphogenesis
      and therefore, epididymal function.

AB  - During the development of the early spinal circuitry in zebrafish, spontaneous
      Ca(2+) transients in the primary motor neurons (PMNs) are reported to transform
      from being slow and uncorrelated, to being rapid, synchronized and patterned. In 
      this study, we demonstrated that in intact zebrafish, Ca(2+) release via two-pore
      channel type 2 (TPC2) from acidic stores/endolysosomes is required for the
      establishment of synchronized activity in the PMNs. Using the
      SAIGFF213A;UAS:GCaMP7a double-transgenic zebrafish line, Ca(2+) transients were
      visualized in the caudal PMNs (CaPs). TPC2 inhibition via molecular, genetic or
      pharmacological means attenuated the CaP Ca(2+) transients, and decreased the
      normal ipsilateral correlation and contralateral anti-correlation, indicating a
      disruption in normal spinal circuitry maturation. Furthermore, treatment with
      MS-222 resulted in a complete (but reversible) inhibition of the CaP Ca(2+)
      transients, as well as a significant decrease in the concentration of the Ca(2+) 
      mobilizing messenger, nicotinic acid adenine diphosphate (NAADP) in whole embryo 
      extract. Together, our new data suggest a novel function for NAADP/TPC2-mediated 
      Ca(2+) signaling in the development, coordination, and maturation of the spinal
      network in zebrafish embryos.

TI  - The cellular prion protein promotes olfactory sensory neuron survival and axon
      targeting during adult neurogenesis.
LID - S0012-1606(18)30016-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.012 [doi]
AB  - The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) has been associated with diverse biological
      processes including cell signaling, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection, but its
      physiological function(s) remain ambiguous. Here we determine the role of PrP(C) 
      in adult neurogenesis using the olfactory system model in transgenic mice.
      Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) within the olfactory sensory epithelium (OSE)
      undergo neurogenesis, integration, and turnover even into adulthood. The
      neurogenic processes of proliferation, differentiation/maturation, and axon
      targeting were evaluated in wild type, PrP-overexpressing, and PrP-null
      transgenic mice. Our results indicate that PrP(C) plays a role in maintaining
      mature OSNs within the epithelium: overexpression of PrP(C) resulted in greater
      survival of mitotically active cells within the OSE, whereas absence of prion
      protein resulted in fewer cells being maintained over time. These results are
      supported by both quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression and protein
      analysis characteristic of OSN differentiation. Finally, evaluation of axon
      migration determined that OSN axon targeting in the olfactory bulb is PrP(C)
      dose-dependent. Together, these findings provide new mechanistic insight into the
      neuroprotective role for PrP(C) in adult OSE neurogenesis, whereby more mature
      neurons are stably maintained in animals expressing PrP(C).

TI  - JAK/STAT signaling prevents excessive apoptosis to ensure maintenance of the
      interfollicular stalk critical for Drosophila oogenesis.

LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Apoptosis not only eliminates cells that are damaged or dangerous but also cells 
      whose function during development in patterning or organogenesis is complete. The
      successful formation of germ cells is essential for the perpetuation of a
      species. The production of an oocyte often depends on signaling between germline 
      and somatic cells, but also between specialized types of somatic cells. In
      Drosophila, each developing egg chamber is separated from the next by a single
      file of interfollicular somatic cells. Little is known about the function of the 
      interfollicular stalk, although its presumed role in separating egg chambers is
      to ensure that patterning cues from one egg chamber do not impact or disrupt the 
      development of adjacent egg chambers. We found that cells comprising the stalk
      undergo a progressive decrease in number during oogenesis through an
      apoptotic-dependent loss. The extent of programmed cell death is restricted by
      JAK/STAT signaling in a cell-autonomous manner to ensure that the stalk is
      maintained. Both a failure to undergo the normal reduction in stalk cell number, 
      or to prevent excessive stalk cell apoptosis results in a decrease in fecundity. 
      Thus, activation of JAK/STAT signaling in the Drosophila interfollicular stalk
      emerges as a model to study the tight regulation of signaling-dependent
      apoptosis.

      crest.
LID - S0012-1606(17)30597-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.016 [doi]
AB  - The neural crest is a transient population of cells that forms within the
      developing central nervous system and migrates away to generate a wide range of
      derivatives throughout the body during vertebrate embryogenesis. These cells are 
      of evolutionary and clinical interest, constituting a key defining trait in the
      evolution of vertebrates and alterations in their development are implicated in a
      high proportion of birth defects and craniofacial abnormalities. In the hindbrain
      and the adjacent cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs), nested domains of Hox gene
      expression provide a combinatorial'Hox-code' for specifying regional properties
      in the developing head. Hox genes have been shown to play important roles at
      multiple stages in cNCC development, including specification, migration, and
      differentiation. However, relatively little is known about the underlying
      gene-regulatory mechanisms involved, both upstream and downstream of Hox genes.
      Furthermore, it is still an open question as to how the genes of the neural crest
      GRN are linked to Hox-dependent pathways. In this review, we describe Hox gene
      expression, function and regulation in cNCCs with a view to integrating these
      genes within the emerging gene regulatory network for cNCC development. We
      highlight early roles for Hox1 genes in cNCC specification, proposing that this
      may be achieved, in part, by regulation of the balance between pluripotency and
      differentiation in precursor cells within the neuro-epithelium. We then describe 
      what is known about the regulation of Hox gene expression in cNCCs and discuss
      this from the perspective of early vertebrate evolution.

AB  - Smoothened (Smo) is the essential transducer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling,
      which regulates cell fate and proliferation during embryogenesis. We identified a
      novel mouse mutant, cabbie (cbb), and found that its cause is a missense mutation
      in Smo. We showed the Smo(cbb) mutation is insensitive to the Shh agonist SAG,
      perhaps due to the disruption of SAG binding. We characterized Smo(cbb) for
      defects in craniofacial and skeletal development, as well as neural tube
      patterning, and revealed Smo(cbb) affected processes that require the highest
      levels of Shh activity. Smo is normally enriched in cilia upon Shh stimulation;
      however, we detected inefficient enrichment of Smo in Smo(cbb) mutants whether we
      stimulated with Shh or SAG. Taken together, our data suggest that the highest
      levels of vertebrate Hedgehog signaling activity require efficient Smo ciliary
      enrichment.

TI  - Kir2.1 is important for efficient BMP signaling in mammalian face development.

AB  - Mutations that disrupt the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 lead to
      Andersen-Tawil syndrome that includes periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia,
      cognitive deficits, craniofacial dysmorphologies and limb defects. The molecular 
      mechanism that underlies the developmental consequences of inhibition of these
      channels has remained a mystery. We show that while loss of Kir2.1 function does 
      not affect expression of several early facial patterning genes, the domain in
      which Pou3f3 is expressed in the maxillary arch is reduced. Pou3f3 is important
      for development of the jugal and squamosal bones. The reduced expression domain
      of Pou3f3 is consistent with the reduction in the size of the squamosal and jugal
      bones in Kcnj2(KO/KO) animals, however it does not account for the diverse
      craniofacial defects observed in Kcnj2(KO/KO) animals. We show that Kir2.1
      function is required in the cranial neural crest for morphogenesis of several
      craniofacial structures including palate closure. We find that while the palatal 
      shelves of Kir2.1-null embryos elevate properly, they are reduced in size due to 
      decreased proliferation of the palatal mesenchyme. While we find no reduction in 
      expression of BMP ligands, receptors, and associated Smads in this setting, loss 
      of Kir2.1 reduces the efficacy of BMP signaling as shown by the reduction of
      phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8 and reduced expression of BMP targets Smad6 and Satb2.

AB  - During metamorphosis of insect epithelial monolayers, cells die, divide, and
      rearrange. In Drosophila undifferentiated diploid cells destined to form the
      adult cuticle of each abdominal segment segregate early in development from the
      surrounding polyploid larval epithelial cells of that segment as eight groups of 
      diploid histoblast cells. The larval polyploid cells are programmed to die and be
      replaced by divisions and rearrangements of histoblast cells. By contrast,
      abdominal epithelial cells of Manduca larvae form a monolayer of cells
      representing different ploidy levels with no definitive segregation of diploid
      cells destined to form adult structures. These epithelial cells of mixed ploidy
      levels produce a thick smooth larval cuticle with sparsely distributed sensory
      bristles. Adult descendants of this larval monolayer produce a thinner cuticle
      with densely packed scale cells. The transition between these differentiated
      states of Manduca involves divisions of cells, changes in ploidy levels, and
      sorting of certain polyploid cells into circular rosette patches to minimize
      contacts of these polyploid cells with surrounding cells of equal or smaller
      size. Cells within the rosettes and some surrounding cells are destined to die
      and be replaced by remaining epithelial cells of uniform size and ploidy at
      pupa-adult apolysis.

AB  - In the sea urchin embryo, gastrulation is characterized by the ingression and
      directed cell migration of primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), as well as the
      primary invagination and convergent extension of the endomesoderm. Like all cell 
      shape changes, individual and collective cell motility is orchestrated by Rho
      family GTPases and their modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. And while
      endomesoderm specification has been intensively studied in echinoids, much less
      is known about the proximate regulators driving cell motility. Toward these ends,
      we employed anti-sense morpholinos, mutant alleles and pharmacological inhibitors
      to assess the role of Cdc42 during sea urchin gastrulation. While inhibition of
      Cdc42 expression or activity had only mild effects on PMC ingression, PMC
      migration, alignment and skeletogenesis were disrupted in the absence of Cdc42,
      as well as elongation of the archenteron. PMC migration and patterning of the
      larval skeleton relies on the extension of filopodia, and Cdc42 was required for 
      filopodia in vivo as well as in cultured PMCs. Lastly, filopodial extension
      required both Arp2/3 and formin actin-nucleating factors, supporting models of
      filopodial nucleation observed in other systems. Together, these results suggest 
      that Cdc42 plays essential roles during PMC cell motility and organogenesis.

TI  - CRISPR mutagenesis confirms the role of oca2 in melanin pigmentation in Astyanax 
      mexicanus.

AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of trait evolution is critical to identifying the
      mechanisms that generated the immense amount of diversity observable in the
      living world. However, genetically manipulating organisms from natural
      populations with evolutionary adaptations remains a significant challenge.
      Astyanax mexicanus exists in two interfertile forms, a surface-dwelling form and 
      multiple independently evolved cave-dwelling forms. Cavefish have evolved a
      number of morphological and behavioral traits and multiple quantitative trait
      loci (QTL) analyses have been performed to identify loci underlying these traits.
      These studies provide a unique opportunity to identify and test candidate genes
      for these cave-specific traits. We have leveraged the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing 
      techniques to characterize the effects of mutations in oculocutaneous albinism II
      (oca2), a candidate gene hypothesized to be responsible for the evolution of
      albinism in A. mexicanus cave populations. We generated oca2 mutant surface A.
      mexicanus. Surface fish with oca2 mutations are albino due to a disruption in the
      first step of the melanin synthesis pathway, the same step that is disrupted in
      albino cavefish. Hybrid offspring from crosses between oca2 mutant surface and
      cavefish are albino, definitively demonstrating the role of this gene in the
      evolution of albinism in this species. This research elucidates the role oca2
      plays in pigmentation in fish, and establishes that this gene is solely
      responsible for the evolution of albinism in multiple cavefish populations.
      Finally, it demonstrates the utility of using genome editing to investigate the
      genetic basis of trait evolution.

TI  - A quantitative study of the diversity of stripe-forming processes in an arthropod
      cell-based field undergoing axis formation and growth.
LID - S0012-1606(17)30908-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.001 [doi]
AB  - One of the conserved traits of arthropod embryonic development is striped
      expression of homologs of Drosophila segment polarity genes, including hedgehog
      (hh). Although a diversity of stripe-forming processes is recognized among
      arthropod embryos, such varied stripe-forming processes have not been well
      characterized from cellular and quantitative perspectives. The spider
      Parasteatoda tepidariorum embryo, which has a hh-dependent mechanism of axis
      formation, offers a cell-based field where the stripes of Pt-hh (a hh homolog)
      expression dynamically develop in accordance with axis formation and growth, with
      the patterning processes varying among the regions of the field. In this study,
      using cell labeling, we mapped the future body subdivisions to the germ disc in
      the spider embryo and provided substantial evidence for the occurrence of kinetic
      waves of Pt-hh expression in the presumptive head and opisthosomal (or abdominal)
      regions of the embryonic field. Notably, combined with cell tracking, we showed
      that surface cells at and near the center of the germ disc persist in the
      posterior portion of the field from where Pt-hh stripes sequentially arise,
      suggesting the operation of ordered oscillations of Pt-hh expression. We then
      conducted a quantitative analysis of forming/formed Pt-hh stripes using serially 
      timed fixation of sibling embryos. By utilizing length measurements that reflect 
      the axis growth of the embryonic field, we reconstructed the pattern dynamics,
      which captured repeated splitting of Pt-hh stripes and oscillations of Pt-hh
      expression in the presumptive head and opisthosomal regions, respectively. In the
      intermediate thoracic region, three stripes of Pt-hh expression showed a late
      appearance, with the segmental units specified much earlier by another mechanism.
      Analyses provided quantitative estimates related to axis growth and
      stripe-splitting and oscillation events, including the periods of the patterning 
      cycles. This work characterizes the diversity of stripe-forming processes in a
      cell-based field in a common spatiotemporal framework and highlights the
      contrasting dynamics of splitting versus oscillation. The cellular and
      quantitative data presented here provide the foundation for experimental,
      theoretical and evolutionary studies of cell-based pattern formation, especially 
      body axis segmentation in arthropods.

AB  - Organ homeostasis relies upon cellular and molecular processes that restore
      tissue structure and function in a timely fashion. Lymphatic vessels help
      maintain fluid equilibrium by returning interstitial fluid that evades venous
      uptake back to the circulation. Despite its important role in tissue homeostasis,
      cancer metastasis, and close developmental origins with the blood vasculature,
      the number of molecular players known to control lymphatic system development is 
      relatively low. Here we show, using genetic approaches in zebrafish and mice,
      that the endothelial specific microRNA mir-126, previously implicated in vascular
      integrity, regulates lymphatic development. In zebrafish, in contrast to mir-126 
      morphants, double mutants (mir-126a(-/-); mir-126b(-/-), hereafter mir-126(-/-)) 
      do not exhibit defects in vascular integrity but develop lymphatic hypoplasia;
      mir-126(-/-) animals fail to develop complete trunk and facial lymphatics,
      display severe edema and die as larvae. Notably, following MIR-126 inhibition,
      human Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (hLECs) respond poorly to VEGFA and VEGFC. In
      this context, we identify a concomitant reduction in Vascular Endothelial Growth 
      Factor Receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3
      (VEGFR3, also known as FLT4) expression upon MIR-126 inhibition. In vivo, we
      further show that flt4(+/-) zebrafish embryos exhibit lymphatic defects after
      mild miR-126 knockdown. Similarly, loss of Mir-126 in Flt4(+/-) mice results in
      embryonic edema and lethality. Thus, our results indicate that miR-126 modulation
      of Vegfr signaling is essential for lymphatic system development in fish and
      mammals.

AB  - Advancements in fetal intervention procedures have led to increases in the number
      of pregnant women undergoing general anesthesia during the second trimester-a
      period characterized by extensive proliferation of fetal neural stem cells
      (NSCs). However, few studies have investigated the effects of mid-gestational
      sevoflurane exposure on fetal NSC proliferation or postnatal learning and memory 
      function. In the present study, pregnant rats were randomly assigned to a control
      group (C group), a low sevoflurane concentration group (2%; L group), a high
      sevoflurane concentration group (3.5%; H group), a high sevoflurane concentration
      plus lithium chloride group (H + Li group), and a lithium chloride group (Li
      group) at gestational day 14. Rats received different concentrations of
      sevoflurane anesthesia for 2h. The offspring rats were weaned at 28 days for
      behavioral testing (i.e., Morris Water Maze [MWM]), and fetal brains or postnatal
      hippocampal tissues were harvested for immunofluorescence staining, real-time
      PCR, and Western blotting analyses in order to determine the effect of
      sevoflurane exposure on NSC proliferation and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      pathway. Our results indicated that maternal exposure to 3.5% sevoflurane (H
      group) during the mid-gestational period impaired the performance of offspring
      rats in the MWM test, reduced NSC proliferation, and increased protein levels of 
      fetal glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta). Such treatment also decreased 
      levels of beta-catenin protein, CD44 RNA, and Cyclin D1 RNA relative to those
      observed in the C group. However, these effects were transiently attenuated by
      treatment with lithium chloride. Conversely, maternal exposure to 2% sevoflurane 
      (L group) did not influence NSC proliferation or the Wnt signaling pathway. Our
      results suggest that sevoflurane exposure during the second trimester inhibits
      fetal NSC proliferation via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and impairs postnatal
      learning and memory function in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - The capacity to fully replace teeth continuously makes zebrafish an attractive
      model to explore regeneration and tooth development. The requirement of
      attachment bone for the appearance of replacement teeth has been hypothesized but
      not yet investigated. The transcription factor sp7 (osterix) is known in mammals 
      to play an important role during odontoblast differentiation and root formation. 
      Here we study tooth replacement in the absence of attachment bone using sp7
      zebrafish mutants. We analysed the pattern of tooth replacement at different
      stages of development and demonstrated that in zebrafish lacking sp7, attachment 
      bone is never present, independent of the stage of tooth development or fish age,
      yet replacement is not interrupted. Without bone of attachment we observed
      abnormal orientation of teeth, and abnormal connection of pulp cavities of
      predecessor and replacement teeth. Mutants lacking sp7 show arrested
      dentinogenesis, with non-polarization of odontoblasts and only a thin layer of
      dentin deposited. Osteoclast activity was observed in sp7 mutants; due to the
      lack of bone of attachment, remodelling was diminished but nevertheless present
      along the pharyngeal bone. We conclude that tooth replacement is ongoing in the
      sp7 mutant despite poor differentiation and defective attachment. Without bone of
      attachment tooth orientation and pulp organization are compromised.

AB  - Genome editing by CRISPR is now routinely used in plant biology for unravelling
      gene functions and improving agronomical traits. CRISPR opens up the possibility 
      of genome manipulations which would have been unthinkable a few years ago. In
      this perspective, we discuss and suggest CRISPR-mediated approaches for steering 
      plant development, also highlighting potential challenges.

AB  - Failure of neural tube closure leads to neural tube defects (NTDs), common
      congenital abnormalities in humans. Among the genes whose loss of function causes
      NTDs in mice, Grainyhead-like3 (Grhl3) is essential for spinal neural tube
      closure, with null mutants exhibiting fully penetrant spina bifida. During spinal
      neurulation Grhl3 is initially expressed in the surface (non-neural) ectoderm,
      subsequently in the neuroepithelial component of the neural folds and at the
      node-streak border, and finally in the hindgut endoderm. Here, we show that
      endoderm-specific knockout of Grhl3 causes late-arising spinal NTDs, preceded by 
      increased ventral curvature of the caudal region which was shown previously to
      suppress closure of the spinal neural folds. This finding supports the hypothesis
      that diminished Grhl3 expression in the hindgut is the cause of spinal NTDs in
      the curly tail, carrying a hypomorphic Grhl3 allele. Complete loss of Grhl3
      function produces a more severe phenotype in which closure fails earlier in
      neurulation, before the stage of onset of expression in the hindgut of wild-type 
      embryos. This implicates additional tissues and NTD mechanisms in Grhl3 null
      embryos. Conditional knockout of Grhl3 in the neural plate and node-streak border
      has minimal effect on closure, suggesting that abnormal function of surface
      ectoderm, where Grhl3 transcripts are first detected, is primarily responsible
      for early failure of spinal neurulation in Grhl3 null embryos.

AB  - Arterial vasculature distributes blood from early embryonic development and
      provides a nutrient highway to maintain tissue viability. Atherosclerosis,
      peripheral artery diseases, stroke and aortic aneurysm represent the most
      frequent causes of death and are all directly related to abnormalities in the
      function of arteries. Vascular intervention techniques have been established for 
      the treatment of all of these pathologies, yet arterial surgery can itself lead
      to biological changes in which uncontrolled arterial wall cell proliferation
      leads to restricted blood flow. In this review we describe the intricate cellular
      composition of arteries, demonstrating how a variety of distinct cell types in
      the vascular walls regulate the function of arteries. We provide an overview of
      the developmental origin of arteries and perivascular cells and focus on cellular
      dynamics in arterial repair. We summarize the current knowledge of the molecular 
      signaling pathways that regulate vascular smooth muscle differentiation in the
      embryo and in arterial injury response. Our review aims to highlight the
      similarities as well as differences between cellular and molecular mechanisms
      that control arterial development and repair.

AB  - DSL ligands activate the Notch receptor in many cellular contexts across metazoa 
      to specify cell fate. In addition, Notch receptor activity is implicated in
      post-mitotic morphogenesis and neuronal function. In C. elegans, the DSL family
      ligand APX-1 is expressed in a subset of cells of the proximal gonad lineage,
      where it can act as a latent proliferation-promoting signal to maintain proximal 
      germline tumors. Here we examine apx-1 in the proximal gonad and uncover a role
      in the maintenance of normal ovulation. Depletion of apx-1 causes an endomitotic 
      oocyte (Emo) phenotype and ovulation defects. We find that lag-2 can substitute
      for apx-1 in this role, that the ovulation defect is partially suppressed by loss
      of ipp-5, and that lin-12 depletion causes a similar phenotype. In addition, we
      find that the ovulation defects are often accompanied by a delay of spermathecal 
      distal neck closure after oocyte entry. Although calcium oscillations occur in
      the spermatheca, calcium signals are abnormal when the distal neck does not close
      completely. Moreover, oocytes sometimes cannot properly transit through the
      spermatheca, leading to fragmentation of oocytes once the neck closes. Finally,
      abnormal oocytes and neck closure defects are seen occasionally when apx-1 or
      lin-12 activity is reduced in adult animals, suggesting a possible
      post-developmental role for APX-1 and LIN-12 signaling in ovulation.

TI  - Quantitating transcription factor redundancy: The relative roles of the ELT-2 and
      ELT-7 GATA factors in the C. elegans endoderm.

AB  - The two GATA transcription factors ELT-2 and ELT-7 function in the
      differentiation of the C. elegans intestine. ELT-2 loss causes lethality. ELT-7
      loss causes no obvious phenotype but enhances the elt-2(-) intestinal phenotype. 
      Thus, ELT-2 and ELT-7 appear partially redundant, with ELT-2 being more
      influential. To investigate the different regulatory roles of ELT-2 and ELT-7, we
      compared the transcriptional profiles of pure populations of wild-type, elt-2(-),
      elt-7(-), and elt-7(-); elt-2(-) double mutant L1-stage larvae. Consistent with
      the mutant phenotypes, loss of ELT-2 had a>25 fold greater influence on the
      number of significantly altered transcripts compared to the loss of ELT-7;
      nonetheless, the levels of numerous transcripts changed upon loss of ELT-7 in the
      elt-2(-) background. The quantitative responses of individual genes revealed a
      more complicated behaviour than simple redundancy/partial redundancy. In
      particular, genes expressed only in the intestine showed three distinguishable
      classes of response in the different mutant backgrounds. One class of genes
      responded as if ELT-2 is the major transcriptional activator and ELT-7 provides
      variable compensatory input. For a second class, transcript levels increased upon
      loss of ELT-2 but decreased upon further loss of ELT-7, suggesting that ELT-7
      actually overcompensates for the loss of ELT-2. For a third class, transcript
      levels also increased upon loss of ELT-2 but remained elevated upon further loss 
      of ELT-7, suggesting overcompensation by some other intestinal transcription
      factor(s). In spite of its minor loss-of-function phenotype and its limited
      sequence similarity to ELT-2, ELT-7 expressed under control of the elt-2 promoter
      is able to rescue elt-2(-) lethality. Indeed, appropriately expressed ELT-7, like
      appropriately expressed ELT-2, is able to replace all other core GATA factors in 
      the C. elegans endodermal pathway. Overall, this study focuses attention on the
      quantitative intricacies behind apparent redundancy or partial redundancy of two 
      related transcription factors.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in embryogenesis, serving
      both as a substrate to which cells attach and as an active regulator of cell
      behavior. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal expression patterns
      and 3D structure of ECM proteins during embryonic development. The lack of
      suitable methods to visualize the embryonic ECM is largely responsible for this
      gap, posing a major technical challenge for biologists and tissue engineers.
      Here, we describe a method of viewing the 3D organization of the ECM using a
      polyacrylamide-based hydrogel to provide a 3D framework within developing murine 
      embryos. After removal of soluble proteins using sodium dodecyl sulfate, confocal
      microscopy was used to visualize the 3D distribution of independent ECM networks 
      in multiple developing tissues, including the forelimb, eye, and spinal cord.
      Comparative analysis of E12.5 and E14.5 autopods revealed proteoglycan-rich
      fibrils maintain connections between the epidermis and the underlying tendon and 
      cartilage, indicating a role for the ECM during musculoskeletal assembly and
      demonstrating that our method can be a powerful tool for defining the
      spatiotemporal distribution of the ECM during embryogenesis.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, in simplest terms, can be described as an
      epithelial-lined muscular tube extending along the cephalocaudal axis from the
      oral cavity to the anus. Although the general architecture of the GI tract organs
      is conserved from end to end, the presence of different epithelial tissue
      structures and unique epithelial cell types within each organ enables each to
      perform the distinct digestive functions required for efficient nutrient
      assimilation. Spatiotemporal regulation of signaling pathways and downstream
      transcription factors controls GI epithelial morphogenesis during development to 
      confer essential regional-specific epithelial structures and functions. Here, we 
      discuss the fundamental functions of each GI tract organ and summarize the
      diversity of epithelial structures present along the cephalocaudal axis of the GI
      tract. Next, we discuss findings, primarily from genetic mouse models, that have 
      defined the roles of key transcription factors during epithelial morphogenesis,
      including p63, SOX2, SOX15, GATA4, GATA6, HNF4A, and HNF4G. Additionally, we
      examine how the Hedgehog, WNT, and BMP signaling pathways contribute to defining 
      unique epithelial features along the cephalocaudal axis of the GI tract. Lastly, 
      we examine the molecular mechanisms controlling regionalized cytodifferentiation 
      of organ-specific epithelial cell types within the GI tract, concentrating on the
      stomach and small intestine. The delineation of GI epithelial patterning
      mechanisms in mice has provided fundamental knowledge to guide the development
      and refinement of three-dimensional GI organotypic culture models such as those
      derived from directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells and those
      derived directly from human tissue samples. Continued examination of these
      pathways will undoubtedly provide vital insights into the mechanisms of GI
      development and disease and may afford new avenues for innovative tissue
      engineering and personalized medicine approaches to treating GI diseases.

AB  - Correct patterning of the nervous system is essential for an organism's survival 
      and complex behavior. Embryologists have used the sea urchin as a model for
      decades, but our understanding of sea urchin nervous system patterning is
      incomplete. Previous histochemical studies identified multiple neurotransmitters 
      in the pluteus larvae of several sea urchin species. However, little is known
      about how, where and when neural subtypes are differentially specified during
      development. Here, we examine the molecular mechanisms of neuronal subtype
      specification in 3 distinct neural subtypes in the Lytechinus variegatus larva.
      We show that these subtypes are specified through Delta/Notch signaling and
      identify a different transcription factor required for the development of each
      neural subtype. Our results show achaete-scute and neurogenin are proneural for
      the serotonergic neurons of the apical organ and cholinergic neurons of the
      ciliary band, respectively. We also show that orthopedia is not proneural but is 
      necessary for the differentiation of the cholinergic/catecholaminergic postoral
      neurons. Interestingly, these transcription factors are used similarly during
      vertebrate neurogenesis. We believe this study is a starting point for building a
      neural gene regulatory network in the sea urchin and for finding conserved
      deuterostome neurogenic mechanisms.

TI  - Dynamics of two key maternal factors that initiate zygotic regulatory programs in
      ascidian embryos.
LID - S0012-1606(18)30031-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.009 [doi]
AB  - In animal embryos, transcription is repressed for a definite period of time after
      fertilization. In the embryo of the ascidian, Ciona intestinalis (type A; or
      Ciona robusta), transcription of regulatory genes is repressed before the 8- or
      16-cell stages. This initial transcriptional quiescence is important to enable
      the establishment of initial differential gene expression patterns along the
      animal-vegetal axis by maternal factors, because the third cell division
      separates the animal and vegetal hemispheres into distinct blastomeres. Indeed,
      maternal transcription factors directly activate zygotic gene expression by the
      16-cell stage; Tcf7/beta-catenin activates genes in the vegetal hemisphere, and
      Gata.a activates genes in the animal hemisphere. In the present study, we
      revealed the dynamics of Gata.a and beta-catenin, and expression profiles of
      their target genes precisely. beta-catenin began to translocate into the nuclei
      at the 16-cell stage, and thus expression of beta-catenin targets began at the
      16-cell stage. Although Gata.a is abundantly present before the 8-cell stage,
      transcription of Gata.a targets was repressed at and before the 4-cell stage, and
      their expression began at the 8-cell stage. Transcription of the beta-catenin
      targets may be repressed by the same mechanism in early embryos, because
      beta-catenin targets were not expressed in 4-cell embryos treated with a GSK
      inhibitor, in which beta-catenin translocated to the nuclei. Thus, these two
      maternal factors have different dynamics, which establish the pre-pattern for
      zygotic genetic programs in 16-cell embryos.

AB  - During embryonic brain development, groups of particular neuronal cells migrate
      tangentially to participate in the formation of a laminated structure. Two
      distinct types of tangential migration in the middle and superficial layers have 
      been reported in the development of the avian optic tectum. Here we show the
      dynamics of tangential cell movement in superficial layers of developing chick
      optic tectum. Confocal time-lapse microscopy in organotypic slice cultures and
      flat-mount cultures revealed that vigorous cell migration continued during
      E6.5-E13.5, where horizontally elongated superficial cells spread out
      tangentially. Motile cells exhibited exploratory behavior in reforming the
      branched leading processes to determine their pathway, and intersected with each 
      other for dispersion. At the tectal peripheral border, the cells retraced or
      turned around to avoid protruding over the border. The tangentially migrating
      cells were eventually distributed in the outer stratum griseum et fibrosum
      superficiale and differentiated into neurons of various morphologies. These
      results revealed the cellular dynamics for widespread neuronal distribution in
      the superficial layers of the developing optic tectum, which underline a mode of 
      novel tangential neuronal migration in the developing brain.

TI  - Multiple zebrafish atoh1 genes specify a diversity of neuronal types in the

LID - S0012-1606(17)30712-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.004 [doi]
AB  - A single Atoh1 basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor specifies multiple
      neuron types in the mammalian cerebellum and anterior hindbrain. The zebrafish
      genome encodes three paralagous atoh1 genes whose functions in cerebellum and
      anterior hindbrain development we explore here. With use of a transgenic
      reporter, we report that zebrafish atoh1c-expressing cells are organized in two
      distinct domains that are separated both by space and developmental time. An
      early isthmic expression domain gives rise to an extracerebellar population in
      rhombomere 1 and an upper rhombic lip domain gives rise to granule cell
      progenitors that migrate to populate all four granule cell territories of the
      fish cerebellum. Using genetic mutants we find that of the three zebrafish atoh1 
      paralogs, atoh1c and atoh1a are required for the full complement of granule
      neurons. Surprisingly, the two genes are expressed in non-overlapping granule
      cell progenitor populations, indicating that fish use duplicate atoh1 genes to
      generate granule cell diversity that is not detected in mammals. Finally, live
      imaging of granule cell migration in wildtype and atoh1c mutant embryos reveals
      that while atoh1c is not required for granule cell specification per se, it is
      required for granule cells to delaminate and migrate away from the rhombic lip.

AB  - Molecular signals are the guiding force of development, imparting direction upon 
      cells to divide, migrate, differentiate, etc. The mechanisms by which a cell can 
      receive and transduce these signals into measurable actions remains a 'black box'
      in developmental biology. Primary cilia are ubiquitous, microtubule-based
      organelles that dynamically extend from a cell to receive and process molecular
      and mechanical signaling cues. In the last decade, this organelle has become
      increasingly intriguing to the research community due to its ability to act as a 
      cellular antenna, receive and transduce molecular stimuli, and initiate a
      cellular response. In this review, we discuss the structure of primary cilia,
      emphasizing how the ciliary components contribute to the transduction of
      signaling pathways. Furthermore, we address how the cilium integrates these
      signals and conveys them into cellular processes such as proliferation, migration
      and tissue patterning. Gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms used by
      primary cilia to receive and integrate molecular signals is essential, as it
      opens the door for the identification of therapeutic targets within the cilium
      that could alleviate pathological conditions brought on by aberrant molecular
      signaling.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stromal cells that display self-renewal and
      multipotent differentiation capacity. The repertoire of mature cells generated
      ranges but is not restricted to: fat, bone and cartilage. Their potential
      importance for both cell therapy and maintenance of in vivo homeostasis is
      indisputable. Nonetheless, both their in vivo identity and use in cell therapy
      remain elusive. A drawback generated by this fact is that little is known about
      the MSC niche and how it impacts differentiation and homeostasis maintenance.
      Hence, the roles played by the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its main regulators
      namely: the Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their counteracting inhibitors
      (TIMPs and RECK) upon stem cells differentiation are only now beginning to be
      unveiled. Here, we will focus on mesenchymal stem cells and review the main
      mechanisms involved in adipo, chondro and osteogenesis, discussing how the
      extracellular matrix can impact not only lineage commitment, but, also, their
      survival and potentiality. This review critically analyzes recent work in the
      field in an effort towards a better understanding of the roles of Matrix
      Metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in the above-cited events.

TI  - Pitx1 regulates cement gland development in Xenopus laevis through activation of 
      transcriptional targets and inhibition of BMP signaling.

AB  - The cement gland in Xenopus laevis has long been used as a model to study the
      interplay of cell signaling and transcription factors during embryogenesis. It
      has been shown that an intermediate level of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)
      signaling is essential for cement gland formation. In addition, several
      transcription factors have been linked to cement gland development. One of these,
      the homeodomain-containing protein Pitx1, can generate ectopic cement gland
      formation; however, the mechanisms underlying this process remain obscure. We
      report here, for the first time, a requirement for Pitx proteins in cement gland 
      formation, in vivo: knockdown of both pitx1 and the closely related pitx2c
      inhibit endogenous cement gland formation. Pitx1 transcriptionally activates
      cement gland differentiation genes through both direct and indirect mechanisms,
      and functions as a transcriptional activator to inhibit BMP signaling. This
      inhibition, required for the expression of pitx genes, is partially mediated by
      Pitx1-dependent follistatin expression. Complete suppression of BMP signaling
      inhibits induction of cement gland markers by Pitx1; furthermore, we find that
      Pitx1 physically interacts with Smad1, an intracellular transducer of BMP
      signaling. We propose a model of cement gland formation in which Pitx1 limits
      local BMP signaling within the cement gland primordium, and recruits Smad1 to
      activate direct downstream targets.

TI  - Epidermal regulation of bone morphogenesis through the development and
      regeneration of osteoblasts in the zebrafish scale.
LID - S0012-1606(17)30582-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.005 [doi]
AB  - Bone is a connective tissue composed of many cell types, including osteoblasts.
      How bones acquire their unique size and shape during development remains poorly
      understood. Herein we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms of bone 
      morphogenesis in the zebrafish scale by using transgenic lines to enable
      visualization of specific types of osteoblasts. We demonstrate that the zebrafish
      scale contains three distinct types of osteoblasts: (i) a monolayer of central
      osteoblasts along the inner surface of scales; (ii) marginal osteoblasts
      elongated along the scale edge; and (iii) submarginal osteoblasts located between
      the central and marginal osteoblast populations. The size of the central
      osteoblasts increases progressively during development, suggesting that scale
      growth is mediated primarily by cell growth rather than the recruitment of new
      osteoblasts. In addition, the total number of central osteoblasts increases in
      regenerated scales and is correlated with scale size, possibly allowing for the
      rapid growth of regenerating scales. Moreover, osteoblast proliferation is not
      detected during regeneration, suggesting that the osteoblasts originate from
      post-mitotic precursor cells. Sonic hedgehog a (shha) is expressed in the
      epidermal cells that make contact with the marginal osteoblasts. Pharmacological 
      inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling during regeneration reduces the number of
      marginal osteoblasts and interferes with scale growth, indicating that
      epidermis-derived Shh regulates scale regeneration. Finally, genetic inhibition
      of Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in the epidermis results in
      misorientation of scales with regard to the body axis. These results reveal a
      novel role for the epidermis in the regulation of bone patterning, namely the
      regeneration of osteoblasts and directional bone growth.

AB  - The neural crest is a multipotent population of cells that originates a variety
      of cell types. Many animal models are used to study neural crest induction,
      migration and differentiation, with amphibians and birds being the most widely
      used systems. A major technological advance to study neural crest development in 
      mouse, chick and zebrafish has been the generation of transgenic animals in which
      neural crest specific enhancers/promoters drive the expression of either
      fluorescent proteins for use as lineage tracers, or modified genes for use in
      functional studies. Unfortunately, no such transgenic animals currently exist for
      the amphibians Xenopus laevis and tropicalis, key model systems for studying
      neural crest development. Here we describe the generation and characterization of
      two transgenic Xenopus laevis lines, Pax3-GFP and Sox10-GFP, in which GFP is
      expressed in the pre-migratory and migratory neural crest, respectively. We show 
      that Pax3-GFP could be a powerful tool to study neural crest induction, whereas
      Sox10-GFP could be used in the study of neural crest migration in living embryos.

AB  - To move directionally, cells can bias the generation of protrusions or select
      among randomly generated protrusions. Here we use 3D two-photon imaging of chick 
      branchial arch 2 directed neural crest cells to probe how these mechanisms
      contribute to directed movement, whether a subset or the majority of cells
      polarize during movement, and how the different classes of protrusions relate to 
      one another. We find that, in contrast to Xenopus, cells throughout the stream
      are morphologically polarized along the direction of overall stream movement and 
      do not exhibit contact inhibition of locomotion. Instead chick neural crest cells
      display a progressive sharpening of the morphological polarity program. Neural
      crest cells have weak spatial biases in filopodia generation and lifetime. Local 
      bursts of filopodial generation precede the generation of larger protrusions.
      These larger protrusions are more spatially biased than the filopodia, and the
      subset of protrusions that are productive for motility are the most polarized of 
      all. Orientation rather than position is the best correlate of the protrusions
      that are selected for cell guidance. This progressive polarity refinement
      strategy may enable neural crest cells to efficiently explore their environment
      and migrate accurately in the face of noisy guidance cues.

AB  - Terminal differentiation of an organ is the last step in development that enables
      the organism to survive in the outside world after birth. Terminal
      differentiation of the insect tracheae that ends with filling the tubular network
      with gas is not fully understood at the tissue level. Here, we demonstrate that
      yet unidentified valves at the end of the tracheal system of the fruit fly
      Drosophila melanogaster embryo are important elements allowing terminal
      differentiation of this organ. Formation of these valves depends on the function 
      of the zona pellucida protein Trynity (Tyn). The tracheae of tyn mutant embryos
      that lack these structures do not fill with gas. Additionally, external material 
      penetrates into the tracheal tubes indicating that the tyn spiracles are
      permanently open. We conclude that the tracheal endings have to be closed to
      ensure gas-filling. We speculate that according to physical models closing of the
      tubular tracheal network provokes initial increase of the internal hydrostatic
      pressure necessary for gas generation through cavitation when the pressure is
      subsequently decreased.

AB  - Neural basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors promote progenitor
      cell differentiation by activation of downstream target genes that coordinate
      neuronal differentiation. Here we characterize a neural bHLH target gene in
      Xenopus laevis, vexin (vxn; previously sbt1), that is homologous to human c8orf46
      and is conserved across vertebrate species. C8orf46 has been implicated in cancer
      progression, but its function is unknown. Vxn is transiently expressed in
      differentiating progenitors in the developing central nervous system (CNS), and
      is required for neurogenesis in the neural plate and retina. Its function is
      conserved, since overexpression of either Xenopus or mouse vxn expands primary
      neurogenesis and promotes early retinal cell differentiation in cooperation with 
      neural bHLH factors. Vxn protein is localized to the cell membrane and the
      nucleus, but functions in the nucleus to promote neural differentiation. Vxn
      inhibits cell proliferation, and works with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
      p27Xic1 (cdkn1b) to enhance neurogenesis and increase levels of the proneural
      protein Neurog2. We propose that vxn provides a key link between neural bHLH
      activity and execution of the neurogenic program.

      intercellular PCP signaling in the vertebrate inner ear.

AB  - The organization of polarized stereociliary bundles is critical for the function 
      of the inner ear sensory receptor hair cells that detect sound and motion, and
      these cells present a striking example of Planar Cell Polarity (PCP); the
      coordinated orientation of polarized structures within the plane of an
      epithelium. PCP is best understood in Drosophila where the essential genes
      regulating PCP were first discovered, and functions for the core PCP proteins
      encoded by these genes have been deciphered through phenotypic analysis of core
      PCP gene mutants. One illuminating phenotype is the domineering non-autonomy that
      is observed where abrupt disruptions in PCP signaling impacts the orientation of 
      neighboring wild type cells, because this demonstrates local intercellular
      signaling mediated by the core PCP proteins. Using Emx2-Cre to generate an
      analogous mutant boundary in the mouse inner ear, we disrupted vertebrate PCP
      signaling in Vangl1;Vangl2 conditional knockouts. Due to unique aspects of
      vestibular anatomy, core PCP protein distribution along the mutant boundary
      generated in the utricle resembles the proximal side of vang mutant clones in the
      Drosophila wing, while the boundary in the saccule resembles and the distal side.
      Consistent with these protein distributions, a domineering non-autonomy phenotype
      occurs along the Emx2-Cre boundary in the mutant utricle that does not occur in
      the saccule. These results further support the hypothesis that core PCP function 
      is conserved in vertebrates by demonstrating intercellular PCP signaling in the
      sensory epithelia of the mouse ear.

AB  - Formation of neural and sensory progenitors in the inner ear requires Sox2 in
      mammals, and in other species is thought to rely on both Sox2 and Sox3. How Sox2 
      and/or Sox3 promote different fates is poorly understood. Our mutant analysis in 
      zebrafish showed that sox2 is uniquely required for sensory development while
      sox3 is uniquely required for neurogenesis. Moderate misexpression of sox2 during
      placodal stages led to development of otic vesicles with expanded sensory and
      reduced neurogenic domains. However, high-level misexpression of sox2 or sox3
      expanded both sensory and neurogenic domains to fill the medial and lateral
      halves of the otic vesicle, respectively. Disruption of medial factor pax2a
      eliminated the ability of sox2/3 misexpression to expand sensory but not
      neurogenic domains. Additionally, mild misexpression of fgf8 during placodal
      development was sufficient to specifically expand the zone of prosensory
      competence. Later, cross-repression between atoh1a and neurog1 helps maintain the
      sensory-neural boundary, but unlike mouse this does not require Notch activity.
      Together, these data show that sox2 and sox3 exhibit intrinsic differences in
      promoting sensory vs. neural competence, but at high levels these factors can
      mimic each other to enhance both states. Regional cofactors like pax2a and fgf8
      also modify sox2/3 functions.

AB  - Expression of sox3 is one of the earliest markers of Fgf-dependent
      otic/epibranchial placode induction. We report here that sox2 is also expressed
      in the early otic/epibranchial placode in zebrafish. To address functions of sox2
      and sox3, we generated knockouts and heat shock-inducible transgenes. Mutant
      analysis, and low-level misexpression, showed that sox2 and sox3 act redundantly 
      to establish a full complement of otic/epibranchial cells. Disruption of pax8,
      another early regulator, caused similar placodal deficiencies to sox3 mutants or 
      pax8-sox3 double mutants, suggesting that sox3 and pax8 operate in the same
      pathway. High-level misexpression of sox2 or sox3 during early stages
      cell-autonomously blocked placode induction, whereas misexpression several hours 
      later could not reverse placodal differentiation. In an assay for ectopic
      placode-induction, we previously showed that misexpression of fgf8 induces a high
      level of ectopic sox3, but not pax8. Partial knockdown of sox3 significantly
      enhanced ectopic induction of pax8, whereas full knockdown of sox3 inhibited this
      process. Together these findings show that sox2 and sox3 are together required
      for proper otic induction, but the level of expression must be tightly regulated 
      to avoid suppression of differentiation and maintenance of pluripotency.

AB  - GSK3 plays a central role in orchestrating key biological signaling pathways,
      including cell migration. Here, we identify GlkA as a GSK3 family kinase with
      functions that overlap with and are distinct from those of GskA. We show that
      GlkA, as previously shown for GskA, regulates the cell's cytoskeleton through
      MyoII assembly and control of Ras and Rap1 function, leading to aberrant cell
      migration. However, there are both qualitative and quantitative differences in
      the regulation of Ras and Rap1 and their downstream effectors, including PKB,
      PKBR1, and PI3K, with glkA(-) cells exhibiting a more severe chemotaxis phenotype
      than gskA(-) cells. Unexpectedly, the severe glkA(-) phenotypes, but not those of
      gskA(-), are only exhibited when cells are grown attached to a substratum but not
      in suspension, suggesting that GlkA functions as a key kinase of cell attachment 
      signaling. Using proteomic iTRAQ analysis we show that there are quantitative
      differences in the pattern of protein expression depending on the growth
      conditions in wild-type cells. We find that GlkA expression affects the cell's
      proteome during vegetative growth and development, with many of these changes
      depending on whether the cells are grown attached to a substratum or in
      suspension. These changes include key cytoskeletal and signaling proteins known
      to be essential for proper chemotaxis and signal relay during the aggregation
      stage of Dictyostelium development.

TI  - Luteinizing hormone signaling phosphorylates and activates the cyclic GMP
      phosphodiesterase PDE5 in mouse ovarian follicles, contributing an additional
      component to the hormonally induced decrease in cyclic GMP that reinitiates
      meiosis.

AB  - Prior to birth, oocytes within mammalian ovarian follicles initiate meiosis, but 
      then arrest in prophase until puberty, when with each reproductive cycle, one or 
      more follicles are stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) to resume meiosis in
      preparation for fertilization. Within preovulatory follicles, granulosa cells
      produce high levels of cGMP, which diffuses into the oocyte to maintain meiotic
      arrest. LH signaling restarts meiosis by rapidly lowering the levels of cGMP in
      the follicle and oocyte. Part of this decrease is mediated by the
      dephosphorylation and inactivation the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase in response to LH,
      but the mechanism for the remainder of the cGMP decrease is unknown. At least one
      cGMP phosphodiesterase, PDE5, is activated by LH signaling, which would
      contribute to lowering cGMP. PDE5 exhibits increased cGMP-hydrolytic activity
      when phosphorylated on serine 92, and we recently demonstrated that LH signaling 
      phosphorylates PDE5 on this serine and increases its activity in rat follicles.
      To test the extent to which this mechanism contributes to the cGMP decrease that 
      restarts meiosis, we generated a mouse line in which serine 92 was mutated to
      alanine (Pde5-S92A), such that it cannot be phosphorylated. Here we show that
      PDE5 phosphorylation is required for the LH-induced increase in cGMP-hydrolytic
      activity, but that this increase has only a modest effect on the LH-induced cGMP 
      decrease in mouse follicles, and does not affect the timing of meiotic
      resumption. Though we show that the activation of PDE5 is among the mechanisms
      contributing to the cGMP decrease, these results suggest that another cGMP
      phosphodiesterase is also activated by LH signaling.

AB  - Embryonic organizers are signaling centers that coordinate developmental events
      within an embryo. Localized to either an individual cell or group of cells,
      embryonic organizing activity induces the specification of other cells in the
      embryo and can influence formation of body axes. In the spiralian Capitella
      teleta, previous cell deletion studies have shown that organizing activity is
      localized to a single cell, 2d, and this cell induces the formation of the
      dorsal-ventral axis and bilateral symmetry. In this study, we attempt to identify
      the signaling pathway responsible for the organizing activity of 2d. Embryos at
      stages when organizing activity is occurring were exposed to various small
      molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibited either the Activin/Nodal or the
      BMP branch of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Embryos were then raised to larval 
      stages, and scored for axial anomalies analogous to 2d ablated phenotypes. Our
      results show that interference with the Activin/Nodal pathway through a short
      three hour exposure to the inhibitor SB431542 results in larvae that lack
      bilateral symmetry and a detectable dorsal-ventral axis. However, interference
      with the BMP signaling pathway through exposure to the inhibitors DMH1 and
      dorsomorphin dihydrochloride does not appear to play a role in specification by
      2d of the dorsal-ventral axis or bilateral symmetry. Our findings highlight
      species differences in how the molecular architecture of the conserved TGF-beta
      superfamily signaling pathway components was utilized to mediate the organizing
      activity signal during early spiralian development.

AB  - An R3-type MYB transcription factor, CAPRICE (CPC), is known to promote root hair
      cell differentiation in Arabidopsis root epidermis. The CPC protein moves from
      non-hair cells to the neighboring cells, and acts as an inducer of root hair
      formation. In contrast, we previously showed that the CPC homolog, ENHANCER OF
      TRY AND CPC1 (ETC1), does not move between the root epidermal cells. To clarify
      the critical difference in the cell-to-cell movement ability of CPC and ETC1
      proteins, we generated five different chimeras of CPC and ETC1. As expected, four
      of the five chimeric proteins with substitution of CPC amino acids with those of 
      ETC1 induced many root hair and no-trichome phenotype, like CPC. These chimeric
      proteins essentially maintained the cell-to-cell movement ability of CPC.
      However, one chimeric protein in which ETC1 was sandwiched between the
      CPC-specific movement motifs of S1 and S2 did not induce ectopic root hair
      formation. This chimeric protein did not move between the cells. These results
      indicate that the maintenance of not only the S1 and S2 motifs but also the
      precise structure of CPC protein might be necessary for the cell-to-cell movement
      of CPC. Our results should help in further unraveling of the roles of these MYB
      transcription factors in root hair formation.

AB  - Small heat shock proteins are chaperones with variable mechanisms of action. The 
      function of cardiac family member Hspb7 is unknown, despite being identified
      through GWAS as a potential cardiomyopathy risk gene. We discovered that
      zebrafish hspb7 mutants display mild focal cardiac fibrosis and sarcomeric
      abnormalities. Significant mortality was observed in adult hspb7 mutants
      subjected to exercise stress, demonstrating a genetic and environmental
      interaction that determines disease outcome. We identified large sarcomeric
      proteins FilaminC and Titin as Hspb7 binding partners in cardiac cells. Damaged
      FilaminC undergoes autophagic processing to maintain sarcomeric homeostasis. Loss
      of Hspb7 in zebrafish or human cardiomyocytes stimulated autophagic pathways and 
      expression of the sister gene encoding Hspb5. Inhibiting autophagy caused
      FilaminC aggregation in HSPB7 mutant human cardiomyocytes and developmental
      cardiomyopathy in hspb7 mutant zebrafish embryos. These studies highlight the
      importance of damage-processing networks in cardiomyocytes, and a previously
      unrecognized role in this context for Hspb7.

AB  - The murine pancreas buds from the ventral embryonic endoderm at approximately
      8.75 dpc and a second pancreas bud emerges from the dorsal endoderm by 9.0 dpc.
      Although it is clear that secreted signals from adjacent mesoderm-derived sources
      are required for both the appropriate emergence and further refinement of the
      pancreatic endoderm, neither the exact signals nor the requisite tissue sources
      have been defined in mammalian systems. Herein we use DiI fate mapping of
      cultured murine embryos to identify the embryonic sources of both the early
      inductive and later condensed pancreatic mesenchyme. Despite being capable of
      supporting pancreas induction from dorsal endoderm in co-culture experiments, we 
      find that in the context of the developing embryo, the dorsal aortae as well as
      the paraxial, intermediate, and lateral mesoderm derivatives only transiently
      associate with the dorsal pancreas bud, producing descendants that are decidedly 
      anterior to the pancreas bud. Unlike these other mesoderm derivatives, the axial 
      (notochord) descendants maintain association with the dorsal pre-pancreatic
      endoderm and early pancreas bud. This fate mapping data points to the notochord
      as the likely inductive source in vivo while also revealing dynamic morphogenetic
      movements displayed by individual mesodermal subtypes. Because none of the
      mesoderm examined above produced the pancreatic mesenchyme that condenses around 
      the induced bud to support exocrine and endocrine differentiation, we also sought
      to identify the mesodermal origins of this mesenchyme. We identify a portion of
      the coelomic mesoderm that contributes to the condensed pancreatic mesenchyme. In
      conclusion, we identify a portion of the notochord as a likely source of the
      signals required to induce and maintain the early dorsal pancreas bud,
      demonstrate that the coelomic mesothelium contributes to the dorsal and ventral
      pancreatic mesenchyme, and provide insight into the dynamic morphological
      rearrangements of mesoderm-derived tissues during early organogenesis stages of
      mammalian development.

AB  - T antigen (Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr) is an evolutionary-conserved
      mucin-type core 1 glycan structure in animals synthesized by core 1
      beta1,3-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GalT1). Previous studies showed that T antigen
      produced by Drosophila C1GalT1 (dC1GalT1) was expressed in various tissues and
      dC1GalT1 loss in larvae led to various defects, including decreased number of
      circulating hemocytes, hyper-differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in lymph
      glands, malformation of the central nervous system, mislocalization of
      neuromuscular junction (NMJ) boutons, and ultrastructural abnormalities in NMJs
      and muscle cells. Although glucuronylated T antigen
      (GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr) has been identified in Drosophila,
      the physiological function of this structure has not yet been clarified. In this 
      study, for the first time, we unraveled biological roles of glucuronylated T
      antigen. Our data show that in Drosophila, glucuronylation of T antigen is
      predominantly carried out by Drosophila beta1,3-glucuronyltransferase-P
      (dGlcAT-P). We created dGlcAT-P null mutants and found that mutant larvae showed 
      lower expression of glucuronylated T antigen on the muscles and at NMJs.
      Furthermore, mislocalization of NMJ boutons and a partial loss of the basement
      membrane components collagen IV (Col IV) and nidogen (Ndg) at the muscle 6/7
      boundary were observed. Those two phenotypes were correlated and identical to
      previously described phenotypes in dC1GalT1 mutant larvae. In addition, dGlcAT-P 
      null mutants exhibited fewer NMJ branches on muscles 6/7. Moreover,
      ultrastructural analysis revealed that basement membranes that lacked Col IV and 
      Ndg were significantly deformed. We also found that the loss of dGlcAT-P
      expression caused ultrastructural defects in NMJ boutons. Finally, we showed a
      genetic interaction between dGlcAT-P and dC1GalT1. Therefore, these results
      demonstrate that glucuronylated core 1 glycans synthesized by dGlcAT-P are key
      modulators of NMJ bouton localization, basement membrane formation, and NMJ
      arborization on larval muscles.

AB  - Proper embryonic development relies on a tight control of spatial and temporal
      gene expression profiles in a highly regulated manner. One good example is the
      ON/OFF switching of the transcription factor PAX6 that governs important steps of
      neurogenesis. In the neural tube PAX6 expression is initiated in neural
      progenitors through the positive action of retinoic acid signaling and
      downregulated in neuronal precursors by the bHLH transcription factor NEUROG2.
      How these two regulatory inputs are integrated at the molecular level to properly
      fine tune temporal PAX6 expression is not known. In this study we identified and 
      characterized a 940-bp long distal cis-regulatory module (CRM), located far away 
      from the PAX6 transcription unit and which conveys positive input from RA
      signaling pathway and indirect repressive signal(s) from NEUROG2. These opposing 
      regulatory signals are integrated through HOMZ, a 94bp core region within E940
      which is evolutionarily conserved in distant organisms such as the zebrafish. We 
      show that within HOMZ, NEUROG2 and RA exert their opposite temporal activities
      through a short 60bp region containing a functional RA-responsive element (RARE).
      We propose a model in which retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and NEUROG2 repressive
      target(s) compete on the same DNA motif to fine tune temporal PAX6 expression
      during the course of spinal neurogenesis.

AB  - Fibrillarin (Fbl) is a highly conserved protein that plays an essential role in
      ribosome biogenesis and more particularly in the methylation of ribosomal RNAs
      and rDNA histones. In cellular models, FBL was shown to play an important role in
      tumorigenesis and stem cell differentiation. We used the zebrafish as an in vivo 
      model to study Fbl function during embryonic development. We show here that the
      optic tectum and the eye are severely affected by Fbl depletion whereas ventral
      regions of the brain are less impacted. The morphogenesis defects are associated 
      with impaired neural differentiation and massive apoptosis. Polysome gradient
      experiments show that fbl mutant larvae display defects in ribosome biogenesis
      and activity. Strikingly, flow cytometry analyses revealed different S-phase
      profiles between wild-type and mutant cells, suggesting a defect in S-phase
      progression.

AB  - Successful fertilization requires that sperm are activated prior to contacting an
      oocyte. In C. elegans, this activation process, called spermiogenesis, transforms
      round immobile spermatids into motile, fertilization-competent spermatozoa. We
      describe the phenotypic and genetic characterization of spe-43, a new component
      of the spe-8 pathway, which is required for spermiogenesis in hermaphrodites;
      spe-43 hermaphrodites are self-sterile, while spe-43 males show wild-type
      fertility. When exposed to Pronase to activate sperm in vitro, spe-43 spermatids 
      form long rigid spikes radiating outward from the cell periphery instead of
      forming a motile pseudopod, indicating that spermiogenesis initiates but is not
      completed. Using a combination of recombinant and deletion mapping and whole
      genome sequencing, we identified F09E8.1 as spe-43. SPE-43 is predicted to exist 
      in two isoforms; one isoform appears to be a single-pass transmembrane protein
      while the other is predicted to be a secreted protein. SPE-43 can bind to other
      known sperm proteins, including SPE-4 and SPE-29, which are known to impact
      spermiogenesis. In summary, we have identified a membrane protein that is present
      in C. elegans sperm and is required for sperm activation via the hermaphrodite
      activation signal.

AB  - Zebrafish primordial germ cells (PGCs) constitute a useful in vivo model to study
      cell migration and to elucidate the role of specific proteins in this process.
      Here we report on the role of the heat shock protein Hsp90aa1.2, a protein whose 
      RNA level is elevated in the PGCs during their migration. Reducing Hsp90aa1.2
      activity slows down the progression through the cell cycle and leads to defects
      in the control over the MTOC number in the migrating cells. These defects result 
      in a slower migration rate and compromise the arrival of PGCs at their target,
      the region where the gonad develops. Our results emphasize the importance of
      ensuring rapid progression through the cell cycle during single-cell migration
      and highlight the role of heat shock proteins in the process.

AB  - Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) are multipotent embryonic progenitors covering all
      developing peripheral nerves. These nerves grow and navigate with unprecedented
      precision, delivering SCP progenitors to almost all locations in the embryonic
      body. Within specific developing tissues, SCPs detach from nerves and generate
      neuroendocrine cells, autonomic neurons, mature Schwann cells, melanocytes and
      other cell types. These properties of SCPs evoke resemblances between them and
      their parental population, namely, neural crest cells. Neural crest cells are
      incredibly multipotent migratory cells that revolutionized the course of
      evolution in the lineage of early chordate animals. Given this similarity and
      recent data, it is possible to hypothesize that proto-neural crest cells are
      similar to SCPs spreading along the nerves. Here, we review the multipotency of
      SCPs, the signals that govern them, their potential therapeutic value, SCP's
      embryonic origin and their evolutionary connections. We dedicate this article to 
      the memory of Wilhelm His, the father of the microtome and "Zwischenstrang",
      currently known as the neural crest.

AB  - Genome stability relies notably on the integrity of centrosomes and on the
      mitotic spindle they organize. Structural and numerical centrosome aberrations
      are frequently observed in human cancer, and there is increasing evidence that
      centrosome amplification can promote tumorigenesis. Here, we use C. elegans seam 
      cells as a model system to analyze centrosome homeostasis in the context of a
      stereotyped stem like lineage. We found that overexpression of the Plk4-related
      kinase ZYG-1 leads to the formation of one supernumerary centriolar focus per
      parental centriole during the cell cycle that leads to the sole symmetric
      division in the seam lineage. In the following cell cycle, such supernumerary
      foci function as microtubule organizing centers, but do not cluster during
      mitosis, resulting in the formation of a multipolar spindle and then aneuploid
      daughter cells. Intriguingly, we found also that supernumerary centriolar foci do
      not assemble in the asymmetric cell divisions that precedes or that follows the
      symmetric seam cell division, despite the similar presence of GFP::ZYG-1.
      Furthermore, we established that supernumerary centrioles form earlier during
      development in animals depleted of the heterochronic gene lin-14, in which the
      symmetric division is precocious. Conversely, supernumerary centrioles are
      essentially not observed in animals depleted of lin-28, in which the symmetric
      division is lacking. These findings lead us to conclude that ZYG-1 promotes
      limited centriole amplification solely during the symmetric division in the C.
      elegans seam lineage.

AB  - During cerebral cortex development, neural progenitors are required to elaborate 
      a variety of cell differentiation signals to which they are continuously exposed.
      RA acid is a potent inducer of neuronal differentiation as it was found to
      influence cortical development. We report herein that TBR2, a transcription
      factor specific to Intermediate (Basal) Neural Progenitors (INPs), represses
      activation of the RA responsive element and expression of RA target genes in cell
      lines. This repressive action on RA signaling was functionally confirmed by the
      decrease of RA-mediated neuronal differentiation in neural stem cells stably
      overexpressing TBR2. In vivo mapping of RA activity in the developing cortex
      indicated that RA activity is detected in radial glial cells and subsequently
      downregulated in INPs, revealing a fine cell-type specific regulation of its
      signaling. Thus, TBR2 might be a molecular player in opposing RA signaling in
      INPs. Interestingly, this negative regulation is achieved at least in part by
      directly repressing the critical nuclear RA co-factor ZFP423. Indeed, we found
      ZFP423 to be expressed in the developing cortex and promote RA-dependent neuronal
      differentiation. These data indicate that TBR2 contributes to suppressing RA
      signaling in INPs, thereby enabling them to re-enter the cell cycle and delay
      neuronal differentiation.

AB  - Hybrid dysgenesis is a sterility syndrome resulting from the mobilization of
      certain transposable elements in the Drosophila germline. Particularly extreme is
      the hybrid dysgenesis syndrome caused by P-element DNA transposons, in which
      dysgenic female ovaries often contain few or no germline cells. Those offspring
      that are produced from dysgenic germlines exhibit high rates of de novo mutation 
      and recombination, implicating transposition-associated DNA damage as the cause
      of germline loss. However, how this loss occurs, in terms of the particular
      cellular response that is triggered (cell cycle arrest, senescence, or cell
      death) remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that two components of the DNA
      damage response, Checkpoint kinase 2 and its downstream target p53, determine the
      frequency of ovarian atrophy that is associated with P-element hybrid dysgenesis.
      We further show that p53 is strongly induced in the germline stem cells (GSCs) of
      dysgenic females, and is required for their maintenance. Our observations support
      the critical role for p53 in conferring tolerance of transposable element
      activity in stem cells.

AB  - Control of microtubule dynamics is crucial for cell migration. We analyzed
      regulation of microtubule network dynamics in the zebrafish yolk cell during
      epiboly, the earliest coordinated gastrulation movement. We labeled microtubules 
      with EMTB-3GFP and EB3-mCherry to visualize and measure microtubule dynamics by
      TIRF microscopy live imaging. Yolk cell microtubules dynamics is temporally
      modulated during epiboly progression. We used maternal zygotic Pou5f3 mutant
      (MZspg) embryos, which develop strong distortions of microtubule network
      organization and epiboly retardation, to investigate genetic control of
      microtubule dynamics. In MZspg embryos, microtubule plus-end growth tracks move
      slower and are less straight compared to wild-type. MZspg embryos have altered
      steroidogenic enzyme expression, resulting in increased pregnenolone and reduced 
      progesterone levels. We show that progesterone positively affects microtubule
      plus-end growth and track straightness. Progesterone may thus act as a
      non-cell-autonomous regulator of microtubule dynamics across the large yolk cell,
      and may adjust differing demands on microtubule dynamics and stability during
      initiation and progression phases of epiboly.

AB  - The eyegone (eyg) gene encodes Eyg, a transcription factor of the Pax family with
      multiple roles during Drosophila development. Eyg has been shown to be nuclear in
      the cells where it functions. In this report we describe a new functional
      cytoplasmic distribution of Eyg during egg chamber development in the female
      ovarioles. The protein is present from the germarium until stage 10 of cyst
      development. The majority of egg chambers that develop in the absence of Eyg
      arrest their development before stage 10, show augmented levels of the telomeric 
      retro-transposon TART-A and low levels of heterochromatin marks in the oocyte
      nucleus. During the maternal to zygotic transition (MTZ) Eyg seems to play a role
      in destabilizing germ cell less (gcl) and oo 16 RNA binding protein (orb) mRNAs. 
      We were able to show that Eyg interacts with Aubergine (Aub), a component of the 
      pi-RNA pathway during egg chamber development. This interaction could be
      essential for Eyg to be retained in the cytoplasm and fulfill its functions
      there.

TI  - Temporal and SUMO-specific SUMOylation contribute to the dynamics of Polo-like

AB  - During mammalian meiosis, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is essential during cell
      cycle progression. In oocyte maturation, PLK1 expression is well characterized
      but timing of posttranslational modifications regulating its activity and
      subcellular localization are less clear. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) 
      posttranslational modifier proteins have been detected in mammalian gametes but
      their precise function during gametogenesis is largely unknown. In the present
      paper we report for mouse oocytes that both PLK1 and phosphorylated PLK1 undergo 
      SUMOylation in meiosis II (MII) oocytes using immunocytochemistry,
      immunoprecipitation and in vitro SUMOylation assays. At MII, PLK1 is
      phosphorylated at threonine-210 and serine-137. MII oocyte PLK1 and
      phosphorylated PLK1 undergo SUMOylation by SUMO-1, -2 and -3 as shown by
      individual in vitro assays. Using these assays, forms of phosphorylated PLK1
      normalized to PLK1 increased significantly and correlated with SUMOylated PLK1
      levels. During meiotic progression and maturation, SUMO-1-SUMOylation of PLK1 is 
      involved in spindle formation whereas SUMO-2/3-SUMOylation may regulate PLK1
      activity at kinetochore-spindle attachment sites. Microtubule integrity is
      required for PLK1 localization with SUMO-1 but not with SUMO-2/3. Inhibition of
      SUMOylation disrupts proper meiotic bipolar spindle organization and
      spindle-kinetochore attachment. The data show that both temporal and
      SUMO-specific-SUMOylation play important roles in orchestrating functional
      dynamics of PLK1 during mouse oocyte meiosis, including subcellular
      compartmentalization.

AB  - The embryonic aorta produces hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from a
      hemogenic endothelium localized in the aortic floor through an endothelial to
      hematopoietic transition. It has been long proposed that the Bone Morphogenetic
      Protein (BMP)/Transforming Growth Factor ss (TGFss) signaling pathway was
      implicated in aortic hematopoiesis but the very nature of the signal was unknown.
      Here, using thorough expression analysis of the BMP/TGFss signaling pathway
      members in the endothelial and hematopoietic compartments of the aorta at
      pre-hematopoietic and hematopoietic stages, we show that the TGFss pathway is
      preferentially balanced with a prominent role of Alk1/TgfssR2/Smad1 and 5 on both
      chicken and mouse species. Functional analysis using embryonic stem cells mutated
      for Acvrl1 revealed an enhanced propensity to produce hematopoietic cells.
      Collectively, we reveal that TGFss through the Alk1/TgfssR2 receptor axis is
      acting on endothelial cells to produce hematopoiesis.

AB  - Merkel cells are mechanosensitive skin cells derived from the epidermal lineage
      whose development requires expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription
      factor Atoh1. The genes and pathways involved in regulating Merkel cell
      development during embryogenesis are poorly understood. Notch pathway signaling
      antagonizes Atoh1 expression in many developing body regions, so we hypothesized 
      that Notch signaling might inhibit Merkel cell development. We found that
      conditional, constitutive overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD)
      in mouse epidermis significantly decreased Merkel cell numbers in whisker
      follicles and touch domes of hairy skin. Conversely, conditional deletion of the 
      obligate NICD binding partner RBPj in the epidermis significantly increased
      Merkel cell numbers in whisker follicles, led to the development of ectopic
      Merkel cells outside of touch domes in hairy skin epidermis, and altered the
      distribution of Merkel cells in touch domes. Deletion of the downstream Notch
      effector gene Hes1 also significantly increased Merkel cell numbers in whisker
      follicles. Together, these data demonstrate that Notch signaling regulates Merkel
      cell production and patterning.

AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated growth factor signaling is essential for proper
      formation and development of the neural crest. The many ligands and receptors
      implicated in these processes signal through relatively few downstream pathways, 
      frequently converging on the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Despite decades of study,
      there is still considerable uncertainty about where and when these signaling
      pathways are required and how they elicit particular responses. This review
      summarizes our current understanding of growth factor-induced MAPK and PI3K
      signaling in the neural crest.

AB  - Wilhelm His (1831-1904) provided lasting insights into the development of the
      central and peripheral nervous system using innovative technologies such as the
      microtome, which he invented. 150 years after his resurrection of the classical
      germ layer theory of Wolff, von Baer and Remak, his description of the
      developmental origin of cranial and spinal ganglia from a distinct cell
      population, now known as the neural crest, has stood the test of time and more
      recently sparked tremendous advances regarding the molecular development of these
      important cells. In addition to his 1868 treatise on 'Zwischenstrang' (now neural
      crest), his work on the development of the human hindbrain published in 1890
      provided novel ideas that more than 100 years later form the basis for
      penetrating molecular investigations of the regionalization of the hindbrain
      neural tube and of the migration and differentiation of its constituent neuron
      populations. In the first part of this review we briefly summarize the major
      discoveries of Wilhelm His and his impact on the field of embryology. In the
      second part we relate His' observations to current knowledge about the molecular 
      underpinnings of hindbrain development and evolution. We conclude with the
      proposition, present already in rudimentary form in the writings of His, that a
      primordial spinal cord-like organization has been molecularly supplemented to
      generate hindbrain 'neomorphs' such as the cerebellum and the auditory and
      vestibular nuclei and their associated afferents and sensory organs.

AB  - The migration and distribution patterns of neural crest (NC) cells reflect the
      distinct embryonic environments of the head and trunk: cephalic NC cells migrate 
      predominantly along the dorsolateral pathway to populate the craniofacial and
      pharyngeal regions, whereas trunk crest cells migrate along the ventrolateral
      pathways to form the dorsal root ganglia. These two patterns thus reflect the
      branchiomeric and somitomeric architecture, respectively, of the vertebrate body 
      plan. The so-called vagal NC occupies a postotic, intermediate level between the 
      head and trunk NC. This level of NC gives rise to both trunk- and cephalic-type
      (circumpharyngeal) NC cells. The anatomical pattern of the amphioxus, a basal
      chordate, suggests that somites and pharyngeal gills coexist along an extensive
      length of the body axis, indicating that the embryonic environment is similar to 
      that of vertebrate vagal NC cells and may have been ancestral for vertebrates.
      The amniote-like condition in which the cephalic and trunk domains are distinctly
      separated would have been brought about, in part, by anteroposterior reduction of
      the pharyngeal domain.

TI  - The switch from cAMP-independent to cAMP-dependent arrest of meiotic prophase is 
      associated with coordinated GPR3 and CDK1 expression in mouse oocytes.

AB  - Mammalian oocytes are arrested in meiotic prophase from around the time of birth 
      until just before ovulation. Following an extended period of growth, they are
      stimulated to mature to the metaphase II stage by a preovulatory luteinizing
      hormone (LH) surge that occurs with each reproductive cycle. Small, growing
      oocytes are not competent to mature into fertilizable eggs because they do not
      possess adequate amounts of cell cycle regulatory proteins, particularly
      cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). As oocytes grow, they synthesize CDK1 and
      acquire the ability to mature. After oocytes achieve meiotic competence, meiotic 
      arrest at the prophase stage is dependent on high levels of cAMP that are
      generated in the oocyte under the control of the constitutively active Gs-coupled
      receptor, GPR3. In this study, we examined the switch between GPR3-independent
      and GPR3-dependent meiotic arrest. We found that the ability of oocytes to
      mature, as well as oocyte CDK1 levels, were dependent on follicle size, but CDK1 
      expression in oocytes from preantral follicles was not acutely altered by the
      activity of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Gpr3 was expressed and active in 
      incompetent oocytes within early stage follicles, well before cAMP is required to
      maintain meiotic arrest. Oocytes from Gpr3(-/-) mice were less competent to
      mature than oocytes from Gpr3(+/+) mice, as assessed by the time course of
      germinal vesicle breakdown. Correspondingly, Gpr3(-/-) oocytes contained
      significantly lower CDK1 levels than their Gpr3(+/+) counterparts that were at
      the same stage of follicle development. These results demonstrate that GPR3
      potentiates meiotic competence, most likely by raising cAMP.

      regulatory targets.

AB  - The PITX1 transcription factor is expressed during hindlimb development, where it
      plays a critical role in directing hindlimb growth and the specification of
      hindlimb morphology. While it is known that PITX1 regulates hindlimb formation,
      in part, through activation of the Tbx4 gene, other transcriptional targets
      remain to be elucidated. We have used a combination of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to
      investigate enhancer regions and target genes that are directly regulated by
      PITX1 in embryonic mouse hindlimbs. In addition, we have analyzed PITX1 binding
      sites in hindlimbs of Anolis lizards to identify ancient PITX1 regulatory
      targets. We find that PITX1-bound regions in both mouse and Anolis hindlimbs are 
      strongly associated with genes implicated in limb and skeletal system
      development. Gene expression analyses reveal a large number of misexpressed genes
      in the hindlimbs of Pitx1(-/-) mouse embryos. By intersecting misexpressed genes 
      with genes that have neighboring mouse PITX1 binding sites, we identified 440
      candidate targets of PITX1. Of these candidates, 68 exhibit ultra-conserved PITX1
      binding events that are shared between mouse and Anolis hindlimbs. Among the
      ancient targets of PITX1 are important regulators of cartilage and skeletal
      muscle development, including Sox9 and Six1. Our data suggest that PITX1 promotes
      chondrogenesis and myogenesis in the hindlimb by direct regulation of several key
      members of the cartilage and muscle transcriptional networks.

AB  - Amacrine interneurons play a critical role in the processing of visual signals
      within the retina. They are highly diverse, representing 30 or more distinct
      subtypes. Little is known about how amacrine subtypes acquire their unique gene
      expression and morphological features. We characterized the gene expression
      pattern of the zinc-finger transcription factor Prdm13 in the mouse. Consistent
      with a developmental role, Prdm13 was expressed by Ptf1a+ amacrine and horizontal
      precursors. Over time, Prdm13 expression diverged from the transiently expressed 
      Ptf1a and marked just a subset of amacrine cells in the adult retina. While
      heterogeneous, we show that most of these Prdm13+ amacrine cells express the
      transcription factor Ebf3 and the calcium binding protein calretinin. Loss of
      Prdm13 did not affect the number of amacrine cells formed during development.
      However, we observed a modest loss of amacrine cells and increased apoptosis that
      correlated with the onset timing of Ebf3 expression. Adult Prdm13
      loss-of-function mice had 25% fewer amacrine cells, altered calretinin
      expression, and a lack of Ebf3+ amacrines. Forcing Prdm13 expression in retinal
      progenitor cells did not significantly increase amacrine cell formation, Ebf3 or 
      calretinin expression, and appeared detrimental to the survival of
      photoreceptors. Our data show that Prdm13 is not required for amacrine fate as a 
      class, but is essential for the formation of Ebf3+ amacrine cell subtypes. Rather
      than driving subtype identity, Prdm13 may act by restricting competing fate
      programs to maintain identity and survival.

AB  - Mechanisms coupling growth and metabolism are conserved in Drosophila and
      mammals. In metazoans, such coupling is achieved across tissue scales through the
      regulated secretion of chemical messengers such as insulin that control the
      metabolism and growth of cells. Although the regulated secretion of Insulin like 
      peptide (dILP) is key to normal growth and metabolism in Drosophila, the
      sub-cellular mechanisms that regulate dILP release remain poorly understood. We
      find that reduced function of the only protein kinase D in Drosophila (dPKD(H))
      results in delayed larval growth and development associated with abnormal sugar
      and lipid metabolism, reduced insulin signalling and accumulation of dILP2 in the
      neurosecretory IPCs of the larval brain. These phenotypes are rescued by
      tissue-selective reconstitution of dPKD in the neurosecretory cells of dPKD(H).
      Selective downregulation of dPKD activity in the neurosecretory IPCs phenocopies 
      the growth defects, metabolic abnormalities and dILP2 accumulation seen in
      dPKD(H). Thus, dPKD mediated secretion of dILP2 from neurosecretory cells during 
      development is necessary for normal larval growth.

AB  - The transcription factors GATA4, GATA5 and GATA6 are important regulators of
      heart muscle differentiation (cardiomyogenesis), which function in a partially
      redundant manner. We identified genes specifically regulated by individual
      cardiogenic GATA factors in a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis. The genes
      regulated by gata4 are particularly interesting because GATA4 is able to induce
      differentiation of beating cardiomyocytes in Xenopus and in mammalian systems.
      Among the specifically gata4-regulated transcripts we identified two SoxF family 
      members, sox7 and sox18. Experimental reinstatement of gata4 restores sox7 and
      sox18 expression, and loss of cardiomyocyte differentiation due to gata4
      knockdown is partially restored by reinstating sox7 or sox18 expression, while
      (as previously reported) knockdown of sox7 or sox18 interferes with heart muscle 
      formation. In order to test for conservation in mammalian cardiomyogenesis, we
      confirmed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergoing cardiomyogenesis that
      knockdown of Gata4 leads to reduced Sox7 (and Sox18) expression and that Gata4 is
      also uniquely capable of promptly inducing Sox7 expression. Taken together, we
      identify an important and conserved gene regulatory axis from gata4 to the SoxF
      paralogs sox7 and sox18 and further to heart muscle cell differentiation.

      amphioxus.

AB  - Establishment of asymmetry along the left-right (LR) body axis in vertebrates
      requires interplay between Nodal and Bmp signaling pathways. In the basal
      chordate amphioxus, the left-sided activity of the Nodal signaling has been
      attributed to the asymmetric morphogenesis of paraxial structures and pharyngeal 
      organs, however the role of Bmp signaling in LR asymmetry establishment has not
      been addressed to date. Here, we show that Bmp signaling is necessary for the
      development of LR asymmetric morphogenesis of amphioxus larvae through regulation
      of Nodal signaling. Loss of Bmp signaling results in loss of the left-sided
      expression of Nodal, Gdf1/3, Lefty and Pitx and in gain of ectopic expression of 
      Cerberus on the left side. As a consequence, the larvae display loss of the
      offset arrangement of axial structures, loss of the left-sided pharyngeal organs 
      including the mouth, and ectopic development of the right-sided organs on the
      left side. Bmp inhibition thus phenocopies inhibition of Nodal signaling and
      results in the right isomerism. We conclude that Bmp and Nodal pathways act in
      concert to specify the left side and that Bmp signaling plays a fundamental role 
      during LR development in amphioxus.

AB  - Actin is an integral component of epithelial apical junctions, yet the
      interactions of branched actin regulators with apical junction components are
      still not clear. Biochemical data have shown that alpha-catenin inhibits
      Arp2/3-dependent branched actin. These results suggested that branched actin is
      only needed at earliest stages of apical junction development. We use live
      imaging in developing C. elegans embryos to test models for how WAVE-induced
      branched actin collaborates with other apical junction proteins during the
      essential process of junction formation and maturation. We uncover both early and
      late essential roles for WAVE in apical junction formation. Early, as the C.
      elegans intestinal epithelium becomes polarized, we find that WAVE components
      become enriched concurrently with the Cadherin components and before the DLG-1
      apical accumulation. Live imaging of F-actin accumulation in polarizing intestine
      supports that the Cadherin complex components and branched actin regulators work 
      together for apical actin enrichment. Later in junction development, the apical
      accumulation of WAVE and Cadherin components is shown to be interdependent:
      Cadherin complex loss alters WAVE accumulation, and WAVE complex loss increases
      Cadherin accumulation. To determine why Cadherin levels rise when WVE-1 is
      depleted, we use FRAP to analyze Cadherin dynamics and find that loss of WAVE as 
      well as of the trafficking protein EHD-1/RME-1 increases Cadherin dynamics. EM
      studies in adults depleted of branched actin regulators support that WVE-1
      maintains established junctions, presumably through its trafficking effect on
      Cadherin. Thus we propose a developmental model for junction formation where
      branched actin regulators are tightly interconnected with Cadherin junctions
      through their previously unappreciated role in Cadherin transport.

      developmental competence during endoderm organogenesis.

AB  - A small number of signaling pathways are used repeatedly during organogenesis,
      and they can have drastically different effects on the same population of cells
      depending on the embryonic stage. How cellular competence changes over
      developmental time is not well understood. Here we used Xenopus, mouse, and human
      pluripotent stem cells to investigate how the temporal sequence of Wnt, BMP, and 
      retinoic acid (RA) signals regulates endoderm developmental competence and organ 
      induction, focusing on respiratory fate. While Nkx2-1+ lung fate is not induced
      until late somitogenesis stages, here we show that lung competence is restricted 
      by the gastrula stage as a result of Wnt and BMP-dependent anterior-posterior
      (A-P) patterning. These early Wnt and BMP signals make posterior endoderm
      refractory to subsequent RA/Wnt/BMP-dependent lung induction. We further mapped
      how RA modulates the response to Wnt and BMP in a temporal specific manner. In
      the gastrula RA promotes posterior identity, however in early somite stages of
      development RA regulates respiratory versus pharyngeal potential in anterior
      endoderm and midgut versus hindgut potential in posterior endoderm. Together our 
      data suggest a dynamic and conserved response of vertebrate endoderm during
      organogenesis, wherein early Wnt/BMP/RA impacts how cells respond to later
      Wnt/BMP/RA signals, illustrating how reiterative combinatorial signaling can
      regulate both developmental competence and subsequent fate specification.

AB  - In early zebrafish development, the program for dorsal axis formation begins soon
      after fertilization. Previous studies suggested that dorsal determinants (DDs)
      localize to the vegetal pole, and are transported to the dorsal blastomeres in a 
      microtubule-dependent manner. The DDs activate the canonical Wnt pathway and
      induce dorsal-specific genes that are required for dorsal axis formation. Among
      wnt-family genes, only the wnt8a mRNA is reported to localize to the vegetal pole
      in oocytes and to induce the dorsal axis, suggesting that Wnt8a is a candidate
      DD. Here, to reveal the roles of maternal wnt8a, we generated wnt8a mutants by
      transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and established
      zygotic, maternal, and maternal zygotic wnt8a mutants by germ-line replacement.
      Zebrafish wnt8a has two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) that are tandemly
      located in the genome. Although the zygotic ORF1 or ORF2 wnt8a mutants showed
      little or no axis-formation defects, the ORF1/2 compound mutants showed
      antero-dorsalized phenotypes, indicating that ORF1 and ORF2 have redundant roles 
      in ventrolateral and posterior tissue formation. Unexpectedly, the maternal wnt8a
      ORF1/2 mutants showed no axis-formation defects. The maternal-zygotic wnt8a
      ORF1/2 mutants showed more severe antero-dorsalized phenotypes than the zygotic
      mutants. These results indicated that maternal wnt8a is dispensable for the
      initial dorsal determination, but cooperates with zygotic wnt8a for ventrolateral
      and posterior tissue formation. Finally, we re-examined the maternal wnt genes
      and found that Wnt6a is an alternative candidate DD.

AB  - Transcriptional silencing is a conserved process used by embryonic germ cells to 
      repress somatic fate and maintain totipotency and immortality. In Drosophila,
      this transcriptional silencing is mediated by polar granule component (pgc).
      Here, we show that in the adult ovary, pgc is required for timely germline stem
      cell (GSC) differentiation. Pgc is expressed transiently in the immediate GSC
      daughter (pre-cystoblast), where it mediates a pulse of transcriptional
      silencing. This transcriptional silencing mediated by pgc indirectly promotes the
      accumulation of Cyclin B (CycB) and cell cycle progression into late-G2 phase,
      when the differentiation factor bag of marbles (bam) is expressed. Pgc mediated
      accumulation of CycB is also required for heterochromatin deposition, which
      protects the germ line genome against selfish DNA elements. Our results suggest
      that transient transcriptional silencing in the pre-cystoblast "re-programs" it
      away from self-renewal and toward the gamete differentiation program.

      expression in diverse animal species.

AB  - In situ hybridization is a widely employed technique allowing spatial
      visualization of gene expression in fixed specimens. It has greatly advanced our 
      understanding of biological processes, including developmental regulation. In
      situ protocols are today routinely followed in numerous laboratories, and
      although details might change, they all include a hybridization step, where
      specific antisense RNA or DNA probes anneal to the target nucleic acid sequence. 
      This step is generally carried out at high temperatures and in a denaturing
      solution, called hybridization buffer, commonly containing 50% (v/v) formamide - 
      a hazardous chemical. When applied to the soft-bodied hydrozoan medusa Clytia
      hemisphaerica, we found that this traditional hybridization approach was not
      fully satisfactory, causing extensive deterioration of morphology and tissue
      texture which compromised our observation and interpretation of results. We thus 
      tested alternative solutions for in situ detection of gene expression and,
      inspired by optimized protocols for Northern and Southern blot analysis, we
      substituted the 50% formamide with an equal volume of 8M urea solution in the
      hybridization buffer. Our new protocol not only yielded better morphologies and
      tissue consistency, but also notably improved the resolution of the signal,
      allowing more precise localization of gene expression and reducing aspecific
      staining associated with problematic areas. Given the improved results and
      reduced manipulation risks, we tested the urea protocol on other metazoans, two
      brachiopod species (Novocrania anomala and Terebratalia transversa) and the
      priapulid worm Priapulus caudatus, obtaining a similar reduction of aspecific
      probe binding. Overall, substitution of formamide by urea during in situ
      hybridization offers a safer alternative, potentially of widespread use in
      research, medical and teaching contexts. We encourage other workers to test this 
      approach on their study organisms, and hope that they will also obtain better
      sample preservation, more precise expression patterns and fewer problems due to
      aspecific staining, as we report here for Clytia medusae and Novocrania and
      Terebratalia developing larvae.

TI  - Gata6 restricts Isl1 to the posterior of nascent hindlimb buds through Isl1
      cis-regulatory modules.

AB  - Isl1 is required for two processes during hindlimb development: initiation of the
      processes directing hindlimb development in the lateral plate mesoderm and
      configuring posterior hindlimb field in the nascent hindlimb buds. During these
      processes, Isl1 expression is restricted to the posterior mesenchyme of hindlimb 
      buds. How this dynamic change in Isl1 expression is regulated remains unknown. We
      found that two evolutionarily conserved sequences, located 3' to the Isl1 gene,
      regulate LacZ transgene expression in the hindlimb-forming region in mouse
      embryos. Both sequences contain GATA binding motifs, and expression pattern
      analysis identified that Gata6 is expressed in the flank and the anterior portion
      of nascent hindlimb buds. Recent studies have shown that conditional inactivation
      of Gata6 in mice causes hindlimb-specific pre-axial polydactyly, indicating a
      role of Gata6 in anterior-posterior patterning of hindlimbs. We studied whether
      Gata6 restricts Isl1 in the nascent hindlimb bud through the cis-regulatory
      modules. In vitro experiments demonstrate that GATA6 binds to the conserved GATA 
      motifs in the cis-regulatory modules. GATA6 repressed expression of a luciferase 
      reporter that contains the cis-regulatory modules by synergizing with Zfpm2.
      Analyses of Gata6 mutant embryos showed that ISL1 levels are higher in the
      anterior of nascent hindlimb buds than in wild type. Moreover, we detected a
      greater number of Isl1-transcribing cells in the anterior of nascent hindlimb
      buds in Gata6 mutants. Our results support a model in which Gata6 contributes to 
      repression of Isl1 expression in the anterior of nascent hindlimb buds.

AB  - The developing kidney provides a useful model for study of the principles of
      organogenesis. In this report we use three independent platforms, Drop-Seq,
      Chromium 10x Genomics and Fluidigm C1, to carry out single cell RNA-Seq
      (scRNA-Seq) analysis of the E14.5 mouse kidney. Using the software AltAnalyze, in
      conjunction with the unsupervised approach ICGS, we were unable to identify and
      confirm the presence of 16 distinct cell populations during this stage of active 
      nephrogenesis. Using a novel integrative supervised computational strategy, we
      were able to successfully harmonize and compare the cell profiles across all
      three technological platforms. Analysis of possible cross compartment
      receptor/ligand interactions identified the nephrogenic zone stroma as a source
      of GDNF. This was unexpected because the cap mesenchyme nephron progenitors had
      been thought to be the sole source of GDNF, which is a key driver of branching
      morphogenesis of the collecting duct system. The expression of Gdnf by stromal
      cells was validated in several ways, including Gdnf in situ hybridization
      combined with immunohistochemistry for SIX2, and marker of nephron progenitors,
      and MEIS1, a marker of stromal cells. Finally, the single cell gene expression
      profiles generated in this study confirmed and extended previous work showing the
      presence of multilineage priming during kidney development. Nephron progenitors
      showed stochastic expression of genes associated with multiple potential
      differentiation lineages.

AB  - Wnt proteins regulate diverse biological responses by initiating two general
      outcomes: beta-catenin-dependent transcription and beta-catenin-independent
      activation of signaling cascades, the latter including modulation of calcium and 
      regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics (Planar Cell Polarity, PCP). It has been
      difficult to elucidate the mechanisms by which Wnt signals are directed to effect
      one or the other outcome due to shared signaling proteins between the
      beta-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways, such as the Dishevelled binding
      protein Naked. While all Naked paralogs contain a putative calcium-binding
      domain, the EF-Hand, Drosophila Naked does not bind calcium. Here we find a
      lineage-specific evolutionary change within the Drosophila Naked EF-hand that is 
      not shared with other insects or vertebrates. We demonstrate the necessary role
      of the EF-hand for Nkd localization changes in calcium fluxing cells and using in
      vivo assays, we identify a role for the zebrafish Naked EF-hand in PCP but not in
      beta-catenin antagonism. In contrast, Drosophila-like Nkd does not function in
      PCP, but is a robust antagonist of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. This work reveals 
      that the zebrafish Nkd1 EF-hand is essential to balance Wnt signaling inputs and 
      modulate the appropriate outputs, while the Drosophila-like EF-Hand primarily
      functions in beta-catenin signaling.

AB  - Cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) is a conserved regulator of ciliogenesis whose
      loss in mice leads to a wide range of developmental defects, including
      exencephaly, preaxial polydactyly, skeletal abnormalities, and microphthalmia.
      Here, we investigate the role of CCRK in mouse eye development. Ccrk mutants show
      dramatic patterning defects, with an expansion of the optic stalk domain into the
      optic cup, as well as an expansion of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) into
      neural retina (NR) territory. In addition, Ccrk mutants display a shortened optic
      stalk. These defects are associated with bimodal changes in Hedgehog (Hh) pathway
      activity within the eye, including the loss of proximal, high level responses but
      a gain in distal, low level responses. We simultaneously removed the Hh activator
      GLI2 in Ccrk mutants (Ccrk-/-;Gli2-/-), which resulted in rescue of optic cup
      patterning and exacerbation of optic stalk length defects. Next, we disrupted the
      Hh pathway antagonist GLI3 in mutants lacking CCRK (Ccrk-/-;Gli3-/-), which lead 
      to even greater expansion of the RPE markers into the NR domain and a complete
      loss of NR specification within the optic cup. These results indicate that CCRK
      functions in eye development by both positively and negatively regulating the Hh 
      pathway, and they reveal distinct requirements for Hh signaling in patterning and
      morphogenesis of the eyes.

AB  - Determination of appropriate chamber size is critical for normal vertebrate heart
      development. Although Nr2f transcription factors promote atrial maintenance and
      differentiation, how they determine atrial size remains unclear. Here, we
      demonstrate that zebrafish Nr2f1a is expressed in differentiating atrial
      cardiomyocytes. Zebrafish nr2f1a mutants have smaller atria due to a specific
      reduction in atrial cardiomyocyte (AC) number, suggesting it has similar
      requirements to Nr2f2 in mammals. Furthermore, the smaller atria in nr2f1a
      mutants are derived from distinct mechanisms that perturb AC differentiation at
      the chamber poles. At the venous pole, Nr2f1a enhances the rate of AC
      differentiation. Nr2f1a also establishes the atrial-atrioventricular canal (AVC) 
      border through promoting the differentiation of mature ACs. Without Nr2f1a, AVC
      markers are expanded into the atrium, resulting in enlarged endocardial cushions 
      (ECs). Inhibition of Bmp signaling can restore EC development, but not AC number,
      suggesting that Nr2f1a concomitantly coordinates atrial and AVC size through both
      Bmp-dependent and independent mechanisms. These findings provide insight into
      conserved functions of Nr2f proteins and the etiology of atrioventricular septal 
      defects (AVSDs) associated with NR2F2 mutations in humans.

AB  - Mitochondrial morphology regulatory proteins interact with signaling pathways
      involved in differentiation. In Drosophila oogenesis, EGFR signaling regulates
      mitochondrial fragmentation in posterior follicle cells (PFCs). EGFR driven
      oocyte patterning and Notch signaling mediated differentiation are abrogated when
      PFCs are deficient for the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. It is not known
      whether fused mitochondrial morphology in drp1 mutant PFCs exerts its effects on 
      these signaling pathways through a change in mitochondrial electron transport
      chain (ETC) activity. In this study we show that aggregated mitochondria in drp1 
      mutant PFCs have increased mitochondrial membrane potential. We perform
      experiments to assess the signaling pathway regulating mitochondrial membrane
      potential and how this impacts follicle cell differentiation. We find that drp1
      mutant PFCs show increase in phosphorylated ERK (dpERK) formed downstream of EGFR
      signaling. ERK regulates high mitochondrial membrane potential in drp1 mutant
      PFCs. PFCs depleted of ERK and drp1 are able to undergo Notch mediated
      differentiation. Notably mitochondrial membrane potential decrease via ETC
      inhibition activates Notch signaling at an earlier stage in wild type and
      suppresses the Notch signaling defect in drp1 mutant PFCs. Thus, this study shows
      that the EGFR pathway maintains mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial
      membrane potential in follicle cells for its functioning and decrease in
      mitochondrial membrane potential is needed for Notch mediated differentiation.

AB  - The journey of embryonic development starts at oocyte fertilization, which
      triggers a complex cascade of events and cellular pathways that guide early
      embryogenesis. Recent technological advances have greatly expanded our knowledge 
      of cleavage-stage embryo development, which is characterized by an increased rate
      of whole-chromosome losses and gains, mixoploidy, and atypical cleavage
      morphokinetics. Embryonic aneuploidy significantly contributes to implantation
      failure, spontaneous miscarriage, stillbirth or congenital birth defects in both 
      natural and assisted human reproduction. Essentially, early embryo development is
      strongly determined by maternal factors. Owing to considerable limitations
      associated with human oocyte and embryo research, the use of animal models is
      inevitable. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the error-prone
      early stages of development are still poorly described. In this review, we
      describe known events that lead to aneuploidy in mammalian oocytes and
      preimplantation embryos. As the processes of oocyte and embryo development are
      rigorously regulated by multiple signal-transduction pathways, we explore the
      putative role of signaling pathways in genomic integrity maintenance. Based on
      the existing evidence from human and animal data, we investigate whether critical
      early developmental pathways, like Wnt, Hippo and MAPK, together with distinct
      DNA damage response and DNA repair pathways can be associated with embryo genomic
      instability, a question that has, so far, remained largely unexplored.

      enteric nervous system precursor cells.

AB  - We quantified cell population increase in the quail embryo enteric nervous system
      (ENS) from E2.5 (about 1500 cells) to E12 (about 8 million cells). We then probed
      ENS proliferative capacity by grafting to the chorio-allantoic membrane large
      (600 cells) and small (40 cells) populations of enteric neural crest (ENC) cells 
      with aneural gut. This demonstrated that ENC cells show an extremely high
      capacity to regulate their proliferation while forming the ENS. Previous
      mathematical models and clonal label experiments revealed that a few dominant ENS
      "superstar" cell clones emerge but most clones are small. The model implied that 
      "superstars" arise stochastically, but the same outcome could arise if
      "superstars" were pre-determined. We investigated these two modes mathematically 
      and by grafting experiments with large and small numbers of ENCs, each including 
      one EGFP-labelled ENC cell. The stochastic model predicts that the frequency of
      "superstar" detection increases as the ENC population decreases, the
      pre-determined model does not. Experimentally, as predicted by the stochastic
      model, the frequency of "superstar" detection increased with small ENC cell
      number. We conclude that ENS "superstar" clones achieve this status
      stochastically. Clonal dominance implies that clonal diversity is greatly reduced
      and in this case, somatic mutations may affect the phenotype. We suggest that
      somatic mutations coupled with loss of clonal diversity may contribute to
      variable penetrance and expressivity in individuals with genetically identical
      ENS pathologies.

AB  - We propose a model to explain the spontaneous collective migration of neural
      crest cells in the absence of an external gradient of chemoattractants. The model
      is based on the dynamical interaction between Rac1 and RhoA that is known to
      regulate the polarization, contact inhibition and co-attraction of neural crest
      cells. Coupling the reaction-diffusion equations for active and inactive Rac1 and
      RhoA on the cell membrane with a mechanical model for the overdamped motion of
      membrane vertices, we show that co-attraction and contact inhibition cooperate to
      produce persistence of polarity in a cluster of neural crest cells by suppressing
      the random onset of Rac1 hotspots that may mature into new protrusion fronts.
      This produces persistent directional migration of cell clusters in corridors. Our
      model confirms a prior hypothesis that co-attraction and contact inhibition are
      key to spontaneous collective migration, and provides an explanation of their
      cooperative working mechanism in terms of Rho GTPase signaling. The model shows
      that the spontaneous migration is more robust for larger clusters, and is most
      efficient in a corridor of optimal confinement.

AB  - In vertebrates, the Eph/ephrin family of signaling molecules is a large group of 
      membrane-bound proteins that signal through a myriad of mechanisms and effectors 
      to play diverse roles in almost every tissue and organ system. Though Eph/ephrin 
      signaling has functions in diverse biological processes, one core developmental
      function is in the regulation of cell position and tissue morphology by
      regulating cell migration and guidance, cell segregation, and boundary formation.
      Often, the role of Eph/ephrin signaling is to translate patterning information
      into physical movement of cells and changes in morphology that define tissue and 
      organ systems. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the regulation of
      these processes, and our evolving understanding of the in vivo signaling
      mechanisms utilized in distinct developmental contexts.

AB  - Rapid wound healing and subsequent formation of the apical epithelial cap (AEC)
      are believed to be required for successful appendage regeneration in amphibians. 
      Despite the significant role of AEC in limb regeneration, its role in tail
      regeneration and the mechanisms that regulate the wound healing and AEC formation
      are not well understood. We previously identified Xenopus laevis es1, which is
      preferentially expressed in wounded regions, including the AEC after tail
      regeneration. In this study we established and characterized transgenic Xenopus
      laevis lines harboring the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene under
      control of an es1 gene regulatory sequence (es1:egfp). The EGFP reporter
      expression was clearly seen in several regions of the embryo and then declined to
      an undetectable level in larvae, recapitulating the endogenous es1 expression.
      After amputation of the tadpole tail, EGFP expression was re-activated at the
      edge of the stump epidermis and then increased in the wound epidermis (WE)
      covering the amputation surface. As the stump started to regenerate, the EGFP
      expression became restricted to the most distal epidermal region, including the
      AEC. EGFP was preferentially expressed in the basal or deep cells but not in the 
      superficial cells of the WE and AEC. We performed a small-scale pharmacological
      screening for chemicals that affected the expression of EGFP in the stump
      epidermis after tail amputation. The EGFP expression was attenuated by treatment 
      with an inhibitor for ERK, TGF-beta or reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling.
      These treatments also impaired wound closure of the amputation surface,
      suggesting that the three signaling activities are required for es1 expression in
      the WE and successful wound healing after tail amputation. These findings showed 
      that es1:egfp Xenopus laevis should be a useful tool to analyze molecular
      mechanisms regulating wound healing and appendage regeneration.

LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.08.013 [doi]
AB  - The use of antioxidants in tissue regeneration has been studied, but their
      mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, we analyze the role of the
      antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in retina regeneration. Embryonic chicks are
      able to regenerate their retina after its complete removal from retinal
      stem/progenitor cells present in the ciliary margin (CM) of the eye only if a
      source of exogenous factors, such as FGF2, is present. This study shows that NAC 
      modifies the redox status of the CM, initiates self-renewal of the
      stem/progenitor cells, and induces regeneration in the absence of FGF2. NAC works
      as an antioxidant by scavenging free radicals either independently or through the
      synthesis of glutathione (GSH), and/or by reducing oxidized proteins through a
      thiol disulfide exchange activity. We dissected the mechanism used by NAC to
      induce regeneration through the use of inhibitors of GSH synthesis and the use of
      other antioxidants with different biochemical structures and modes of action, and
      found that NAC induces regeneration through its thiol disulfide exchange
      activity. Thus, our results provide, for the first time, a biochemical basis for 
      induction of retina regeneration. Furthermore, NAC induction was independent of
      FGF receptor signaling, but dependent on the MAPK (pErk1/2) pathway.

AB  - Asexual bud development in the budding tunicate Polyandrocarpa misakiensis
      involves transdifferentiation of multipotent epithelial cells, which is triggered
      by retinoic acid (RA), and thrives under starvation after bud isolation from the 
      parent. This study aimed to determine cell and molecular mechanisms of
      dedifferentiation that occur during the early stage of transdifferentiation.
      During dedifferentiation, the numbers of autophagosomes, lysosomes, and secondary
      lysosomes increased remarkably. Mitochondrial degradation and exosome discharge
      also occurred in the atrial epithelium. Autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) and
      lysosomal proton pump A gene (PumpA) were activated during the dedifferentiation 
      stage. When target of rapamycin (TOR) inhibitor was administered to growing buds 
      without isolating them from the parent, phagosomes and secondary lysosomes became
      prominent. TOR inhibitor induced Atg7 only in the presence of RA. In contrast,
      when growing buds were treated with RA, lysosomes, secondary lysosomes, and
      mitochondrial degradation were prematurely induced. RA significantly activated
      PumpA in a retinoid X receptor-dependent manner. Our results indicate that in P. 
      misakiensis, TOR inhibition and RA signals act in synergy to accomplish
      cytoplasmic clearance for dedifferentiation.

AB  - The adult brain of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (a freshwater flatworm)
      is a dynamic structure with constant cell turnover as well as the ability to
      completely regenerate de novo. Despite this, function and pattern is achieved in 
      a reproducible manner from individual to individual in terms of the correct
      spatial and temporal production of specific neuronal subtypes. Although several
      signaling molecules have been found to be key to scaling and cell turnover, the
      mechanisms by which specific neural subtypes are specified remain largely
      unknown. Here we performed a 6 day RNAseq time course on planarians that were
      regenerating either 0, 1, or 2 heads in order to identify novel regulators of
      brain regeneration. Focusing on transcription factors, we identified a TCF/LEF
      factor, Smed-tcf1, which was required to correctly pattern the dorsal-lateral
      cell types of the regenerating brain. The most severely affected neurons in
      Smed-tcf1(RNAi) animals were the dorsal GABAergic neurons, which failed to
      regenerate, leading to an inability of the animals to phototaxis away from light.
      Together, Smed-tcf1 is a critical regulator, required to pattern the
      dorsal-lateral region of the regenerating planarian brain.

AB  - The lizards are evolutionarily the closest vertebrates to humans that demonstrate
      the ability to regenerate entire appendages containing cartilage, muscle, skin,
      and nervous tissue. We previously isolated PAX7-positive cells from muscle of the
      green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, that can differentiate into
      multinucleated myotubes and express the muscle structural protein, myosin heavy
      chain. Studying gene expression in these satellite/progenitor cell populations
      from A. carolinensis can provide insight into the mechanisms regulating tissue
      regeneration. We generated a transcriptome from proliferating lizard
      myoprogenitor cells and compared them to transcriptomes from the mouse and human 
      tissues from the ENCODE project using XGSA, a statistical method for
      cross-species gene set analysis. These analyses determined that the lizard
      progenitor cell transcriptome was most similar to mammalian satellite cells.
      Further examination of specific GO categories of genes demonstrated that among
      genes with the highest level of expression in lizard satellite cells were an
      increased number of genetic regulators of chondrogenesis, as compared to mouse
      satellite cells. In micromass culture, lizard PAX7-positive cells formed Alcian
      blue and collagen 2a1 positive nodules, without the addition of exogenous
      morphogens, unlike their mouse counterparts. Subsequent quantitative RT-PCR
      confirmed up-regulation of expression of chondrogenic regulatory genes in lizard 
      cells, including bmp2, sox9, runx2, and cartilage specific structural genes,
      aggrecan and collagen 2a1. Taken together, these data suggest that tail
      regeneration in lizards involves significant alterations in gene regulation with 
      expanded musculoskeletal potency.

AB  - Regeneration is a post-embryonic developmental process that ensures complete
      morphological and functional restoration of lost body parts. The repair phase is 
      a key step for the effectiveness of the subsequent regenerative process: in
      vertebrates, efficient re-epithelialisation, rapid inflammatory/immune response
      and post-injury tissue remodelling are fundamental aspects for the success of
      this phase, their impairment leading to an inhibition or total prevention of
      regeneration. Among deuterostomes, echinoderms display a unique combination of
      striking regenerative abilities and diversity of useful experimental models,
      although still largely unexplored. Therefore, the brittle star Amphiura
      filiformis and the starfish Echinaster sepositus were here used to comparatively 
      investigate the main repair phase events after injury as well as the presence and
      expression of immune system and extracellular matrix (i.e. collagen) molecules
      using both microscopy and molecular tools. Our results showed that emergency
      reaction and re-epithelialisation are similar in both echinoderm models, being
      faster and more effective than in mammals. Moreover, in comparison to the latter,
      both echinoderms showed delayed and less abundant collagen deposition at the
      wound site (absence of fibrosis). The gene expression patterns of molecules
      related to the immune response, such as Ese-fib-like (starfishes) and Afi-ficolin
      (brittle stars), were described for the first time during echinoderm regeneration
      providing promising starting points to investigate the immune system role in
      these regeneration models. Overall, the similarities in repair events and timing 
      within the echinoderms and the differences with what has been reported in mammals
      suggest that effective repair processes in echinoderms play an important role for
      their subsequent ability to regenerate. Targeted molecular and functional
      analyses will shed light on the evolution of these abilities in the
      deuterostomian lineage.

AB  - Peripheral nerves exhibit robust regenerative capabilities in response to
      selective injury among amniotes, but the regeneration of entire muscle groups
      following volumetric muscle loss is limited in birds and mammals. In contrast,
      lizards possess the remarkable ability to regenerate extensive de novo muscle
      after tail loss. However, the mechanisms underlying reformation of the entire
      neuromuscular system in the regenerating lizard tail are not completely
      understood. We have tested whether the regeneration of the peripheral nerve and
      neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) recapitulate processes observed during normal
      neuromuscular development in the green anole, Anolis carolinensis. Our data
      confirm robust axonal outgrowth during early stages of tail regeneration and
      subsequent NMJ formation within weeks of autotomy. Interestingly, NMJs are
      overproduced as evidenced by a persistent increase in NMJ density 120 and 250
      days post autotomy (DPA). Substantial Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) expression could
      also be detected along regenerating nerves indicating that the ability of Schwann
      cells to myelinate newly formed axons remained intact. Overall, our data suggest 
      that the mechanism of de novo nerve and NMJ reformation parallel, in part, those 
      observed during neuromuscular development. However, the prolonged increase in NMJ
      number and aberrant muscle differentiation hint at processes specific to the
      adult response. An examination of the coordinated exchange between peripheral
      nerves, Schwann cells, and newly synthesized muscle of the regenerating
      neuromuscular system may assist in the identification of candidate molecules that
      promote neuromuscular recovery in organisms incapable of a robust regenerative
      response.

AB  - Xenopus laevis (an anuran amphibian) shows limb regeneration ability between that
      of urodele amphibians and that of amniotes. Xenopus frogs can initiate limb
      regeneration but fail to form patterned limbs. Regenerated limbs mainly consist
      of cone-shaped cartilage without any joints or branches. These pattern defects
      are thought to be caused by loss of proper expressions of patterning-related
      genes. This study shows that hyperinnervation surgery resulted in the induction
      of a branching regenerate. The hyperinnervated blastema allows the identification
      and functional analysis of the molecules controlling this patterning of limb
      regeneration. This paper focuses on the nerve affects to improve Xenopus limb
      patterning ability during regeneration. The nerve molecules, which regulate limb 
      patterning, were also investigated. Blastemas grown in a hyperinnervated forelimb
      upregulate limb patterning-related genes (shh, lmx1b, and hoxa13). Nerves
      projecting their axons to limbs express some growth factors (bmp7, fgf2, fgf8,
      and shh). Inputs of these factors to a blastema upregulated some limb
      patterning-related genes and resulted in changes in the cartilage patterns in the
      regenerates. These results indicate that additional nerve factors enhance Xenopus
      limb patterning-related gene expressions and limb regeneration ability, and that 
      bmp, fgf, and shh are candidate nerve substitute factors.

AB  - Hydra tissues are made from three distinct populations of stem cells that
      continuously cycle and pause in G2 instead of G1. To characterize the role of
      cell proliferation after mid-gastric bisection, we have (i) used flow cytometry
      and classical markers to monitor cell cycle modulations, (ii) quantified the
      transcriptomic regulations of 202 genes associated with cell proliferation during
      head and foot regeneration, and (iii) compared the impact of anti-proliferative
      treatments on regeneration efficiency. We confirm two previously reported events:
      an early mitotic wave in head-regenerating tips, when few cell cycle genes are
      up-regulated, and an early-late wave of proliferation on the second day, preceded
      by the up-regulation of 17 cell cycle genes. These regulations appear more
      intense after mid-gastric bisection than after decapitation, suggesting a
      position-dependent regulation of cell proliferation during head regeneration.
      Hydroxyurea, which blocks S-phase progression, delays head regeneration when
      applied before but not after bisection. This result is consistent with the fact
      that the Hydra central region is enriched in G2-paused adult stem cells, poised
      to divide upon injury, thus forming a necessary constitutive pro-blastema.
      However a prolonged exposure to hydroxyurea does not block regeneration as cells 
      can differentiate apical structures without traversing S-phase, and also escape
      in few days the hydroxyurea-induced S-phase blockade. Thus Hydra head
      regeneration, which is a fast event, is highly plastic, relying on large stocks
      of adult stem cells paused in G2 at amputation time, which immediately divide to 
      proliferate and/or differentiate apical structures even when S-phase is blocked.

AB  - The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is the vertebrate model system with the highest
      regeneration capacity. Experimental tools established over the past 100 years
      have been fundamental to start unraveling the cellular and molecular basis of
      tissue and limb regeneration. In the absence of a reference genome for the
      Axolotl, transcriptomic analysis become fundamental to understand the genetic
      basis of regeneration. Here we present one of the most diverse transcriptomic
      data sets for Axolotl by profiling coding and non-coding RNAs from diverse
      tissues. We reconstructed a population of 115,906 putative protein coding mRNAs
      as full ORFs (including isoforms). We also identified 352 conserved miRNAs and
      297 novel putative mature miRNAs. Systematic enrichment analysis of gene
      expression allowed us to identify tissue-specific protein-coding transcripts. We 
      also found putative novel and conserved microRNAs which potentially target mRNAs 
      which are reported as important disease candidates in heart and liver.

AB  - The ubiquitin system plays a role in nearly every aspect of eukaryotic cell
      biology. The enzymes responsible for transferring ubiquitin onto specific
      substrates are the E3 ubiquitin ligases, a large and diverse family of proteins, 
      for which biological roles and target substrates remain largely undefined.
      Studies using model organisms indicate that ubiquitin signaling mediates key
      steps in developmental processes and tissue regeneration. Here, we used the
      freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, to investigate the role of
      Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes in stem cell regulation during
      regeneration. We identified six S. mediterranea cullin genes, and used RNAi to
      uncover roles for homologs of Cullin-1, -3 and -4 in planarian regeneration. The 
      cullin-1 RNAi phenotype included defects in blastema formation, organ
      regeneration, lesions, and lysis. To further investigate the function of
      cullin-1-mediated cellular processes in planarians, we examined genes encoding
      the adaptor protein Skp1 and F-box substrate-recognition proteins that are
      predicted to partner with Cullin-1. RNAi against skp1 resulted in phenotypes
      similar to cullin-1 RNAi, and an RNAi screen of the F-box genes identified 19
      genes that recapitulated aspects of cullin-1 RNAi, including ones that in mammals
      are involved in stem cell regulation and cancer biology. Our data provides
      evidence that CRLs play discrete roles in regenerative processes and provide a
      platform to investigate how CRLs regulate stem cells in vivo.

AB  - Studying regeneration in animals where and when it occurs is inherently
      interesting and a challenging research topic within developmental biology.
      Historically, vertebrate regeneration has been investigated in animals that
      display enhanced regenerative abilities and we have learned much from studying
      organ regeneration in amphibians and fish. From an applied perspective, while
      regeneration biologists will undoubtedly continue to study poikilothermic animals
      (i.e., amphibians and fish), studies focused on homeotherms (i.e., mammals and
      birds) are also necessary to advance regeneration biology. Emerging mammalian
      models of epimorphic regeneration are poised to help link regenerative biology
      and regenerative medicine. The regenerating rodent digit tip, which parallels
      human fingertip regeneration, and the regeneration of large circular defects
      through the ear pinna in spiny mice and rabbits, provide tractable, experimental 
      systems where complex tissue structures are regrown through blastema formation
      and morphogenesis. Using these models as examples, we detail similarities and
      differences between the mammalian blastema and its classical counterpart to
      arrive at a broad working definition of a vertebrate regeneration blastema. This 
      comparison leads us to conclude that regenerative failure is not related to the
      availability of regeneration-competent progenitor cells, but is most likely a
      function of the cellular response to the microenvironment that forms following
      traumatic injury. Recent studies demonstrating that targeted modification of this
      microenvironment can restrict or enhance regenerative capabilities in mammals
      helps provide a roadmap for eventually pushing the limits of human regeneration.

AB  - The ability to control pattern formation is critical for the both the embryonic
      development of complex structures as well as for the regeneration/repair of
      damaged or missing tissues and organs. In addition to chemical gradients and gene
      regulatory networks, endogenous ion flows are key regulators of cell behavior.
      Not only do bioelectric cues provide information needed for the initial
      development of structures, they also enable the robust restoration of normal
      pattern after injury. In order to expand our basic understanding of morphogenetic
      processes responsible for the repair of complex anatomy, we need to identify the 
      roles of endogenous voltage gradients, ion flows, and electric fields. In
      complement to the current focus on molecular genetics, decoding the information
      transduced by bioelectric cues enhances our knowledge of the dynamic control of
      growth and pattern formation. Recent advances in science and technology place us 
      in an exciting time to elucidate the interplay between molecular-genetic inputs
      and important biophysical cues that direct the creation of tissues and organs.
      Moving forward, these new insights enable additional approaches to direct cell
      behavior and may result in profound advances in augmentation of regenerative
      capacity.

AB  - Chronic degenerative lung diseases are essentially untreatable pathological
      conditions. By contrast, the healthy lung has numerous mechanisms that allow for 
      rapid repair and restoration of function following minor acute injuries. We
      discuss the normal endogenous processes of lung development, homeostatic
      maintenance and repair and consider the research strategies required for the
      development of methods for human therapeutic lung regeneration.

AB  - A major cause for vision impairment and blindness in industrialized countries is 
      the loss of the light-sensing retinal tissue in the eye. Photoreceptor damage is 
      one of the main characteristics found in retinal degeneration diseases, such as
      Retinitis Pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration. The lack of effective
      therapies to stop photoreceptor loss together with the absence of significant
      intrinsic regeneration in the human retina converts such degenerative diseases
      into permanent conditions that are currently irreversible. Cell replacement by
      means of photoreceptor transplantation has been proposed as a potential approach 
      to tackle cell loss in the retina. Since the first attempt of photoreceptor
      transplantation in humans, about twenty years ago, several research groups have
      focused in the development and improvement of technologies necessary to bring
      cell transplantation for retinal degeneration diseases to reality. Progress in
      recent years in the generation of human tissue derived from pluripotent stem
      cells (PSCs) has significantly improved our tools to study human development and 
      disease in the dish. Particularly the availability of 3D culture systems for the 
      generation of PSC-derived organoids, including the human retina, has dramatically
      increased access to human material for basic and medical research. In this
      review, we focus on important milestones towards the generation of transplantable
      photoreceptor precursors from PSC-derived retinal organoids and discuss recent
      pre-clinical transplantation studies using organoid-derived photoreceptors in
      context to related in vivo work using primary photoreceptors as donor material.
      Additionally, we summarize remaining challenges for developing photoreceptor
      transplantation towards clinical application.

AB  - Axolotls can regenerate complex structures through recruitment and remodeling of 
      cells within mature tissues. Accessing the underlying mechanisms at a molecular
      resolution is crucial to understand how injury triggers regeneration and how it
      proceeds. However, gene transformation in adult tissues can be challenging. Here 
      we characterize the use of pseudotyped baculovirus (BV) as an effective gene
      transfer method both for cells within mature limb tissue and within the blastema.
      These cells remain competent to participate in regeneration after transduction.
      We further characterize the effectiveness of BV for gene overexpression studies
      by overexpressing Shh in the blastema, which yields a high penetrance of classic 
      polydactyly phenotypes. Overall, our work establishes BV as a powerful tool to
      access gene function in axolotl limb regeneration.

AB  - How do animals regenerate specialised tissues or their entire body after a
      traumatic injury, how has this ability evolved and what are the genetic and
      cellular components underpinning this remarkable feat? While some progress has
      been made in understanding mechanisms, relatively little is known about the
      evolution of regenerative ability. Which elements of regeneration are due to
      lineage specific evolutionary novelties or have deeply conserved roots within the
      Metazoa remains an open question. The renaissance in regeneration research,
      fuelled by the development of modern functional and comparative genomics, now
      enable us to gain a detailed understanding of both the mechanisms and
      evolutionary forces underpinning regeneration in diverse animal phyla. Here we
      review existing and emerging model systems, with the focus on invertebrates, for 
      studying regeneration. We summarize findings across these taxa that tell us
      something about the evolution of adult stem cell types that fuel regeneration and
      the growing evidence that many highly regenerative animals harbor adult stem
      cells with a gene expression profile that overlaps with germline stem cells. We
      propose a framework in which regenerative ability broadly evolves through changes
      in the extent to which stem cells generated through embryogenesis are maintained 
      into the adult life history.

AB  - Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) require well-defined signals from their environment 
      in order to carry out their specific functions. Most of these signals are
      provided by neighboring cells that form a stem cell niche, whose shape and
      cellular composition self-organize. Major features of this self-organization can 
      be studied in ISC-derived organoid culture. In this system, manipulation of
      essential pathways of stem cell maintenance and differentiation results in
      well-described growth phenotypes. We here provide an individual cell-based model 
      of intestinal organoids that enables a mechanistic explanation of the observed
      growth phenotypes. In simulation studies of the 3D structure of expanding
      organoids, we investigate interdependences between Wnt- and Notch-signaling which
      control the shape of the stem cell niche and, thus, the growth pattern of the
      organoids. Similar to in vitro experiments, changes of pathway activities alter
      the cellular composition of the organoids and, thereby, affect their shape.
      Exogenous Wnt enforces transitions from branched into a cyst-like growth pattern;
      known to occur spontaneously during long term organoid expansion. Based on our
      simulation results, we predict that the cyst-like pattern is associated with
      biomechanical changes of the cells which assign them a growth advantage. The
      results suggest ongoing stem cell adaptation to in vitro conditions during long
      term expansion by stabilizing Wnt-activity. Our study exemplifies the potential
      of individual cell-based modeling in unraveling links between molecular stem cell
      regulation and 3D growth of tissues. This kind of modeling combines experimental 
      results in the fields of stem cell biology and cell biomechanics constituting a
      prerequisite for a better understanding of tissue regeneration as well as
      developmental processes.

AB  - Mechanical forces are an important contributor to cell fate specification and
      cell migration during embryonic development in animals. Similarities between
      embryogenesis and regeneration, particularly with regards to pattern formation
      and large-scale tissue movements, suggest similarly important roles for physical 
      forces during regeneration. While the influence of the mechanical environment on 
      stem cell differentiation in vitro is being actively exploited in the fields of
      tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, comparatively little is known about
      the role of stresses and strains acting during animal regeneration. In this
      review, we summarize published work on the role of physical principles and
      mechanical forces in animal regeneration. Novel experimental techniques aimed at 
      addressing the role of mechanics in embryogenesis have greatly enhanced our
      understanding at scales from the subcellular to the macroscopic - we believe the 
      time is ripe for the field of regeneration to similarly leverage the tools of the
      mechanobiological research community.

AB  - The skin is the largest organ in the body and plays multiple essential roles
      ranging from regulating temperature, preventing infection and ultimately defining
      who we are physically. It is a highly dynamic organ that constantly replaces the 
      outermost cells throughout life. However, when faced with a major injury, human
      skin cannot restore a significant lesion to its original functionality, instead a
      reparative scar is formed. In contrast to this, many other species have the
      unique ability to regenerate full thickness skin without formation of scar
      tissue. Here we review recent advances in the field that shed light on how the
      skin cells in regenerative species react to injury to prevent scar formation
      versus scar forming humans.

AB  - Activation of progenitor cells is crucial to promote tissue repair following
      injury in adult animals. In the context of successful limb regeneration following
      amputation, progenitor cells residing within the stump must re-enter the cell
      cycle to promote regrowth of the missing limb. We demonstrate that in axolotls,
      amputation is sufficient to induce cell-cycle activation in both the amputated
      limb and the intact, uninjured contralateral limb. Activated cells were found
      throughout all major tissue populations of the intact contralateral limb, with
      internal cellular populations (bone and soft tissue) the most affected. Further, 
      activated cells were additionally found within the heart, liver, and spinal cord,
      suggesting that amputation induces a common global activation signal throughout
      the body. Among two other injury models, limb crush and skin excisional wound,
      only limb crush injuries were capable of inducing cellular responses in
      contralateral uninjured limbs but did not achieve activation levels seen
      following limb loss. We found this systemic activation response to injury is
      independent of formation of a wound epidermis over the amputation plane,
      suggesting that injury-induced signals alone can promote cellular activation. In 
      mammals, mTOR signaling has been shown to promote activation of quiescent cells
      following injury, and we confirmed a subset of activated contralateral cells is
      positive for mTOR signaling within axolotl limbs. These findings suggest that
      conservation of an early systemic response to injury exists between mammals and
      axolotls, and propose that a distinguishing feature in species capable of full
      regeneration is converting this initial activation into sustained and productive 
      growth at the site of regeneration.

AB  - Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling plays crucial roles in regenerative processes in
      eumetazoans. It also acts in regeneration and axial patterning in the simple
      freshwater polyp Hydra, whose morphallactic regenerative capacity is unparalleled
      in the animal kingdom. Previous studies have identified beta-catenin as an early 
      response gene activated within the first 30min in Hydra head regeneration. Here, 
      we have studied the role of beta-Catenin in more detail. First, we show that
      nuclear beta-Catenin signaling is required for head and foot regeneration. Loss
      of nuclear beta-Catenin function blocks head and foot regeneration. Transgenic
      Hydra tissue, in which beta-Catenin is over-expressed, regenerates more heads and
      feet. In addition, we have identified a set of putative beta-Catenin target genes
      by transcriptional profiling, and these genes exhibit distinct expression
      patterns in the hypostome, in the tentacles, or in an apical gradient in the body
      column. All of them are transcriptionally up-regulated in the tips of early head 
      and foot regenerates. In foot regenerates, this is a transient response, and
      expression starts to disappear after 12-36h. ChIP experiments using an
      anti-HydraTcf antibody show Tcf binding at promoters of these targets. We propose
      that gene regulatory beta-Catenin activity in the pre-patterning phase is
      generally required as an early regeneration response. When regenerates are
      blocked with iCRT14, initial local transcriptional activation of beta-catenin and
      the target genes occurs, and all these genes remain upregulated at the site of
      both head and foot regeneration for the following 2-3 days. This indicates that
      the initial regulatory network is followed by position-specific programs that
      inactivate fractions of this network in order to proceed to differentiation of
      head or foot structures. brachyury1 (hybra1) has previously been described as
      early response gene in head and foot regeneration. The HyBra1 protein, however,
      appears in head regenerating tips not earlier than about twelve hours after
      decapitation, and HyBra1 translation does not occur in iCRT14-treated
      regenerates. Foot regenerates never show detectable levels of HyBra1 protein at
      all. These results suggest that translational control mechanisms may play a
      decisive role in the head- and foot-specific differentiation phase, and HyBra1 is
      an excellent candidate for such a key regulator of head specification.

AB  - Understanding how somatic stem cells respond to tissue needs is important, since 
      aberrant somatic stem cell behaviors may lead to tissue degeneration or
      tumorigenesis. Here, from an in vivo RNAi screen targeting transcription factors 
      that regulate intestinal regeneration, we uncovered a requirement for the
      Drosophila FoxA transcription factor Fork head (Fkh) in the maintenance of
      intestinal stem/progenitor cell identities. FoxA/Fkh maintains the expressions of
      stem/progenitor cell markers and is required for stem cell proliferation during
      intestinal homeostasis and regeneration. Furthermore, FoxA/Fkh prevents the
      intestinal stem/progenitor cells from precocious differentiation into the
      Enterocyte lineage, likely in cooperation with the transcription factor
      bHLH/Daughterless (Da). In addition, loss of FoxA/Fkh suppresses the intestinal
      tumorigenesis caused by Notch pathway inactivation. To reveal the gene program
      underlying stem/progenitor cell identities, we profiled the genome-wide chromatin
      binding sites of transcription factors Fkh and Da, and interestingly, around half
      of Fkh binding regions are shared by Da, further suggesting their collaborative
      roles. Finally, we identified the genes associated with their shared binding
      regions. This comprehensive gene list may contain stem/progenitor maintenance
      factors functioning downstream of Fkh and Da, and would be helpful for future
      gene discoveries in the Drosophila intestinal stem cell lineage.

AB  - The epidermis is essential for animal survival, providing both a protective
      barrier and cellular sensor to external environments. The generally conserved
      embryonic origin of the epidermis, but the broad morphological and functional
      diversity of this organ across animals is puzzling. We define the transcriptional
      regulators underlying epidermal lineage differentiation in the planarian
      Schmidtea mediterranea, an invertebrate organism that, unlike fruitflies and
      nematodes, continuously replaces its epidermal cells. We find that Smed-p53, Sox 
      and Pax transcription factors are essential regulators of epidermal homeostasis, 
      and act cooperatively to regulate genes associated with early epidermal precursor
      cell differentiation, including a tandemly arrayed novel gene family (prog) of
      secreted proteins. Additionally, we report on the discovery of distinct and
      previously undescribed secreted organelles whose production is dependent on the
      transcriptional activity of soxP-3, and which we term Hyman vesicles.

AB  - One of the most fascinating questions in regenerative biology is why some animals
      can regenerate injured structures while others cannot. Skeletal muscle has a
      remarkable capacity to regenerate even after repeated traumas, yet limited
      information is available on muscle repair mechanisms and how they have evolved.
      For decades, the main focus in the study of muscle regeneration was on muscle
      stem cells, however, their interaction with their progeny and stromal cells is
      only starting to emerge, and this is crucial for successful repair and
      re-establishment of homeostasis after injury. In addition, numerous murine injury
      models are used to investigate the regeneration process, and some can lead to
      discrepancies in observed phenotypes. This review addresses these issues and
      provides an overview of some of the main regulatory cellular and molecular
      players involved in skeletal muscle repair.

AB  - Planarian flatworms are popular models for the study of regeneration and stem
      cell biology in vivo. Technical advances and increased availability of genetic
      information have fueled the discovery of molecules responsible for stem cell
      pluripotency and regeneration in flatworms. Unfortunately, most of the planarian 
      research performed worldwide utilizes species that are not natural habitants of
      North America, which limits their availability to newcomer laboratories and
      impedes their distribution for educational activities. In order to circumvent
      these limitations and increase the genetic information available for comparative 
      studies, we sequenced the transcriptome of Girardia dorotocephala, a planarian
      species pandemic and commercially available in North America. A total of
      254,802,670 paired sequence reads were obtained from RNA extracted from intact
      individuals, regenerating fragments, as well as freshly excised auricles of a
      clonal line of G. dorotocephala (MA-C2), and used for de novo assembly of its
      transcriptome. The resulting transcriptome draft was validated through functional
      analysis of genetic markers of stem cells and their progeny in G. dorotocephala. 
      Akin to orthologs in other planarian species, G. dorotocephala Piwi1 (GdPiwi1)
      was found to be a robust marker of the planarian stem cell population and GdPiwi2
      an essential component for stem cell-driven regeneration. Identification of G.
      dorotocephala homologs of the early stem cell descendent marker PROG-1 revealed a
      family of lysine-rich proteins expressed during epithelial cell differentiation. 
      Sequences from the MA-C2 transcriptome were found to be 98-99% identical to
      nucleotide sequences from G. dorotocephala populations with different chromosomal
      number, demonstrating strong conservation regardless of karyotype evolution.
      Altogether, this work establishes G. dorotocephala as a viable and accessible
      option for analysis of gene function in North America.

AB  - The skeleton of adult zebrafish fins comprises lepidotrichia, which are dermal
      bones of the rays, and actinotrichia, which are non-mineralized spicules at the
      distal margin of the appendage. Little is known about the regenerative dynamics
      of the actinotrichia-specific structural proteins called Actinodins. Here, we
      used immunofluorescence analysis to determine the contribution of two paralogous 
      Actinodin proteins, And1/2, in regenerating fins. Both proteins were detected in 
      the secretory organelles in the mesenchymal cells of the blastema, but only And1 
      was detected in the epithelial cells of the wound epithelium. The analysis of
      whole mount fins throughout the entire regenerative process and longitudinal
      sections revealed that And1-positive fibers are complementary to the
      lepidotrichia. The analysis of another longfin fish, a gain-of-function mutation 
      in the potassium channel kcnk5b, revealed that the long-fin phenotype is
      associated with an extended size of actinotrichia during homeostasis and
      regeneration. Finally, we investigated the role of several signaling pathways in 
      actinotrichia formation and maintenance. This revealed that the pulse-inhibition 
      of either TGFbeta/Activin-betaA or FGF are sufficient to impair deposition of
      Actinodin during regeneration. Thus, the dynamic turnover of Actinodin during fin
      regeneration is regulated by multiple factors, including the osteoblasts, growth 
      rate in a potassium channel mutant, and instructive signaling networks between
      the epithelium and the blastema of the regenerating fin.

AB  - Heterogeneity of planarian stem cells has been categorised on the basis of single
      cell expression analyses and subsequent experiments to demonstrate lineage
      relationships. Some data suggest that despite heterogeneity in gene expression
      amongst cells in the cell cycle, in fact only one sub-population, known as sigma 
      neoblasts, can self-renew. Without the tools to perform live in vivo lineage
      analysis, we instead took an alternative approach to provide independent evidence
      for defining the self-renewing stem cell population. We exploited the role of
      highly conserved condensin family genes to functionally assay neoblast
      self-renewal properties. Condensins are involved in forming properly condensed
      chromosomes to allow cell division to proceed during mitosis, and their
      abrogation inhibits mitosis and can lead to repeated endoreplication of the
      genome in cells that make repeated attempts to divide. We find that planarians
      possess only the condensin I complex, and that this is required for normal stem
      cell function. Abrogation of condensin function led to rapid stem cell depletion 
      accompanied by the appearance of 'giant' cells with increased DNA content. Using 
      previously discovered markers of heterogeneity we show that enlarged cells are
      always from the sigma-class of the neoblast population and we never observe
      evidence for endoreplication for the other neoblast subclasses. Overall, our data
      establish that condensins are essential for stem cell maintenance and provide
      independent evidence that only sigma-neoblasts are capable of multiple rounds of 
      cell division and hence self-renewal.

AB  - Temporal and spatial characterization of gene expression is a prerequisite for
      the understanding of cell-, tissue-, and organ-differentiation. In a multifaceted
      approach to investigate gene expression in the tail plate of the free-living
      marine flatworm Macrostomum lignano, we performed a posterior-region-specific in 
      situ hybridization screen, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of regenerating animals, and 
      functional analyses of selected tail-specific genes. The in situ screen revealed 
      transcripts expressed in the antrum, cement glands, adhesive organs, prostate
      glands, rhabdite glands, and other tissues. Next we used RNA-seq to characterize 
      temporal expression in the regenerating tail plate revealing a time restricted
      onset of both adhesive organs and copulatory apparatus regeneration. In addition,
      we identified three novel previously unannotated genes solely expressed in the
      regenerating stylet. RNA interference showed that these genes are required for
      the formation of not only the stylet but the whole male copulatory apparatus.
      RNAi treated animals lacked the stylet, vesicula granulorum, seminal vesicle,
      false seminal vesicle, and prostate glands, while the other tissues of the tail
      plate, such as adhesive organs regenerated normally. In summary, our findings
      provide a large resource of expression data during homeostasis and regeneration
      of the morphologically complex tail regeneration and pave the way for a better
      understanding of organogenesis in M. lignano.

AB  - The proper development of a multicellular organism requires precise spatial and
      temporal coordination of cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic regulatory mechanisms.
      Both Notch signaling and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling function to
      regulate the proper development of the C. elegans postembryonic mesoderm. We have
      identified the C. elegans FOXD transcription factor UNC-130 as a major target
      functioning downstream of both BMP signaling and Notch signaling to regulate
      dorsoventral patterning of the postembryonic mesoderm. We showed that unc-130
      expression in the postembryonic M lineage is asymmetric: its absence of
      expression in the dorsal side of the M lineage requires the antagonism of BMP
      signaling by the zinc finger transcription factor SMA-9, while its expression in 
      the ventral side of the M lineage is activated by LIN-12/Notch signaling. We
      further showed that the regulation of UNC-130 expression by BMP signaling and
      Notch signaling is specific to the M lineage, as the ventral expression of
      UNC-130 in the embryonically-derived bodywall muscles was not affected in either 
      BMP pathway or Notch pathway mutants. Finally, we showed that the function of
      UNC-130 in the M lineage is independent of UNC-129, a gene previously shown to
      function downstream of and be repressed by UNC-130 for axon guidance. Our studies
      uncovered a new function of UNC-130/FOXD in the C. elegans postembryonic
      mesoderm, and identify UNC-130 as a critical factor that integrates two
      independent spatial cues for the proper patterning and fate specification of the 
      C. elegans postembryonic mesoderm.

AB  - Spermiogenesis is the final phase during sperm cell development in which round
      spermatids undergo dramatic morphological changes to generate spermatozoa. Here
      we report that the serine/threonine kinase Stk33 is essential for the
      differentiation of round spermatids into functional sperm cells and male
      fertility. Constitutive Stk33 deletion in mice results in severely malformed and 
      immotile spermatozoa that are particularly characterized by disordered structural
      tail elements. Stk33 expression first appears in primary spermatocytes, and
      targeted deletion of Stk33 in these cells recapitulates the defects observed in
      constitutive knockout mice, confirming a germ cell-intrinsic function. Stk33
      protein resides in the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with the caudal end
      of the manchette, a transient structure that guides tail elongation, in
      elongating spermatids, and loss of Stk33 leads to the appearance of a tight,
      straight and elongated manchette. Together, these results identify Stk33 as an
      essential regulator of spermatid differentiation and male fertility.

AB  - Polycomb repressive complexes maintain transcriptional repression of genes
      encoding crucial developmental regulators through chromatin modification. Here we
      investigated the role of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in retinal
      development by inactivating its key components Eed and Ezh2. Conditional deletion
      of Ezh2 resulted in a partial loss of PRC2 function and accelerated
      differentiation of Muller glial cells. In contrast, inactivation of Eed led to
      the ablation of PRC2 function at early postnatal stage. Cell proliferation was
      reduced and retinal progenitor cells were significantly decreased in this mutant,
      which subsequently caused depletion of Muller glia, bipolar, and rod
      photoreceptor cells, primarily generated from postnatal retinal progenitor cells.
      Interestingly, the proportion of amacrine cells was dramatically increased at
      postnatal stages in the Eed-deficient retina. In accordance, multiple
      transcription factors controlling amacrine cell differentiation were upregulated.
      Furthermore, ChIP-seq analysis showed that these deregulated genes contained
      bivalent chromatin (H3K27me3(+) H3K4me3(+)). Our results suggest that PRC2 is
      required for proliferation in order to maintain the retinal progenitor cells at
      postnatal stages and for retinal differentiation by controlling amacrine cell
      generation.

TI  - Nasal and otic placode specific regulation of Sox2 involves both activation by

AB  - Transcription factor gene Sox2 is expressed throughout sensory development, but
      the enhancers that regulate the gene vary depending on the developmental stages
      and tissues. To gain new insights into the gene regulatory network in sensory
      placode specification, regulation of the nasal-otic bispecific NOP1 enhancer of
      Sox2 was investigated in chicken embryos. Deletion and mutational analyses using 
      electroporation showed that transcriptional repression mechanisms in combination 
      with activation mechanisms determine placodal specificity. Activation of the NOP1
      enhancer involves synergistic action by Sall4 and SoxB1/SoxE factors that bind to
      the adjacent sites. Deletion of repressive elements resulted in widening of the
      tissue area for enhancer activity to a region where the expression of Sall4 and
      SoxB1/E overlaps, e.g., the CNS and neural crest. Among multiple repressive
      elements that contribute to the placodal confinement of the NOP1 enhancer
      activity, CACCT/CACCTG motifs bound by Zeb/Snail family repressors play important
      roles. Overexpression of deltaEF1 (Zeb1) or Snail2 (Slug) strongly inhibited NOP1
      activity. These data indicate that both activation by Sall4-Sox synergism and
      multiple repression mechanisms involving Zeb/Snail factors are essential for Sox2
      regulation to be confined to the nasal and otic placodes.

AB  - Apoptosis is crucial during the morphogenesis of most organs and tissues, and is 
      utilized for tissues to achieve their proper size, shape and patterning. Many
      signaling pathways contribute to the precise regulation of apoptosis. Here we
      show that Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activity contributes to the coordinated
      removal of interommatidial cells via apoptosis in the Drosophila pupal retina.
      This is consistent with previous findings that JNK activity promotes apoptosis in
      other epithelia. However, we found that JNK activity is repressed by Cindr (the
      CIN85 and CD2AP ortholog) in order to promote cell survival. Reducing the amount 
      of Cindr resulted in ectopic cell death. Increased expression of the Drosophila
      JNK basket in the setting of reduced cindr expression was found to result in even
      more severe apoptosis, whilst ectopic death was found to be reduced if retinas
      were heterozygous for basket. Hence Cindr is required to properly restrict
      JNK-mediated apoptosis in the pupal eye, resulting in the correct number of
      interommatidial cells. A lack of precise control over developmental apoptosis can
      lead to improper tissue morphogenesis.

TI  - Coupling astogenic aging in the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri with the
      stress protein mortalin.

AB  - Botryllus schlosseri, a colonial marine invertebrate, exhibits three generations 
      of short-lived astogenic modules that continuously grow and die throughout the
      colony's entire lifespan, within week-long repeating budding cycles
      (blastogenesis), each consisting of four stages (A-D). At stage D, aging is
      followed by the complete absorption of adult modules (zooids) via a massive
      apoptotic process. Here we studied in Botryllus the protein mortalin (HSP70s
      member), a molecule largely known for its association with aging and
      proliferation. In-situ hybridization and qPCR assays reveal that mortalin follows
      the cyclic pattern of blastogenesis. Colonies at blastogenic stage D display the 
      highest mortalin levels, and young modules exhibit elevated mortalin levels
      compared to old modules. Manipulations of mortalin with the specific allosteric
      inhibitor MKT-077 has led to a decrease in the modules' growth rate and the
      development of abnormal somatic/germinal morphologies (primarily in vasculature
      and in organs such as the endostyle, the stomach and gonads). We therefore
      propose that mortalin plays a significant role in the astogeny and aging of
      colonial modules in B. schlosseri, by direct involvement in the regulation of
      blastogenesis.

      fibronectin and tissue boundary establishment in the dorsal margin.

AB  - Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins are a large family of membrane channel proteins 
      that allow rapid movement of water and small, uncharged solutes into and out of
      cells along concentration gradients. Recently, aquaporins have been gaining
      recognition for more complex biological roles than the regulation of cellular
      osmotic homeostasis. We have identified a specific expression pattern for Xenopus
      aqp3b (also called aqp3.L) during gastrulation, where it is localized to the
      sensorial (deep) layer of the blastocoel roof and dorsal margin. Interference
      with aqp3b expression resulted in loss of fibrillar fibronectin matrix in
      Brachet's cleft at the dorsal marginal zone, but not on the free surface of the
      blastocoel. Detailed observation showed that the absence of fibronectin matrix
      correlated with compromised border integrities between involuted mesendoderm and 
      noninvoluted ectoderm in the marginal zone. Knockdown of aqp3b also led to
      delayed closure of the blastopore, suggesting defects in gastrulation movements. 
      Radial intercalation was not affected in aqp3b morphants, while the data
      presented are consistent with impeded convergent extension movements of the
      dorsal mesoderm in response to loss of aqp3b. Our emerging model suggests that
      aqp3b is part of a mechanism that promotes proper interaction between cells and
      the extracellular matrix, thereby playing a critical role in gastrulation.

AB  - The enteric nervous system arises from neural crest cells that migrate as chains 
      into and along the primitive gut, subsequently differentiating into enteric
      neurons and glia. Little is known about the mechanisms governing neural crest
      migration en route to and along the gut in vivo. Here, we report that Retinoic
      Acid (RA) temporally controls zebrafish enteric neural crest cell chain
      migration. In vivo imaging reveals that RA loss severely compromises the
      integrity and migration of the chain of neural crest cells during the window of
      time window when they are moving along the foregut. After loss of RA, enteric
      progenitors accumulate in the foregut and differentiate into enteric neurons, but
      subsequently undergo apoptosis resulting in a striking neuronal deficit.
      Moreover, ectopic expression of the transcription factor meis3 and/or the
      receptor ret, partially rescues enteric neuron colonization after RA attenuation.
      Collectively, our findings suggest that retinoic acid plays a critical temporal
      role in promoting enteric neural crest chain migration and neuronal survival
      upstream of Meis3 and RET in vivo.

AB  - During mouse spinal cord development, ventricular zone progenitor cells
      transition from producing neurons to producing glia at approximately embryonic
      day 11.5, a process known as the gliogenic switch. The transcription factors
      Nuclear Factor I (NFI) A and B initiate this developmental transition, but the
      contribution of a third NFI member, NFIX, remains unknown. Here, we reveal that
      ventricular zone progenitor cells within the spinal cord express NFIX after the
      onset of NFIA and NFIB expression, and after the gliogenic switch has occurred.
      Mice lacking NFIX exhibit normal neurogenesis within the spinal cord, and, while 
      early astrocytic differentiation proceeds normally, aspects of terminal
      astrocytic differentiation are impaired. Finally, we report that, in the absence 
      of Nfia or Nfib, there is a marked reduction in the spinal cord expression of
      NFIX, and that NFIB can transcriptionally activate Nfix expression in vitro.
      These data demonstrate that NFIX is part of the downstream transcriptional
      program through which NFIA and NFIB coordinate gliogenesis within the spinal
      cord. This hierarchical organisation of NFI protein expression and function
      during spinal cord gliogenesis reveals a previously unrecognised auto-regulatory 
      mechanism within this gene family.

AB  - One way to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the
      construction of a nervous system is to identify the downstream effectors of major
      regulatory proteins. We previously showed that Engrailed (EN) and
      Gooseberry-Neuro (GsbN) transcription factors act in partnership to drive the
      formation of posterior commissures in the central nervous system of Drosophila.
      In this report, we identified genes regulated by both EN and GsbN through
      chromatin immunoprecipitation ("ChIP on chip") and transcriptome experiments,
      combined to a genetic screen relied to the gene dose titration method. The
      genomic-scale approaches allowed us to define 175 potential targets of EN-GsbN
      regulation. We chose a subset of these genes to examine ventral nerve cord (VNC) 
      defects and found that half of the mutated targets show clear VNC phenotypes when
      doubly heterozygous with en or gsbn mutations, or when homozygous. This strategy 
      revealed new groups of genes never described for their implication in the
      construction of the nerve cord. Their identification suggests that, to construct 
      the nerve cord, EN-GsbN may act at three levels, in: (i) sequential control of
      the attractive-repulsive signaling that ensures contralateral projection of the
      commissural axons, (ii) temporal control of the translation of some mRNAs, (iii) 
      regulation of the capability of glial cells to act as commissural guideposts for 
      developing axons. These results illustrate how an early, coordinated
      transcriptional control may orchestrate the various mechanisms involved in the
      formation of stereotyped neuronal networks. They also validate the overall
      strategy to identify genes that play crucial role in axonal pathfinding.

AB  - Information on the mechanisms orchestrating sexual differentiation of the
      bipotential gonads into testes or ovaries in amphibians is limited. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the development of Xenopus laevis gonad, to
      identify the earliest signs of sexual differentiation, and to describe mechanisms
      driving these processes. We used light and electron microscopy,
      immunofluorescence and cell tracing. In order to identify the earliest signs of
      sexual differentiation the sex of each tadpole was determined using genotyping
      with the sex markers. Our analysis revealed a series of events participating in
      the gonadal development, including cell proliferation, migration, cell adhesion, 
      stroma penetration, and basal lamina formation. We found that during the period
      of sexual differentiation the sites of intensive cell proliferation and migration
      differ between male and female gonads. In the differentiating ovaries the germ
      cells remain associated with the gonadal surface epithelium (cortex) and a
      sterile medulla forms in the ovarian center, whereas in the differentiating
      testes the germ cells detach from the surface epithelium, disperse, and the
      cortex and medulla fuse. Cell junctions that are more abundant in the ovarian
      cortex possibly can favor the persistence of germ cells in the cortex. Also the
      stroma penetrates the female and male gonads differently. These finding indicate 
      that the crosstalk between the stroma and the coelomic epithelium-derived cells
      is crucial for development of male and female gonad.

AB  - Cell proliferation, growth and survival are three different basic processes which
      converge at determining a fundamental property -the size of an organism.
      Scalloped (Sd) is the first characterised transcriptional partner to Yorkie
      (Yki), the downstream effector of the Hippo pathway which is a highly potential
      and evolutionarily conserved regulator of organ size. Here we have studied the
      hypomorphic effect of sd on the development of Mushroom Bodies (MBs) in
      Drosophila brain. We show that, sd non-function results in an increase in the
      size of MBs. We demonstrate that, sd regulation on MB size operates through
      multiple routes. Sd expressed in the differentiated MB neurons, imposes non-cell 
      autonomous repression on the proliferation of MB precursor cells, and Sd
      expression in the MB neuroblasts (NB) cell autonomously represses mushroom body
      neuroblast (MBNB) proliferation. Further Sd in Kenyon cells (KCs) imparts a cell 
      autonomous restriction on their growth. Our findings are distinctive because,
      while the classical sd loss of function phenotypes in eye, wing and lymph gland
      are reported as loss of tissue or reduced organ size, the present study shows
      that, Sd inactivation in the developing MB, promotes precursor cell proliferation
      and results in an increase in the organ size.

      Xenopus froglet limb regeneration.

AB  - Limb regeneration is considered a form of limb redevelopment because of the
      molecular and morphological similarities. Forming a regeneration blastema is, in 
      essence, creating a developing limb bud in an adult body. This reactivation of a 
      developmental process in a mature body is worth studying. Xenopus laevis has a
      biphasic life cycle that involves distinct larval and adult stages. These
      distinct developmental stages are useful for investigating the reactivation of
      developmental processes in post-metamorphic frogs (froglets). In this study, we
      focused on the re-expression of a larval gene (krt62.L) during Xenopus froglet
      limb regeneration. Recently renamed krt62.L, this gene was known as the larval
      keratin (xlk) gene, which is specific to larval-tadpole stages. During limb
      regeneration in a froglet, krt62.L was re-expressed in a basal layer of blastema 
      epithelium, where adult-specific keratin (Krt12.6.S) expression was also
      observable. Nerves produce important regulatory factors for amphibian limb
      regeneration, and also play a role in blastema formation and maintenance. The
      effect of nerve function on krt62.L expression could be seen in the maintenance
      of krt62.L expression, but not in its induction. When an epidermis-stripped limb 
      bud was grafted in a froglet blastema, the grafted limb bud could reach the
      digit-forming stage. This suggests that krt62.L-positive froglet blastema
      epithelium is able to support the limb development process. These findings imply 
      that the developmental process is locally reactivated in an postmetamorphic body 
      during limb regeneration.

AB  - The Caenorhabditis elegans germline is widely used as a model to study stem cell 
      development, chromosome dynamics and apoptosis. Major readouts of germline
      phenotypes such as cell counting and protein expression profiling are routinely
      analyzed manually and in a two-dimensional manner. The major disadvantages of the
      existing approaches are 1) they are time-consuming and laborious and 2) there is 
      an inability to study the effects of genetic mutations in three dimensions. Here,
      we demonstrate a rapid, automated method for analyzing the three-dimensional
      distribution of proteins, germline nuclei and cytoskeletal structures in the C.
      elegans germline. Using this method, we have revealed previously unappreciated
      germline organization and cytoskeletal structures that will have a major impact
      on the characterization of germline phenotypes. To conclude, our new method
      dramatically enhances the efficiency and resolution of C. elegans germline
      analysis and may be applied to other cellular structures.

AB  - Dafachronic acid (DA) is a bile acid-like steroid hormone that regulates dauer
      formation, heterochrony, and lifespan in C. elegans. Here, we describe that DA is
      an inhibitor of C. elegans germ stem cell proliferation in adult hermaphrodites. 
      Using a C. elegans germ cell primary culture system, we show that DA inhibits the
      proliferation of germ cells in vitro. Exogenous DA reduces the frequency of large
      tumors in adult tumorous germline mutants and decreases the proliferation of
      wild-type germ stem cells in adult hermaphrodites. In contrast, DA has no
      appreciable effect on the proliferation of larval-stage germ cells in wild type. 
      The inhibition of adult germ cell proliferation by DA requires its canonical
      receptor DAF-12. Blocking DA production by inactivating the cytochrome P450 DAF-9
      increases germ cell proliferation in wild-type adult hermaphrodites and the
      frequency of large tumors in germline tumorous mutants, suggesting that DA
      inhibits the rate of germ cell proliferation under normal growth conditions.

AB  - The localization and organization of mitochondria- and ribonucleoprotein
      granule-rich germ plasm is essential for many aspects of germ cell development.
      In Xenopus, germ plasm is maternally inherited and is required for the
      specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs). Germ plasm is aggregated into
      larger patches during egg activation and cleavage and is ultimately translocated 
      perinuclearly during gastrulation. Although microtubule dynamics and a kinesin
      (Kif4a) have been implicated in Xenopus germ plasm localization, little is known 
      about how germ plasm distribution is regulated. Here, we identify a role for
      maternal Xenopus Syntabulin in the aggregation of germ plasm following
      fertilization. We show that depletion of sybu mRNA using antisense
      oligonucleotides injected into oocytes results in defects in the aggregation and 
      perinuclear transport of germ plasm and subsequently in reduced PGC numbers.
      Using live imaging analysis, we also characterize a novel role for Sybu in the
      collection of germ plasm in vegetal cleavage furrows by surface contraction
      waves. Additionally, we show that a localized kinesin-like protein, Kif3b, is
      also required for germ plasm aggregation and that Sybu functionally interacts
      with Kif3b and Kif4a in germ plasm aggregation. Overall, these data suggest
      multiple coordinate roles for kinesins and adaptor proteins in controlling the
      localization and distribution of a cytoplasmic determinant in early development.

TI  - Retinoic acid deficiency leads to an increase in spermatogonial stem number in
      the neonatal mouse testis, but excess retinoic acid results in no change.

AB  - The onset of spermatogenesis occurs in response to retinoic acid (RA), the active
      metabolite of vitamin A. However, whether RA plays any role during establishment 
      of the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) pool is unknown. Because designation of the
      SSC population and the onset of RA signaling in the testis that induces
      differentiation have similar timing, this study asked whether RA influenced SSC
      establishment. Whole mount immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis using 
      the Id4-eGfp transgenic reporter mouse line revealed an enrichment for ID4-EGFP+ 
      cells within the testis following inhibition of RA synthesis by WIN 18,446
      treatment. Transplantation analyses confirmed a significant increase in the
      number of SSCs in testes from RA-deficient animals. Conversely, no difference in 
      the ID4-EGFP+ population or change in SSC number were detected following exposure
      to an excess of RA. Collectively, reduced RA altered the number of SSCs present
      in the neonatal testis but precocious RA exposure in the neonatal testis did not,
      suggesting that RA deficiency causes a greater proportion of progenitor
      undifferentiated spermatogonia to retain their SSC state past the age when the
      pool is thought to be determined.

AB  - The adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are transcriptionally heterogeneous. As
      the mechanisms governing their developmental specification are still poorly
      understood, whether this heterogeneity reflects an early determination of
      distinct cellular sub-types with potentially distinct physiological functions
      remains an open question. We investigate the cellular heterogeneity within the
      mouse embryonic midgut epithelium at the molecular and functional levels. Cell
      fate mapping analysis revealed that multiple early embryonic epithelial
      progenitors give rise to Lgr5(+) ISCs. The origin of the molecularly distinct
      early precursors along the anterior-posterior axis defines the transcriptional
      signature of embryonic Lgr5(+) ISC progenitors. We further show that the early
      epithelial progenitors have different capacity to generate Lgr5(+) ISC
      progenitors and Axin2(+) early precursors display the highest potential.

AB  - The dendritic processes of nociceptive neurons transduce external signals into
      neurochemical cues that alert the organism to potentially damaging stimuli. The
      receptive field for each sensory neuron is defined by its dendritic arbor, but
      the mechanisms that shape dendritic architecture are incompletely understood.
      Using the model nociceptor, the PVD neuron in C. elegans, we determined that two 
      types of PVD lateral branches project along the dorsal/ventral axis to generate
      the PVD dendritic arbor: (1) Pioneer dendrites that adhere to the epidermis, and 
      (2) Commissural dendrites that fasciculate with circumferential motor neuron
      processes. Previous reports have shown that the LIM homeodomain transcription
      factor MEC-3 is required for all higher order PVD branching and that one of its
      targets, the claudin-like membrane protein HPO-30, preferentially promotes
      outgrowth of pioneer branches. Here, we show that another MEC-3 target, the
      conserved TFIIA-like zinc finger transcription factor EGL-46, adopts the
      alternative role of specifying commissural dendrites. The known EGL-46 binding
      partner, the TEAD transcription factor EGL-44, is also required for PVD
      commissural branch outgrowth. Double mutants of hpo-30 and egl-44 show strong
      enhancement of the lateral branching defect with decreased numbers of both
      pioneer and commissural dendrites. Thus, HPO-30/Claudin and EGL-46/EGL-44
      function downstream of MEC-3 and in parallel acting pathways to direct outgrowth 
      of two distinct classes of PVD dendritic branches.

      development.

AB  - Recently, endothelial cell metabolism has emerged as an essential driver and
      regulator of both blood and lymph vessel development. Evidence rapidly builds
      that metabolism is not only necessary for endothelial cell function, but moreover
      controls several aspects of the (lymph)-angiogenic process. So far, the
      best-characterized metabolic pathways to have an impact on angiogenesis are
      glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and glutamine metabolism. Glycolysis regulates
      tip cell behavior by providing ATP, fatty acid oxidation controls stalk cell
      proliferation by producing nucleotide biomass, and glutamine metabolism is
      critical for tip and stalk cell dynamics by supporting Krebs cycle anaplerosis,
      protein production and redox homeostasis, and links to asparagine metabolism.
      During lymphangiogenesis, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation are key metabolic
      pathways. Glycolysis provides energy for growing lymph vessels, while fatty acid 
      oxidation is a critical metabolic regulator of lymphangiogenesis, in part by
      promoting nucleotide synthesis as well as by mediating epigenetic changes of
      histone acetylation, which promotes transcription of key lymphatic genes, and
      hence venous-to-lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation. On the whole,
      increasing knowledge on the metabolic landscape of endothelial cells offers a
      fresh impetus to future treatment possibilities of vascular related diseases.

AB  - The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 has made genome editing possible in virtually any
      organism, including those not previously amenable to genetic manipulations. Here,
      we present an optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 for application to early avian embryos 
      with improved efficiency via a three-fold strategy. First, we employed Cas9
      protein flanked with two nuclear localization signal sequences for improved
      nuclear localization. Second, we used a modified guide RNA (gRNA) scaffold that
      obviates premature termination of transcription and unstable Cas9-gRNA
      interactions. Third, we used a chick-specific U6 promoter that yields 4-fold
      higher gRNA expression than the previously utilized human U6. For rapid screening
      of gRNAs for in vivo applications, we also generated a chicken fibroblast cell
      line that constitutively expresses Cas9. As proof of principle, we performed
      electroporation-based loss-of-function studies in the early chick embryo to knock
      out Pax7 and Sox10, key transcription factors with known functions in neural
      crest development. The results show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion causes
      loss of their respective proteins and transcripts, as well as predicted
      downstream targets. Taken together, the results reveal the utility of this
      optimized CRISPR/Cas9 method for targeted gene knockout in chicken embryos in a
      manner that is reproducible, robust and specific.

AB  - Repairing injured tissues / organs is one of the major challenges for the
      maintenance of proper organ function in adulthood. In mammals, the central
      nervous system including the spinal cord, once established during embryonic
      development, has very limited capacity to regenerate. In contrast, salamanders
      such as axolotls can fully regenerate the injured spinal cord, making this a very
      powerful vertebrate model system for studying this process. Here we discuss the
      cellular and molecular requirements for spinal cord regeneration in the axolotl. 
      The recent development of tools to test molecular function, including
      CRISPR-mediated gene editing, has lead to the identification of key players
      involved in the cell response to injury that ultimately leads to outgrowth of
      neural stem cells that are competent to replay the process of spinal cord
      development to replace the damaged/missing tissue.

AB  - Pax6 transcription factors are essential upstream regulators in the developing
      anterior brain and peripheral visual system of most bilaterian animals. While a
      single homolog is in charge of these functions in vertebrates, two Pax6 genes are
      in Drosophila: eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy). At first glance, their
      co-existence seems sufficiently explained by their differential involvement in
      the specification of two types of insect visual organs: the lateral compound eyes
      (ey) and the dorsal ocelli (toy). Less straightforward to understand, however, is
      their genetic redundancy in promoting defined early and late growth phases of the
      precursor tissue to these organs: the eye-antennal imaginal disc. Drawing on
      comparative sequence, expression, and gene function evidence, I here conclude
      that this gene regulatory network module dates back to the dawn of arthropod
      evolution, securing the embryonic development of the ocular head segment. Thus,
      ey and toy constitute a paradigm to explore the organization and functional
      significance of longterm conserved genetic redundancy of duplicated genes.
      Indeed, as first steps in this direction, recent studies uncovered the shared use
      of binding sites in shared enhancers of target genes that are under redundant
      (string) and, strikingly, even subfunctionalized control by ey and toy (atonal). 
      Equally significant, the evolutionarily recent and paralog-specific function of
      ey to repress the transcription of the antenna fate regulator Distal-less offers 
      a functionally and phylogenetically well-defined opportunity to study the
      reconciliation of shared, partitioned, and newly acquired functions in a
      duplicated developmental gene pair.

AB  - In the developing retina, as in other regions of the CNS, neural progenitors give
      rise to individual cell types during discrete temporal windows. Pax6 is expressed
      in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) throughout the course of retinogenesis, and
      has been shown to be required during early retinogenesis for generation of most
      early-born cell types. In this study, we examined the function of Pax6 in
      postnatal mouse retinal development. We found that Pax6 is essential for the
      generation of late-born interneurons, while inhibiting photoreceptor
      differentiation. Generation of bipolar interneurons requires Pax6 expression in
      RPCs, while Pax6 is required for the generation of glycinergic, but not for
      GABAergic or non-GABAergic-non-glycinergic (nGnG) amacrine cell subtypes. In
      contrast, overexpression of either full-length Pax6 or its 5a isoform in RPCs
      induces formation of cells with nGnG amacrine features, and suppresses generation
      of other inner retinal cell types. Moreover, overexpression of both Pax6 variants
      prevents photoreceptor differentiation, most likely by inhibiting Crx expression.
      Taken together, these data show that Pax6 acts in RPCs to control differentiation
      of multiple late-born neuronal cell types.

AB  - In the spinal cord, motor axons project out the neural tube at specific exit
      points, then bundle together to project toward target muscles. The molecular
      signals that guide motor axons to and out of their exit points remain undefined. 
      Since motor axons and their exit points are located near the floor plate,
      guidance signals produced by the floor plate and adjacent ventral tissues could
      influence motor axons as they project toward and out of exit points. The secreted
      Slit proteins are major floor plate repellents, and motor neurons express two
      Slit receptors, Robo1 and Robo2. Using mutant mouse embryos at early stages of
      motor axon exit, we found that motor exit points shifted ventrally in Robo1/2 or 
      Slit1/2 double mutants. Along with the ventral shift, mutant axons had abnormal
      trajectories both within the neural tube toward the exit point, and after exit
      into the periphery. In contrast, the absence of the major ventral attractant,
      Netrin-1, or its receptor, DCC caused motor exit points to shift dorsally.
      Netrin-1 attraction on spinal motor axons was demonstrated by in vitro explant
      assays, showing that Netrin-1 increased outgrowth and attracted cultured spinal
      motor axons. The opposing effects of Slit/Robo and Netrin-1/DCC signals were
      tested genetically by combining Netrin-1 and Robo1/2 mutations. The location of
      exit points in the combined mutants was significantly recovered to their normal
      position compared to Netrin-1 or Robo1/2 mutants. Together, these results suggest
      that the proper position of motor exit points is determined by a "push-pull"
      mechanism, pulled ventrally by Netrin-1/DCC attraction and pushed dorsally by
      Slit/Robo repulsion.

AB  - Hoxa1 has important functional roles in neural crest specification, hindbrain
      patterning and heart and ear development, yet the enhancers and genes that are
      targeted by Hoxa1 are largely unknown. In this study, we performed a
      comprehensive analysis of Hoxa1 target genes using genome-wide Hoxa1 binding data
      in mouse ES cells differentiated with retinoic acid (RA) into neural fates in
      combination with differential gene expression analysis in Hoxa1 gain- and
      loss-of-function mouse and zebrafish embryos. Our analyses reveal that
      Hoxa1-bound regions show epigenetic marks of enhancers, occupancy of Hox
      cofactors and differential expression of nearby genes, suggesting that these
      regions are enriched for enhancers. In support of this, 80 of them mapped to
      regions with known reporter activity in transgenic mouse embryos based on the
      Vista enhancer database. Two additional enhancers in Dok5 and Wls1 were shown to 
      mediate neural expression in developing mouse and zebrafish. Overall, our
      analysis of the putative target genes indicate that Hoxa1 has input to components
      of major signaling pathways, including Wnt, TGF-beta, Hedgehog and Hippo, and
      frequently does so by targeting multiple components of a pathway such as secreted
      inhibitors, ligands, receptors and down-stream components. We also identified
      genes implicated in heart and ear development, neural crest migration and
      neuronal patterning and differentiation, which may underlie major Hoxa1 mutant
      phenotypes. Finally, we found evidence for a high degree of evolutionary
      conservation of many binding regions and downstream targets of Hoxa1 between
      mouse and zebrafish. Our genome-wide analyses in ES cells suggests that we have
      enriched for in vivo relevant target genes and pathways associated with
      functional roles of Hoxa1 in mouse development.

AB  - Cerebellar growth and foliation require the Hedgehog-driven proliferation of
      granule cell precursors (GCPs) in the external granule layer (EGL). However, that
      increased or extended GCP proliferation generally does not elicit ectopic folds
      suggests that additional determinants control cortical expansion and foliation
      during cerebellar development. Here, we find that genetic loss of the
      serine-threonine kinase Liver Kinase B1 (Lkb1) in GCPs increased cerebellar
      cortical size and foliation independent of changes in proliferation or Hedgehog
      signaling. This finding is unexpected given that Lkb1 has previously shown to be 
      critical for Hedgehog pathway activation in cultured cells. Consistent with
      unchanged proliferation rate of GCPs, the cortical expansion of Lkb1 mutants is
      accompanied by thinning of the EGL. The plane of cell division, which has been
      implicated in diverse processes from epithelial surface expansions to
      gyrification of the human cortex, remains unchanged in the mutants when compared 
      to wild-type controls. However, we find that Lkb1 mutants display delayed radial 
      migration of post-mitotic GCPs that coincides with increased cortical size,
      suggesting that aberrant cell migration may contribute to the cortical expansion 
      and increase foliation. Taken together, our results reveal an important role for 
      Lkb1 in regulating cerebellar cortical size and foliation in a
      Hedgehog-independent manner.

TI  - Intraflagellar transporter protein (IFT27), an IFT25 binding partner, is
      essential for male fertility and spermiogenesis in mice.

AB  - Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism essential
      for the assembly and maintenance of most eukaryotic cilia and flagella. In mice, 
      mutations in IFT proteins have been shown to cause several ciliopathies including
      retinal degeneration, polycystic kidney disease, and hearing loss. However,
      little is known about its role in the formation of the sperm tail, which has the 
      longest flagella of mammalian cells. IFT27 is a component of IFT-B complex and
      binds to IFT25 directly. In mice, IFT27 is highly expressed in the testis. To
      investigate the role of IFT27 in male germ cells, the floxed Ift27 mice were bred
      with Stra8-iCre mice so that the Ift27 gene was disrupted in
      spermatocytes/spermatids. The Ift27: Stra8-iCre mutant mice did not show any
      gross abnormalities, and all of the mutant mice survived to adulthood. There was 
      no difference between testis weight/body weight between controls and mutant mice.
      All adult homozygous mutant males examined were completely infertile.
      Histological examination of the testes revealed abnormally developed germ cells
      during the spermiogenesis phase. The epididymides contained round bodies of
      cytoplasm. Sperm number was significantly reduced compared to the controls and
      only about 2% of them remained significantly reduced motility. Examination of
      epididymal sperm by light microscopy and SEM revealed multiple morphological
      abnormalities including round heads, short and bent tails, abnormal thickness of 
      sperm tails in some areas, and swollen tail tips in some sperm. TEM examination
      of epididymal sperm showed that most sperm lost the "9+2'' axoneme structure, and
      the mitochondria sheath, fibrous sheath, and outer dense fibers were also
      disorganized. Some sperm flagella also lost cell membrane. Levels of IFT25 and
      IFT81 were significantly reduced in the testis of the conditional Ift27 knockout 
      mice, and levels of IFT20, IFT74, and IFT140 were not changed. Sperm lipid rafts,
      which were disrupted in the conditional Ift25 knockout mice, appeared to be
      normal in the conditional Ift27 knockout mice. Our findings suggest that like
      IFT25, IFT27, even though not required for ciliogenesis in somatic cells, is
      essential for sperm flagella formation, sperm function, and male fertility in
      mice. IFT25 and IFT27 control sperm formation/function through many common
      mechanisms, but IFT25 has additional roles beyond IFT27.

AB  - Hypoblast/visceral endoderm assists in amniote nutrition, axial positioning and
      formation of the gut. Here, we provide evidence, currently limited to humans and 
      non-human primates, that hypoblast is a purveyor of extraembryonic mesoderm in
      the mouse gastrula. Fate mapping a unique segment of axial extraembryonic
      visceral endoderm associated with the allantoic component of the primitive
      streak, and referred to as the "AX", revealed that visceral endoderm supplies the
      placentae with extraembryonic mesoderm. Exfoliation of the AX was dependent upon 
      contact with the primitive streak, which modulated Hedgehog signaling. Resolution
      of the AX's epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by Hedgehog shaped the
      allantois into its characteristic projectile and individualized placental
      arterial vessels. A unique border cell separated the delaminating AX from the
      yolk sac blood islands which, situated beyond the limit of the streak, were not
      formed by an EMT. Over time, the AX became the hindgut lip, which contributed
      extensively to the posterior interface, including both embryonic and
      extraembryonic tissues. The AX, in turn, imparted antero-posterior (A-P) polarity
      on the primitive streak and promoted its elongation and differentiation into
      definitive endoderm. Results of heterotopic grafting supported mutually
      interactive functions of the AX and primitive streak, showing that together, they
      self-organized into a complete version of the fetal-placental interface, forming 
      an elongated structure that exhibited A-P polarity and was composed of the
      allantois, an AX-derived rod-like axial extension reminiscent of the embryonic
      notochord, the placental arterial vasculature and visceral endoderm/hindgut.

AB  - Transcription factors are key orchestrators of the emergence of neuronal
      diversity within the developing spinal cord. As such, the two paralogous proteins
      Pax3 and Pax7 regulate the specification of progenitor cells within the
      intermediate neural tube, by defining a neat segregation between those fated to
      form motor circuits and those involved in the integration of sensory inputs. To
      attain insights into the molecular means by which they control this process, we
      have performed detailed phenotypic analyses of the intermediate spinal
      interneurons (IN), namely the dI6, V0D, V0VCG and V1 populations in compound null
      mutants for Pax3 and Pax7. This has revealed that the levels of Pax3/7 proteins
      determine both the dorso-ventral extent and the number of cells produced in each 
      subpopulation; with increasing levels leading to the dorsalisation of their fate.
      Furthermore, thanks to the examination of mutants in which Pax3 transcriptional
      activity is skewed either towards repression or activation, we demonstrate that
      this cell diversification process is mainly dictated by Pax3/7 ability to repress
      gene expression. Consistently, we show that Pax3 and Pax7 inhibit the expression 
      of Dbx1 and of its repressor Prdm12, fate determinants of the V0 and V1
      interneurons, respectively. Notably, we provide evidence for the activity of
      several cis-regulatory modules of Dbx1 to be sensitive to Pax3 and Pax7
      transcriptional activity levels. Altogether, our study provides insights into how
      the redundancy within a TF family, together with discrete dynamics of expression 
      profiles of each member, are exploited to generate cellular diversity.
      Furthermore, our data supports the model whereby cell fate choices in the neural 
      tube do not rely on binary decisions but rather on inhibition of multiple
      alternative fates.

AB  - Anamniotes, fishes and amphibians, have the capacity to regenerate spinal cord
      tissue after injury, generating new neurons that mature and integrate into the
      spinal circuitry. Elucidating the molecular signals that promote this
      regeneration is a fundamental question in regeneration research. Model systems,
      such as salamanders and larval and adult zebrafish are used to analyse successful
      regeneration. This shows that many developmental signals, such as Notch, Hedgehog
      (Hh), Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), Wnt, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF),
      Retinoic Acid (RA) and neurotransmitters are redeployed during regeneration and
      activate resident spinal progenitor cells. Here we compare the roles of these
      signals in spinal cord development and regeneration of the much larger and fully 
      patterned adult spinal cord. Understanding how developmental signalling systems
      are reactivated in successfully regenerating species may ultimately lead to ways 
      to reactivate similar systems in mammalian progenitor cells, which do not show
      neurogenesis after spinal injury.

AB  - Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulates the patterning of ventral spinal cord
      through the effector Gli family of transcription factors. Previous in vitro
      studies showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing Speckle-type POZ protein
      (Spop) targets Gli2 and Gli3 for ubiquitination and degradation, but the role of 
      Spop in Shh signaling and mammalian spinal cord patterning remains unknown. Here,
      we show that loss of Spop does not alter spinal cord patterning, but it
      suppresses the loss of floor plate and V3 interneuron phenotype of Gli2 mutants, 
      suggesting a negative role of Spop in Gli3 activator activity, Shh signaling and 
      the specification of ventral cell fates in the spinal cord. This correlates with 
      a moderate but significant increase in the level of Gli3 protein in the Spop
      mutant spinal cords. Furthermore, loss of Spop restores the maximal Shh pathway
      activation and ventral cell fate specification in the Gli1;Sufu double mutant
      spinal cord. Finally, we show that loss of Spop-like does not change the spinal
      cord patterning in either wild type or Spop mutants, suggesting that it does not 
      compensate for the loss of Spop in Shh signaling and spinal cord patterning.
      Therefore, our results demonstrate a negative role of Spop in the level and
      activity of Gli3, Shh signaling and ventral spinal cord patterning.

AB  - The formation of the spinal cord during early embryonic development in vertebrate
      embryos is a continuous process that begins at gastrulation and continues through
      to the completion of somitogenesis. Despite the conserved usage of patterning
      mechanisms and gene regulatory networks that act to generate specific spinal cord
      progenitors, there now exists two seemingly disparate models to account for their
      action. In the first, a posteriorly localized signalling source transforms
      previously anterior-specified neural plate into the spinal cord. In the second, a
      population of bipotent stem cells undergo continuous self-renewal and
      differentiation to progressively lay down the spinal cord and axial mesoderm by
      posterior growth. Whether this represents fundamental differences between the
      experimental model organisms utilised in the generation of these models remains
      to be addressed. Here we review lineage studies across four key vertebrate
      models: mouse, chicken, Xenopus and zebrafish and relate them to the underlying
      gene regulatory networks that are known to be required for spinal cord formation.
      We propose that by applying a dynamical systems approach to understanding how
      distinct neural and mesodermal fates arise from a bipotent progenitor pool, it is
      possible to begin to understand how differences in the dynamical cell behaviours 
      such as proliferation rates and cell movements can map onto conserved regulatory 
      networks to generate diversity in the timing of tissue generation and patterning 
      during development.

AB  - A fundamental issue in nervous system development and homeostasis is to
      understand the mechanisms governing the balance between the maintenance of
      proliferating progenitors versus their differentiation into post-mitotic neurons.
      Accumulating data suggest that the cell cycle and core regulators of the cell
      cycle machinery play a major role in regulating this fine balance. Here, we focus
      on the interplay between the cell cycle and cellular and molecular events
      governing spinal cord development. We describe the existing links between the
      cell cycle and interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). We show how the different
      morphogens patterning the neural tube also regulate the cell cycle machinery to
      coordinate proliferation and patterning. We give examples of how cell cycle core 
      regulators regulate transcriptionally, or post-transcriptionally, genes involved 
      in controlling the maintenance versus the differentiation of neural progenitors. 
      Finally, we describe the changes in cell cycle kinetics occurring during neural
      tube patterning and at the time of neuronal differentiation, and we discuss
      future research directions to better understand the role of the cell cycle in
      cell fate decisions.

AB  - Functional neural circuits depend on the establishment of specific connections
      between neurons and their target cells. To this end, many axons have to travel
      long distances to reach their target cells during development. Studies addressing
      the molecular mechanisms of axon guidance have to overcome the complexity of
      subpopulation-specific requirements with respect to pathways, guidance cues, and 
      target recognition. Compared to the brain, the relatively simple structure of the
      spinal cord provides an advantage for experimental studies of axon guidance
      mechanisms. Therefore, the so far best understood model for axon guidance is the 
      dI1 population of dorsal interneurons of the spinal cord. They extend their axons
      ventrally towards the floor plate. After midline crossing, they turn rostrally
      along the contralateral floor-plate border. Despite the fact that the trajectory 
      of dI1 axons seems to be rather simple, the number of axon guidance molecules
      involved in the decisions taken by these axons is bewildering. Because guidance
      molecules and mechanisms are conserved throughout the developing nervous system, 
      we can generalize what we have learned about the navigation of the floor plate as
      an intermediate target for commissural axons to the brain.

AB  - Neurons of the dorsal hindbrain and spinal cord are central in receiving,
      processing and relaying sensory perception and participate in the coordination of
      sensory-motor output. Numerous cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie
      neuronal development in both regions of the nervous system are shared. We discuss
      here the mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity in the dorsal spinal cord
      and hindbrain, and emphasize similarities in patterning and neuronal
      specification. Insight into the developmental mechanisms has provided tools that 
      can help to assign functions to small subpopulations of neurons. Hence, novel
      information on how mechanosensory or pain sensation is encoded under normal and
      neuropathic conditions has already emerged. Such studies show that the complex
      neuronal circuits that control perception of somatosensory and viscerosensory
      stimuli are becoming amenable to investigations.

AB  - Collagen IV networks endow basement membranes (BMs) with remarkable tensile
      strength and function as morphoregulatory substrata for diverse tissue-specific
      developmental events. A complex repertoire of intracellular and extracellular
      molecular interactions are required for collagen IV secretion and supramolecular 
      assembly into BMs. These include intracellular chaperones such as Heat shock
      protein 47 (Hsp47) and the chaperone-binding trafficking protein Transport and
      Golgi organization protein 1 (Tango1). Mutations in these proteins lead to
      compromised collagen IV protomer stability and secretion, leading to defective BM
      assembly and function. In addition to intracellular chaperones, a role for
      extracellular chaperones orchestrating the transport, supramolecular assembly,
      and architecture of collagen IV in BM is emerging. We present evidence derived
      from evolutionarily distant model organisms that supports an extracellular
      collagen IV chaperone-like activity for the matricellular protein SPARC (Secreted
      Protein, Acidic, Rich in Cysteine). Loss of SPARC disrupts BM homeostasis and
      compromises tissue biomechanics and physiological function. Thus, the combined
      contributions of intracellular and extracellular collagen IV-associated
      chaperones and chaperone-like proteins are critical to ensure proper secretion
      and stereotypic assembly of collagen IV networks in BMs.

      neural circuit diversity.

AB  - Diversification of neuronal types is key to establishing functional variations in
      neural circuits. The first critical step to generate neuronal diversity is to
      organize the compartmental domains of developing brains into spatially distinct
      neural progenitor pools. Neural progenitors in each pool then generate a unique
      set of diverse neurons through specific spatiotemporal specification processes.
      In this review article, we focus on an additional mechanism, 'inter-progenitor
      pool wiring', that further expands the diversity of neural circuits. After
      diverse types of neurons are generated in one progenitor pool, a fraction of
      these neurons start migrating toward a remote brain region containing neurons
      that originate from another progenitor pool. Finally, neurons of different
      origins are intermingled and eventually form complex but precise neural circuits.
      The developing cerebral cortex of mammalian brains is one of the best examples of
      inter-progenitor pool wiring. However, Drosophila visual system development has
      revealed similar mechanisms in invertebrate brains, suggesting that
      inter-progenitor pool wiring is an evolutionarily conserved strategy that expands
      neural circuit diversity. Here, we will discuss how inter-progenitor pool wiring 
      is accomplished in mammalian and fly brain systems.

AB  - The transcription factor Six1 and its cofactor Eya1 are important regulators of
      neurogenesis in cranial placodes, activating genes promoting both a progenitor
      state, such as hes8, and neuronal differentiation, such as neurog1. Here, we use 
      gain and loss of function studies in Xenopus laevis to elucidate how these genes 
      function during placodal neurogenesis. We first establish that hes8 is activated 
      by Notch signaling and represses neurog1 and neuronal differentiation, indicating
      that it mediates lateral inhibition. Using hes8 knockdown we demonstrate that
      hes8 is essential for limiting neuronal differentiation during normal placode
      development. We next show that Six1 and Eya1 cell autonomously activate both hes8
      and neurog1 in a dose-dependent fashion, with increasing upregulation at higher
      doses, while neuronal differentiation is increasingly repressed. However, high
      doses of Six1 and Eya1 upregulate neurog1 only transiently, whereas low doses of 
      Six1 and Eya1 ultimately promote both neurog1 expression and neuronal
      differentiation. Finally, we show that Six1 and Eya1 can activate hes8 and arrest
      neuronal differentiation even when Notch signaling is blocked. Our findings
      indicate that Six1 and Eya1 can both promote and arrest neuronal differentiation 
      by activating the Notch pathway genes neurog1 and hes8, respectively, revealing a
      novel mechanism of Six1/Eya1 action during placodal neurogenesis.

AB  - While several studies indicate the importance of ephrin-B/EphB bidirectional
      signaling in excitatory neurons, potential roles for these molecules in
      inhibitory neurons are largely unknown. We identify here an autonomous
      receptor-like role for ephrin-B reverse signaling in the tangential migration of 
      interneurons into the neocortex using ephrin-B (EfnB1/B2/B3) conditional triple
      mutant (TM(lz)) mice and a forebrain inhibitory neuron specific Cre driver.
      Inhibitory neuron deletion of the three EfnB genes leads to reduced interneuron
      migration, abnormal cortical excitability, and lethal audiogenic seizures.
      Truncated and intracellular point mutations confirm the importance of ephrin-B
      reverse signaling in interneuron migration and cortical excitability. A
      non-autonomous ligand-like role was also identified for ephrin-B2 that is
      expressed in neocortical radial glial cells and required for proper tangential
      migration of GAD65-positive interneurons. Our studies thus define both
      receptor-like and ligand-like roles for the ephrin-B molecules in controlling the
      migration of interneurons as they populate the neocortex and help establish
      excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) homeostasis.

      Insights into the evolution of nervous systems.

AB  - In the deuterostomes and ecdysozoans that have been studied (e.g. chordates and
      insects), neural fate specification relies on signaling from surrounding cells.
      However, very little is known about mechanisms of neural specification in the
      third major bilaterian clade, spiralians. Using blastomere isolation in the
      annelid Capitella teleta, a spiralian, we studied to what extent extrinsic versus
      intrinsic signals are involved in early neural specification of the brain and
      ventral nerve cord. For the first time in any bilaterian, we found that brain
      neural ectoderm is autonomously specified. This occurs in the daughters of
      first-quartet micromeres, which also generate anterior neural ectoderm in other
      spiralians. In contrast, isolation of the animal cap, including the 2d micromere,
      which makes the trunk ectoderm and ventral nerve cord, blocked ventral nerve cord
      formation. When the animal cap was isolated with the 2D macromere, the resulting 
      partial larvae had a ventral nerve cord. These data suggest that extrinsic
      signals from second-quartet macromeres or their daughters, which form mesoderm
      and endoderm, are required for nerve cord specification in C. teleta and that the
      2D macromere or its daughters are sufficient to provide the inductive signal. We 
      propose that autonomous specification of anterior neural ectoderm evolved in
      spiralians in order to enable them to quickly respond to environmental cues
      encountered by swimming larvae in the water column. In contrast, a variety of
      signaling pathways could have been co-opted to conditionally specify the nerve
      cord. This flexibility of nerve cord development may be linked to the large
      diversity of trunk nervous systems present in Spiralia.

      embryonic stem cell fate.

AB  - beta-catenin-mediated signaling has been extensively studied in regard to its
      role in the regulation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). However, the
      results are controversial and the mechanism by which beta-catenin regulates the
      hESC fate remains unclear. Here, we report that beta-catenin and gamma-catenin
      are functionally redundant in mediating hESC adhesion and are required for
      embryoid body formation, but both genes are dispensable for hESC maintenance, as 
      the undifferentiated state of beta-catenin and gamma-catenin double deficient
      hESCs can be maintained. Overexpression of beta-catenin induces rapid hESC
      differentiation. Functional assays revealed that TCF1 plays a crucial role in
      hESC differentiation mediated by beta-catenin. Forced expression of TCF1, but not
      other LEF1/TCF family members, resulted in hESC differentiation towards the
      definitive endoderm. Conversely, knockdown of TCF1 or inhibition of the
      interaction between TCF1 and beta-catenin delayed hESC exit from pluripotency.
      Furthermore, we demonstrated that GATA6 plays a predominant role in TCF1-mediated
      hESC differentiation. Knockdown of GATA6 completely eliminated the effect of
      TCF1, while forced expression of GATA6 induced hESC differentiation. Our data
      thus reveal more detailed mechanisms for beta-catenin in regulating hESC fate
      decisions and will expand our understanding of the self-renewal and
      differentiation circuitry in hESCs.

AB  - Development of the brain directly influences the development of the face via both
      physical growth and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) activity; however, little is known about
      how neural crest cells (NCCs), the mesenchymal population that comprise the
      developing facial prominences, influence the development of the brain. We
      utilized the conditional ciliary mutant Wnt1-Cre;Kif3a(fl/fl) to demonstrate that
      loss of primary cilia on NCCs resulted in a widened ventral forebrain. We found
      that neuroectodermal Shh expression, dorsal/ventral patterning, and amount of
      proliferation in the ventral neuroectoderm was not changed in
      Wnt1-Cre;Kif3a(fl/fl) mutants; however, tissue polarity and directional cell
      division were disrupted. Furthermore, NCCs of Wnt1-Cre;Kif3a(fl/fl) mutants
      failed to respond to a SHH signal emanating from the ventral forebrain. We were
      able to recapitulate the ventral forebrain phenotype by removing Smoothened from 
      NCCs (Wnt1-Cre;Smo(fl/fl)) indicating that changes in the ventral forebrain were 
      mediated through a Hedgehog-dependent mechanism. Together, these data suggest a
      novel, cilia-dependent mechanism for NCCs during forebrain development.

AB  - In insects, the hindgut is a homeostatic region of the digestive tract, divided
      into pylorus, ileum, and rectum, that reabsorbs water, ions, and small molecules 
      produced during hemolymph filtration. The hindgut anatomy in bee larvae is
      different from that of adult workers. This study reports the morphological
      changes and cellular events that occur in the hindgut during the metamorphosis of
      the honeybee Apis mellifera. We describe the occurrence of autophagosomes and the
      ultrastructure of the epithelial cells and cuticle, suggesting that cuticular
      degradation begins in prepupae, with the cuticle being reabsorbed and recycled by
      autophagosomes in white- and pink-eyed pupae, followed by the deposition of new
      cuticle in light-brown-eyed pupae. In L5S larvae and prepupae, the hindgut
      undergoes cell proliferation in the anterior and posterior ends. In the pupae,
      the pylorus, ileum, and rectum regions are differentiated, and cell proliferation
      ceases in dark-brown-eyed pupae. Apoptosis occurs in the hindgut from the L5S
      larval to the pink-eyed pupal stage. In light-brown- and dark-brown-eyed pupae,
      the ileum epithelium changes from pseudostratified to simple only after the
      production of the basal lamina, whereas the rectal epithelium is always
      flattened. In black-eyed pupae, ileum epithelial cells have large vacuoles and
      subcuticular spaces, while in adult forager workers these cells have long
      invaginations in the cell apex and many mitochondria, indicating a role in the
      transport of compounds. Our findings show that hindgut morphogenesis is a dynamic
      process, with tissue remodeling and cellular events taking place for the
      formation of different regions of the organ, the reconstruction of a new cuticle,
      and the remodeling of visceral muscles.

AB  - The calcium ion (Ca(2+)) is an important second messenger, and a rapid increase
      in Ca(2+) level (Ca(2+) transient) is involved in various aspects of
      embryogenesis. Although Ca(2+) transients play an important role in early
      developmental stages, little is known about their dynamics throughout
      embryogenesis. Here, Ca(2+) transients were characterized by visualizing Ca(2+)
      dynamics in developing chordate embryos using a fluorescent protein-based Ca(2+) 
      indicator, GCaMP6s in combination with finely tuned microscopy. Ca(2+) transients
      were detected in precursors of muscle cells in the late gastrula stage. In the
      neurula stage, repetitive Ca(2+) transients were observed in left and right
      neurogenic cells, including visceral ganglion (VG) precursors, and the duration
      of Ca(2+) transients was 39+/-4s. In the early tailbud stage, Ca(2+) transients
      were observed in differentiating precursors of nerve cord neurons. A small
      population of VG precursors showed rhythmical Ca(2+) transients with a duration
      of 22+/-4s, suggesting a central pattern generator (CPG) origin. At the mid
      tailbud stage, Ca(2+)transients were observed in a wide area of epidermal cells
      and named CTECs. The number and frequency of CTECs increased drastically in late 
      tailbud stages, and the timing of the increase coincided with that of the
      relaxation of the tail bending. The experiment using Ca(2+) chelator showed that 
      the CTECs were largely depending on the extracellular Ca(2+). The waveform
      analysis of Ca(2+) transients revealed different features according to duration
      and frequency. The comprehensive characterization of Ca(2+) transients during
      early ascidian embryogenesis will help our understanding of the role of Ca(2+)
      signaling in chordate embryogenesis.

AB  - The lateral line system is a mechanosensory systems present in aquatic animals.
      The anterior and posterior lateral lines develop from anterior and posterior
      lateral line placodes (aLLp and pLLp), respectively. Although signaling molecules
      required for the induction of other cranial placodes have been well studied, the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying formation of the lateral line placodes are
      unknown. In this study we tested the requirement of multiple signaling pathways, 
      such as Wnt, Bmp Fgf, and Retinoic Acid for aLLp and pLLp induction. We
      determined that aLLp specification requires Fgf signaling, whilst pLLp
      specification requires retinoic acid which inhibits Fgf signaling. pLLp induction
      is also independent of Wnt and Bmp activities, even though these pathways limit
      the boundaries of the pLLp. This is the first report that the aLLp and pLLp
      depend on different inductive mechanisms and that pLLp induction requires the
      inhibition of Fgf, Wnt and Bmp signaling.

AB  - Notch regulates both neurogenesis and cell cycle activity to coordinate precursor
      cell generation in the differentiating Drosophila eye. Mosaic analysis with
      mitotic clones mutant for Notch components was used to identify the pathway of
      Notch signaling that regulates the cell cycle in the Second Mitotic Wave.
      Although S phase entry depends on Notch signaling and on the transcription factor
      Su(H), the transcriptional co-activator Mam and the bHLH repressor genes of the
      E(spl)-Complex were not essential, although these are Su(H) coactivators and
      targets during the regulation of neurogenesis. The Second Mitotic Wave showed
      little dependence on ubiquitin ligases neuralized or mindbomb, and although the
      ligand Delta is required non-autonomously, partial cell cycle activity occurred
      in the absence of known Notch ligands. We found that myc was not essential for
      the Second Mitotic Wave. The Second Mitotic Wave did not require the HLH protein 
      Extra macrochaetae, and the bHLH protein Daughterless was required only
      cell-nonautonomously. Similar cell cycle phenotypes for Daughterless and Atonal
      were consistent with requirement for neuronal differentiation to stimulate Delta 
      expression, affecting Notch activity in the Second Mitotic Wave indirectly.
      Therefore Notch signaling acts to regulate the Second Mitotic Wave without
      activating bHLH gene targets.

AB  - Split ends (SPEN) is the founding member of a well conserved family of nuclear
      proteins with critical functions in transcriptional regulation and the
      post-transcriptional processing and nuclear export of transcripts. In animals,
      the SPEN proteins fall into two size classes that perform either complementary or
      antagonistic functions in different cellular contexts. Here, we show that the two
      Drosophila representatives of this family, SPEN and Spenito (NITO), regulate
      metamorphic remodeling of the CCAP/bursicon neurosecretory cells. CCAP/bursicon
      cell-targeted overexpression of SPEN had no effect on the larval morphology or
      the pruning back of the CCAP/bursicon cell axons at the onset of metamorphosis.
      During the subsequent outgrowth phase of metamorphic remodeling, overexpression
      of either SPEN or NITO strongly inhibited axon extension, axon branching,
      peripheral neuropeptide accumulation, and soma growth. Cell-targeted
      loss-of-function alleles for both spen and nito caused similar reductions in axon
      outgrowth, indicating that the absolute levels of SPEN and NITO activity are
      critical to support the developmental plasticity of these neurons. Although nito 
      RNAi did not affect SPEN protein levels, the phenotypes produced by SPEN
      overexpression were suppressed by nito RNAi. We propose that SPEN and NITO
      function additively or synergistically in the CCAP/bursicon neurons to regulate
      multiple aspects of neurite outgrowth during metamorphic remodeling.

AB  - miRNAs are essential regulators of cell identity, yet their role in early embryo 
      development in plants remains largely unexplored. To determine the earliest stage
      at which miRNAs act to promote pattern formation in embryogenesis, we examined a 
      series of mutant alleles in the Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA biogenesis enzymes
      DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1), SERRATE (SE), and HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1). Cellular and
      patterning defects were observed in dcl1, se and hyl1 embryos from the zygote
      through the globular stage of embryogenesis. To identify miRNAs that are
      expressed in early embryogenesis, we sequenced mRNAs from globular stage Columbia
      wild type (wt) and se-1 embryos, and identified transcripts potentially
      corresponding to 100 miRNA precursors. Considering genome location and transcript
      increase between wt and se-1, 39 of these MIRNAs are predicted to be bona fide
      early embryo miRNAs. Among these are conserved miRNAs such as miR156, miR159,
      miR160, miR161, miR164, miR165, miR166, miR167, miR168, miR171, miR319, miR390
      and miR394, as well as miRNAs whose function has never been characterized. Our
      analysis demonstrates that miRNAs promote pattern formation beginning in the
      zygote, and provides a comprehensive dataset for functional studies of individual
      miRNAs in Arabidopsis embryogenesis.

AB  - Sp7 is a zinc finger transcription factor that is essential for osteoblast
      differentiation in mammals. To verify the characteristic features of
      osteoblast-lineage cells in teleosts, we established medaka sp7 mutants using a
      transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) genome editing system.
      These mutants showed severe defects in the formation of skeletal structures. In
      particular, the neural and the hemal arches were not formed, although the chordal
      centra were formed. Analysis of the transgenic medaka revealed that sp7 mutant
      had normal distribution of type X collagen a1 a (col10a1a)-positive
      osteoblast-like cells around the centrum and at the proximal region of the
      vertebral arch. The sp7 mutant phenotype could be rescued by exogenous sp7
      expression in col10a1a-positive cells, as well as in sp7-positive osteoblast
      cells. Furthermore, runx2-positive osteoblast progenitors were observed on the
      vertebral arches, but not on the centrum, during vertebral column development. In
      addition, these osteoblast progenitors differentiated into the col10a1a-positive 
      cells. In sp7 mutant, the runx2-positive cells were normally distributed at the
      region of unformed vertebral arch but failed to differentiate into
      col10a1a-positive cells. These results indicate that osteoblast-lineage cells
      undergo two distinct differentiation processes during development of the
      vertebral arch and the centrum. Nevertheless, our results verified that sp7 gene 
      expression in osteoblast-lineage cells is required for differentiation into
      mature osteoblasts to form the vertebral column and other skeletal structures.

AB  - Balancing self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells requires differential
      expression of self-renewing factors in two daughter cells generated from the
      asymmetric division of the stem cells. In Drosophila type II neural stem cell (or
      neuroblast, NB) lineages, the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix-Orange
      (bHLH-O) family proteins, including Deadpan (Dpn) and E(spl) proteins, is
      required for maintaining the self-renewal and identity of type II NBs, whereas
      the absence of these self-renewing factors is essential for the differentiation
      of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) generated from type II NBs. Here, we
      demonstrate that Dpn maintains type II NBs by suppressing the expression of
      Earmuff (Erm). We provide evidence that Dpn and E(spl) proteins suppress Erm by
      directly binding to C-sites and N-boxes in the cis-regulatory region of erm.
      Conversely, the absence of bHLH-O proteins in INPs allows activation of erm and
      Erm-mediated maturation of INPs. Our results further suggest that Pointed P1
      (PntP1) mediates the dedifferentiation of INPs resulting from the loss of Erm or 
      overexpression of Dpn or E(spl) proteins. Taken together, these findings reveal
      mechanisms underlying the regulation of the maintenance of type II NBs and
      differentiation of INPs through the differential expression of bHLH-O family
      proteins.

AB  - The circadian timing system is a complex biological network of interacting
      circadian clocks that regulates 24h rhythms of behavioral and physiological
      processes. One intriguing observation is that stem cell homeostasis is subject to
      circadian clock regulation. Rhythmic oscillations have been observed in a variety
      of embryonic and adult stem cell dependent processes, such as hematopoietic
      progenitor cell migration, the hair follicle cycle, bone remodeling, regenerative
      myogenesis and neurogenesis. This review aims to discuss the nature of the
      circadian clock in embryonic stem cells and how it changes during
      differentiation. Furthermore, it will examine how the circadian clock contributes
      to adult stem cell function in different tissues of the body with an emphasis on 
      the brain and adult neurogenesis.

AB  - In turtles undergoing temperature sex determination (TSD), bipotential gonads
      express Sox9 in medullary cords at both female- (FPT) and male-producing
      temperatures (MPT). Subsequently, when the sex fate of medullary cords becomes
      dimorphic, at FPT, Sox9 is downregulated, whereas at MPT, its expression is
      maintained. Medullary cords in the ovary turn into ovarian lacuna, whereas in the
      testis they differentiate as seminiferous cords. When embryos of Lepidochelys
      olivacea sea turtle are incubated at MPT and treated with estradiol, Sox9
      expression persists in the medullary cords in the form of tiny ovotestis-like
      formations. The perturbed development of the treated gonads is due to a
      significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells. This suggests that the
      disturbed effect caused by exogenous estradiol may be due to a conflict between
      the gene networks regulated by temperature and the increased level of endogenous 
      estrogens, induced by the treatment. Here, we decided to use fadrozole and
      fulvestrant, an aromatase inhibitor and an estrogen-receptor antagonist,
      respectively, to provide insights into the role played by endogenous estrogens in
      regulating the cell proliferation of the two main gonadal compartments: the
      medullary cords and the cortex. Comparing cell proliferation patterns, our
      current results suggest that the endogenous estrogens are involved in determining
      the sex fate of medullary cords, by repressing proliferation. Interestingly, our 
      results showed that endogenous estradiol levels are unnecessary for the
      thickening of the ovarian cortex.

AB  - The organization of cnidarian nerve nets is traditionally described as diffuse
      with randomly arranged neurites that show minimal reproducibility between
      animals. However, most observations of nerve nets are conducted using
      cross-reactive antibodies that broadly label neurons, which potentially masks
      stereotyped patterns produced by individual neuronal subtypes. Additionally, many
      cnidarians species have overt structures such as a nerve ring, suggesting higher 
      levels of organization and stereotypy exist, but mechanisms that generated that
      stereotypy are unknown. We previously demonstrated that NvLWamide-like is
      expressed in a small subset of the Nematostella nerve net and speculated that
      observing a few neurons within the developing nerve net would provide a better
      indication of potential stereotypy. Here we document NvLWamide-like expression
      more systematically. NvLWamide-like is initially expressed in the typical
      neurogenic salt and pepper pattern within the ectoderm at the gastrula stage, and
      expression expands to include endodermal salt and pepper expression at the
      planula larval stage. Expression persists in both ectoderm and endoderm in
      adults. We characterized our NvLWamide-like::mCherry transgenic reporter line to 
      visualize neural architecture and found that NvLWamide-like is expressed in six
      neural subtypes identifiable by neural morphology and location. Upon completing
      development the numbers of neurons in each neural subtype are minimally variable 
      between animals and the projection patterns of each subtype are consistent.
      Furthermore, between the juvenile polyp and adult stages the number of neurons
      for each subtype increases. We conclude that development of the Nematostella
      nerve net is stereotyped between individuals. Our data also imply that one aspect
      of generating adult cnidarian nervous systems is to modify the basic structural
      architecture generated in the juvenile by increasing neural number proportionally
      with size.

AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is an intracellular N-terminal
      post-proline-cleaving enzyme whose physiological function remains largely

      knock-in mice expressing a catalytically inactive mutant form of DPP9 (S729A;
      DPP9(ki/ki) mice). We show that DPP9(ki/ki) mice die within 12-18h after birth.
      The neonatal lethality can be rescued by manual feeding, indicating that a
      suckling defect is the primary cause of neonatal lethality. The suckling defect
      results from microglossia, and is characterized by abnormal formation of
      intrinsic muscles at the distal tongue. In DPP9(ki/ki) mice, the number of
      occipital somite-derived migratory muscle progenitors, forming distal tongue
      intrinsic muscles, is reduced due to increased apoptosis. In contrast, intrinsic 
      muscles of the proximal tongue and extrinsic tongue muscles, which derive from
      head mesoderm, develop normally in DPP9(ki/ki) mice. Thus, lack of DPP9 activity 
      in mice leads to impaired tongue development, suckling defect and subsequent
      neonatal lethality due to impaired survival of a specific subset of migratory
      tongue muscle progenitors.

AB  - During development in metazoan embryos, the fundamental embryonic axes are
      established by organizing centers that influence the fates of nearby cells. Among
      the spiralians, a large and diverse branch of protostome metazoans, studies have 
      shown that an organizer sets up the dorsal-ventral axis, which arises from one of
      the four basic cell quadrants during development (the dorsal, D quadrant).
      Studies in a few species have also revealed variation in terms of how and when
      the D quadrant and the organizer are established. In some species the D quadrant 
      is specified conditionally, via cell-cell interactions, while in others it is
      specified autonomously, via asymmetric cell divisions (such as those involving
      the formation of polar lobes). The third quartet macromere (3D) typically serves 
      as the spiralian organizer; however, other cells born earlier or later in the D
      quadrant lineage can serve as the organizer, such as the 2d micromere in the
      annelid Capitella teleta or the 4d micromere in the mollusc Crepidula fornicata. 
      Here we present work carried out in the snail C. fornicata to show that
      establishment of a single D quadrant appears to rely on a combination of both
      autonomous (via inheritance of the polar lobe) and conditional mechanisms
      (involving induction via the progeny of the first quartet micromeres). Through
      systematic ablation of cells, we show that D quadrant identity is established
      between 5th and 6th cleavage stages, as it is in other spiralians that use
      conditional specification. Subsequently, following the next cell cycle, organizer
      activity takes place soon after the birth of the 4d micromere. Therefore, unlike 
      the case in other spiralians that use conditional specification, the
      specification of the D quadrant and the activity of the dorso-ventral organizer
      are temporally and spatially uncoupled. We also present data on organizer
      function in naturally-occurring and experimentally-induced twin embryos, which
      possess multiple D quadrants. We show that supernumerary D quadrants can arise in
      C. fornicata (either spontaneously or following polar lobe removal); when
      multiple D quadrants are present these do not exhibit effective organizer
      activity. We conclude that the polar lobe is not required for D quadrant
      specification, though it could play a role in effective organizer activity. We
      also tested whether the inheritance of the small polar lobe by the D quadrant is 
      associated with the ability to laterally inhibit neighboring quadrants by direct 
      contact in order to normally prevent supernumerary organizers from arising.
      Finally, we discuss the variation of spiralian organizers in a phylogenetic
      context.

AB  - Balancing the number of stem cells and their progeny is crucial for tissue
      development and repair. Here we examine how cell numbers and overall muscle size 
      are tightly regulated during zebrafish somitic muscle development. Muscle
      stem/precursor cell (MPCs) expressing Pax7 are initially located in the
      dermomyotome (DM) external cell layer, adopt a highly stereotypical distribution 
      and thereafter a proportion of MPCs migrate into the myotome. Regional variations
      in the proliferation and terminal differentiation of MPCs contribute to growth of
      the myotome. To probe the robustness of muscle size control and spatiotemporal
      regulation of MPCs, we compared the behaviour of wild type (wt) MPCs with those
      in mutant zebrafish that lack the muscle regulatory factor Myod. Myod(fh261)
      mutants form one third fewer multinucleate fast muscle fibres than wt and show a 
      significant expansion of the Pax7(+) MPC population in the DM. Subsequently,
      myod(fh261) mutant fibres generate more cytoplasm per nucleus, leading to
      recovery of muscle bulk. In addition, relative to wt siblings, there is an
      increased number of MPCs in myod(fh261) mutants and these migrate prematurely
      into the myotome, differentiate and contribute to the hypertrophy of existing
      fibres. Thus, homeostatic reduction of the excess MPCs returns their number to
      normal levels, but fibre numbers remain low. The GSK3 antagonist BIO prevents MPC
      migration into the deep myotome, suggesting that canonical Wnt pathway activation
      maintains the DM in zebrafish, as in amniotes. BIO does not, however, block
      recovery of the myod(fh261) mutant myotome, indicating that homeostasis acts on
      fibre intrinsic growth to maintain muscle bulk. The findings suggest the
      existence of a critical window for early fast fibre formation followed by a
      period in which homeostatic mechanisms regulate myotome growth by controlling
      fibre size. The feedback controls we reveal in muscle help explain the extremely 
      precise grading of myotome size along the body axis irrespective of fish size,
      nutrition and genetic variation and may form a paradigm for wider matching of
      organ size.

AB  - Novelty and innovation are fundamental yet relatively understudied concepts in
      evolution. We may study the history and provenance of novelty using
      phylogenetics, where key questions include when evolution occurs by tree-like
      branching and when it occurs by movement of distantly related parts in processes 
      akin to horizontal transfer. Perfectly vertical inheritance, often an assumption 
      of evolutionary trees, requires simultaneous co-duplication of the parts of a
      duplicating or speciating (processes I collectively call 'furcating') biological 
      feature. However, simultaneous co-duplication of many parts usually requires
      variational processes that are rare. Therefore, instead of always being perfectly
      tree-like, evolution often involves events that incorporate or fuse more
      distantly related parts into new units during evolution, which herein I call
      'fusion'. Exon shuffling, horizontal gene transfer, introgression, and co-option 
      are such fusion processes at different levels of organization. The ubiquity of
      processes that fuse distantly related parts has wide ranging implications for the
      study of macroevolution. For one, the central metaphor of a tree of life will
      often be incomplete, to the point where we may consider a different metaphor,
      such as economic public goods, or a 'web of life'. Secondly, we often may need to
      expand commonly used phylogenetic models and methods, highlighting a need for an 
      expansive toolkit for studying evolutionary history. Even though furcation - the 
      splitting and individuation of biological features - does happen, fusion of
      distant parts may often be just as critical for the evolution of novelties, and
      must formally be incorporated into the metaphors, models, and visualization of
      evolutionary history. This will allow us to understand the timing, order of
      appearance, and diversification rates of developmental systems, including cell
      types, organs, behavior, and language, which very commonly evolve through
      co-option.

AB  - Ciliary photoreceptors are a diverse cell type family that comprises the rods and
      cones of the retina and other related cell types such as pineal photoreceptors.
      Ciliary photoreceptor evolution has been dynamic during vertebrate evolution with
      numerous gains and losses of opsin and phototransduction genes, and changes in
      their expression. For example, early mammals lost all but two cone opsins,
      indicating loss of cone receptor types in response to nocturnal lifestyle. Our
      review focuses on the comparison of specifying transcription factors and cell
      type-specific transcriptome data in vertebrate retinae to build and test
      hypotheses on ciliary photoreceptor evolution. Regarding cones, recent data
      reveal that a combination of factors specific for long-wavelength sensitive opsin
      (Lws)- cones in non-mammalian vertebrates (Thrb and Rxrg) is found across all
      differentiating cone photoreceptors in mice. This suggests that mammalian
      ancestors lost all but one ancestral cone type, the Lws-cone. We test this
      hypothesis by a correlation analysis of cone transcriptomes in mouse and chick,
      and find that, indeed, transcriptomes of all mouse cones are most highly
      correlated to avian Lws-cones. These findings underscore the importance of
      specifying transcription factors in tracking cell type evolution, and shed new
      light on the mechanisms of cell type loss and gain in retina evolution.

AB  - We review the development and evolution of the ear neurosensory cells, the
      aggregation of neurosensory cells into an otic placode, the evolution of novel
      neurosensory structures dedicated to hearing and the evolution of novel nuclei in
      the brain and their input dedicated to processing those novel auditory stimuli.
      The evolution of the apparently novel auditory system lies in duplication and
      diversification of cell fate transcription regulation that allows variation at
      the cellular level [transforming a single neurosensory cell into a sensory cell
      connected to its targets by a sensory neuron as well as diversifying hair cells],
      organ level [duplication of organ development followed by diversification and
      novel stimulus acquisition] and brain nuclear level [multiplication of
      transcription factors to regulate various neuron and neuron aggregate fate to
      transform the spinal cord into the unique hindbrain organization]. Tying cell
      fate changes driven by bHLH and other transcription factors into cell and organ
      changes is at the moment tentative as not all relevant factors are known and
      their gene regulatory network is only rudimentary understood. Future research can
      use the blueprint proposed here to provide both the deeper molecular evolutionary
      understanding as well as a more detailed appreciation of developmental networks. 
      This understanding can reveal how an auditory system evolved through
      transformation of existing cell fate determining networks and thus how
      neurosensory evolution occurred through molecular changes affecting cell fate
      decision processes. Appreciating the evolutionary cascade of developmental
      program changes could allow identifying essential steps needed to restore cells
      and organs in the future.

AB  - Nervous systems often consist of a large number of different types of neurons
      which are generated from neural stem and progenitor cells by a series of
      symmetric and asymmetric divisions. The origin and early evolution of these
      neural progenitor systems is not well understood. Here we use a cnidarian model
      organism, Nematostella vectensis, to gain insight into the generation of neural
      cell type diversity in a non-bilaterian animal. We identify NvFoxQ2d as a
      transcription factor that is expressed in a population of spatially restricted,
      proliferating ectodermal cells that are derived from NvSoxB(2)-expressing neural 
      progenitor cells. Using a transgenic reporter line we show that the NvFoxQ2d
      cells undergo a terminal, symmetric division to generate a morphologically
      homogeneous population of putative sensory cells. The abundance of these cells,
      but not their proliferation status is affected by treatment with the
      gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT, suggesting regulation by Notch signalling. Our
      data suggest that intermediate progenitor cells and symmetric divisions
      contribute to the formation of the seemingly simple nervous system of a sea
      anemone.

TI  - Notch and Fgf signaling during electrosensory versus mechanosensory lateral line

AB  - The lateral line system is a useful model for studying the embryonic and
      evolutionary diversification of different organs and cell types. In jawed
      vertebrates, this ancestrally comprises lines of mechanosensory neuromasts over
      the head and trunk, flanked on the head by fields of electrosensory ampullary
      organs, all innervated by lateral line neurons in cranial lateral line ganglia.
      Both types of sense organs, and their afferent neurons, develop from cranial
      lateral line placodes. Current research primarily focuses on the posterior
      lateral line primordium in zebrafish, which migrates as a cell collective along
      the trunk; epithelial rosettes form in the trailing zone and are deposited as a
      line of neuromasts, within which hair cells and supporting cells differentiate.
      However, in at least some other teleosts (e.g. catfishes) and all non-teleosts,
      lines of cranial neuromasts are formed by placodes that elongate to form a
      sensory ridge, which subsequently fragments, with neuromasts differentiating in a
      line along the crest of the ridge. Furthermore, in many non-teleost species,
      electrosensory ampullary organs develop from the flanks of the sensory ridge. It 
      is unknown to what extent the molecular mechanisms underlying neuromast formation
      from the zebrafish migrating posterior lateral line primordium are conserved with
      the as-yet unexplored molecular mechanisms underlying neuromast and ampullary
      organ formation from elongating lateral line placodes. Here, we report
      experiments in an electroreceptive non-teleost ray-finned fish, the Mississippi
      paddlefish Polyodon spathula, that suggest a conserved role for Notch signaling
      in regulating lateral line organ receptor cell number, but potentially divergent 
      roles for the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway, both between neuromasts
      and ampullary organs, and between paddlefish and zebrafish.

AB  - Entero-endocrine cells involved in the regulation of digestive function form a
      large and diverse cell population within the intestinal epithelium of all
      animals. Together with absorptive enterocytes and secretory gland cells,
      entero-endocrine cells are generated by the embryonic endoderm and, in the mature
      animal, from a pool of endoderm derived, self-renewing stem cells.
      Entero-endocrine cells share many structural/functional and developmental
      properties with sensory neurons, which hints at the possibility of an ancient
      evolutionary relationship between these two cell types. We will survey in this
      article recent findings that emphasize the similarities between entero-endocrine 
      cells and sensory neurons in vertebrates and insects, for which a substantial
      volume of data pertaining to the entero-endocrine system has been compiled. We
      will then report new findings that shed light on the specification and
      morphogenesis of entero-endocrine cells in Drosophila. In this system,
      presumptive intestinal stem cells (pISCs), generated during early metamorphosis, 
      undergo several rounds of mitosis that produce the endocrine cells and stem cells
      (ISCs) with which the fly is born. Clonal analysis demonstrated that individual
      pISCs can give rise to endocrine cells expressing different types of peptides.
      Immature endocrine cells start out as unpolarized cells located basally of the
      gut epithelium; they each extend an apical process into the epithelium which
      establishes a junctional complex and apical membrane specializations contacting
      the lumen of the gut. Finally, we show that the Drosophila homolog of ngn3, a
      bHLH gene that defines the entero-endocrine lineage in mammals, is expressed and 
      required for the differentiation of this cell type in the fly gut.

      sponges. Among the genes present in poriferans are those fundamental to the
      sensory and nervous systems of other animals. Sponges are dynamic and sensitive
      animals and it is intuitive to link these genes to behaviour. The proposal that
      ctenophores are the earliest diverging metazoan has led to the question of
      whether sponges possess a 'pre-nervous' system or have undergone nervous system
      loss. Both lines of thought generally assume that the last common ancestor of
      sponges and eumetazoans possessed the genetic modules that underlie sensory
      abilities. By corollary extant sponges may possess a sensory cell homologous to
      one present in the last common ancestor, a hypothesis that has been studied by
      gene expression. We have performed a meta-analysis of all gene expression studies
      published to date to explore whether gene expression is indicative of a feature's
      sensory function. In sponges we find that eumetazoan sensory-neural markers are
      not particularly expressed in structures with known sensory functions. Instead it
      is common for these genes to be expressed in cells with no known or
      uncharacterized sensory function. Indeed, many sensory-neural markers so far
      studied are expressed during development, perhaps because many are transcription 
      factors. This suggests that the genetic signal of a sponge sensory cell is
      dissimilar enough to be unrecognizable when compared to a bilaterian sensory or
      neural cell. It is possible that sensory-neural markers have as yet unknown
      functions in sponge cells, such as assembling an immunological synapse in the
      larval globular cell. Furthermore, the expression of sensory-neural markers in
      non-sensory cells, such as adult and larval epithelial cells, suggest that these 
      cells may have uncharacterized sensory functions. While this does not rule out
      the co-option of ancestral sensory modules in later evolving groups, a distinct
      genetic foundation may underlie the sponge sensory system.

AB  - Regardless of how a nervous system is genetically built, natural selection is
      acting on the functional outcome of its activity. To understand how nervous
      systems evolve, it is essential to analyze how their functional units - the
      neural circuits - change and adapt over time. A neural circuit can evolve in many
      different ways, and the underlying developmental and genetic mechanisms involve
      different sets of genes. Therefore, the comparison of gene expression can help
      reconstructing circuit evolution, as demonstrated by several examples in sensory 
      systems. Functional constraints on neural circuit evolution suggest that in
      nervous systems developmental and genetic variants do not appear randomly, and
      that the evolution of neuroanatomy might be biased. Sensory systems, in
      particular, seem to evolve along trajectories that enhance their evolvability,
      ensuring adaptation to different environments.

AB  - We examine the molecular phylogeny of the proteins underlying the activation
      steps of vertebrate phototransduction, for both agnathan and jawed vertebrate
      taxa. We expand the number of taxa analysed and we update the alignment and tree 
      building methodology from a previous analysis. For each of the four primary
      components (the G-protein transducin alpha subunit, GalphaT, the cyclic GMP
      phosphodiesterase, PDE6, and the alpha and beta subunits of the cGMP-gated ion
      channel, CNGC), the phylogenies appear consistent with expansion from an
      ancestral proto-vertebrate cascade during two rounds of whole-genome duplication 
      followed by divergence of the agnathan and jawed vertebrate lineages. In each
      case, we consider possible scenarios for the underlying gene duplications and
      losses, and we apply relevant constraints to the tree construction. From tests of
      the topology of the resulting trees, we obtain a scenario for the expansion of
      each component during 2R that accurately fits the observations. Similar analysis 
      of the visual opsins indicates that the only expansion to have occurred during 2R
      was the formation of Rh1 and Rh2. Finally, we propose a hypothetical scenario for
      the conversion of an ancestral chordate cascade into the proto-vertebrate
      phototransduction cascade, prior to whole-genome duplication. Together, our
      models provide a plausible account for the origin and expansion of the vertebrate
      phototransduction cascade.

AB  - Precise regulation of the amplitude and duration of receptor tyrosine kinase
      (RTK) signaling is critical for the execution of cellular programs and behaviors.
      Understanding these control mechanisms has important implications for the field
      of developmental biology, and in recent years, the question of how augmentation
      or attenuation of RTK signaling via feedback loops modulates development has
      become of increasing interest. RTK feedback regulation is also important for
      human disease research; for example, germline mutations in genes that encode RTK 
      signaling pathway components cause numerous human congenital syndromes, and
      somatic alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancers.
      In this review, we survey regulators of RTK signaling that tune receptor activity
      and intracellular transduction cascades, with a focus on the roles of these genes
      in the developing embryo. We detail the diverse inhibitory mechanisms utilized by
      negative feedback regulators that, when lost or perturbed, lead to aberrant
      increases in RTK signaling. We also discuss recent biochemical and genetic
      insights into positive regulators of RTK signaling and how these proteins
      function in tandem with negative regulators to guide embryonic development.

AB  - Sex determination pathways are extensively diverse across species, with the
      master sex-determinants being the most variable element. Despite this, there is a
      family of DM-domain transcription factors (Dmrts), which hold a highly conserved 
      function in sexual development. This work is the first to describe a
      heterogametic sex-linked Dmrt in an invertebrate species, the Eastern spiny
      lobster, Sagmariasus verreauxi. We have termed the Y-linked, truncated paralogue 
      of the autosomal iDmrt1, Sv-iDMY. Considering the master sex-determining function
      of both DMY in medaka and DM-W in frog, we hypothesised a similar function of
      Sv-iDMY. By conducting temporal expression analyses during embryogenesis we have 
      identified a putative male sex-determining period during which iDMY>iDmrt1.
      Employing a GAL4-transactivation assay we then demonstrate the dominant negative 
      suppression of iDMY over its autosomal iDmrt1 paralogue, suggesting the mechanism
      with which iDMY determines sex. Comparative analyses of Sv-iDMY, DM-W and medaka 
      DMY, highlight the C'-mediated features of oligomerisation and transactivation as
      central to the mechanism that each exerts. Indeed, these features may underpin
      the plasticity facilitating the convergent emergence of these three sporadic
      sex-linked master-Dmrts.

AB  - Studies of gamete development in the self-fertile hermaphrodites of
      Caenorhabditis elegans have significantly contributed to our understanding of
      fundamental developmental mechanisms. However, evolutionary transitions from
      outcrossing males and females to self-fertile hermaphrodites have convergently
      evolved within multiple nematode sub-lineages, and whether the C. elegans pattern
      of self-fertile hermaphroditism and gamete development is representative remains 
      largely unexplored. Here we describe a pattern of sperm production in the
      trioecious (male/female/hermaphrodite) nematode Rhabditis sp. SB347 (recently
      named Auanema rhodensis) that differs from C. elegans in two striking ways.
      First, while C. elegans hermaphrodites make a one-time switch from sperm to
      oocyte production, R. sp. SB347 hermaphrodites continuously produce both sperm
      and oocytes. Secondly, while C. elegans germ cell proliferation is limited to
      germline stem cells (GSCs), sperm production in R. sp. SB347 includes an
      additional population of mitotically dividing cells that are a developmental
      intermediate between GSCs and fully differentiated spermatocytes. These cells are
      present in males and hermaphrodites but not females, and exhibit key
      characteristics of spermatogonia - the mitotic progenitors of spermatocytes in
      flies and vertebrates. Specifically, they exist outside the stem cell niche,
      increase germ cell numbers by transit-amplifying divisions, and synchronously
      proliferate within germ cell cysts. We also discovered spermatogonia in other
      trioecious Rhabditis species, but not in the male/female species Rhabditis axei
      or the more distant hermaphroditic Oscheius tipulae. The discovery of
      simultaneous hermaphroditism and spermatogonia in a lab-cultivatable nematode
      suggests R. sp. SB347 as a richly informative species for comparative studies of 
      gametogenesis.

AB  - The migration of limb myogenic precursors from limb level somites to their
      ultimate site of differentiation in the limb is a paradigmatic example of a set
      of dynamic and orchestrated migratory cell behaviours. The homeobox containing
      transcription factor ladybird homeobox 1 (Lbx1) is a central regulator of limb
      myoblast migration, null mutations of Lbx1 result in severe disruptions to limb
      muscle formation, particularly in the distal region of the limb in mice (Gross et
      al., 2000). As such Lbx1 has been hypothesized to control lateral migration of
      myoblasts into the distal limb anlage. It acts as a core regulator of the limb
      myoblast migration machinery, controlled by Pax3. A secondary role for Lbx1 in
      the differentiation and commitment of limb musculature has also been proposed
      (Brohmann et al., 2000; Uchiyama et al., 2000). Here we show that lateral
      migration, but not differentiation or commitment of limb myoblasts, is controlled
      by the phosphorylation of three adjacent serine residues of LBX1. Electroporation
      of limb level somites in the chick embryo with a dephosphomimetic form of Lbx1
      results in a specific defect in the lateral migration of limb myoblasts. Although
      the initial delamination and migration of myoblasts is unaffected, migration into
      the distal limb bud is severely disrupted. Interestingly, myoblasts undergo
      normal differentiation independent of their migratory status, suggesting that the
      differentiation potential of hypaxial muscle is not regulated by the
      phosphorylation state of LBX1. Furthermore, we show that FGF8 and ERK mediated
      signal transduction, both critical regulators of the developing limb bud, have
      the capacity to induce the phosphorylation of LBX1 at these residues. Overall,
      this suggests a mechanism whereby the phosphorylation of LBX1, potentially
      through FGF8 and ERK signalling, controls the lateral migration of myoblasts into
      the distal limb bud.

AB  - Germ layer formation and axial patterning are biological processes that are
      tightly linked during embryonic development of most metazoans. In addition to
      canonical WNT, it has been proposed that ERK-MAPK signaling is involved in
      specifying oral as well as aboral territories in cnidarians. However, the
      effector and the molecular mechanism underlying latter phenomenon is unknown. By 
      screening for potential effectors of ERK-MAPK signaling in both domains, we
      identified a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, Nverg that is
      bi-polarily expressed prior to gastrulation. We further describe the crucial role
      of NvERG for gastrulation, endomesoderm as well as apical domain formation. The
      molecular characterization of the obtained NvERG knock-down phenotype using
      previously described as well as novel potential downstream targets, provides
      evidence that a single transcription factor, NvERG, simultaneously controls
      expression of two different sets of downstream targets, leading to two different 
      embryonic gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in opposite poles of the developing
      embryo. We also highlight the molecular interaction of cWNT and MEK/ERK/ERG
      signaling that provides novel insight into the embryonic axial organization of
      Nematostella, and show a cWNT repressive role of MEK/ERK/ERG signaling in
      segregating the endomesoderm in two sub-domains, while a common input of both
      pathways is required for proper apical domain formation. Taking together, we
      build the first blueprint for a global cnidarian embryonic GRN that is the
      foundation for additional gene specific studies addressing the evolution of
      embryonic and larval development.

AB  - During development and throughout adult life, sub-populations of cells exist that
      exhibit phenotypic plasticity - the ability to differentiate into multiple
      lineages. This behaviour is important in embryogenesis, is exhibited in a more
      limited context by adult stem cells, and can be re-activated in cancer cells to
      drive important processes underlying tumour progression. A well-studied mechanism
      of phenotypic plasticity is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
      process which has been observed in both normal and cancerous cells. The
      epigenetic and metabolic modifications necessary to facilitate phenotypic
      plasticity are first seen in development and can be re-activated both in normal
      regeneration and in cancer. In cancer, the re-activation of these mechanisms
      enables tumour cells to acquire a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype with enhanced 
      ability to survive in hostile environments, resist therapeutic interventions, and
      undergo metastasis. However, recent research has suggested that plasticity may
      also expose weaknesses in cancer cells that could be exploited for future
      therapeutic development. More research is needed to identify developmental
      mechanisms that are active in cancer, so that these may be targeted to reduce
      tumour growth and metastasis and overcome therapeutic resistance.

AB  - Although highly regulated cell cycle behavior accompanies specification of cell
      types in the Drosophila retina, no evidence has previously existed that cell
      cycle phase influences cell fate choice. Meserve and Duronio have now used
      genetic techniques to trace the fate of a sub-population of cells that accumulate
      in G2-phase of the cell cycle, discovering that they contribute to a particular
      fate, the precursor of the sensory inter-ommatidial bristles. Meserve and Duronio
      further show that G2 cells have an advantage acquiring inter-ommatidial bristle
      fate. This is the first evidence for a functional contribution of cell cycle
      phase to cell fate determination in the Drosophila eye and indicates that the
      fate of one population of retinal cells is established much earlier than
      previously recognized, during the larval stages when cell-cell interactions
      influence cell cycle phase. Inter-ommatidial bristle fate had been thought to
      arise much later, in the pupal stage, and models for how these neuronal eye
      structures arise will now have to be revised.

AB  - A mechanistic dissection of early oocyte differentiation in vertebrates is key to
      advancing our knowledge of germline development, reproductive biology, the
      regulation of meiosis, and all of their associated disorders. Recent advances in 
      the field include breakthroughs in the identification of germline stem cells in
      Medaka, in the cellular architecture of the germline cyst in mice, in a
      mechanistic dissection of chromosomal pairing and bouquet formation in meiosis in
      mice, in tracing oocyte symmetry breaking to the chromosomal bouquet of meiosis
      in zebrafish, and in the biology of the Balbiani body, a universal oocyte
      granule. Many of the major events in early oogenesis are universally conserved,
      and some are co-opted for species-specific needs. The chromosomal events of
      meiosis are of tremendous consequence to gamete formation and have been
      extensively studied. New light is now being shed on other aspects of early oocyte
      differentiation, which were traditionally considered outside the scope of
      meiosis, and their coordination with meiotic events. The emerging theme is of
      meiosis as a common groundwork for coordinating multifaceted processes of oocyte 
      differentiation. In an accompanying manuscript we describe methods that allowed
      for investigations in the zebrafish ovary to contribute to these breakthroughs.
      Here, we review these advances mostly from the zebrafish and mouse. We discuss
      oogenesis concepts across established model organisms, and construct an inclusive
      paradigm for early oocyte differentiation in vertebrates.

AB  - Cell cycle progression and differentiation are highly coordinated during the
      development of multicellular organisms. The mechanisms by which these processes
      are coordinated and how their coordination contributes to normal development are 
      not fully understood. Here, we determine the developmental fate of a population
      of precursor cells in the developing Drosophila melanogaster retina that arrest
      in G2 phase of the cell cycle and investigate whether cell cycle phase-specific
      arrest influences the fate of these cells. We demonstrate that retinal precursor 
      cells that arrest in G2 during larval development are selected as sensory organ
      precursors (SOPs) during pupal development and undergo two cell divisions to
      generate the four-cell interommatidial mechanosensory bristles. While G2 arrest
      is not required for bristle development, preventing G2 arrest results in
      incorrect bristle positioning in the adult eye. We conclude that G2-arrested
      cells provide a positional cue during development to ensure proper spacing of
      bristles in the eye. Our results suggest that the control of cell cycle
      progression refines cell fate decisions and that the relationship between these
      two processes is not necessarily deterministic.

AB  - The transition to flowering marks a key adaptive developmental switch in plants
      which impacts on their survival and fitness. Different signaling pathways control
      the floral transition, conveying both endogenous and environmental cues. These
      cues are often relayed and/or modulated by different hormones, which might confer
      additional developmental flexibility to the floral process in the face of varying
      conditions. Among the different hormonal pathways, the phytohormone gibberellic
      acid (GA) plays a dominant role. GA is connected with the other floral pathways
      through the GA-regulated DELLA proteins, acting as versatile interacting modules 
      for different signaling proteins. In this review, I will highlight the role of
      DELLAs as spatial and temporal modulators of different consolidated floral
      pathways. Next, building on recent data, I will provide an update on some
      emerging themes connecting other hormone signaling cascades to flowering time
      control. I will finally provide examples for some established as well as
      potential cross-regulatory mechanisms between hormonal pathways mediated by the
      DELLA proteins.

AB  - Intracellular Ca(2+) signaling regulates cellular activities during embryogenesis
      and in adult organisms. We generated stable Tg[betaactin2:GCaMP6s](stl351) and
      Tg[ubi:GCaMP6s](stl352) transgenic lines that combine the ubiquitously-expressed 
      Ca(2+) indicator GCaMP6s with the transparent characteristics of zebrafish
      embryos to achieve superior in vivo Ca(2+) imaging. Using the
      Tg[betaactin2:GCaMP6s](stl351) line featuring strong GCaMP6s expression from
      cleavage through gastrula stages, we detected higher frequency of Ca(2+)
      transients in the superficial blastomeres during the blastula stages preceding
      the midblastula transition. Additionally, GCaMP6s also revealed that
      dorsal-biased Ca(2+) signaling that follows the midblastula transition persisted 
      longer during gastrulation, compared with earlier studies. We observed that
      dorsal-biased Ca(2+) signaling is diminished in ventralized ichabod/beta-catenin2
      mutant embryos and ectopically induced in embryos dorsalized by excess
      beta-catenin. During gastrulation, we directly visualized Ca(2+) signaling in the
      dorsal forerunner cells, which form in a Nodal signaling dependent manner and
      later give rise to the laterality organ. We found that excess Nodal increases the
      number and the duration of Ca(2+) transients specifically in the dorsal
      forerunner cells. The GCaMP6s transgenic lines described here enable
      unprecedented visualization of dynamic Ca(2+) events from embryogenesis through
      adulthood, augmenting the zebrafish toolbox.

AB  - Oocyte differentiation is a highly dynamic and intricate developmental process
      whose mechanistic understanding advances female reproduction, fertility, and
      ovarian cancer biology. Despite the many attributes of the zebrafish model, it
      has yet to be fully exploited for the investigation of early oocyte
      differentiation and ovarian development. This is partly because the properties of
      the adult zebrafish ovary make it technically challenging to access early stage
      oocytes. As a result, characterization of these stages has been lacking and tools
      for their analysis have been insufficient. To overcome these technical hurdles,
      we took advantage of the juvenile zebrafish ovary, where early stage oocytes can 
      readily be found in high numbers and progress in a predictable manner. We
      characterized the earliest stages of oocyte differentiation and ovarian
      development and defined accurate staging criteria. We further developed protocols
      for quantitative microscopy, live time-lapse imaging, ovarian culture, and
      isolation of stage-specific oocytes for biochemical analysis. These methods have 
      recently provided us with an unprecedented view of early oogenesis, allowing us
      to study formation of the Balbiani body, a universal oocyte granule that is
      associated with oocyte survival in mice and required for oocyte and egg polarity 
      in fish and frogs. Despite its tremendous developmental significance, the Bb has 
      been little investigated and how it forms was unknown in any species for over two
      centuries. We were able to trace Balbiani body formation and oocyte symmetry
      breaking to the onset of meiosis. Through this investigation we revealed novel
      cytoskeletal structures in oocytes and the contribution of specialized cellular
      organization to differentiation. Overall, the juvenile zebrafish ovary arises as 
      an exciting model for studies of cell and developmental biology. We review these 
      and other recent advances in vertebrate oogenesis in an accompanying manuscript
      in this issue of Developmental Biology. Here, we describe the protocols for
      ovarian investigation that we developed in the zebrafish, including all
      experimental steps that will easily allow others to reproduce such analysis. This
      juvenile ovary toolbox also contributes to establishing the zebrafish as a model 
      for post-larval developmental stages.

AB  - Arginylation is an emerging protein modification mediated by arginyltransferase
      ATE1, shown to regulate embryogenesis and actin cytoskeleton, however its
      functions in different physiological systems are not well understood. Here we
      analyzed the role of ATE1 in brain development and neuronal growth by producing a
      conditional mouse knockout with Ate1 deletion in the nervous system driven by
      Nestin promoter (Nes-Ate1 mice). These mice were weaker than wild type, resulting
      in low postnatal survival rates, and had abnormalities in the brain that
      suggested defects in neuronal migration. Cultured Ate1 knockout neurons showed a 
      reduction in the neurite outgrowth and the levels of doublecortin and F-actin in 
      the growth cones. In wild type, ATE1 prominently localized to the growth cones,
      in addition to the cell bodies. Examination of the Ate1 mRNA sequence reveals the
      existence of putative zipcode-binding sequences involved in mRNA targeting to the
      cell periphery and local translation at the growth cones. Fluorescence in situ
      hybridization showed that Ate1 mRNA localized to the tips of the growth cones,
      likely due to zipcode-mediated targeting, and this localization coincided with
      spots of localization of arginylated beta-actin, which disappeared in the
      presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. We propose that zipcode-mediated
      co-targeting of Ate1 and beta-actin mRNA leads to localized co-translational
      arginylation of beta-actin that drives the growth cone migration and neurite
      outgrowth.

TI  - Loss of zinc finger MYND-type containing 10 (zmynd10) affects cilia integrity and
      axonemal localization of dynein arms, resulting in ciliary dysmotility,
      polycystic kidney and scoliosis in medaka (Oryzias latipes).

AB  - Cilia and flagella are hair-like organelles that project from the cell surface
      and play important roles in motility and sensory perception. Motility defects in 
      cilia and flagella lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare human
      disease. Recently zinc finger MYND-type containing 10 (ZMYND10) was identified in
      humans as a PCD-associated gene. In this study, we use medaka fish as a model to 
      characterize the precise functions of zmynd10. In medaka, zmynd10 is exclusively 
      expressed in cells with motile cilia. Embryos with zmynd10 Morpholino knockdown
      exhibited a left-right (LR) defect associated with loss of motility in Kupffer's 
      vesicle (KV) cilia. This immotility was caused by loss of the outer dynein arms, 
      which is a characteristic ultrastructural phenotype in PCD. In addition, KV cilia
      in zmynd10 knockdown embryos had a swollen and wavy morphology. Together, these
      results suggest that zmynd10 is a multi-functional protein that has independent
      roles in axonemal localization of dynein arms and in formation and/or maintenance
      of cilia. The C-terminal region of zmynd10 has a MYND-type zinc finger domain
      (zf-MYND) that is important for its function. Our rescue experiment showed that
      the zmynd10-DeltaC truncated protein, which lacks zf-MYND, was still partially
      functional, suggesting that zmynd10 has another functional domain besides
      zf-MYND. To analyze the later stages of development, we generated a zmynd10
      knockout mutant using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)
      technology. Adult mutants exhibited sperm dysmotility, scoliosis and progressive 
      polycystic kidney.

AB  - Scavenger receptors class B (SR-B) are multifunctional transmembrane proteins,
      which in vertebrates participate in lipid transport, pathogen clearance,
      lysosomal delivery and intracellular sorting. Drosophila has 14 SR-B members
      whose functions are still largely unknown. Here, we reveal a novel role for the
      SR-B family member Debris buster (Dsb) in Drosophila airway physiology. Larvae
      lacking dsb show yeast avoidance behavior, hypoxia, and severe growth defects
      associated with impaired elongation and integrity along the airways. Furthermore,
      in dsb mutant embryos, the barrier function of the posterior spiracles, which are
      critical for gas exchange, is not properly established and liquid clearance is
      locally impaired at the spiracular lumen. We found that Dsb is specifically
      expressed in a group of distal epithelial cells of the posterior spiracle organ
      and not throughout the entire airways. Furthermore, tissue-specific knockdown and
      rescue experiments demonstrate that Dsb function in the airways is only required 
      in the posterior spiracles. Dsb localizes in intracellular vesicles, and a subset
      of these associate with lysosomes. However, we found that depletion of proteins
      involved in vesicular transport to the apical membrane, but not in lysosomal
      function, causes dsb-like airway elongation defects. We propose a model in which 
      Dsb sorts components of the apical extracellular matrix which are essential for
      airway physiology. Since SR-B LIMP2-deficient mice show reduced expression of
      several apical plasma membrane proteins, sorting of proteins to the apical
      membrane is likely an evolutionary conserved function of Dsb and LIMP2. Our data 
      provide insights into a spatially confined function of the SR-B Dsb in
      intracellular trafficking critical for the physiology of the whole tubular airway
      network.

AB  - GW182 (also known asTNRC6) family members are critically involved in the final
      effector phase of miRNA-mediated mRNA repression. The three mammalian paralogs,
      TNRC6a, b and c, are thought to be redundant based on Argonaute (Ago) binding,
      tethering assays, and RNAi silencing of individual members in cell lines. To test
      this idea, we generated TNRC6a, b and c knockout mice. TNRC6a mutants die at
      mid-gestation, while b- and c- deleted mice are born at a Mendelian ratio.
      However, the majority of TNRC6b and all TNRC6c mutants die within 24h after
      birth, the latter with respiratory failure. Necropsy of TNRC6c mutants revealed
      normal-appearing airways that give rise to abnormally thick-walled distal gas
      exchange sacs. Immunohistological analysis of mutant lungs demonstrated a normal 
      distribution of bronchiolar and alveolar cells, indicating that loss of TNRC6c
      did not abrogate epithelial cell differentiation. The cellular kinetics and
      relative proportions of endothelial, epithelial, and mesenchymal cells were also 
      not altered. However, the underlying capillary network was simplified and
      endothelial cells had failed to become tightly apposed to the surface epithelium 
      in TNRC6c mutants, presumably causing the observed respiratory failure. TGFbeta
      family mutant mice exhibit a similar lung phenotype of thick-walled air sacs and 
      neonatal lethality, and qRT-PCR confirmed dynamic downregulation of TGFbeta1 and 
      TGFbetaR2 in TNRC6c mutant lungs during sacculation. VEGFR, but not VEGF-A
      ligand, was also lower, likely reflecting the overall reduced capillary density
      in TNRC6c mutants. Together, these results demonstrate that GW182 paralogs are
      not functionally redundant in vivo. Surprisingly, despite regulating a general
      cellular process, TNRC6c is selectively required only in the distal lung and not 
      until late in gestation for proper expression of the TGFbeta family genes that
      drive sacculation. These results imply a complex and indirect mode of regulation 
      of sacculation by TNRC6c, mediated in part by dynamic transcriptional repression 
      of an inhibitor of TGFbeta family gene expression.

AB  - During vertebrate embryogenesis, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and primitive
      erythrocytes become specified within close proximity in the posterior lateral
      plate mesoderm (LPM) from a common progenitor. However, the signaling cascades
      regulating the specification into either lineage remain largely elusive. Here, we
      analyze the contribution of beta-catenin dependent Wnt signaling to EC and
      erythrocyte specification during zebrafish embryogenesis. We generated novel
      beta-catenin dependent Wnt signaling reporters which, by using destabilized
      fluorophores (Venus-Pest, dGFP), specifically allow us to detect Wnt signaling
      responses in narrow time windows as well as in spatially restricted domains,
      defined by Cre recombinase expression (Tg(axin2BAC:Venus-Pest)(mu288);
      Tg(14TCF:loxP-STOP-loxP-dGFP)(mu202)). We therefore can detect beta-catenin
      dependent Wnt signaling activity in a subset of the Fli1a-positive progenitor
      population. Additionally, we show that mesodermal Wnt3a-mediated signaling via
      the transcription factor Lef1 positively regulates EC specification (defined by
      kdrl expression) at the expense of primitive erythrocyte specification (defined
      by gata1 expression) in zebrafish embryos. Using mesoderm derived from human
      embryonic stem cells, we identified the same principle of Wnt signaling dependent
      EC specification in conjunction with auto-upregulation of LEF1. Our data indicate
      a novel role of beta-catenin dependent Wnt signaling in regulating EC
      specification during vasculogenesis.

AB  - Chordates are characterised by contractile muscle on either side of the body that
      promotes movement by side-to-side undulation. In the lineage leading to modern
      jawed vertebrates (crown group gnathostomes), this system was refined: body
      muscle became segregated into distinct dorsal (epaxial) and ventral (hypaxial)
      components that are separately innervated by the medial and hypaxial motors
      column, respectively, via the dorsal and ventral ramus of the spinal nerves. This
      allows full three-dimensional mobility, which in turn was a key factor in their
      evolutionary success. How the new gnathostome system is established during
      embryogenesis and how it may have evolved in the ancestors of modern vertebrates 
      is not known. Vertebrate Engrailed genes have a peculiar expression pattern as
      they temporarily demarcate a central domain of the developing musculature at the 
      epaxial-hypaxial boundary. Moreover, they are the only genes known with this
      particular expression pattern. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
      Engrailed genes control epaxial-hypaxial muscle development and innervation.
      Investigating chick, mouse and zebrafish as major gnathostome model organisms, we
      found that the Engrailed expression domain was associated with the establishment 
      of the epaxial-hypaxial boundary of muscle in all three species. Moreover, the
      outgrowing epaxial and hypaxial nerves orientated themselves with respect to this
      Engrailed domain. In the chicken, loss and gain of Engrailed function changed
      epaxial-hypaxial somite patterning. Importantly, in all animals studied, loss and
      gain of Engrailed function severely disrupted the pathfinding of the spinal motor
      axons, suggesting that Engrailed plays an evolutionarily conserved role in the
      separate innervation of vertebrate epaxial-hypaxial muscle.

TI  - MGL-1 on AIY neurons translates starvation to reproductive plasticity via
      neuropeptide signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.

AB  - Reproductive plasticity is the ability of an animal to modulate its reproductive 
      functions in response to environmental changes. For example, Caenorhabditis
      elegans, a free-living nematode, can adjust the onsets of oogenesis and
      embryogenesis under harsh environmental conditions, including starvation.
      However, the molecular mechanisms used to perceive and translate environmental
      signals into reproductive functional adjustments remain largely uncharacterized. 
      We discovered that in C. elegans, the glutamate receptor homolog MGL-1 initiated 
      reproductive plasticity in response to starvation. A genetic analysis of the
      mutant gene, mgl-1(tm1811), suggested that starvation delayed the onsets of
      oogenesis and embryogenesis via MGL-1. Cell-specific rescues of mgl-1 deletion
      mutants, which used transgenic lines designed to express MGL-1 in different
      neurons (e.g., RMD, AIA, AIY, and NSM), suggested that only AIY-rescued animals
      exhibited normal delays in oogenesis and embryogenesis equivalent to those of
      wild-type animals, suggesting recovery. Furthermore, in AIY neurons, MGL-1
      appears to use neuropeptide signaling, rather than glutamate, to translate
      starvation stimuli into delayed oogenesis and embryogenesis. Our findings, which 
      reveal molecular linkages between starvation signals and reproductive
      alterations, may provide a basis for understanding energy reallocation
      mechanisms, as the mgl-1 deletion mutant exhibited more severe reductions in
      lifespan and fat accumulation than did wild-type animals under starvation
      conditions. Taken together, MGL-1 is the molecular driver underlying the
      translation of starvation signals to reproduction plasticity in an AIY
      neuron-specific manner.

AB  - Sensory organ glia surround neuronal receptive endings (NREs), forming a
      specialized compartment important for neuronal activity, and reminiscent of
      glia-ensheathed synapses in the central nervous system. We previously showed that
      DAF-6, a Patched-related protein, is required in glia of the C. elegans amphid
      sensory organ to restrict sensory compartment size. LIT-1, a Nemo-like kinase,
      and SNX-1, a retromer component, antagonize DAF-6 and promote compartment
      expansion. To further explore the machinery underlying compartment size control, 
      we sought genes whose inactivation restores normal compartment size to daf-6
      mutants. We found that mutations in igdb-2, encoding a single-pass transmembrane 
      protein containing Ig-like and fibronectin type III domains, suppress daf-6
      mutant defects. IGDB-2 acts in glia, where it localizes to glial membranes
      surrounding NREs, and, together with LIT-1 and SNX-1, regulates compartment
      morphogenesis. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry demonstrates
      that IGDB-2 binds to LGC-34, a predicted ligand-gated ion channel, and lgc-34
      mutations inhibit igdb-2 suppression of daf-6. Our findings reveal a novel
      membrane protein complex and suggest possible mechanisms for how sensory
      compartment size is controlled.

AB  - Although having great potential for live cell imaging to address numerous cell
      biological questions with high spatial and temporal resolution, primary cell
      cultures of zebrafish embryos are not widely used. We present an easy-to-use
      protocol for preparing primary cell cultures of 2 dpf zebrafish embryos allowing 
      for live cell imaging of fully differentiated cells such as neurons and myocytes.
      We demonstrate that different cell types can be identified by morphology and
      expression of transgenic cell type-specific fluorescent reporters and that
      fluorescent cells can be sorted by flow cytometry to prepare an enriched culture.
      To facilitate subcellular imaging in live primary cells, we successfully tested a
      selection of fluorescent vital dyes. Most importantly, we demonstrate that
      zebrafish primary cells can be transfected efficiently with expression constructs
      allowing for visualizing subcellular structures with fluorescent marker proteins 
      for time lapse imaging. We propose zebrafish primary cell culture as a versatile 
      tool to address cell biological questions in combination with a powerful in vivo 
      model.

AB  - Tctn1, Tctn2, and Tctn3 are membrane proteins that localize at the transition
      zone of primary cilia. Tctn1 and Tctn2 mutations have been reported in both
      humans and mice, but Tctn3 mutations have been reported only in humans. It is
      also not clear whether the three Tctn proteins are functionally conserved with
      respect to ciliogenesis and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. In the present study, we
      report that loss of Tctn3 gene function in mice results in a decrease in
      ciliogenesis and Hh signaling. Consistent with this, Tctn3 mutant mice exhibit
      holoprosencephaly and randomized heart looping and lack the floor plate in the
      neural tube, the phenotypes similar to those of Tctn1 and Tctn2 mutants. We also 
      show that overexpression of Tctn3, but not Tctn1 or Tctn2, can rescue
      ciliogenesis in Tctn3 mutant cells. Similarly, replacement of Tctn3 with Tctn1 or
      Tctn2 in the Tctn3 gene locus results in reduced ciliogenesis and Hh signaling,
      holoprosencephaly, and randomized heart looping. Surprisingly, however, the
      neural tube patterning and the proteolytic processing of Gli3 (a transcription
      regulator for Hh signaling) into a repressor, both of which are usually impaired 
      in ciliary gene mutants, are normal. These results suggest that Tctn1, Tctn2, and
      Tctn3 are functionally divergent with respect to their role in ciliogenesis and
      Hh signaling but conserved in neural tube patterning and Gli3 processing.

AB  - A tight regulation of neuron production is required to generate a functional
      cerebral cortex and is achieved by a proper balance between proliferation and
      differentiation of progenitor cells. Though the vitamin A (retinol) active
      derivative retinoic acid (RA) has been implicated as one of the signals acting
      during mammalian forebrain neurogenesis, its function at the onset of
      neurogenesis as well as during establishment of cortical layers and neuronal
      subtypes remains elusive. One limitation is that murine mutants for genes
      encoding key enzymes involved in RA synthesis die during early embryonic
      development. We analysed corticogenesis in Rdh10 null mutants, in which an RA
      deficiency is generated as the intracellular retinol to retinaldehyde conversion 
      is abolished. When analysed at the latest stage before lethality occurs
      (embryonic day [E]13.5), the mutants show smaller telencephalic vesicles and the 
      thickness of their cortical plate is strongly reduced. The first progenitors
      formed in the cortical plate are radial glial (RG) cells which generate neurons
      either directly, or through an indirect mechanism involving the production of
      intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs) which then give rise to neurons. We show
      that in absence of RA, the RG progenitors proliferate less and prematurely
      produce neurons, leading to their depletion at E11.5. Furthermore, we could
      demonstrate that lack of RA impairs the generation of INPs at E13.5 and affects
      the cell cycle exit of progenitor cells during corticogenesis, altogether leading
      to a deficit in projection neurons and to microcephaly.

AB  - Distal outgrowth, maturation and remodeling of the endocardial cushion mesenchyme
      in the atrioventricular (AV) canal are the essential morphogenetic events during 
      four-chambered heart formation. Mesenchymalized AV endocardial cushions give rise
      to the AV valves and the membranous ventricular septum (VS). Failure of these
      processes results in several human congenital heart defects. Despite this
      clinical relevance, the mechanisms governing how mesenchymalized AV endocardial
      cushions mature and remodel into the membranous VS and AV valves have only begun 
      to be elucidated. The role of BMP signaling in the myocardial and secondary heart
      forming lineage has been well studied; however, little is known about the role of
      BMP2 expression in the endocardial lineage. To fill this knowledge gap, we
      generated Bmp2 endocardial lineage-specific conditional knockouts (referred to as
      Bmp2 cKO(Endo)) by crossing conditionally-targeted Bmp2(flox/flox) mice with a
      Cre-driver line, Nfatc1(Cre), wherein Cre-mediated recombination was restricted
      to the endocardial cells and their mesenchymal progeny. Bmp2 cKO(Endo) mouse
      embryos did not exhibit failure or delay in the initial AV endocardial cushion
      formation at embryonic day (ED) 9.5-11.5; however, significant reductions in AV
      cushion size were detected in Bmp2 cKO(Endo) mouse embryos when compared to
      control embryos at ED13.5 and ED16.5. Moreover, deletion of Bmp2 from the
      endocardial lineage consistently resulted in membranous ventricular septal
      defects (VSDs), and mitral valve deficiencies, as evidenced by the absence of
      stratification of mitral valves at birth. Muscular VSDs were not found in Bmp2
      cKO(Endo) mouse hearts. To understand the underlying morphogenetic mechanisms
      leading to a decrease in cushion size, cell proliferation and cell death were
      examined for AV endocardial cushions. Phospho-histone H3 analyses for cell
      proliferation and TUNEL assays for apoptotic cell death did not reveal
      significant differences between control and Bmp2 cKO(Endo) in AV endocardial
      cushions. However, mRNA expression of the extracellular matrix components,
      versican, Has2, collagen 9a1, and periostin was significantly reduced in Bmp2
      cKO(Endo) AV cushions. Expression of transcription factors implicated in the
      cardiac valvulogenesis, Snail2, Twist1 and Sox9, was also significantly reduced
      in Bmp2 cKO(Endo) AV cushions. These data provide evidence that BMP2 expression
      in the endocardial lineage is essential for the distal outgrowth, maturation and 
      remodeling of AV endocardial cushions into the normal membranous VS and the
      stratified AV valves.

AB  - The axons of developing neurons travel long distances along stereotyped pathways 
      under the direction of extracellular cues sensed by the axonal growth cone.
      Guidance cues are either secreted proteins that diffuse freely or bind the
      extracellular matrix, or membrane-anchored proteins. Different populations of
      axons express distinct sets of receptors for guidance cues, which results in
      differential responses to specific ligands. The full repertoire of axon guidance 
      cues and receptors and the identity of the tissues producing these cues remain to
      be elucidated. The meninges are connective tissue layers enveloping the
      vertebrate brain and spinal cord that serve to protect the central nervous system
      (CNS). The meninges also instruct nervous system development by regulating the
      generation and migration of neural progenitors, but it has not been determined
      whether they help guide axons to their targets. Here, we investigate a possible
      role for the meninges in neuronal wiring. Using mouse neural tissue explants, we 
      show that developing spinal cord meninges produce secreted attractive and
      repulsive cues that can guide multiple types of axons in vitro. We find that
      motor and sensory neurons, which project axons across the CNS-peripheral nervous 
      system (PNS) boundary, are attracted by meninges. Conversely, axons of both ipsi-
      and contralaterally projecting dorsal spinal cord interneurons are repelled by
      meninges. The responses of these axonal populations to the meninges are
      consistent with their trajectories relative to meninges in vivo, suggesting that 
      meningeal guidance factors contribute to nervous system wiring and control which 
      axons are able to traverse the CNS-PNS boundary.

AB  - Steroid hormones regulate life stage transitions, allowing animals to
      appropriately follow a developmental timeline. During insect development, the
      steroid hormone ecdysone is synthesized and released in a regulated manner by the
      prothoracic gland (PG) and then hydroxylated to the active molting hormone,
      20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), in peripheral tissues. We manipulated ecdysteroid
      titers, through temporally controlled over-expression of the
      ecdysteroid-inactivating enzyme, CYP18A1, in the PG using the GeneSwitch-GAL4
      system in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We monitored expression of a
      20E-inducible glue protein gene, Salivary gland secretion 3 (Sgs3), using a
      Sgs3:GFP fusion transgene. In wild type larvae, Sgs3-GFP expression is activated 
      at the midpoint of the third larval instar stage in response to the rising
      endogenous level of 20E. By first knocking down endogenous 20E levels during
      larval development and then feeding 20E to these larvae at various stages, we
      found that Sgs3-GFP expression could be triggered at an inappropriate
      developmental stage after a certain time lag. This stage-precocious activation of
      Sgs3 required expression of the Broad-complex, similar to normal Sgs3
      developmental regulation, and a small level of nutritional input. We suggest that
      these studies provide evidence for a tissue-autonomic regulatory system for a
      metamorphic event independent from the primary 20E driven developmental
      progression.

AB  - The canonical model for netrin1 function proposed that it acted as a long-range
      chemotropic axon guidance cue. In the developing spinal cord, floor-plate
      (FP)-derived netrin1 was thought to act as a diffusible attractant to draw
      commissural axons to the ventral midline. However, our recent studies have shown 
      that netrin1 is dispensable in the FP for axon guidance. We have rather found
      that netrin1 acts locally: netrin1 is produced by neural progenitor cells (NPCs) 
      in the ventricular zone (VZ), and deposited on the pial surface as a haptotactic 
      adhesive substrate that guides Dcc(+) axon growth. Here, we further demonstrate
      that this netrin1 pial-substrate has an early role orienting pioneering spinal
      axons, directing them to extend ventrally. However, as development proceeds,
      commissural axons choose to grow around a boundary of netrin1 expressing cells in
      VZ, instead of continuing to extend alongside the netrin1 pial-substrate in the
      ventral spinal cord. This observation suggests netrin1 may supply a more complex 
      activity than pure adhesion, with netrin1-expressing cells also supplying a
      growth boundary for axons. Supporting this possibility, we have observed that
      additional domains of netrin1 expression arise adjacent to the dorsal root entry 
      zone (DREZ) in E12.5 mice that are also required to sculpt axonal growth.
      Together, our studies suggest that netrin1 provides "hederal" boundaries: a local
      growth substrate that promotes axon extension, while also preventing local
      innervation of netrin1-expressing domains.

AB  - Embryonic development evolves by balancing stringent morphological constraints
      with genetic and environmental variation. The design principle that allows
      developmental transcriptional programs to conserve embryonic morphology while
      adapting to environmental changes is still not fully understood. To address this 
      fundamental challenge, we compare developmental transcriptomes of two sea urchin 
      species, Paracentrotus lividus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, that shared a
      common ancestor about 40 million years ago and are geographically distant yet
      show similar morphology. We find that both developmental and housekeeping genes
      show highly dynamic and strongly conserved temporal expression patterns. The
      expression of other gene sets, including homeostasis and response genes, show
      divergent expression which could result from either evolutionary drift or
      adaptation to local environmental conditions. The interspecies correlations of
      developmental gene expressions are highest between morphologically similar
      developmental time points whereas the interspecies correlations of housekeeping
      gene expression are high between all the late zygotic time points. Relatedly, the
      position of the phylotypic stage varies between these two groups of genes:
      developmental gene expression shows highest conservation at mid-developmental
      stage, in agreement with the hourglass model while the conservation of
      housekeeping genes keeps increasing with developmental time. When all genes are
      combined, the relationship between conservation of gene expression and
      morphological similarity is partially masked by housekeeping genes and genes with
      diverged expression. Our study illustrates various transcriptional programs that 
      coexist in the developing embryo and evolve under different constraints.
      Apparently, morphological constraints underlie the conservation of developmental 
      gene expression while embryonic fitness requires the conservation of housekeeping
      gene expression and the species-specific adjustments of homeostasis gene
      expression. The distinct evolutionary forces acting on these transcriptional
      programs enable the conservation of similar body plans while allowing adaption.

AB  - Development of the central nervous system requires orchestration of morphogenetic
      processes which drive elevation and apposition of the neural folds and their
      fusion into a neural tube. The newly formed tube gives rise to the brain in
      anterior regions and continues to develop into the spinal cord posteriorly.
      Conspicuous differences between the anterior and posterior neural tube become
      visible already during neural tube closure (NTC). Planar cell polarity
      (PCP)-mediated convergent extension (CE) movements are restricted to the
      posterior neural plate, i.e. hindbrain and spinal cord, where they propagate
      neural fold apposition. The lack of CE in the anterior neural plate correlates
      with a much slower mode of neural fold apposition anteriorly. The morphogenetic
      processes driving anterior NTC have not been addressed in detail. Here, we report
      a novel role for the breast cancer susceptibility gene and microtubule (MT)
      binding protein Hmmr (Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor, RHAMM) in anterior
      neurulation and forebrain development in Xenopus laevis. Loss of hmmr function
      resulted in a lack of telencephalic hemisphere separation, arising from defective
      roof plate formation, which in turn was caused by impaired neural tissue
      narrowing. hmmr regulated polarization of neural cells, a function which was
      dependent on the MT binding domains. hmmr cooperated with the core PCP component 
      vangl2 in regulating cell polarity and neural morphogenesis. Disrupted cell
      polarization and elongation in hmmr and vangl2 morphants prevented radial
      intercalation (RI), a cell behavior essential for neural morphogenesis. Our
      results pinpoint a novel role of hmmr in anterior neural development and support 
      the notion that RI is a major driving force for anterior neurulation and
      forebrain morphogenesis.

AB  - Patterning of the vertebrate eye into optic stalk, retinal pigment epithelium
      (RPE) and neural retina (NR) territories relies on a number of signaling
      pathways, but how these signals are interpreted by optic progenitors is not well 
      understood. The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that is essential
      for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, but it has also been implicated in the regulation of
      other signaling pathways. Here, we show that the optic primordium is ciliated
      during early eye development and that ciliogenesis is essential for proper
      patterning and morphogenesis of the mouse eye. Ift172 mutants fail to generate
      primary cilia and exhibit patterning defects that resemble those of Gli3 mutants,
      suggesting that cilia are required to restrict Hh activity during eye formation. 
      Ift122 mutants, which produce cilia with abnormal morphology, generate optic
      vesicles that fail to invaginate to produce the optic cup. These mutants also
      lack formation of the lens, RPE and NR. Such phenotypic features are accompanied 
      by strong, ectopic Hh pathway activity, evidenced by altered gene expression
      patterns. Removal of GLI2 from Ift122 mutants rescued several aspects of optic
      cup and lens morphogenesis as well as RPE and NR specification. Collectively, our
      data suggest that proper assembly of primary cilia is critical for restricting
      the Hedgehog pathway during eye formation in the mouse.

AB  - The deutocerebral (second) head segment is putatively homologous across
      Arthropoda, in spite of remarkable disparity of form and function of
      deutocerebral appendages. In Mandibulata this segment bears a pair of sensory
      antennae, whereas in Chelicerata the same segment bears a pair of feeding
      appendages called chelicerae. Part of the evidence for the homology of
      deutocerebral appendages is the conserved function of homothorax (hth), which has
      been shown to specify antennal or cheliceral fate in the absence of Hox
      signaling, in both mandibulate and chelicerate exemplars. However, the genetic
      basis for the morphological disparity of antenna and chelicera is not understood.
      To test whether downstream targets of hth have diverged in a lineage-specific
      manner, we examined the evolution of the function and expression of spineless
      (ss), which in two holometabolous insects is known to act as a hth target and
      distal antennal determinant. Toward expanding phylogenetic representation of gene
      expression data, here we show that strong expression of ss is observed in
      developing antennae of a hemimetabolous insect, a centipede, and an amphipod
      crustacean. By contrast, ss orthologs are not expressed throughout the cheliceral
      limb buds of spiders or harvestmen during developmental stages when appendage
      fate is specified. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ss in Oncopeltus
      fasciatus, which bears a simple plesiomorphic antenna, resulted in homeotic
      distal antenna-to-leg transformation, comparable to data from holometabolous
      insect counterparts. Knockdown of hth in Oncopeltus fasciatus abrogated ss
      expression, suggesting conservation of upstream regulation. These data suggest
      that ss may be a flagellar (distal antennal) determinant more broadly, and that
      this function was acquired at the base of Mandibulata.

      zebrafish.

AB  - The casper strain of zebrafish is widely used in studies ranging from cancer to
      neuroscience. casper offers the advantage of relative transparency throughout
      adulthood, making it particularly useful for in vivo imaging by epifluorescence, 
      confocal, and light sheet microscopy. casper was developed by selective breeding 
      of two previously described recessive pigment mutants: 1) nacre, which harbors an
      inactivating mutation of the mitfa gene, rendering the fish devoid of pigmented
      melanocytes; and 2) roy orbison, a mutant with a so-far unidentified genetic
      cause that lacks reflective iridophores. To clarify the molecular nature of the
      roy orbison mutation, such that it can inform studies using casper, we undertook 
      an effort to positionally clone the roy orbison mutation. We find that roy
      orbison is caused by an intronic defect in the gene mpv17, encoding an inner
      mitochondrial membrane protein that has been implicated in the human
      mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. The roy orbison mutation is phenotypically 
      and molecularly remarkably similar to another zebrafish iridophore mutant called 
      transparent. Using Cas9-induced crispants and germline mutants with a disrupted
      mpv17 open reading frame, we show in trans-heterozygote embryos that new
      frameshift alleles of mpv17, roy orbison, and transparent fail to complement each
      other. Our work provides genetic evidence that both roy orbison and transparent
      affect the mpv17 locus by a similar if not identical genetic lesion.
      Identification of mpv17 mutants will allow for further work probing the
      relationship between mitochondrial function and pigmentation, which has to date
      received little attention.

      involvement in neurogenesis.

AB  - It is well established that the gbx2 homeobox gene contributes to the positioning
      of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) governing the development of adjacent
      brain regions in vertebrate embryos, but the specific aspects of the gene
      regulatory network regulated by gbx2 during brain development remain unclear. In 
      the present study, we sought to comprehensively identify gbx2 target genes in
      zebrafish embryos by microarray analysis around the end of gastrulation, when the
      MHB is established, using transgenic embryos harboring heat-inducible gbx2. This 
      analysis revealed that a large number of genes were either upregulated or
      downregulated following gbx2 induction, and the time course of induction differed
      depending on the genes. The differences in response to gbx2 were found by
      functional annotation analysis to be related to the functions and structures of
      the target genes. Among the significantly downregulated genes was her5, whose
      expression in the midbrain was precisely complementary to gbx2 expression around 
      the MHB, suggesting that gbx2 expression in the anterior hindbrain restricts her5
      expression to the midbrain. Because her5 represses neurogenesis, gbx2 may
      positively regulate neural development in its expression domain. Indeed, we
      showed further that gbx2 induction upregulated neural marker expression in the
      midbrain. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that gbx2 upregulated the expression
      of the zebrafish proneural gene ebf2, whereas it repressed notch1a, which
      generally represses neurogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 
      gbx2 not only functions to position the MHB but also regulates neurogenesis in
      the anterior hindbrain.

AB  - The axons of the DA and DB classes of motor neurons fail to reach the dorsal cord
      in the absence of the guidance cue UNC-6/Netrin or its receptor UNC-5 in C.
      elegans. However, the axonal processes usually exit their cell bodies in the
      ventral cord in the absence of both molecules. Strains lacking functional
      versions of UNC-6 or UNC-5 have a low level of DA and DB motor neuron axon
      outgrowth defects. We found that mutations in the genes for all six of the ENU-3 
      proteins function to enhance the outgrowth defects of the DA and DB axons in
      strains lacking either UNC-6 or UNC-5. A mutation in the gene for the
      MIG-14/Wntless protein also enhances defects in a strain lacking either UNC-5 or 
      UNC-6, suggesting that the ENU-3 and Wnt pathways function parallel to the Netrin
      pathway in directing motor neuron axon outgrowth. Our evidence suggests that the 
      ENU-3 proteins are novel members of the Wnt pathway in nematodes. Five of the six
      members of the ENU-3 family are predicted to be single-pass trans-membrane
      proteins. The expression pattern of ENU-3.1 was consistent with plasma membrane
      localization. One family member, ENU-3.6, lacks the predicted signal peptide and 
      the membrane-spanning domain. In HeLa cells ENU-3.6 had a cytoplasmic
      localization and caused actin dependent processes to appear. We conclude that the
      ENU-3 family proteins function in a pathway parallel to the UNC-6/Netrin pathway 
      for motor neuron axon outgrowth, most likely in the Wnt pathway.

AB  - Breaking symmetry in populations of uniform cells, to induce adoption of an
      alternative cell fate, is an essential developmental mechanism. Similarly, domain
      and boundary establishment are crucial steps to forming organs during
      development. Notch signaling is a pathway ideally suited to mediating precise
      patterning cues, as both receptors and ligands are membrane-bound and can thus
      act as a precise switch to toggle cell fates on or off. Fine-tuning of signaling 
      by positive or negative feedback mechanisms dictate whether signaling results in 
      lateral induction or lateral inhibition, respectively, allowing Notch to either
      induce entire regions of cell specification, or dictate binary fate choices.
      Furthermore, pathway activity is modulated by Fringe modification of receptors or
      ligands, co-expression of receptors with ligands, mode of ligand presentation,
      and cell surface area in contact. In this review, we describe how Notch signaling
      is fine-tuned to mediate lateral induction or lateral inhibition cues, and
      discuss examples from C.elegans, D. melanogaster and M. musculus. Identifying the
      cellular machinery dictating the choice between lateral induction and lateral
      inhibition highlights the versatility of the Notch signaling pathway in
      development.

AB  - The physical basis of morphogenesis is a fascinating concern that has been a
      longstanding interest of developmental biologists. In this review, I attempt to
      incorporate earlier and recent biophysical concepts and data to explain basic
      features of early limb bud morphogenesis. In particular, I discuss the influence 
      of mesenchymal cohesion and physical properties that might contribute to phase
      separation of the bud from the lateral plate, the possibility that the early
      dorsoventral limb bud axis is moulded by the surface ectoderm, and endogenous
      electric fields that might contribute to oriented cell movements which generate
      the early limb bud. A combination of quantitative biophysical experimentation and
      modelling will likely advance this field.

AB  - John Saunders was a highly skilled embryologist who pioneered the study of limb
      development. His studies on chick embryos provided the fundamental framework for 
      understanding how vertebrate limbs develop. This framework inspired generations
      of scientists and formed the bridge from experimental embryology to molecular
      mechanisms. Saunders investigated how feathers become organized into tracts in
      the skin of the chick wing and also identified regions of programmed cell death. 
      He discovered that a region of thickened ectoderm that rims the chick wing bud - 
      the apical ectodermal ridge - is required for outgrowth and the laying down of
      structures along the proximo-distal axis (long axis) of the wing, identified the 
      zone of polarizing activity (ZPA; polarizing region) that controls development
      across the anteroposterior axis ("thumb to little finger "axis) and contributed
      to uncovering the importance of the ectoderm in development of structures along
      the dorso-ventral axis ( "back of hand to palm" axis). This review looks in depth
      at some of his original papers and traces how he made the crucial findings about 
      how limbs develop, considering these findings both in the context of contemporary
      knowledge at the time and also in terms of their immediate impact on the field.

AB  - Functional movement and stability of the limb depends on an organized and fully
      integrated musculoskeletal system composed of skeleton, muscle, and tendon. Much 
      of our current understanding of musculoskeletal development is based on studies
      that focused on the development and differentiation of individual tissues.
      Likewise, research on patterning events have been largely limited to the primary 
      skeletal elements and the mechanisms that regulate soft tissue patterning, the
      development of the connections between tissues, and their interdependent
      development are only beginning to be elucidated. This review will therefore
      highlight recent exciting discoveries in this field, with an emphasis on tendon
      and muscle patterning and their integrated development with the skeleton and
      skeletal attachments.

AB  - Variation in regional identity, patterning, and structure of epidermal appendages
      contributes to skin diversity among many vertebrate groups, and is perhaps most
      striking in birds. In pioneering work on epidermal appendage patterning, John
      Saunders and his contemporaries took advantage of epidermal appendage diversity
      within and among domestic chicken breeds to establish the importance of
      mesoderm-ectoderm signaling in determining skin patterning. Diversity in chickens
      and other domestic birds, including pigeons, is driving a new wave of research to
      dissect the molecular genetic basis of epidermal appendage patterning. Domestic
      birds are not only outstanding models for embryonic manipulations, as Saunders
      recognized, but they are also ideal genetic models for discovering the specific
      genes that control normal development and the mutations that contribute to skin
      diversity. Here, we review recent genetic and genomic approaches to uncover the
      basis of epidermal macropatterning, micropatterning, and structural variation. We
      also present new results that confirm expression changes in two limb identity
      genes in feather-footed pigeons, a case of variation in appendage structure and
      identity.

AB  - Vertebrate limb development relies on the activity of signaling centers that
      promote growth and control patterning along three orthogonal axes of the limb
      bud. The apical ectodermal ridge, at the distal rim of the limb bud ectoderm,
      produces WNT and FGF signals, which promote limb bud growth and progressive
      distalization. The zone of polarizing activity, a discrete postero-distal
      mesenchymal domain, produces SHH, which stimulates growth and organizes
      patterning along the antero-posterior axis. The dorsal and ventral ectoderms
      produce, respectively, WNT7A and BMPs, which induce dorso-ventral limb fates.
      Interestingly, these signaling centers and the mechanisms they instruct interact 
      with each other to coordinate events along the three axes. We review here the
      main interactions described between the three axial systems of the developing
      limb and discuss their relevance to proper limb growth and patterning.

      work?

AB  - Among John Saunders' many seminal contributions to developmental biology, his
      discovery of the limb 'zone of polarizing activity' (ZPA) is arguably one of the 
      most memorable and ground-breaking. This discovery introduced the limb as a
      premier model for understanding developmental patterning and promoted the concept
      of patterning by a morphogen gradient. In the 50 years since the discovery of the
      ZPA, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been identified as the ZPA factor and the basic
      components of the signaling pathway and many aspects of its regulation have been 
      elucidated. Although much has also been learned about how it regulates growth,
      the mechanism by which Shh patterns the limb, how it acts to instruct digit
      'identity', nevertheless remains an enigma. This review focuses on what has been 
      learned about Shh function in the limb and the outstanding puzzles that remain to
      be solved.

AB  - More than sixty years ago, while studying feather tracks on the shoulder of the
      chick embryo, Dr. John Saunders used Nile Blue dye to stain the tissue. There, he
      noticed a darkly stained line of cells that neatly rims the tip of the growing
      limb bud. Rather than ignoring this observation, he followed it up by removing
      this tissue and found that it led to a striking truncation of the limb skeletons.
      This landmark experiment marks the serendipitous discovery of the apical
      ectodermal ridge (AER), the quintessential embryonic structure that drives the
      outgrowth of the limb. Dr. Saunders continued to lead the limb field for the next
      fifty years, not just through his own work, but also by inspiring the next
      generation of researchers through his infectious love of science. Together, he
      and those who followed ushered in the discovery of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
      as the AER molecule. The seamless marriage of embryology and molecular biology
      that led to the decoding of the AER serves as a shining example of how
      discoveries are made for the rest of the developmental biology field.

AB  - John W. Saunders, Jr. made seminal discoveries unveiling how chick embryos
      develop their limbs. He discovered the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), the zone of
      polarizing activity (ZPA), and the domains of interdigital cell death within the 
      developing limb and determined their function through experimental analysis.
      These discoveries provided the basis for subsequent molecular understanding of
      how vertebrate limbs are induced, patterned, and differentiated. These mechanisms
      are strongly conserved among the vast diversity of tetrapod limbs suggesting that
      relatively minor changes and tweaks to the molecular cascades are responsible for
      the diversity observed in nature. Analysis of the pathway systems first
      identified by Saunders in the context of animals displaying limb reduction show
      how alterations in these pathways have resulted in multiple mechanisms of limb
      and digit loss. Other classes of modification to these same patterning systems
      are seen at the root of other, novel limb morphological alterations and
      elaborations.

AB  - Evidence in many experimental systems supports the idea that non-uniform
      distributions of morphogen proteins encode positional information in developing
      tissues. There is also strong evidence that morphogen dispersal is mediated by
      cytonemes and that morphogen proteins transfer from producing to receiving cells 
      at morphogenetic synapses that form at sites of cytoneme contacts. This essay
      considers some implications of this mechanism and its relevance to various
      contexts including large single cells such as the pre-cellular Drosophila embryo 
      and the ciliate Stentor.

AB  - The Iroquois genes (Irx) appear to regulate fundamental processes that lead to
      cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation during development. In this
      report, the Iroquois homeobox 1 (Irx1) transcription factor was functionally
      disrupted using a LacZ insert and LacZ expression demonstrated stage-specific
      expression during embryogenesis. Irx1 is highly expressed in the brain, lung,
      digits, kidney, testis and developing teeth. Irx1 null mice are neonatal lethal
      and this lethality it due to pulmonary immaturity. Irx1(-/-) mice show delayed
      lung maturation characterized by defective surfactant protein secretion and Irx1 
      marks a population of SP-C expressing alveolar type II cells. Irx1 is
      specifically expressed in the outer enamel epithelium (OEE), stellate reticulum
      (SR) and stratum intermedium (SI) layers of the developing tooth. Irx1 mediates
      dental epithelial cell differentiation in the lower incisors resulting in delayed
      growth of the lower incisors. Irx1 is specifically and temporally expressed
      during developmental stages and we have focused on lung and dental development in
      this report. Irx1+ cells are unique to the development of the incisor outer
      enamel epithelium, patterning of Lef-1+ and Sox2+ cells as well as a new marker
      for lung alveolar type II cells. Mechanistically, Irx1 regulates Foxj1 and Sox9
      to control cell differentiation during development.

TI  - RNAi-mediated knockdown of SPOOK reduces ecdysteroid titers and causes precocious
      metamorphosis in the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria.

AB  - The Halloween gene SPOOK (SPO) is involved in the production of the active
      metabolite of ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), in insects. A previous study
      showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of SPO in Schistocerca gregaria last instar
      nymphs markedly reduced the hemolymph 20E titer, but did not affect
      metamorphosis. In the present study, the effects of SPO interference on
      development were re-examined in this locust. Injections of SPO double-stranded
      RNA (dsSPO) into nymphs at mid and late instars significantly delayed nymphal
      development and interfered with molting. The 20E levels of dsSPO-treated nymphs
      were generally low, with a delayed, small peak, suggesting that disturbance of
      the 20E levels caused the above developmental abnormalities. A small proportion
      of the dsSPO-injected nymphs metamorphosed precociously, producing adults and
      adultoids. Precocious adults were characterized by small body size, short wings
      with abbreviated venation, and normal reproductive activity. Fourth instar nymphs
      that precociously metamorphosed at the following instar exhibited temporal
      expression patterns of ecdysone-induced protein 93F and the juvenile hormone (JH)
      early-inducible gene Kruppel homolog 1 similar to those observed at the last
      instar in normal nymphs. Adultoids displayed mating behavior and adultoid females
      developed eggs, but never laid eggs. JH injection around the expected time of the
      20E peak in the dsSPO-injected nymphs completely inhibited the appearance of
      adultoids, suggesting that appearance of adultoids might be due to a reduced
      titer of JH rather than of 20E. These results suggest that SPO plays an important
      role in controlling morphogenesis, metamorphosis, and reproduction in S.
      gregaria.

TI  - Functional determination of the differentiation potential of ventral
      mesencephalic neural precursor cells during dopaminergic neurogenesis.

AB  - The ventral mesencephalic neural precursor cells (vmNPCs) that give rise to
      dopaminergic (DA) neurons have been identified by the expression of distinct
      genes (e.g., Lmx1a, Foxa2, Msx1/2). However, the commitment of these NPCs to the 
      mesencephalic DA neuronal fate has not been functionally determined. Evaluation
      of the plasticity of vmNPCs suggests that their commitment occurs after E10.5.
      Here we show that E9.5 vmNPCs implanted in an ectopic area of E10.5 mesencephalic
      explants, retained their specification marker Lmx1a and efficiently
      differentiated into neurons but did not express the gene encoding tyrosine
      hydroxylase (Th), the limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis. A proportion of
      E10.5-E11.5 implanted vmNPCs behaved as committed, deriving into Th(+) neurons in
      ectopic sites. Interestingly, implanted cells from E12.5 embryos were unable to
      give rise to a significant number of Th(+) neurons. Concomitantly,
      differentiation assays in culture and in mesencephalic explants treated with
      Fgf2+LIF detected vmNPCs with astrogenic potential since E11.5. Despite this, a
      full suspension of E12.5 vmNPCs give rise to DA neurons in a similar proportion
      as those of E10.5 when they were transplanted into adult brain, but astrocytes
      were only detected with the former population. These data suggest that the
      subventricular postmitotic progenitors present in E12.5 ventral mesencephalon are
      unable to implant in embryonic explants and are the source of DA neurons in the
      transplanted adult brain. Based on our findings we propose that during DA
      differentiation committed vmNPCs emerge at E10.5 and they exhaust their
      neurogenic capacity with the rise of NPCs with astrogenic potential.

AB  - Myc proto-oncogenes regulate diverse cellular processes during development, but
      their roles during morphogenesis of specific tissues are not fully understood. We
      found that c-myc regulates cell proliferation in mouse lens development and
      previous genome-wide studies suggested functional roles for N-myc in developing
      lens. Here, we examined the role of N-myc in mouse lens development. Genetic
      inactivation of N-myc in the surface ectoderm or lens vesicle impaired eye and
      lens growth, while "late" inactivation in lens fibers had no effect.
      Unexpectedly, defective growth of N-myc-deficient lenses was not associated with 
      alterations in lens progenitor cell proliferation or survival. Notably,
      N-myc-deficient lens exhibited a delay in degradation of DNA in terminally
      differentiating lens fiber cells. RNA-sequencing analysis of N-myc-deficient
      lenses identified a cohort of down-regulated genes associated with fiber cell
      differentiation that included DNaseIIbeta. Further, an integrated analysis of
      differentially expressed genes in N-myc-deficient lens using normal lens
      expression patterns of iSyTE, N-myc-binding motif analysis and molecular
      interaction data from the String database led to the derivation of an N-myc-based
      gene regulatory network in the lens. Finally, analysis of N-myc and c-myc
      double-deficient lens demonstrated that these Myc genes cooperate to drive lens
      growth prior to lens vesicle stage. Together, these findings provide evidence for
      exclusive and cooperative functions of Myc transcription factors in mouse lens
      development and identify novel mechanisms by which N-myc regulates cell
      differentiation during eye morphogenesis.

AB  - The Polycomb group (PcG) of proteins control developmental gene silencing and are
      highly conserved between flies and mammals. PcG proteins function by controlling 
      post-translational modification of histones, such as ubiquitylation, which
      impacts chromatin compaction and thus gene transcription. Changes in PcG cellular
      levels have drastic effects on organismal development and are involved in the
      generation of human pathologies such as cancer. However, the mechanisms
      controlling their levels of expression and their physiological effects are only
      partially understood. In this work we describe the effects of modulating levels
      of SCE/dRING, a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase and member of the PcG known to
      mono-ubiquitylate histone H2A. We find that inactivation of Sce induces
      apoptosis, an effect that is decreased in the absence of Dp53 function. However, 
      over-expression of SCE produce no developmental effects but inhibits DP53-induced
      apoptosis. Thus, Sce functions as a Dp53-dependent apoptosis inhibitor. The SCE
      inhibition of DP53-induced apoptosis requires dRYBP, an ubiquitin binding protein
      and member of the PcG. Moreover, this inhibition of apoptosis involves the
      reduction of DP53 protein levels. Finally, high levels of SCE inhibit X-ray
      induced apoptosis as well as the apoptosis associated with tumor growth. We
      propose that SCE, together with dRYBP, inhibits apoptosis either by
      epigenetically regulating Dp53 transcription or by controlling the stabilization 
      of DP53 protein levels thus promoting its ubiquitylation for proteaosomal
      degradation. This function may generate a homeostatic balance between apoptosis
      and proliferation during development that provides cell survival during the
      initiation and progression of disease processes.

AB  - The behavior of visceral endoderm cells was examined as the anterior visceral
      endoderm (AVE) formed from the distal visceral endoderm (DVE) using the mouse
      lines R26-H2B-EGFP and R26-PHA7-EGFP to visualize cell nuclei and adherens
      junction, respectively. The analysis using R26-H2B-EGFP demonstrated global cell 
      rearrangement that was not specific to the DVE cells in the monolayer embryonic
      visceral endoderm sheet; each population of the endoderm cells moved collectively
      in a swirling movement as a whole. Most of the AVE cells at E6.5 were not E5.5
      DVE cells but were E5.5 cells that were located caudally behind them, as
      previously reported (Hoshino et al., 2015; Takaoka et al., 2011). In the
      rearrangement, the posterior embryonic visceral endoderm cells did not move, as
      extraembryonic visceral endoderm cells did not, and they constituted a distinct
      population during the process of anterior-posterior axis formation. The analysis 
      using R26-PHA7-EGFP suggested that constriction of the apical surfaces of the
      cells in prospective anterior portion of the DVE initiated the global cellular
      movement of the embryonic visceral endoderm to drive AVE formation.

AB  - Development of multicellular organisms relies upon the coordinated regulation of 
      cellular differentiation and proliferation. Growing evidence suggests that some
      molecular regulatory pathways associated with the cell cycle machinery also
      dictate cell fate; however, it remains largely unclear how the cell cycle is
      remodeled in concert with cell differentiation. During Drosophila oogenesis,
      mature oocytes are created through a series of precisely controlled division and 
      differentiation steps, originating from a single tissue-specific stem cell.
      Further, germline stem cells (GSCs) and their differentiating progeny remain in a
      predominantly linear arrangement as oogenesis proceeds. The ability to visualize 
      the stepwise events of differentiation within the context of a single tissue make
      the Drosophila ovary an exceptional model for study of cell cycle remodeling. To 
      describe how the cell cycle is remodeled in germ cells as they differentiate in
      situ, we used the Drosophila Fluorescence Ubiquitin-based Cell Cycle Indicator
      (Fly-FUCCI) system, in which degradable versions of GFP::E2f1 and RFP::CycB
      fluorescently label cells in each phase of the cell cycle. We found that the
      lengths of the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle change dramatically over
      the course of differentiation, and identified the 4/8-cell cyst as a key
      developmental transition state in which cells prepare for specialized cell
      cycles. Our data suggest that the transcriptional activator E2f1, which controls 
      the transition from G1 to S phase, is a key regulator of mitotic divisions in the
      early germline. Our data support the model that E2f1 is necessary for proper GSC 
      proliferation, self-renewal, and daughter cell development. In contrast, while
      E2f1 degradation by the Cullin 4 (Cul4)-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase (CRL4) is 
      essential for developmental transitions in the early germline, our data do not
      support a role for E2f1 degradation as a mechanism to limit GSC proliferation or 
      self-renewal. Taken together, these findings provide further insight into the
      regulation of cell proliferation and the acquisition of differentiated cell fate,
      with broad implications across developing tissues.

AB  - The formation of complex tissues from simple epithelial sheets requires the
      regional subdivision of the developing tissue. This is initially accomplished by 
      a sequence of gene regulatory hierarchies that set up distinct fates within
      adjacent territories, and rely on cross-regulatory interactions to do so.
      However, once adjacent territories are established, cells that confront one
      another across territorial boundaries must actively participate in maintaining
      separation from each other. Classically, it was assumed that adhesive differences
      would be a primary means of sorting cells to their respective territories. Yet it
      is becoming clear that no single, simple mechanism is at play. In the few
      instances studied, an emergent theme along developmental boundaries is the
      generation of asymmetry in cell mechanical properties. The repertoire of ways in 
      which cells might establish and then put mechanical asymmetry to work is not
      fully appreciated since only a few boundaries have been molecularly studied.
      Here, we characterize once such boundary in the develop leg epithelium of
      Drosophila. The region of the pretarsus / tarsus is a known gene expression
      boundary that also exhibits a lineage restriction (Sakurai et al., 2007). We now 
      show that the interface comprising this boundary is strikingly aligned compared
      to other cell interfaces across the disk. The boundary also exhibits an asymmetry
      for both Myosin II accumulation as well as one of its activators, Rho Kinase.
      Furthermore, the enrichment correlates with increased mechanical tension across
      that interface, and that tension is Rho Kinase-dependent. Lastly, interfering
      with actomyosin contractility, either by depletion of myosin heavy chain or
      expression of a phosphomimetic variant of regulatory light chain causes defects
      in alignment of the interfaces. These data suggest strongly that mechanical
      asymmetries are key in establishing and maintaining this developmental boundary.

AB  - The vertebrate retina develops in close proximity to the forebrain and neural
      crest-derived cartilages of the face and jaw. Coloboma, a congenital eye
      malformation, is associated with aberrant forebrain development
      (holoprosencephaly) and with craniofacial defects (frontonasal dysplasia) in
      humans, suggesting a critical role for cross-lineage interactions during retinal 
      morphogenesis. ZIC2, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is linked to human
      holoprosencephaly. We have previously used morpholino assays to show zebrafish
      zic2 functions in the developing forebrain, retina and craniofacial cartilage. We
      now report that zebrafish with genetic lesions in zebrafish zic2 orthologs, zic2a
      and zic2b, develop with retinal coloboma and craniofacial anomalies. We
      demonstrate a requirement for zic2 in restricting pax2a expression and show
      evidence that zic2 function limits Hh signaling. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis
      identified an early requirement for zic2 in periocular neural crest as an
      activator of alx1, a transcription factor with essential roles in craniofacial
      and ocular morphogenesis in human and zebrafish. Collectively, these data
      establish zic2 mutant zebrafish as a powerful new genetic model for in-depth
      dissection of cell interactions and genetic controls during craniofacial complex 
      development.

AB  - Suppressor of Fused (SUFU) is an essential negative regulator of the Hedgehog
      (HH) pathway and involved in GLI transcription factor regulation. Due to early
      embryonic lethality of Sufu(-/-) mice, investigations of SUFU's role later in
      development are limited to conditional, tissue-specific knockout models. In this 
      study we developed a mouse model (Sufu(Ex456(fl)/Ex456(fl))) with hypomorphic
      features where embryos were viable up to E18.5, although with a spectrum of
      developmental defects of varying severity, including polydactyly, exencephaly and
      omphalocele. Development of certain tissues, like the skeleton, was more affected
      than that of others such as skin, which remained largely normal. Interestingly,
      no apparent changes in the dorso-ventral patterning of the neural tube at E9.0
      could be seen. Thus, this model provides an opportunity to globally study SUFU's 
      molecular function in organogenesis beyond E9.5. Molecularly,
      Sufu(Ex456(fl)/Ex456(fl)) embryos displayed aberrant mRNA splicing and
      drastically reduced levels of Sufu wild-type mRNA and SUFU protein in all
      tissues. As a consequence, at E9.5 the levels of all three different GLI proteins
      were reduced. Interestingly, despite the reduction of GLI3 protein levels, the
      critical ratio of the GLI3 full-length transcriptional activator versus GLI3
      truncated repressor remained unchanged compared to wild-type embryos. This
      suggests that the limited amount of SUFU protein present is sufficient for GLI
      processing but not for stabilization. Our data demonstrate that tissue
      development is differentially affected in response to the reduced SUFU levels,
      providing novel insight regarding the requirements of different levels of SUFU
      for proper organogenesis.

TI  - PKA-mediated Gli2 and Gli3 phosphorylation is inhibited by Hedgehog signaling in

AB  - Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is thought to occur in primary cilia, but the molecular
      basis of Gli2 and Gli3 activation by Hh signaling in cilia is unknown. Similarly,
      how ciliary gene mutations result in reduced Gli3 processing that generates a
      repressor is also not clear. Here we show that Hh signaling inhibits Gli2 and
      Gli3 phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) in cilia. The cilia related gene
      Talpid3 (Ta3) mutation results in the reduced processing and phosphorylation of
      Gli2 and Gli3. Interestingly, Ta3 interacts and colocalizes with PKA regulatory
      subunit PKARIIbeta at centrioles in the cell. The centriolar localization and PKA
      binding regions are located in the N- and C-terminal regions of Ta3,
      respectively. PKARIIbeta fails to localize at centrioles in some Ta3 mutant
      cells. Therefore, our study provides the direct evidence that Gli2 and Gli3 are
      dephosphorylated and activated in cilia and that impaired Gli2 and Gli3
      processing in Ta3 mutant is at least in part due to a decrease in Gli2 and Gli3
      phosphorylation.

AB  - Comparative sequence analysis methods, such as phylogenetic footprinting,
      represent one of the most effective ways to decode regulatory sequence functions 
      based upon DNA sequence information alone. The laborious task of assembling
      orthologous sequences to perform these comparisons is a hurdle to these analyses,
      which is further aggravated by the relative paucity of tools for visualization of
      sequence comparisons in large genic regions. Here, we describe a
      second-generation implementation of the GenePalette DNA sequence analysis
      software to facilitate comparative studies of gene function and regulation. We
      have developed an automated module called OrthologGrabber (OG) that performs BLAT
      searches against the UC Santa Cruz genome database to identify and retrieve
      segments homologous to a region of interest. Upon acquisition, sequences are
      compared to identify high-confidence anchor-points, which are graphically
      displayed. The visualization of anchor-points alongside other DNA features, such 
      as transcription factor binding sites, allows users to precisely examine whether 
      a binding site of interest is conserved, even if the surrounding region exhibits 
      poor sequence identity. This approach also aids in identifying orthologous
      segments of regulatory DNA, facilitating studies of regulatory sequence
      evolution. As with previous versions of the software, GenePalette 2.1 takes the
      form of a platform-independent, single-windowed interface that is simple to use.

AB  - The 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of mRNAs mediate post-transcriptional
      regulation of genes in many biological processes. Cis elements in 3' UTRs can
      interact with RNA-binding factors in sequence-specific or structure-dependent
      manners, enabling regulation of mRNA stability, translation, and localization.
      Caenorhabditis elegans CEBP-1 is a conserved transcription factor of the C/EBP
      family, and functions in diverse contexts, from neuronal development and axon
      regeneration to organismal growth. Previous studies revealed that the levels of
      cebp-1 mRNA in neurons depend on its 3' UTR and are also negatively regulated by 
      the E3 ubiquitin ligase RPM-1. Here, by systematically dissecting cebp-1's 3'
      UTR, we test the roles of specific cis elements in cebp-1 expression and function
      in neurons. We present evidence for a putative stem-loop in the cebp-1 3' UTR
      that contributes to basal expression levels of mRNA and to negative regulation by
      rpm-1. Mutant animals lacking the endogenous cebp-1 3' UTR showed a noticeable
      increased expression of cebp-1 mRNA and enhanced the neuronal developmental
      phenotypes of rpm-1 mutants. Our data reveal multiple cis elements within
      cebp-1's 3' UTR that help to optimize CEBP-1 expression levels in neuronal
      development.

AB  - Correct cardiac development is essential for fetal and adult life. Disruptions in
      a variety of signaling pathways result in congenital heart defects, including
      outflow and inflow tract defects. We previously found that WNT11 regulates
      outflow tract development. However, tissue specific requirements for WNT11 in
      this process remain unknown and whether WNT11 is required for inflow tract
      development has not been addressed. Here we find that germline Wnt11 null mice
      also show hypoplasia of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion (DMP), which is
      required for atrioventricular septation. Ablation of Wnt11 with myocardial
      cTnTCre recapitulated outflow tract defects observed in germline Wnt11 null mice,
      but DMP development was unaffected. In contrast, ablation of Wnt11 with Isl1Cre
      fully recapitulated both outflow tract and DMP defects of Wnt11 germline nulls.
      DMP hypoplasia in Wnt11 mutants was associated with reduced proliferation within 
      the DMP, but no evident defects in myocardial differentiation of the DMP.
      Examination of Pitx2-, Axin2-, or Patched-lacZ reporter mice revealed no
      alterations in reporter expression, suggesting that WNT11 was required downstream
      of, or in parallel to, these signaling pathways to regulate DMP formation. These 
      studies revealed a previously unappreciated role for WNT11 for DMP formation and 
      distinct tissue-specific requirements for WNT11 in outflow tract and DMP
      development.

AB  - In most multicellular organisms, the structure and content of the genome is
      rigorously maintained over the course of development. However some species have
      evolved genome biologies that permit, or require, developmentally regulated
      changes in the physical structure and content of the genome (programmed genome
      rearrangement: PGR). Relatively few vertebrates are known to undergo PGR,
      although all agnathans surveyed to date (several hagfish and one lamprey:
      Petromyzon marinus) show evidence of large scale PGR. To further resolve the
      ancestry of PGR within vertebrates, we developed probes that allow simultaneous
      tracking of nearly all sequences eliminated by PGR in P. marinus and a second
      lamprey species (Entosphenus tridentatus). These comparative analyses reveal
      conserved subcellular structures (lagging chromatin and micronuclei) associated
      with PGR and provide the first comparative embryological evidence in support of
      the idea that PGR represents an ancient and evolutionarily stable strategy for
      regulating inherent developmental/genetic conflicts between germline and soma.

AB  - Eyespot patterns of nymphalid butterflies are an example of a novel trait yet,
      the developmental origin of eyespots is still not well understood. Several genes 
      have been associated with eyespot development but few have been tested for
      function. One of these genes is the signaling ligand, wingless, which is
      expressed in the eyespot centers during early pupation and may function in
      eyespot signaling and color ring differentiation. Here we tested the function of 
      wingless in wing and eyespot development by down-regulating it in transgenic
      Bicyclus anynana butterflies via RNAi driven by an inducible heat-shock promoter.
      Heat-shocks applied during larval and early pupal development led to significant 
      decreases in wingless mRNA levels and to decreases in eyespot size and wing size 
      in adult butterflies. We conclude that wingless is a positive regulator of
      eyespot and wing development in B. anynana butterflies.

AB  - DNA degradation is critical to healthy organism development and survival. Two
      nuclease families that play key roles in development and in disease are the
      Dnase1 and Dnase2 families. While these two families were initially characterized
      by biochemical function, it is now clear that multiple enzymes in each family
      perform similar, non-redundant roles in many different tissues. Most Dnase1 and
      Dnase2 family members are poorly characterized, yet their elimination can lead to
      a wide range of diseases, including lethal anemia, parakeratosis, cataracts and
      systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore, understanding these enzyme families
      represents a critical field of emerging research. This review explores what is
      currently known about Dnase1 and Dnase2 family members, highlighting important
      questions about the structure and function of family members, and how their
      absence translates to disease.

AB  - In humans and mice, motile cilia occur on the surface of the embryonic ventral
      node, on respiratory and ependymal epithelia and in reproductive organs where
      they ensure normal left-right asymmetry of the organism, mucociliary clearance of
      airways, homeostasis of the cerebrospinal fluid and fertility. The genetic
      programme for the formation of motile cilia, thus critical for normal development
      and health, is switched on by the key transcription factor FOXJ1. In previous
      microarray screens for murine FOXJ1 effectors, we identified candidates for novel
      factors involved in motile ciliogenesis, including both genes that are well
      conserved throughout metazoa and beyond, like FOXJ1 itself, and genes without
      overt homologues outside higher vertebrates. Here we examine one of the novel
      murine FOXJ1 effectors, the uncharacterised 1700012B09Rik whose homologues appear
      to be restricted to higher vertebrates. In mouse embryos and adults,
      1700012B09Rik is predominantly expressed in motile ciliated tissues in a
      FOXJ1-dependent manner. 1700012B09RIK protein localises to basal bodies of cilia 
      in cultured cells. Detailed analysis of 1700012B09Rik(lacZ) knock-out mice
      reveals no impaired function of motile cilia or non-motile cilia. In conclusion, 
      this novel FOXJ1 effector is associated mainly with motile cilia but - in
      contrast to other known FOXJ1 targets - its putative ciliary function is not
      essential for development or health in the mouse, consistent with a late
      emergence during evolution of motile ciliogenesis.

AB  - In many animals, maternally synthesized mRNAs are critical for primary germ layer
      formation. In Xenopus, several maternal mRNAs are enriched in the animal
      blastomere progenitors of the embryonic ectoderm. We previously identified one of
      these, WW-domain binding protein 2 N-terminal like (wbp2nl), that others
      previously characterized as a sperm protein (PAWP) that promotes meiotic
      resumption. Herein we demonstrate that it has an additional developmental role in
      regionalizing the embryonic ectoderm. Knock-down of Wbp2nl in the dorsal ectoderm
      reduced cranial placode and neural crest gene expression domains and expanded
      neural plate domains; knock-down in ventral ectoderm reduced epidermal gene
      expression. Conversely, increasing levels of Wbp2nl in the neural plate induced
      ectopic epidermal and neural crest gene expression and repressed many neural
      plate and cranial placode genes. The effects in the neural plate appear to be
      mediated, at least in part, by down-regulating chd, a BMP antagonist. Because the
      cellular function of Wbp2nl is not known, we mutated several predicted motifs.
      Expressing mutated proteins in embryos showed that a putative phosphorylation
      site at Thr45 and an alpha-helix in the PH-G domain are required to ectopically
      induce epidermal and neural crest genes in the neural plate. An intact
      YAP-binding motif also is required for ectopic epidermal gene expression as well 
      as for down-regulating chd. This work reveals novel developmental roles for a
      cytoplasmic protein that promotes epidermal and neural crest formation at the
      expense of neural ectoderm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic deletion of Nosip in mice causes holoprosencephaly, however, 
      the function of Nosip in neurogenesis is currently unknown. RESULTS: We combined 
      two vertebrate model organisms, the mouse and the South African clawed frog,
      Xenopus laevis, to study the function of Nosip in neurogenesis. We found, that
      size and cortical thickness of the developing brain of Nosip knockout mice were
      reduced. Accordingly, the formation of postmitotic neurons was greatly
      diminished, concomitant with a reduced number of apical and basal neural
      progenitor cells in vivo. Neurospheres derived from Nosip knockout embryos
      exhibited reduced growth and the differentiation capability into neurons in vitro
      was almost completely abolished. Mass spectrometry analysis of the neurospheres
      proteome revealed a reduced expression of Rbp1, a regulator of retinoic acid
      synthesis, when Nosip was absent. We identified the homologous nosip gene to be
      expressed in differentiated neurons in the developing brain of Xenopus embryos.
      Knockdown of Nosip in Xenopus resulted in a reduction of brain size that could be
      rescued by reintroducing human NOSIP mRNA. Furthermore, the expression of
      pro-neurogenic transcription factors was reduced and the differentiation of
      neuronal cells was impaired upon Nosip knockdown. In Xenopus as well as in mouse 
      we identified reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis as underlying cause
      of microcephaly upon Nosip depletion. In Xenopus Nosip and Rbp1 are similarly
      expressed and knockdown of Nosip resulted in down regulation of Rbp1. Knockdown
      of Rbp1 caused a similar microcephaly phenotype as the depletion of Nosip and
      synergy experiments indicated that both proteins act in the same signalling
      pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Nosip is a novel factor critical for neural stem
      cell/progenitor self-renewal and neurogenesis during mouse and Xenopus
      development and functions upstream of Rbp1 during early neurogenesis.

TI  - Novel functions for the RNA-binding protein ETR-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans
      reproduction and engulfment of germline apoptotic cell corpses.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential regulators of gene expression that act 
      through a variety of mechanisms to ensure the proper post-transcriptional
      regulation of their target RNAs. RBPs in multiple species have been identified as
      playing crucial roles during development and as having important functions in
      various adult organ systems, including the heart, nervous, muscle, and
      reproductive systems. ETR-1, a highly conserved ELAV-Type RNA-binding protein
      belonging to the CELF/Bruno protein family, has been previously reported to be
      involved in C. elegans muscle development. Animals depleted of ETR-1 have been
      previously characterized as arresting at the two-fold stage of embryogenesis. In 
      this study, we show that ETR-1 is expressed in the hermaphrodite somatic gonad
      and germ line, and that reduction of ETR-1 via RNA interference (RNAi) results in
      reduced hermaphrodite fecundity. Detailed characterization of this fertility
      defect indicates that ETR-1 is required in both the somatic tissue and the germ
      line to ensure wild-type reproductive levels. Additionally, the ability of ETR-1 
      depletion to suppress the published WEE-1.3-depletion infertility phenotype is
      dependent on ETR-1 being reduced in the soma. Within the germline of etr-1(RNAi) 
      hermaphrodite animals, we observe a decrease in average oocyte size and an
      increase in the number of germline apoptotic cell corpses as evident by an
      increased number of CED-1::GFP and acridine orange positive apoptotic germ cells.
      Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies confirm the significant increase
      in apoptotic cells in ETR-1-depleted animals, and reveal a failure of the somatic
      gonadal sheath cells to properly engulf dying germ cells in etr-1(RNAi) animals. 
      Through investigation of an established engulfment pathway in C. elegans, we
      demonstrate that co-depletion of CED-1 and ETR-1 suppresses both the reduced
      fecundity and the increase in the number of apoptotic cell corpses observed in
      etr-1(RNAi) animals. Combined, this data identifies a novel role for ETR-1 in
      hermaphrodite gametogenesis and in the process of engulfment of germline
      apoptotic cell corpses.

TI  - Identification of regulators of germ stem cell enwrapment by its niche in C.

AB  - Many stem cell niches contain support cells that increase contact with stem cells
      by enwrapping them in cellular processes. One example is the germ stem cell niche
      in C. elegans, which is composed of a single niche cell termed the distal tip
      cell (DTC) that extends cellular processes, constructing an elaborate plexus that
      enwraps germ stem cells. To identify genes required for plexus formation and to
      explore the function of this specialized enwrapping behavior, a series of
      targeted and tissue-specific RNAi screens were performed. Here we identify genes 
      that promote stem cell enwrapment by the DTC plexus, including a set that
      specifically functions within the DTC, such as the chromatin modifier
      lin-40/MTA1, and others that act within the germline, such as the 14-3-3
      signaling protein par-5. Analysis of genes that function within the germline to
      mediate plexus development reveal that they are required for expansion of the
      germ progenitor zone, supporting the emerging idea that germ stem cells signal to
      the niche to stimulate enwrapping behavior. Examination of wild-type animals with
      asymmetric plexus formation and animals with reduced DTC plexus elaboration via
      loss of two candidates including lin-40 indicate that cellular enwrapment
      promotes GLP-1/Notch signaling and germ stem cell fate. Together, our work
      identifies novel regulators of cellular enwrapment and suggests that reciprocal
      signaling between the DTC niche and the germ stem cells promotes enwrapment
      behavior and stem cell fate.

TI  - Pnrc2 regulates 3'UTR-mediated decay of segmentation clock-associated transcripts
      during zebrafish segmentation.

AB  - Vertebrate segmentation is controlled by the segmentation clock, a molecular
      oscillator that regulates gene expression and cycles rapidly. The expression of
      many genes oscillates during segmentation, including hairy/Enhancer of
      split-related (her or Hes) genes, which encode transcriptional repressors that
      auto-inhibit their own expression, and deltaC (dlc), which encodes a Notch
      ligand. We previously identified the tortuga (tor) locus in a zebrafish forward
      genetic screen for genes involved in cyclic transcript regulation and showed that
      cyclic transcripts accumulate post-splicing in tor mutants. Here we show that
      cyclic mRNA accumulation in tor mutants is due to loss of pnrc2, which encodes a 
      proline-rich nuclear receptor co-activator implicated in mRNA decay. Using an
      inducible in vivo reporter system to analyze transcript stability, we find that
      the her1 3'UTR confers Pnrc2-dependent instability to a heterologous transcript. 
      her1 mRNA decay is Dicer-independent and likely employs a Pnrc2-Upf1-containing
      mRNA decay complex. Surprisingly, despite accumulation of cyclic transcripts in
      pnrc2-deficient embryos, we find that cyclic protein is expressed normally.
      Overall, we show that Pnrc2 promotes 3'UTR-mediated decay of
      developmentally-regulated segmentation clock transcripts and we uncover an
      additional post-transcriptional regulatory layer that ensures oscillatory protein
      expression in the absence of cyclic mRNA decay.

AB  - Craniosynostosis is caused by premature fusion of one or more sutures in an
      infant skull, resulting in abnormal facial features. The molecular and cellular
      mechanisms by which genetic mutations cause craniosynostosis are incompletely
      characterized, and many of the causative genes for diverse types of syndromic
      craniosynostosis have not yet been identified. We previously demonstrated that
      augmentation of BMP signaling mediated by a constitutively active BMP type IA
      receptor (ca-BmpR1A) in neural crest cells (ca1A hereafter) causes
      craniosynostosis and superimposition of heterozygous null mutation of Bmpr1a
      rescues premature suture fusion (ca1A;1aH hereafter). In this study, we
      superimposed heterozygous null mutations of the other two BMP type I receptors,
      Bmpr1b and Acvr1 (ca1A;1bH and ca1A;AcH respectively hereafter) to further
      dissect involvement of BMP-Smad signaling. Unlike caA1;1aH, ca1A;1bH and ca1A;AcH
      did not restore the craniosynostosis phenotypes. In our in vivo study,
      Smad-dependent BMP signaling was decreased to normal levels in mut;1aH mice.
      However, BMP receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads; pSmad1/5/9 hereafter) levels were
      comparable between ca1A, ca1A;1bH and ca1A;AcH mice, and elevated compared to
      control mice. Bmpr1a, Bmpr1b and Acvr1 null cells were used to examine potential 
      mechanisms underlying the differences in ability of heterozygosity for Bmpr1a vs.
      Bmpr1b or Acvr1 to rescue the mut phenotype. pSmad1/5/9 level was undetectable in
      Bmpr1a homozygous null cells while pSmad1/5/9 levels did not decrease in Bmpr1b
      or Acvr1 homozygous null cells. Taken together, our study indicates that
      different levels of expression and subsequent activation of Smad signaling
      differentially contribute each BMP type I receptor to BMP-Smad signaling and
      craniofacial development. These results also suggest differential involvement of 
      each type 1 receptor in pathogenesis of syndromic craniosynostoses.

AB  - The two main mechanisms that expand the proteomic output of eukaryotic genes are 
      alternative splicing and alternative translation initiation signals. Despite
      being essential to generate isoforms of gene products that create functional
      diversity during development, the impact of these mechanisms on fine-tuning
      regulatory gene networks is still underappreciated. In this review, we use the
      Grainyhead-like (Grhl) family as a case study to illustrate the importance of
      isoforms when investigating transcription factor family function during
      development and disease, and highlight the potential for differential modulation 
      of downstream target genes. We provide insights into the importance of
      considering alternative gene products when designing, undertaking, and analysing 
      primary research, and the effect that isoforms may have on development. This
      review also covers known mutations in Grhl family members, and postulates how
      genetic changes may dictate transcriptional specificity between the Grhl family
      members. It also contrasts and compares the available literature on the function 
      and importance of the Grhl isoforms, and highlights current gaps in our
      understanding of their regulatory gene networks in development and disease.

AB  - The molecular pathways involved in the development of multicellular fruiting
      bodies in fungi are still not well known. Especially, the interplay between the
      mycelium, the female tissues and the zygotic tissues of the fruiting bodies is
      poorly documented. Here, we describe PM154, a new strain of the model ascomycetes
      Podospora anserina able to mate with itself and that enabled the easy recovery of
      new mutants affected in fruiting body development. By complete genome sequencing 
      of spod1, one of the new mutants, we identified an inositol phosphate polykinase 
      gene as essential, especially for fruiting body development. A factor present in 
      the wild type and diffusible in mutant hyphae was able to induce the development 
      of the maternal tissues of the fruiting body in spod1, but failed to promote
      complete development of the zygotic ones. Addition of myo-inositol in the growth 
      medium was able to increase the number of developing fruiting bodies in the wild 
      type, but not in spod1. Overall, the data indicated that inositol and inositol
      polyphosphates were involved in promoting fruiting body maturation, but also in
      regulating the number of fruiting bodies that developed after fertilization. The 
      same effect of inositol was seen in two other fungi, Sordaria macrospora and
      Chaetomium globosum. Key role of the inositol polyphosphate pathway during
      fruiting body maturation appears thus conserved during the evolution of
      Sordariales fungi.

AB  - Cranial neural crest cells are a multipotent cell population that generate all
      the elements of the pharyngeal cartilage with differentiation into chondrocytes
      tightly regulated by temporal intracellular and extracellular cues. Here, we
      demonstrate a novel role for miR-27, a highly enriched microRNA in the pharyngeal
      arches, as a positive regulator of chondrogenesis. Knock down of miR-27 led to
      nearly complete loss of pharyngeal cartilage by attenuating proliferation and
      blocking differentiation of pre-chondrogenic cells. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
      is a key regulator in integrin-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion and
      has been proposed to function as a negative regulator of chondrogenesis. We show 
      that FAK is downregulated in the pharyngeal arches during chondrogenesis and is a
      direct target of miR-27. Suppressing the accumulation of FAK in miR-27 morphants 
      partially rescued the severe pharyngeal cartilage defects observed upon knock
      down of miR-27. These data support a crucial role for miR-27 in promoting
      chondrogenic differentiation in the pharyngeal arches through regulation of FAK.

TI  - The C. elegans Spalt-like protein SEM-4 functions through the SoxC transcription

AB  - Proper development of a multicellular organism relies on well-coordinated
      regulation of cell fate specification, cell proliferation and cell
      differentiation. The C. elegans postembryonic mesoderm provides a useful system
      for uncovering factors involved in these processes and for further dissecting
      their regulatory relationships. The single Spalt-like zinc finger containing
      protein SEM-4/SALL is known to be involved in specifying the proliferative sex
      myoblast (SM) fate. We have found that SEM-4/SALL is sufficient to promote the SM
      fate and that it does so in a cell autonomous manner. We further showed that
      SEM-4/SALL acts through the SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 to promote the SM
      fate. SEM-2 is known to promote the SM fate by inhibiting the expression of two
      BWM-specifying transcription factors. In light of recent findings in mammals
      showing that Sall4, one of the mammalian homologs of SEM-4, contributes to
      pluripotency regulation by inhibiting differentiation, our work suggests that the
      function of SEM-4/SALL proteins in regulating pluripotency versus differentiation
      appears to be evolutionarily conserved.

AB  - Neuron-glial interactions are crucial for growth, guidance and ensheathment of
      axons across species. In the Drosophila CNS midline, neuron-glial interactions
      underlie ensheathment of commissural axons by midline glial (MG) cells in a
      manner similar to mammalian oligodendrocytes. Although there has been some
      advance in the study of neuron-glial interactions and ensheathment of axons in
      the CNS midline, key aspects of axonal ensheathment are still not fully
      understood. One of the limitations has been the unavailability of MG membrane
      markers that could highlight the glial processes wrapping the axons. Previous
      studies have identified two key molecular players from the neuronal and glial
      cell types in the CNS midline. These are the neuronal transmembrane protein
      Neurexin IV (Nrx IV) and the membrane-anchored MG protein Wrapper, both of which 
      interact in trans to mediate neuron-glial interactions and ensheathment of
      commissural axons. In the current study, we attempt to further our understanding 
      of MG biology and try to overcome some of the technical difficulties posed by the
      lack of a robust MG driver that will specifically allow expression or knockdown
      of genes in MG. We report the generation of BAC transgenic flies of wrapper-GAL4 
      and demonstrate how these flies could be used as a genetic tool to understand MG 
      biology. We have utilized the GAL4/UAS system to drive GFP-reporter lines
      (membrane-bound mCD8-GFP; microtubule-associated tau-GFP) and nuclear lacZ using 
      wrapper-GAL4 to highlight the MG cells and/or their processes that surround and
      perform axonal ensheathment functions in the embryonic midline. We also describe 
      the utility of the wrapper-GAL4 driver line to down-regulate known MG genes
      specifically in Wrapper-positive cells. Finally, we validate the functionality of
      the wrapper-GAL4 driver by rescue of wrapper mutant phenotypes and lethality.
      Together, these studies provide us with a versatile genetic tool to investigate
      MG functions and will aid in future investigations where genetic screens using
      wrapper-GAL4 could be designed to identify novel molecular players at the
      Drosophila midline and unravel key aspects of MG biology.

AB  - Nuclear hormone receptors play a major role in the development of many tissues.
      This study uncovers a novel role for testicular receptor 2 (Tr2, Nr2c1) in
      defining the early phase of retinal development and regulating normal retinal
      cell patterning and topography. The mammalian retina undergoes an overlapping yet
      biphasic period of development to generate all seven retinal cell types. We
      discovered that Nr2c1 expression coincides with development of the early retinal 
      cells. Loss of Nr2c1 causes a severe vision deficit and impacts early, but not
      late retina cell types. Retinal cone cell topography is disrupted with an
      increase in displaced amacrine cells. Additionally, genetic background
      significantly impacts phenotypic outcome of cone photoreceptor cells but not
      amacrine cells. Chromatin-IP experiments reveal NR2C1 regulates early cell
      transcription factors that regulate retinal progenitor cells during development, 
      including amacrine (Satb2) and cone photoreceptor regulators thyroid and retinoic
      acid receptors. This study supports a role for Nr2c1 in defining the biphasic
      period of retinal development and specifically influencing the early phase of
      retinal cell fate.

AB  - The migration and fate of cranial and vagal neural crest-derived progenitor cells
      (NCPCs) have been extensively studied; however, much less is known about sacral
      NCPCs particularly in regard to their distribution in the urogenital system. To
      construct a spatiotemporal map of NCPC migration pathways into the developing
      lower urinary tract, we utilized the Sox10-H2BVenus transgene to visualize NCPCs 
      expressing Sox10. Our aim was to define the relationship of Sox10-expressing
      NCPCs relative to bladder innervation, smooth muscle differentiation, and
      vascularization through fetal development into adulthood. Sacral NCPC migration
      is a highly regimented, specifically timed process, with several potential
      regulatory mileposts. Neuronal differentiation occurs concomitantly with sacral
      NCPC migration, and neuronal cell bodies are present even before the pelvic
      ganglia coalesce. Sacral NCPCs reside within the pelvic ganglia anlagen through
      13.5 days post coitum (dpc), after which they begin streaming into the bladder
      body in progressive waves. Smooth muscle differentiation and vascularization of
      the bladder initiate prior to innervation and appear to be independent processes.
      In adult bladder, the majority of Sox10+ cells express the glial marker S100beta,
      consistent with Sox10 being a glial marker in other tissues. However, rare Sox10+
      NCPCs are seen in close proximity to blood vessels and not all are S100beta+,
      suggesting either glial heterogeneity or a potential nonglial role for Sox10+
      cells along vasculature. Taken together, the developmental atlas of Sox10+ NCPC
      migration and distribution profile of these cells in adult bladder provided here 
      will serve as a roadmap for future investigation in mouse models of lower urinary
      tract dysfunction.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are at the origin of adult hematopoiesis,
      providing an organism with all blood cell types needed throughout life. During
      embryonic development a first wave of hematopoiesis (independent of HSCs) allows 
      the survival and growth of the embryo until birth. A second wave of hematopoiesis
      that will last into adulthood depends on the production of HSCs that begins at
      mid-gestation in large arteries such as the aorta. HSC production occurs through 
      a hemogenic endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) process and the
      formation of hematopoietic clusters in most vertebrate species. Advances in
      understanding EHT, cluster formation and HSC production were triggered by
      combined progresses made in the development of in vivo assays, microscopy,
      imaging and fluorescence tools. Here, we review the current knowledge on
      developmental hematopoiesis with a focus on the first step of HSC production in
      the aorta and how microscopic approaches have contributed to a better
      understanding of the vital process of blood cell formation.

AB  - Hox genes are crucial players in the generation and pattering of the vertebrate
      trunk and posterior body during embryogenesis. Their initial expression takes
      place shortly after the establishment of the primitive streak, in the
      posterior-most part of the mouse embryo and is a determinant step for setting up 
      the definitive Hox expression boundaries along the antero-posterior body axis.
      The developmental signals and epigenetic mechanisms underlying this early
      activation remained unsolved until recently. The development of novel
      embryo-derived model systems, combined with methods that examine chromatin status
      and chromosome conformation, led to deeper understanding of the process of Hox
      activation in the early embryo. Here we summarize how the early Hox
      cis-regulatory landscape becomes active upon receiving the appropriate
      developmental signal, and we discuss the importance of the local topological
      segmentation of the HoxA cluster during early Hox activation.

AB  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) remove phosphate groups from tyrosine
      residues, and thereby propagate or inhibit signal transduction, and hence
      influence cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation. The 
      importance of tightly controlled PTP activity is reflected by the numerous
      mechanisms employed by the cell to control PTP activity, including a variety of
      post-translational modifications, and restricted subcellular localization. This
      review highlights the strides made in the last decade and discusses the important
      role of PTPs in key aspects of embryonic development: the regulation of stem cell
      self-renewal and differentiation, gastrulation and somitogenesis during early
      embryonic development, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis. The tentative importance
      of PTPs in these processes is highlighted by the diseases that present upon
      aberrant activity.

AB  - During the last 100 years, the Hubrecht Institute evolved from a small laboratory
      aimed at providing research material to the scientific community to a modern,
      fully equipped research institute with state-of-the-art infrastructure,
      performing research at the highest standard. The past 100 years have been
      eventful for the Hubrecht Institute with many glorious moments, but also threats 
      to be shut down on several occasions. Here, we will briefly review the rich
      history of the Hubrecht Institute.

AB  - Adult stem cells self-renew and replenish differentiated cells in various organs 
      and tissues throughout a mammal's life. Over the last 25 years an ever-growing
      body of knowledge has unraveled the essential regulation of adult mammalian
      epithelia by the canonical Wnt signaling with its key intracellular effector
      beta-catenin. In this review, we discuss the principles of the signaling pathway 
      and its role in adult epithelial stem cells of the intestine and skin during
      homeostasis and tumorigenesis. We further highlight the research that led to the 
      identification of new stem cell markers and methods to study adult stem cells ex 
      vivo.

AB  - Homeostasis of tissues is tightly regulated at the cellular, tissue and
      organismal level. Interestingly, tumor cells have found ways to hijack many of
      these physiological processes at all the different levels. Here we review how
      intravital microscopy techniques have provided new insights into our
      understanding of tissue homeostasis and cancer progression. In addition, we
      highlight the different strategies that tumor cells have adopted to use these
      physiological processes for their own benefit. We describe how visualization of
      these dynamic processes in living mice has broadened to our view on cancer
      initiation and progression.

AB  - DNA repair pathways are crucial to maintain the integrity of our genome and
      prevent genetic diseases such as cancer. There are many different types of DNA
      damage and specific DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to deal with these
      lesions. In addition to these repair pathways there is an extensive signaling
      network that regulates processes important for repair, such as cell cycle control
      and transcription. Despite extensive research, DNA damage repair and signaling
      are not fully understood. In vitro systems such as the Xenopus egg extract
      system, have played, and still play, an important role in deciphering the
      molecular details of these processes. Xenopus laevis egg extracts contain all
      factors required to efficiently perform DNA repair outside a cell, using
      mechanisms conserved in humans. These extracts have been used to study several
      genome maintenance pathways, including mismatch repair, non-homologous end
      joining, ICL repair, DNA damage checkpoint activation, and replication fork
      stability. Here we describe how the Xenopus egg extract system, in combination
      with specifically designed DNA templates, contributed to our detailed
      understanding of these pathways.

AB  - Classically, we think of cell compartmentalization as being achieved by
      membrane-bound organelles. It has nevertheless emerged that membrane-less
      assemblies also largely contribute to this compartmentalization. Here, we compare
      the characteristics of both types of compartmentalization in term of maintenance 
      of functional identities. Furthermore, membrane less-compartments are critical
      for sustaining developmental and cell biological events as they control major
      metabolic pathways. We describe two examples related to this issue in Drosophila,
      the role of P-bodies in the translational control of gurken in the Drosophila
      oocyte, and the formation of Sec bodies upon amino-acid starvation in Drosophila 
      cells.

AB  - One hundred years of the Hubrecht Institute were celebrated in May 2016 with the 
      organization of a one-day symposium "From embryos to stem cells" on the Uithof
      Campus, Utrecht, the Netherlands. Nine distinguished speakers were invited. They 
      all represent a research branch originating from the passion of Institute
      founder, Ambrosius Hubrecht, for embryology:, regulation of gene expression,
      genome structure and function, embryonic and adult stem cells, nuclear
      reprogramming, and understanding cancer and other diseases using model organisms.
      The centennial symposium not only retraced the history of the Institute and of
      modern developmental biology, but was also a tribute to basic research. From
      there, avenues to therapeutics are being developed and implemented. The symposium
      was organized, introduced and chaired by Jeroen den Hertog and Alexander van
      Oudenaarden, the present Directors of the Institute, who also stand on Hubrecht's
      shoulders.

TI  - Lamprey neural crest migration is Snail-dependent and occurs without a
      differential shift in cadherin expression.

AB  - The acquisition of neural crest cells was a key step in the origin of the
      vertebrate body plan. An outstanding question is how neural crest cells acquired 
      their ability to undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate
      extensively throughout the vertebrate embryo. We tested if differential
      regulation of classical cadherins-a highly conserved feature of neural crest EMT 
      and migration in jawed vertebrates-mediates these cellular behaviors in lamprey, 
      a basal jawless vertebrate. Lamprey has single copies of the type I and type II
      classical cadherins (CadIA and CadIIA). CadIIA is expressed in premigratory
      neural crest, and requires the transcription factor Snail for proper expression, 
      yet CadIA is never expressed in the neural tube during neural crest development, 
      suggesting that differential regulation of classical cadherin expression is not
      required to initiate neural crest migration in basal vertebrates. We hypothesize 
      that neural crest cells evolved by retention of regulatory programs linking
      distinct mesenchymal and multipotency properties, and emigrated from the neural
      tube without differentially regulating type I/type II cadherins. Our results
      point to the coupling of mesenchymal state and multipotency as a key event
      facilitating the origin of migratory neural crest cells.

AB  - Macrophages are required for proper mammary gland development and maintaining
      tissue homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which macrophages regulate this
      process remain unclear. Here, we identify STAT5 as an important regulator of
      macrophage function in the developing mammary gland. Analysis of mammary glands
      from mice with STAT5-deficient macrophages demonstrates delayed ductal
      elongation, enhanced ductal branching and increased epithelial proliferation.
      Further analysis reveals that STAT5 deletion in macrophages leads to enhanced
      expression of proliferative factors such as Cyp19a1/aromatase and IL-6.
      Mechanistic studies demonstrate that STAT5 binds directly to the Cyp19a1 promoter
      in macrophages to suppress gene expression and that loss of STAT5 results in
      enhanced stromal expression of aromatase. Finally, we demonstrate that STAT5
      deletion in macrophages cooperates with oncogenic initiation in mammary
      epithelium to accelerate the formation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
      hyperplasias. These studies establish the importance of STAT5 in macrophages
      during ductal morphogenesis in the mammary gland and demonstrate that altering
      STAT5 function in macrophages can affect the development of tissue-specific
      disease.

      epidermis of the appendicularian, Oikopleura dioica.

AB  - Mechanisms for morphogenetic processes that generate complex patterns in a
      reproducible manner remain elusive. Live imaging provides a powerful tool to
      record cell behaviors. The appendicularian, Oikopleura dioica, is a planktonic
      tunicate that has a rapid developmental speed, small number of cells (less than
      3500 cells in a juvenile), and a transparent body. The trunk epidermis, called
      the oikoplastic epithelium (OE), has elaborate cellular arrangements showing a
      complex pattern to secrete so-called "house" made of extracellular components.
      The OE is characterized by invariant number, size, and shape of the monolayer
      epithelial cells. Pattern formation is achieved during 5h of larval development
      without growth of the body, making this a suitable system for live imaging of a
      two-dimensional (2D) sheet. First, we subdivided the OE and defined several
      domains by cellular resolution, and systematically gave names to the constituent 
      cells, since there is no variation among individuals. Time-lapse imaging of the
      epidermal cells revealed region-specific pattern formation processes. Each
      identified domain served as a compartment into which distribution of descendant
      cells of founder cells is restricted. Regulation of orientation, timing, and the 
      number of rounds of cell divisions, but not cell death and migration, was a
      critical mechanism for determination of final cell arrangement and size. In
      addition, displacement of epithelial sheet plates was observed in the Eisen
      domain. Stem-cell-like cell divisions, whereby large mother stem cells generate a
      chain of small daughter cells, were involved in formation of the Nasse region and
      ventral sensory organ. These are the first examples of this kind of
      stem-cell-like cell division in deuterostomes. Furthermore, labeling of the left 
      or right blastomere of the two-cell-stage embryo, which roughly gives rise to the
      left or right side of the body, respectively, revealed that the boundary of the
      descendant cells does not match with the midline of the trunk epidermis. Left and
      right descendants largely invade into the opposite side in an invariant way,
      suggesting the possibility that specification of the OE cell identities may occur
      later in development, most probably around hatching, and depending on cell
      position in the OE epithelial sheet. These detailed descriptions of OE patterning
      processes provide basic and essential information to analyze further cell
      behaviors in the generation of elaborate and intricate but stereotyped 2D
      cellular patterns in this advantageous model system for developmental and cell
      biological studies in chordates.

AB  - Understanding genetic interactions during early development of a given organism, 
      is the first step toward unveiling gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern a 
      biological process of interest. Predicting such interactions from large
      expression datasets by performing targeted knock-down/knock-out approaches is a
      challenging task. We use the currently available expression datasets (in situ
      hybridization images & qPCR time series) for a basal anthozoan the sea anemone N.
      vectensis to construct continuous spatiotemporal gene expression patterns during 
      its early development. Moreover, by combining cluster results from each dataset
      we develop a method that provides testable hypotheses about potential genetic
      interactions. We show that the analysis of spatial gene expression patterns
      reveals functional regions of the embryo during the gastrulation. The clustering 
      results from qPCR time series unveils significant temporal events and highlights 
      genes potentially involved in N. vectensis gastrulation. Furthermore, we
      introduce a method for merging the clustering results from spatial and temporal
      datasets by which we can group genes that are expressed in the same region and at
      the time. We demonstrate that the merged clusters can be used to identify GRN
      interactions involved in various processes and to predict possible activators or 
      repressors of any gene in the dataset. Finally, we validate our methods and
      results by predicting the repressor effect of NvErg on NvBra in the central
      domain during the gastrulation that has recently been confirmed by functional
      analysis.

AB  - Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells is essential for tissue homeostasis in
      metazoans. Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified signaling
      cascades that activate CED-10/Rac1 GTPase and promote actin cytoskeletal
      rearrangement during apoptotic cell engulfment. However, the molecular connection
      between CED-10 activation and actin reorganization remains elusive. Here, we
      provide evidence that CED-10 binds to the Arp2/3 nucleation promoting factor
      WASP; CED-10 recruits WASP and Arp2/3 to apoptotic cell corpses in the
      phagocytes. The loss of WASP and Arp2/3 impaired cell corpse engulfment.
      Furthermore, we uncover that a WASP-activating factor SEM-5/GRB2 functions in the
      phagocytes to promote cell corpse clearance. Together, our results suggest CED-10
      reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton by recruiting the WASP-Arp2/3 actin nucleation
      factors during apoptotic cell engulfment.

AB  - The function of Notch signaling was previously studied in two cnidarians, Hydra
      and Nematostella, representing the lineages Hydrozoa and Anthozoa, respectively. 
      Using pharmacological inhibition in Hydra and a combination of pharmacological
      and genetic approaches in Nematostella, it was shown in both animals that Notch
      is required for tentacle morphogenesis and for late stages of stinging cell
      maturation. Surprisingly, a role for Notch in neural development, which is well
      documented in bilaterians, was evident in embryonic Nematostella but not in adult
      Hydra. Adult neurogenesis in the latter seemed to be unaffected by DAPT, a drug
      that inhibits Notch signaling. To address this apparent discrepancy, we studied
      the role of Notch in Hydractinia echinata, an additional hydrozoan, in all life
      stages. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis, transgenesis, and pharmacological
      interference we show that Notch is dispensable for Hydractinia normal
      neurogenesis in all life stages but is required for the maturation of stinging
      cells and for tentacle morphogenesis. Our results are consistent with a conserved
      role for Notch in morphogenesis and nematogenesis across Cnidaria, and a
      lineage-specific loss of Notch dependence in neurogenesis in hydrozoans.

AB  - Hair follicles of the mammalian epidermis display local order and global
      alignment, a complex pattern instructed by the core planar cell polarity (PCP)
      pathway. Here we address the contributions of core PCP genes, Van Gogh-like and
      Frizzled, to the establishment, local refinement, and global order of embryonic
      and postnatal hair follicles. We find that, similar to Fz6 mutants, the
      disordered hair patterns of Vangl2 mutants are refined over time and eventually
      corrected. In both mutants, we find that tissue-level reorientation occurs
      through locally coordinated follicle rotation at stereotyped locations.
      Strikingly, Vangl2 and Fz6 mutant follicles collectively rotate with opposing
      directionalities, suggesting that redundant core PCP signals contribute to their 
      directed realignment. Consistently, global follicle alignment is not restored
      upon conditional ablation of both Vangl1 and Vangl2 genes. Instead, spatially
      distinct patterns of whorls and crosses emerge and persist even after a complete 
      cycle of hair follicle regeneration. Thus, local refinement of hair follicles
      into higher order patterns can occur independently of the core PCP system,
      however, their global alignment with the body axes requires PCP function
      throughout morphogenesis, growth and regeneration.

TI  - The zebrafish kidney mutant zeppelin reveals that brca2/fancd1 is essential for
      pronephros development.

AB  - The zebrafish kidney is conserved with other vertebrates, making it an excellent 
      genetic model to study renal development. The kidney collects metabolic waste
      using a blood filter with specialized epithelial cells known as podocytes.
      Podocyte formation is poorly understood but relevant to many kidney diseases, as 
      podocyte injury leads to progressive scarring and organ failure. zeppelin (zep)
      was isolated in a forward screen for kidney mutants and identified as a
      homozygous recessive lethal allele that causes reduced podocyte numbers,
      deficient filtration, and fluid imbalance. Interestingly, zep mutants had a
      larger interrenal gland, the teleostean counterpart of the mammalian adrenal
      gland, which suggested a fate switch with the related podocyte lineage since cell
      proliferation and cell death were unchanged within the shared progenitor field
      from which these two identities arise. Cloning of zep by whole genome sequencing 
      (WGS) identified a splicing mutation in breast cancer 2, early onset
      (brca2)/fancd1, which was confirmed by sequencing of individual fish. Several
      independent brca2 morpholinos (MOs) phenocopied zep, causing edema, reduced
      podocyte number, and increased interrenal cell number. Complementation analysis
      between zep and brca2(ZM_00057434) -/- zebrafish, which have an insertional
      mutation, revealed that the interrenal lineage was expanded. Importantly,
      overexpression of brca2 rescued podocyte formation in zep mutants, providing
      critical evidence that the brca2 lesion encoded by zep specifically disrupts the 
      balance of nephrogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest for the first time
      that brca2/fancd1 is essential for vertebrate kidney ontogeny. Thus, our findings
      impart novel insights into the genetic components that impact renal development, 
      and because BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations in humans cause Fanconi anemia and several
      common cancers, this work has identified a new zebrafish model to further study
      brca2/fancd1 in disease.

TI  - Six3 in a small population of progenitors at E8.5 is required for neuroretinal
      specification via regulating cell signaling and survival in mice.

AB  - Neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are differentiated from the
      progenitors in optic vesicles, but it is unclear when and how the two lineages
      are segregated. Manipulation of chick embryos reveals that the early
      anteroventral optic vesicle is crucial for neuroretinal development, but the
      molecular mechanism is unclear. Homeodomain transcription factor Six3 is required
      for neuroretinal specification and is dispensable for RPE formation, but the cell
      fates of Six3-deficient progenitors and the origins of remnant RPE are unknown.
      Here, we performed lineage tracing of Six3-Cre positive cells in wild-type and
      Six3-deficient mouse embryos. Six3-Cre positive progenies were found in a
      population of progenitors in the anteroventral optic pits/vesicles starting at
      E8.5, and were found in neuroretina, optic stalk, ventral forebrain, but not RPE,
      at E10.5. Six3-deletion in the small population of progenitors at E8.5 was
      sufficient to cause rostral expansion of Wnt8b and drastic reduction of Fgf8/MAPK
      signaling, ablating neuroretinal specification without affecting RPE. Lineage
      tracing revealed Six3-deficient progenitors at E8.5 were eventually lost and the 
      remnant RPE was derived from Six3-Cre negative cells. Thus, Six3 in a small
      population of progenitors expressing Six3-Cre at E8.5 is required for
      neuroretinal specification via regulating cell signaling and survival in mice.

AB  - Complement components have been implicated in a wide variety of functions
      including neurogenesis, proliferation, cell migration, differentiation, cancer,
      and more recently early development and regeneration. Following our initial
      observations indicating that C3a/C3aR signaling induces chick retina
      regeneration, we analyzed its role in chick eye morphogenesis. During eye
      development, the optic vesicle (OV) invaginates to generate a bilayer optic cup
      (OC) that gives rise to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and neural retina.
      We show by immunofluorescence staining that C3 and the receptor for C3a (the
      cleaved and active form of C3), C3aR, are present in chick embryos during eye
      morphogenesis in the OV and OC. Interestingly, C3aR is mainly localized in the
      nuclear compartment at the OC stage. Loss of function studies at the OV stage
      using morpholinos or a blocking antibody targeting the C3aR (anti-C3aR Ab),
      causes eye defects such as microphthalmia and defects in the ventral portion of
      the eye that result in coloboma. Such defects were not observed when C3aR was
      disrupted at the OC stage. Histological analysis demonstrated that microphthalmic
      eyes were unable to generate a normal optic stalk or a closed OC. The
      dorsal/ventral patterning defects were accompanied by an expansion of the ventral
      markers Pax2, cVax and retinoic acid synthesizing enzyme raldh-3 (aldh1a3)
      domains, an absence of the dorsal expression of Tbx5 and raldh-1 (aldh1a1) and a 
      re-specification of the ventral RPE to neuroepithelium. In addition, the eyes
      showed overall decreased expression of Gli1 and a change in distribution of
      nuclear beta-catenin, suggesting that Shh and Wnt pathways have been affected.
      Finally, we observed prominent cell death along with a decrease in proliferating 
      cells, indicating that both processes contribute to the microphthalmic phenotype.
      Together our results show that C3aR is necessary for the proper morphogenesis of 
      the OC. This is the first report implicating C3aR in eye development, revealing
      an unsuspected hitherto regulator for proper chick eye morphogenesis.

AB  - Signaling mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is essential for the
      migration of cells toward chemoattractants. The recruitment of neutrophils to
      injured tissues in zebrafish larvae is a useful model for studying neutrophil
      migration and trafficking in vivo. Indeed, the study of this process led to the
      discovery that PI3Kgamma is required for the polarity and motility of
      neutrophils, features that are necessary for the directed migration of these
      cells to wounds. However, the mechanism by which PI3Kgamma is activated remains
      to be determined. Here we show that signaling by specifically the heterotrimeric 
      G protein subunit Gbeta1 is critical for neutrophil migration in response to
      wounding. In embryos treated with small-molecule inhibitors of Gbetagamma
      signaling, neutrophils failed to migrate to wound sites. Although both the Gbeta1
      and Gbeta4 isoforms are expressed in migrating neutrophils, only deficiency for
      the former (morpholino-based knockdown) interfered with the directed migration of
      neutrophils towards wounds. The Gbeta1 deficiency also impaired the ability of
      cells to change cell shape and reduced their general motility, defects that are
      similar to those in neutrophils deficient for PI3Kgamma. Transplantation assays
      showed that the requirement for Gbeta1 in neutrophil migration is cell
      autonomous. Finally, live imaging revealed that Gbeta1 is required for polarized 
      activation of PI3K, and for the actin dynamics that enable neutrophil migration. 
      Collectively, our data indicate that Gbeta1 signaling controls proper neutrophil 
      migration by activating PI3K and modulating actin dynamics. Moreover, they
      illustrate a role for a specific Gbeta isoform in chemotaxis in vivo.

      and lens morphogenesis.

AB  - Tissue development and regeneration involve high-ordered morphogenetic processes 
      that are governed by elements of the cytoskeleton in conjunction with cell
      adhesion molecules. Such processes are particularly important in the lens whose
      structure dictates its function. Studies of our lens-specific N-cadherin
      conditional knockout mouse (N-cadcKO) revealed an essential role for N-cadherin
      in the migration of the apical tips of differentiating lens fiber cells along the
      apical surfaces of the epithelium, a region termed the Epithelial Fiber Interface
      (EFI), that is necessary for normal fiber cell elongation and the morphogenesis. 
      Studies of the N-cadcKO lens suggest that N-cadherin function in fiber cell
      morphogenesis is linked to the activation of Rac1 and myosin II, both signaling
      pathways central to the regulation of cell motility including determining the
      directionality of cellular movement. The absence of N-cadherin did not disrupt
      lateral contacts between fiber cells during development, and the maintenance of
      Aquaporin-0 and increased expression of EphA2 at cell-cell interfaces suggests
      that these molecules may function in this role. E-cadherin was maintained in
      newly differentiating fiber cells without interfering with expression of
      lens-specific differentiation proteins but was not able to replace N-cadherin
      function in these cells. The dependence of migration of the fiber cell apical
      domains along the EFI for lens morphogenesis on N-cadherin provides new insight
      into the process of tissue development.

AB  - Rough environmental conditions make the survival of many multi-cellular organisms
      almost impossible, enforcing behavioral, morphological, physiological and
      reproductive rejoinders that can cope with harsh times and hostile environments, 
      frequently through down-regulation of metabolism into basal states of dormancy,
      or torpor. This study examines one of the most unique torpor strategies seen
      within the phylum Chordata, exhibited by the colonial urochordate Botrylloides
      leachi, which enters a state of hibernation or aestivation in response to thermal
      stress, during which all of its functional colonial units (zooids) are entirely
      absorbed and the colony survives as small remnants of the vasculature, lacking
      both feeding and reproduction organs. Tissue vestiges then regenerate fully
      functional colony when re-exposed to milder environmental conditions. The whole
      metamorphic cycle of hibernation and arousal was studied here and divided into
      seven major stages, during which the anatomical characteristics of the zooids,
      the blood cell populations and the expression patterns of some "stem cell"
      markers were monitored. The first two phases are associated with the shortening
      of the blastogenic cycles from the typical 7-day cycle to 3-5day long cycles and 
      with the significant diminution of zooids, leaving a carpet of vasculature.
      During hibernation this colonial carpet is made of a twisted, opaque and
      condensed mass of vasculature, loaded with condensed masses of blood cells that
      possess two types of multicellular structures, the 20-50microm "morula-like"
      opaque balls of cells, and small single-layer epithelial spheres, "blastula-like"
      structures (50-80microm). Arousal from hibernation starts with the emergence of
      several clear tunic areas among the vasculature lacunae, which then turn into
      transparent buds that become progressively larger and opaque. This is followed by
      sluggish, newfangled cell movement within the vasculature, which increases in
      intensity and rate over time. A closer examination of the vasculature revealed
      dramatic vicissitudes in the blood cell constituency as hibernation progressed,
      which is manifested by the appearance of two novel cell types not recorded in
      regular colonies, the multinucleate cells (MNC) and storage cells, each with 2-3 
      distinct cell morphs. Using mixtures of pre-labeled where half stained with a
      florescent marker for membranes and half stained for DNA we recorded within 2-3
      days from onset new MNC stained by both staining, attesting for the de novo
      formation of MNC through cells fusion. At the outset of hibernation we documented
      high expression levels of PIWI, PL-10 and PCNA in cells residing in cell islands 
      (CIs), which are the specific stem cell niches found along the endostyle at the
      ventral side of the zooids. During hibernation, most of the PIWI(+)/
      PL-10(+)/PCNA(+) cells were the MNCs, now located in the newly shaped and dilated
      vasculature, where they increased in numbers. Also, most of the PCNA(+) cells
      were identified as MNCs. We further documented that the Bl-PIWI RNA (in situ
      hybridization) and protein (immunohistochemistry) expressions documented during
      the hibernation/arousal processes diverged significantly from normal
      blastogenesis expressions. Counting PIWI(+) blood cells at various blastogenic
      stages revealed a significant increase as the hibernation progressed, peaking in 
      aroused colonies at an average of 30 PIWI(+) cells/ampulla. The Pl-10 protein
      expression patterns in the zooids and buds changed as the hibernation progressed,
      similar to the PIWI and PCNA expressions. Considering the evolutionary
      perspectives to hibernation we propose linkages to the disposable-soma theory.

AB  - During neural tube closure, regulated changes at the level of individual cells
      are translated into large-scale morphogenetic movements to facilitate conversion 
      of the flat neural plate into a closed tube. Throughout this process, the
      integrity of the neural epithelium is maintained via cell interactions through
      intercellular junctions, including apical tight junctions. Members of the claudin
      family of tight junction proteins regulate paracellular permeability,
      apical-basal cell polarity and link the tight junction to the actin cytoskeleton.
      Here, we show that claudins are essential for neural tube closure: the
      simultaneous removal of Cldn3, -4 and -8 from tight junctions caused
      folate-resistant open neural tube defects. Their removal did not affect cell type
      differentiation, neural ectoderm patterning nor overall apical-basal polarity.
      However, apical accumulation of Vangl2, RhoA, and pMLC were reduced, and Par3 and
      Cdc42 were mislocalized at the apical cell surface. Our data showed that claudins
      act upstream of planar cell polarity and RhoA/ROCK signaling to regulate cell
      intercalation and actin-myosin contraction, which are required for convergent
      extension and apical constriction during neural tube closure, respectively.

AB  - Visual information processing in animals with large image forming eyes is carried
      out in highly structured retinotopically ordered neuropils. Visual neuropils in
      Drosophila form the optic lobe, which consists of four serially arranged major
      subdivisions; the lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate; the latter three of
      these are further subdivided into multiple layers. The visual neuropils are
      formed by more than 100 different cell types, distributed and interconnected in
      an invariant highly regular pattern. This pattern relies on a protracted sequence
      of developmental steps, whereby different cell types are born at specific time
      points and nerve connections are formed in a tightly controlled sequence that has
      to be coordinated among the different visual neuropils. The developing fly visual
      system has become a highly regarded and widely studied paradigm to investigate
      the genetic mechanisms that control the formation of neural circuits. However,
      these studies are often made difficult by the complex and shifting patterns in
      which different types of neurons and their connections are distributed throughout
      development. In the present paper we have reconstructed the three-dimensional
      architecture of the Drosophila optic lobe from the early larva to the adult.
      Based on specific markers, we were able to distinguish the populations of
      progenitors of the four optic neuropils and map the neurons and their
      connections. Our paper presents sets of annotated confocal z-projections and
      animated 3D digital models of these structures for representative stages. The
      data reveal the temporally coordinated growth of the optic neuropils, and clarify
      how the position and orientation of the neuropils and interconnecting tracts
      (inner and outer optic chiasm) changes over time. Finally, we have analyzed the
      emergence of the discrete layers of the medulla and lobula complex using the same
      markers (DN-cadherin, Brp) employed to systematically explore the structure and
      development of the central brain neuropil. Our work will facilitate experimental 
      studies of the molecular mechanisms regulating neuronal fate and connectivity in 
      the fly visual system, which bears many fundamental similarities with the retina 
      of vertebrates.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) is an extensive network of neurons in the gut
      wall that arises from neural crest-derived cells. Like other populations of
      neural crest cells, it is known that enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCCs)
      influence the behaviour of each other and therefore must communicate. However,
      little is known about how ENCCs communicate with each other. In this study, we
      used Ca(2+) imaging to examine communication between ENCCs in the embryonic gut, 
      using mice where ENCCs express a genetically-encoded calcium indicator.
      Spontaneous propagating calcium waves were observed between neighbouring ENCCs,
      through both neuronal and non-neuronal ENCCs. Pharmacological experiments showed 
      wave propagation was not mediated by gap junctions, but by purinergic signalling 
      via P2 receptors. The expression of several P2X and P2Y receptors was confirmed
      using RT-PCR. Furthermore, inhibition of P2 receptors altered the morphology of
      the ENCC network, without affecting neuronal differentiation or ENCC
      proliferation. It is well established that purines participate in synaptic
      transmission in the mature ENS. Our results describe, for the first time,
      purinergic signalling between ENCCs during pre-natal development, which plays
      roles in the propagation of Ca(2+) waves between ENCCs and in ENCC network
      formation. One previous study has shown that calcium signalling plays a role in
      sympathetic ganglia formation; our results suggest that calcium waves are likely 
      to be important for enteric ganglia development.

AB  - Fertilization is a multi-step process that begins with plasma membrane
      interactions that enable sperm - oocyte binding followed by fusion of the sperm
      and oocyte plasma membranes. Once membrane fusion has occurred, sperm
      incorporation involves actin remodeling events within the oocyte cortex that
      allow the sperm head to penetrate the cortical actin layer and gain access to the
      ooplasm. Despite the significance for reproduction, the control mechanisms
      involved in gamete binding, fusion, and sperm incorporation are poorly
      understood. While it is known that proline - rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2 or
      PTK2b) kinase activity plays an important role in fertilization, its specific
      function has not been addressed. The present study made use of a zona-free mouse 
      oocyte fertilization assay to investigate the relationship between PYK2 activity 
      and sperm - oocyte binding and fusion, as well as localized changes in actin
      polymerization and sperm incorporation. In this assay, the majority of bound
      sperm had no apparent effect on the oocyte and only a few became incorporated
      into the ooplasm. However, a subset of bound sperm were associated with a
      localized response in which PYK2 was recruited to the oocyte cortex where it
      frequently co-localized with a ring or disk of f-actin. The frequency of
      sperm-oocyte binding sites that exhibited this actin response was reduced in
      pyk2(-/-) oocytes and the pyk2(-/-) oocytes proved less efficient at
      incorporating sperm, indicating that this protein kinase may have an important
      role in sperm incorporation. The response of PYK2 to sperm-oocyte interaction
      appeared unrelated to gamete fusion since PYK2 was recruited to sperm - binding
      sites under conditions where sperm - oocyte fusion was prevented and since PYK2
      suppression or ablation did not prevent sperm - oocyte fusion. While a direct
      correlation between the PYK2 response in the oocyte and the successful
      incorporation of individual bound sperm remains to be established, these findings
      suggest a model in which the oocyte is not a passive participant in
      fertilization, but instead responds to sperm contact by localized PYK2 signaling 
      that promotes actin remodeling events required to physically incorporate the
      sperm head into the ooplasm.

AB  - Wilms tumor 1 (Wt1) is an essential factor for urogenital system development.
      Teleosts have two wt1s, named as wt1a and wt1b. In this study, the expression
      pattern of wt1a and wt1b and their functions on the urogenital system were
      analyzed by in situ hybridization and CRISPR/Cas9. wt1a was found to be expressed
      in the glomerulus at 3 dah (days after hatching), earlier than wt1b. wt1a and
      wt1b were simultaneously expressed in the somatic cells of gonads at 3 dah, while
      their cell locations were similar, but not identical in adult fish gonads. The
      wt1a(-/-) fish displayed pericardial edema and yolk sac edema at 3 dah and
      subsequently expanded as general body edema at 6 dah, failed to develop
      glomerulus and died during 6-10 dah, whereas the wt1b(-/-) fish were
      phenotypically normal. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the germ cell
      marker Vasa was expressed, while somatic cell genes Cyp19a1a, Amh, Gsdf and Dmrt1
      were not expressed in the wt1a(-/-) gonads at 6 dah. The sex phenotypes of XX and
      XY in the wt1b(-/-) fish were not affected. Real-time PCR revealed that the
      ovarian cyp19a1a expression was up-regulated in XX wt1b(-/-) fish, compared with 
      XX control at 90 dah. Serum estradiol-17beta level was also up-regulated in XX
      wt1b(-/-) fish at 90 and 180 dah. The XY wt1b(-/-) fish had normal serum
      estradiol-17beta and 11-ketotestosterone levels and remained fertile. These
      results suggest that Wt1a and Wt1b have different functions in the kidneys and
      gonads of tilapia.

AB  - The loss of sensory hair cells from the inner ear is a leading cause of hearing
      and balance disorders. The mammalian ear has a very limited ability to replace
      lost hair cells, but the inner ears of non-mammalian vertebrates can
      spontaneously regenerate hair cells after injury. Prior studies have shown that
      replacement hair cells are derived from epithelial supporting cells and that the 
      differentiation of new hair cells is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway.
      The present study examined molecular influences on regeneration in the avian
      utricle, which has a particularly robust regenerative ability. Chicken utricles
      were placed in organotypic culture and hair cells were lesioned by application of
      the ototoxic antibiotic streptomycin. Cultures were then allowed to regenerate in
      vitro for seven days. Some specimens were treated with small molecule inhibitors 
      of gamma-secretase or ADAM10, proteases which are essential for transmission of
      Notch signaling. As expected, treatment with both inhibitors led to increased
      numbers of replacement hair cells. However, we also found that inhibition of both
      proteases resulted in increased regenerative proliferation. Subsequent
      experiments showed that inhibition of gamma-secretase or ADAM10 could also
      trigger proliferation in undamaged utricles. To better understand these
      phenomena, we used RNA-Seq profiling to characterize changes in gene expression
      following gamma-secretase inhibition. We observed expression patterns that were
      consistent with Notch pathway inhibition, but we also found that the utricular
      sensory epithelium contains numerous gamma-secretase substrates that might
      regulate cell cycle entry and possibly supporting cell-to-hair cell conversion.
      Together, our data suggest multiple roles for gamma-secretase and ADAM10 in
      vestibular hair cell regeneration.

AB  - In multicellular organisms, the specification, maintenance, and transmission of
      the germ cell lineage to subsequent generations are critical processes that
      ensure species survival. A number of studies suggest that the Bone Morphogenetic 
      Protein (BMP) pathway plays multiple roles in this cell lineage. We wished to use
      a comparative framework to examine the role of BMP signaling in regulating these 
      processes, to determine if patterns would emerge that might shed light on the
      evolution of molecular mechanisms that may play germ cell-specific or other
      reproductive roles across species. To this end, here we review evidence to date
      from the literature supporting a role for BMP signaling in reproductive processes
      across Metazoa. We focus on germ line-specific processes, and separately consider
      somatic reproductive processes. We find that from primordial germ cell (PGC)
      induction to maintenance of PGC identity and gametogenesis, BMP signaling
      regulates these processes throughout embryonic development and adult life in
      multiple deuterostome and protostome clades. In well-studied model organisms,
      functional genetic evidence suggests that BMP signaling is required in the germ
      line across all life stages, with the exception of PGC specification in species
      that do not use inductive signaling to induce germ cell formation. The current
      evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that BMP signaling is ancestral in
      bilaterian inductive PGC specification. While BMP4 appears to be the most broadly
      employed ligand for the reproductive processes considered herein, we also noted
      evidence for sex-specific usage of different BMP ligands. In gametogenesis, BMP6 
      and BMP15 seem to have roles restricted to oogenesis, while BMP8 is restricted to
      spermatogenesis. We hypothesize that a BMP-based mechanism may have been
      recruited early in metazoan evolution to specify the germ line, and was
      subsequently co-opted for use in other germ line-specific and somatic
      reproductive processes. We suggest that if future studies assessing the function 
      of the BMP pathway across extant species were to include a reproductive focus,
      that we would be likely to find continued evidence in favor of an ancient
      association between BMP signaling and the reproductive cell lineage in animals.

AB  - The highly recognizable animals within the phylum Echinodermata encompass an
      enormous disparity of adult and larval body plans. The extensive knowledge of sea
      urchin development has culminated in the description of the exquisitely detailed 
      gene regulatory network (GRN) that governs the specification of various embryonic
      territories. This information provides a unique opportunity for comparative
      studies in other echinoderm taxa to understand the evolution and developmental
      mechanisms underlying body plan change. This review focuses on recent work that
      has utilized new genomic resources and systems-level experiments to address
      questions of evolutionary developmental biology. In particular, we synthesize the
      results of several recent studies from various echinoderm classes that have
      explored the development and evolution of the larval skeleton, which is a major
      feature that distinguishes the two predominant larval subtypes within the Phylum.
      We specifically examine the ways in which GRNs can evolve, either through cis
      regulatory and/or protein-level changes in transcription factors. We also examine
      recent work comparing evolution across shorter time scales that occur within and 
      between species of sea urchin, and highlight the kinds of questions that can be
      addressed by these comparisons. The advent of new genomic and transcriptomic
      datasets in additional species from all classes of echinoderm will continue to
      empower the use of these taxa for evolutionary developmental studies.

AB  - Vertebrate morphology has been evolutionarily modified by natural and/or
      artificial selection. The morphological variation of goldfish is a representative
      example. In particular, the twin-tail strain of ornamental goldfish shows highly 
      diverged anal and caudal fin morphology: bifurcated anal and caudal fins. Recent 
      molecular developmental genetics research revealed that a stop codon mutation in 
      one of the two recently duplicated chordin genes is important for the highly
      diverged fin morphology of twin-tail goldfish. However, some issues still need to
      be discussed in the context of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). For
      example, the bifurcated anal and caudal fins of twin-tail goldfish provided early
      researchers with insights into the origin of paired fins (pectoral and pelvic
      fins), but no subsequent researchers have discussed this topic. In addition,
      although the fossil jawless vertebrate species Euphanerops is also known to have 
      had a bifurcated anal fin, how the bifurcated anal fin of twin-tail goldfish is
      related to that of fossil jawless vertebrate species has never been investigated.
      In this review, we present an overview of the early anatomical and embryological 
      studies of twin-tail goldfish. Moreover, based on the similarity of embryonic
      features between the secondarily bifurcated competent stripe in twin-tail
      goldfish and the trunk bilateral competent stripes in conventional gnathostomes, 
      we hypothesized that they share the same molecular developmental mechanisms. We
      also postulate that the bifurcated anal fin of Euphanerops might be caused by the
      same type of modification of dorsal-ventral patterning that occurs in the
      twin-tail goldfish, unlike the previously suggested evolutionary process that
      required the co-option of paired fin developmental mechanisms. Understanding the 
      molecular developmental genetics of twin-tail goldfish allows us to further
      investigate the evolutionary developmental mechanisms of the origin of paired
      fins.

AB  - Metazoan evolution encompasses a vast evolutionary time scale spanning over 600
      million years. Our ability to infer ancestral metazoan characters, both
      morphological and functional, is limited by our understanding of the nature and
      evolutionary dynamics of the underlying regulatory networks. Increasing coverage 
      of metazoan genomes enables us to identify the evolutionary changes of the
      relevant genomic characters such as the loss or gain of coding sequences, gene
      duplications, micro- and macro-synteny, and non-coding element evolution in
      different lineages. In this review we describe recent advances in our
      understanding of ancestral metazoan coding and non-coding features, as deduced
      from genomic comparisons. Some genomic changes such as innovations in gene and
      linkage content occur at different rates across metazoan clades, suggesting some 
      level of independence among genomic characters. While their contribution to
      biological innovation remains largely unclear, we review recent literature about 
      certain genomic changes that do correlate with changes to specific developmental 
      pathways and metazoan innovations. In particular, we discuss the origins of the
      recently described pharyngeal cluster which is conserved across deuterostome
      genomes, and highlight different genomic features that have contributed to the
      evolution of this group. We also assess our current capacity to infer ancestral
      metazoan states from gene models and comparative genomics tools and elaborate on 
      the future directions of metazoan comparative genomics relevant to evo-devo
      studies.

AB  - The apparent evolvability of the vertebrate head skeleton has allowed a diverse
      array of shapes, sizes, and compositions of the head in order to better adapt
      species to their environments. This encompasses feeding, breathing, sensing, and 
      communicating: the head skeleton somehow participated in the evolution of all
      these critical processes for the last 500 million years. Through evolution,
      present head diversity was made possible via developmental modifications to the
      first head skeletal genetic program. Understanding the development of the
      vertebrate common ancestor's head skeleton is thus an important step in
      identifying how different lineages have respectively achieved their many
      innovations in the head. To this end, cyclostomes (jawless vertebrates) are
      extremely useful, having diverged from jawed vertebrates approximately 400
      million years ago, at the deepest node within living vertebrates. From this
      ancestral vantage point (that is, the node connecting cyclostomes and
      gnathostomes) we can best identify the earliest major differences in development 
      between vertebrate classes, and start to address how these might translate onto
      morphology. In this review we survey what is currently known about the cell
      biology and gene expression during head development in modern vertebrates,
      allowing us to better characterize the developmental genetics driving head
      skeleton formation in the most recent common ancestor of all living vertebrates. 
      By pairing this vertebrate composite with information from fossil chordates, we
      can also deduce how gene regulatory modules might have been arranged in the
      ancestral vertebrate head. Together, we can immediately begin to understand which
      aspects of head skeletal development are the most conserved, and which are
      divergent, informing us as to when the first differences appear during
      development, and thus which pathways or cell types might be involved in
      generating lineage specific shape and structure.

AB  - Animals rely on genomic regulatory systems to direct the dynamic spatiotemporal
      and cell-type specific gene expression that is essential for the development and 
      maintenance of a multicellular lifestyle. Although it is widely appreciated that 
      these systems ultimately evolved from genomic regulatory mechanisms present in
      single-celled stem metazoans, it remains unclear how this occurred. Here, we
      focus on the contribution of the non-coding portion of the genome to the
      evolution of animal gene regulation, specifically on recent insights from
      non-bilaterian metazoan lineages, and unicellular and colonial holozoan sister
      taxa. High-throughput next-generation sequencing, largely in bilaterian model
      species, has led to the discovery of tens of thousands of non-coding RNA genes
      (ncRNAs), including short, long and circular forms, and uncovered the central
      roles they play in development. Based on the analysis of non-bilaterian metazoan,
      unicellular holozoan and fungal genomes, the evolution of some ncRNAs, such as
      Piwi-interacting RNAs, correlates with the emergence of metazoan
      multicellularity, while others, including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and
      circular RNAs, appear to be more ancient. Analysis of non-coding regulatory DNA
      and histone post-translational modifications have revealed that some
      cis-regulatory mechanisms, such as those associated with proximal promoters, are 
      present in non-animal holozoans, while others appear to be metazoan innovations, 
      most notably distal enhancers. In contrast, the cohesin-CTCF system for
      regulating higher-order chromatin structure and enhancer-promoter long-range
      interactions appears to be restricted to bilaterians. Taken together, most
      bilaterian non-coding regulatory mechanisms appear to have originated before the 
      divergence of crown metazoans. However, differential expansion of non-coding RNA 
      and cis-regulatory DNA repertoires in bilaterians may account for their increased
      regulatory and morphological complexity relative to non-bilaterians.

AB  - Skeletogenic mesenchyme cells in echinoids are suitable for studying
      developmental mechanisms, and have been used extensively. Most of these studies
      have been performed on species in the order Camarodonta, which are modern
      echinoids (subclass Euechinoidea) and are considered "model" echinoid species. In
      contrast, species belonging to other orders are studied less frequently,
      especially investigations of their molecular developmental biology such as gene
      regulatory networks. Recent studies on mesenchyme development in non-camarodont
      species suggest that these species are potential sources of comparative
      information to elucidate the mechanisms underlying skeletogenic mesenchyme
      development. In this review, the importance of using comparative data to
      understand development and evolution is discussed.

AB  - Intensive artificial selection over thousands of years has produced hundreds of
      varieties of domestic pigeon. As Charles Darwin observed, the morphological
      differences among breeds can rise to the magnitude of variation typically
      observed among different species. Nevertheless, different pigeon varieties are
      interfertile, thereby enabling forward genetic and genomic approaches to identify
      genes that underlie derived traits. Building on classical genetic studies of
      pigeon variation, recent molecular investigations find a spectrum of coding and
      regulatory alleles controlling derived traits, including plumage color, feather
      growth polarity, and limb identity. Developmental and genetic analyses of pigeons
      are revealing the molecular basis of variation in a classic example of extreme
      intraspecific diversity, and have the potential to nominate genes that control
      variation among other birds and vertebrates in general.

TI  - Yorkie regulates epidermal wound healing in Drosophila larvae independently of
      cell proliferation and apoptosis.

AB  - Yorkie (Yki), the transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo signaling pathway,
      has well-characterized roles in balancing apoptosis and cell division during
      organ growth control. Yki is also required in diverse tissue regenerative
      contexts. In most cases this requirement reflects its well-characterized roles in
      balancing apoptosis and cell division. Whether Yki has repair functions outside
      of the control of cell proliferation, death, and growth is not clear. Here we
      show that Yki and Scalloped (Sd) are required for epidermal wound closure in the 
      Drosophila larval epidermis. Using a GFP-tagged Yki transgene we show that Yki
      transiently translocates to some epidermal nuclei upon wounding. Genetic analysis
      strongly suggests that Yki interacts with the known wound healing pathway, Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not with Platelet Derived Growth
      Factor/Vascular-Endothelial Growth Factor receptor (Pvr). Yki likely acts
      downstream of or parallel to JNK signaling and does not appear to regulate either
      proliferation or apoptosis in the larval epidermis during wound repair. Analysis 
      of actin structures after wounding suggests that Yki and Sd promote wound closure
      through actin regulation. In sum, we found that Yki regulates an epithelial
      tissue repair process independently of its previously documented roles in
      balancing proliferation and apoptosis.

AB  - The tear film protects the terrestrial animal's ocular surface and the lacrimal
      gland provides important aqueous secretions necessary for its maintenance.
      Despite the importance of the lacrimal gland in ocular health, molecular aspects 
      of its development remain poorly understood. We have identified a noncoding RNA
      (miR-205) as an important gene for lacrimal gland development. Mice lacking
      miR-205 fail to properly develop lacrimal glands, establishing this noncoding RNA
      as a key regulator of lacrimal gland development. Specifically, more than half of
      knockout lacrimal glands never initiated, suggesting a critical role of miR-205
      at the earliest stages of lacrimal gland development. RNA-seq analysis uncovered 
      several up-regulated miR-205 targets that may interfere with signaling to impair 
      lacrimal gland initiation. Supporting this data, combinatorial epistatic deletion
      of Fgf10, the driver of lacrimal gland initiation, and miR-205 in mice
      exacerbates the lacrimal gland phenotype. We develop a molecular rheostat model
      where miR-205 modulates signaling pathways related to Fgf10 in order to regulate 
      glandular development. These data show that a single microRNA is a key regulator 
      for early lacrimal gland development in mice and highlights the important role of
      microRNAs during organogenesis.

TI  - Modelling asymmetric somitogenesis: Deciphering the mechanisms behind species
      differences.

AB  - Somitogenesis is one of the major hallmarks of bilateral symmetry in vertebrates.
      This symmetry is lost when retinoic acid (RA) signalling is inhibited, allowing
      the left-right determination pathway to influence somitogenesis. In all three
      studied vertebrate model species, zebrafish, chicken and mouse, the frequency of 
      somite formation becomes asymmetric, with slower gene expression oscillations
      driving somitogenesis on the right side. Still, intriguingly, the resulting
      left-right asymmetric phenotypes differ significantly between these model
      species. While somitogenesis is generally considered as functionally equivalent
      among different vertebrates, substantial differences exist in the subset of
      oscillating genes between different vertebrate species. Variation also appears to
      exist in the way oscillations cease and somite boundaries become patterned. In
      addition, in absence of RA, the FGF8 gradient thought to constitute the
      determination wavefront becomes asymmetric in zebrafish and mouse, extending more
      anteriorly to the right, while remaining symmetric in chicken. Here we use a
      computational modelling approach to decipher the causes underlying species
      differences in asymmetric somitogenesis. Specifically, we investigate to what
      extent differences can be explained from observed differences in FGF asymmetry
      and whether differences in somite determination dynamics may also be involved. We
      demonstrate that a simple clock-and-wavefront model incorporating the observed
      left-right differences in somitogenesis frequency readily reproduces asymmetric
      somitogenesis in chicken. However, incorporating asymmetry in FGF signalling was 
      insufficient to robustly reproduce mouse or zebrafish asymmetry phenotypes. In
      order to explain these phenoptypes we needed to extend the basic model,
      incorporating species-specific details of the somitogenesis determination
      mechanism. Our results thus demonstrate that a combination of differences in FGF 
      dynamics and somite determination cause species differences in asymmetric
      somitogenesis. In addition,they highlight the power of using computational models
      as well as studying left-right asymmetry to obtain more insight in somitogenesis.

AB  - The C. elegans gut descends from the E progenitor cell through a series of
      stereotyped cell divisions and morphogenetic events. Effects of perturbations of 
      upstream cell specification on downstream organogenesis have not been extensively
      investigated. Here we have assembled an allelic series of strains that variably
      compromise specification of E by perturbing the activation of the gut-specifying 
      end-1 and end-3 genes. Using a marker that allows identification of all E
      descendants regardless of fate, superimposed with markers that identify cells
      that have adopted a gut fate, we have examined the fate of E lineage descendants 
      among hundreds of embryos. We find that when specification is partially
      compromised, the E lineage undergoes hyperplasia accompanied by stochastic and
      variable specification of gut fate among the E descendants. As anticipated by
      prior work, the activation of the gut differentiation factor elt-2 becomes
      delayed in these strains, although ultimate protein levels of a translational
      ELT-2::GFP reporter resemble those of the wild type. By comparing these effects
      among the various specification mutants, we find that the stronger the defect in 
      specification (i.e. the fewer number of embryos specifying gut), the stronger the
      defects in the E lineage and delay in activation of elt-2. Despite the changes in
      the E lineage in these strains, we find that supernumerary E descendants that
      adopt a gut fate are accommodated into a relatively normal-looking intestine.
      Hence, upstream perturbation of specification dramatically affects the E lineage,
      but as long as sufficient descendants adopt a gut fate, organogenesis overcomes
      these effects to form a relatively normal intestine.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are essential signaling proteins that regulate
      diverse cellular functions in developmental and metabolic processes. In
      Drosophila, the FGF homolog, branchless (bnl) is expressed in a dynamic and
      spatiotemporally restricted pattern to induce branching morphogenesis of the
      trachea, which expresses the Bnl-receptor, breathless (btl). Here we have
      developed a new strategy to determine bnl- expressing cells and study their
      interactions with the btl-expressing cells in the range of tissue patterning
      during Drosophila development. To enable targeted gene expression specifically in
      the bnl expressing cells, a new LexA based bnl enhancer trap line was generated
      using CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing. Analyses of the spatiotemporal expression
      of the reporter in various embryonic stages, larval or adult tissues and in
      metabolic hypoxia, confirmed its target specificity and versatility. With this
      tool, new bnl expressing cells, their unique organization and functional
      interactions with the btl-expressing cells were uncovered in a larval
      tracheoblast niche in the leg imaginal discs, in larval photoreceptors of the
      developing retina, and in the embryonic central nervous system. The targeted
      expression system also facilitated live imaging of simultaneously labeled Bnl
      sources and tracheal cells, which revealed a unique morphogenetic movement of the
      embryonic bnl- source. Migration of bnl- expressing cells may create a dynamic
      spatiotemporal pattern of the signal source necessary for the directional growth 
      of the tracheal branch. The genetic tool and the comprehensive profile of
      expression, organization, and activity of various types of bnl-expressing cells
      described in this study provided us with an important foundation for future
      research investigating the mechanisms underlying Bnl signaling in tissue
      morphogenesis.

AB  - During early fetal development, paracrine Hedgehog (HH) ligands secreted from the
      foregut epithelium activate Gli transcription factors in the surrounding
      mesenchyme to coordinate formation of the respiratory system, digestive track and
      the cardiovascular network. Although disruptions to this process can lead to
      devastating congenital defects, the underlying mechanisms and downstream targets,
      are poorly understood. We show that the zinc finger transcription factor Osr1 is 
      a novel HH target as Osr1 expression in the foregut mesenchyme depends on HH
      signaling and the effector of HH pathway Gli3 binds to a conserved genomic loci
      near Osr1 promoter region. Molecular analysis of mouse germline Osr1 mutants
      reveals multiple functions of Osr1 during foregut development. Osr1 mutants
      exhibit fewer lung progenitors in the ventral foregut. Osr is then required for
      the proper branching of the primary lung buds, with mutants exhibiting
      miss-located lung lobes. Finally, Osr1 is essential for proper mesenchymal
      differentiation including pulmonary arteries, esophageal and tracheal smooth
      muscle as well as tracheal cartilage rings. Tissue specific conditional knockouts
      in combination with lineage tracing indicate that Osr1 is required cell
      autonomously in the foregut mesenchyme. We conclude that Osr1 is a novel
      downstream target of HH pathway, required for lung specification, branching
      morphogenesis and foregut mesenchymal differentiation.

      pseudogenization of the Xenopus laevis homoeologs six6.L and six6.S.

AB  - Common models for the evolution of duplicated genes after genome duplication are 
      subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, and pseudogenization. Although the
      crucial roles of cis-regulatory mutations in subfunctionalization are
      well-documented, their involvement in pseudogenization and/or
      neofunctionalization remains unclear. We addressed this issue by investigating
      the evolution of duplicated homeobox genes, six6.L and six6.S, in the
      allotetraploid frog Xenopus laevis. Based on a comparative expression analysis,
      we observed similar eye-specific expression patterns for the two loci and their
      single ortholog in the ancestral-type diploid species Xenopus tropicalis.
      However, we detected lower levels of six6.S expression than six6.L expression.
      The six6.S enhancer sequence was more highly diverged from the orthologous
      enhancer of X. tropicalis than the six6.L enhancer, and showed weaker activity in
      a transgenic reporter assay. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the protein
      sequences, we observed greater divergence between X. tropicalis Six6 and Six6.S
      than between X. tropicalis Six6 and Six6.L, and the observed mutations were
      reminiscent of a microphthalmia mutation in human SIX6. Misexpression experiments
      showed that six6.S has weaker eye-enlarging activity than six6.L, and targeted
      disruption of six6.L reduced the eye size more significantly than that of six6.S.
      These results suggest that enhancer attenuation stimulates the accumulation of
      hypomorphic coding mutations, or vice versa, in one duplicated gene copy and
      facilitates pseudogenization. We also underscore the value of the allotetraploid 
      genome of X. laevis as a resource for studying latent pathogenic mutations.

AB  - Crosstalk between mesenchymal and epithelial cells influences organogenesis in
      multiple tissues, such as lung, pancreas, liver, and the nervous system. Lung
      mesenchyme comprises multiple cell types, however, and precise identification of 
      the mesenchymal cell type(s) that drives early events in lung development remains
      unknown. Endothelial cells have been shown to be required for some aspects of
      lung epithelial patterning, lung stem cell differentiation, and regeneration
      after injury. Furthermore, endothelial cells are involved in early liver and
      pancreas development. From these observations we hypothesized that endothelial
      cells might also be required for early specification of the respiratory field and
      subsequent lung bud initiation. We first blocked VEGF signaling in E8.5 cultured 
      foreguts with small molecule VEGFR inhibitors and found that lung specification
      and bud formation were unaltered. However, when we examined E9.5 mouse embryos
      carrying a mutation in the VEGFR Flk-1, which do not develop endothelial cells,
      we found that respiratory progenitor specification was impeded. Because the E9.5 
      embryos were substantially smaller than control littermates, suggesting the
      possibility of developmental delay, we isolated and cultured foreguts from mutant
      and control embryos on E8.5, when no size differences were apparent. We found
      that both specification of the respiratory field and lung bud formation occurred 
      in mutant and control explants. These observations were unaffected by the
      presence or absence of serum. We also observed that hepatic specification and
      initiation occurred in the absence of endothelial cells, and that expansion of
      the liver epithelium in culture did not differ between mutant and control
      explants. Consistent with previously published results, we also found that
      pancreatic buds were not maintained in cultured foreguts when endothelial cells
      were absent. Our observations support the conclusion that endothelial cells are
      not required for early specification of lung progenitors and bud initiation, and 
      that the diminished lung specification seen in E9.5 Flk(-/-) embryos is likely
      due to developmental delay resulting from the insufficient delivery of oxygen,
      nutrients, and other factors in the absence of a vasculature.

AB  - In order to examine interactions between cells originating from different species
      during embryonic development we constructed interspecific mouse<-->rat chimaeras 
      by aggregation of 8-cell embryos. Embryos of both species expressed different
      fluorescent markers (eGFP and DsRed), which enabled us to follow the fate of both
      components from the moment of aggregation until adulthood. We revealed that in
      majority of embryos the blastocyst cavity appeared inside the group of rat cells,
      while the mouse component was allocated to the deeper layer of the inner cell
      mass and to the polar trophectoderm. However, due to rearrangement of all cells
      and selective elimination of rat cells, shortly before implantation all primary
      lineages became chimaeric. Moreover, despite the fact that rat cells were always 
      present in the mural trophectoderm, majority of mouse<-->rat chimaeric
      blastocysts implanted in mouse uterus, and out of those 46% developed into
      foetuses and pups, half of which were chimaeric. In contrast to mural
      trophectoderm, polar trophectoderm derivatives, i.e. the placentae of all
      chimaeras were exclusively of mouse origin. This strongly suggests that the
      successful postimplantation development of chimaeras is enabled by gradual
      elimination of xenogeneic cells from the nascent placenta. The size of chimaeric 
      newborns was within the limits of control mouse neonates. The rat component
      located preferentially in the anterior part of the body, where it contributed
      mainly to the neural tube. Our observations indicate that although chimaeric
      animals were able to reach adulthood, high contribution of rat cells tended to
      diminish their viability.

AB  - Pericytes heterogeneity is based on their morphology, distribution, and markers. 
      It is well known that pericytes from different organs may have distinct embryonic
      sources. Yamazaki et al. (2017) using several transgenic mouse model reveal by
      cell-lineage tracing that pericytes are even more heterogeneous than previously
      appreciated. This study shows that pericytes from within the same tissue may be
      heterogeneous in their origin. Remarkably, a subpopulation of embryonic dermal
      pericytes derives from the hematopoietic lineage, an unexpected source.
      Reconstructing the lineage of pericytes is central to understanding development, 
      and also for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in which pericytes play
      important roles.

AB  - Lineage tracing of specific populations of progenitor cells provides crucial
      information about developmental programs. Four members of the Dlx homeobox gene
      family, Dlx1,2, 5 and 6, are involved in the specification of gamma-aminobutyric 
      acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the vertebrate forebrain. Orthologous genes in
      mammals and teleost show similarities in expression patterns and transcriptional 
      regulation mechanisms. We have used lineage tracing to permanently label
      dlx-expressing cells in the zebrafish and have characterized the progeny of these
      cells in the larva and in the juvenile and adult brain. We have found that
      dlx1a/2a and dlx5a/6a expressing progenitors give rise, for the most part, to
      small populations of cells which constitute only a small proportion of GABAergic 
      cells in the adult brain tissue. Moreover, some of the cells do not acquire a
      neuronal phenotype suggesting that, regardless of the time a cell expresses dlx
      genes in the brain, it can potentially give rise to cells other than neurons. In 
      some instances, labeling larval dlx5a/6a-expressing cells, but not
      dlx1a/2a-expressing cells, results in massively expanding, widespread clonal
      expansion throughout the adult brain. Our data provide a detailed lineage
      analysis of the dlx1a/2a and dlx5a/6a expressing progenitors in the zebrafish
      brain and lays the foundation for further characterization of the role of these
      transcription factors beyond the specification of GABAergic neurons.

TI  - Non-muscle myosin II deletion in the developing kidney causes ureter-bladder
      misconnection and apical extrusion of the nephric duct lineage epithelia.

AB  - In kidney development, connection of the nephric duct (ND) to the cloaca and
      subsequent sprouting of the ureteric bud (UB) from the ND are important for
      urinary exit tract formation. Although the roles of Ret signaling are well
      established, it remains unclear how intracellular cytoskeletal proteins regulate 
      these morphogenetic processes. Myh9 and Myh10 encode two different non-muscle
      myosin II heavy chains, and Myh9 mutations in humans are implicated in congenital
      kidney diseases. Here we report that ND/UB lineage-specific deletion of
      Myh9/Myh10 in mice caused severe hydroureter/hydronephrosis at birth. At
      mid-gestation, the mutant ND/UB epithelia exhibited aberrant basal protrusion and
      ectopic UB formation, which likely led to misconnection of the ureter to the
      bladder. In addition, the mutant epithelia exhibited apical extrusion followed by
      massive apoptosis in the lumen, which could be explained by reduced apical
      constriction and intercellular adhesion mediated by E-cadherin. These phenotypes 
      were not ameliorated by genetic reduction of the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret. In
      contrast, ERK was activated in the mutant cells and its chemical inhibition
      partially ameliorated the phenotypes. Thus, myosin II is essential for
      maintaining the apicobasal integrity of the developing kidney epithelia
      independently of Ret signaling.

AB  - The eukaryotic initiation translation factor eIF6 is a highly conserved,
      essential protein implicated in translation. eIF6 is regulated in vivo by
      extracellular signals, such as IGF signaling (for a review see Miluzio et al.,
      2009). In Xenopus, eif6 over-expression causes a delay in eye development (De
      Marco et al., 2011). In this study we showed that eif6 co-immunoprecipitates with
      the insulin-like growth factor receptor (igfr) and may function downstream of igf
      in eye formation. The relationship between eif6 and gipc2, a protein partner of a
      variety of molecules including membrane proteins, was investigated. gipc2 is
      required for maintaining igf-induced akt activation on eye development (Wu et
      al., 2006). Significantly eif6 and gipc2 have opposite effects in eye
      development. While eif6 is required for eye formation below threshold levels,
      gipc2 knockdown impairs eye development (De Marco et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2006).
      In this study, it was shown that in eif6 over-expressors, the delay in eye
      morphogenesis is reversed by gipc2 injection, while the injection of eif6
      down-regulates gipc2 expression. Real-time-PCR indicates that eif6 regulates
      gipc2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, gipc2 knockdown has no 
      significant effect on eif6 mRNA levels. These results suggest that eif6
      regulation of gipc2 enables correct morphogenesis of Xenopus eye and stimulate
      questions on the molecular network implicated in this process.

AB  - The ancestral state of animal gastrulation and its bearing for our understanding 
      of bilaterian evolution still is one of the most controversially discussed topics
      in the field of evolutionary and developmental biology. One hypothesis, the
      so-called amphistomy scenario, suggests the presence of a slit-like blastopore in
      the last common ancestor of Bilateria. Onychophoran ontogeny at least
      superficially appears to support this scenario since a ventral groove clearly
      forms during gastrulation. The origin and nature of this groove, however, is
      another matter of ongoing controversy; i.e. the question of whether this
      structure actually represents the blastopore, or at least part of it. Recent
      research using genetic markers argued against the furrow representing a
      blastoporal structure. Here we investigate the origin of endoderm, which usually 
      originates from the blastopore. We find conserved expression patterns of the
      endoderm- and gut-marker genes GATA456, GATA123, Hnf4 and fkh during gut
      development, and discuss the formation of the onychophoran gut in comparison with
      that in a range of arthropods. Despite expression of endodermal markers in and
      around the furrow we do not find convincing evidence that the furrow may be part 
      of the blastopore, and thus we suggest that onychophoran development does not
      yield support for the amphistomy scenario.

AB  - Regeneration of body parts requires the replacement of multiple cell types. To
      dissect this complex process, we utilized planarian flatworms that are capable of
      regenerating any tissue after amputation. An RNAi screen for genes involved in
      regeneration of the pharynx identified a novel gene, Pharynx regeneration
      defective-1 (PHRED-1) as essential for normal pharynx regeneration. PHRED-1 is a 
      predicted transmembrane protein containing EGF, Laminin G, and WD40 domains, is
      expressed in muscle, and has predicted homologs restricted to other
      lophotrochozoan species. Knockdown of PHRED-1 causes abnormal regeneration of
      muscle fibers in both the pharynx and body wall muscle. In addition to defects in
      muscle regeneration, knockdown of PHRED-1 or the bHLH transcription factor MyoD
      also causes defects in muscle and intestinal regeneration. Together, our data
      demonstrate that muscle plays a key role in restoring the structural integrity of
      closely associated organs, and in planarians it may form a scaffold that
      facilitates normal intestinal branching.

AB  - The eye field transcription factor, Six6, is essential for both the early
      (specification and proliferative growth) phase of eye formation, as well as for
      normal retinal progenitor cell differentiation. While genomic regions driving
      six6 optic cup expression have been described, the sequences controlling eye
      field and optic vesicle expression are unknown. Two evolutionary conserved
      regions 5' and a third 3' to the six6 coding region were identified, and together
      they faithfully replicate the endogenous X. laevis six6 expression pattern.
      Transgenic lines were generated and used to determine the onset and expression
      patterns controlled by the regulatory regions. The conserved 3' region was
      necessary and sufficient for eye field and optic vesicle expression. In contrast,
      the two conserved enhancer regions located 5' of the coding sequence were
      required together for normal optic cup and mature retinal expression.
      Gain-of-function experiments indicate endogenous six6 and GFP expression in F1
      transgenic embryos are similarly regulated in response to candidate trans-acting 
      factors. Importantly, CRISPR/CAS9-mediated deletion of the 3' eye field/optic
      vesicle enhancer in X. laevis, resulted in a reduction in optic vesicle size.
      These results identify the cis-acting regions, demonstrate the modular nature of 
      the elements controlling early versus late retinal expression, and identify
      potential regulators of six6 expression during the early stages of eye formation.

AB  - Cell signaling pathways, such as Wnt, Hedgehog (Hh), Notch, and Hippo, are
      essential for embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tissue homeostasis. In this
      study, we analyzed 415 genes involved in these pathways in the allotetraploid
      frog, Xenopus laevis. Most genes are retained in two subgenomes called L and S
      (193 homeologous gene pairs and 29 singletons). This conservation rate of
      homeologs is much higher than that of all genes in the X. laevis genome (86.9% vs
      60.2%). Among singletons, 24 genes are retained in the L subgenome, a rate
      similar to the average for all genes (82.8% vs 74.6%). In addition, as general
      components of signal transduction, we also analyzed 32 heparan sulfate
      proteoglycan (HSPG)-related genes and eight TLE/Groucho transcriptional
      corepressors-related genes. In these gene sets, all homeologous pairs have been
      retained. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq data from developmental stages and
      adult tissues demonstrated that most homeologous pairs of signaling components
      have variable expression patterns, in contrast to the conservative expression
      profiles of homeologs for transcription factors. Our results indicate that
      homeologous gene pairs for cell signaling regulation have tended to become
      subfunctionalized after allotetraploidization. Diversification of signaling
      pathways by subfunctionalization of homeologs may enhance environmental
      adaptability. These results provide insights into the evolution of signaling
      pathways after polyploidization.

AB  - Keratin genes belong to the intermediate filament superfamily and their
      expression is altered following morphological and physiological changes in
      vertebrate epithelial cells. Keratin genes are divided into two groups, type I
      and II, and are clustered on vertebrate genomes, including those of Xenopus
      species. Various keratin genes have been identified and characterized by their
      unique expression patterns throughout ontogeny in Xenopus laevis; however,
      compilation of previously reported and newly identified keratin genes in two
      Xenopus species is required for our further understanding of keratin gene
      evolution, not only in amphibians but also in all terrestrial vertebrates. In
      this study, 120 putative type I and II keratin genes in total were identified
      based on the genome data from two Xenopus species. We revealed that most of these
      genes are highly clustered on two homeologous chromosomes, XLA9_10 and XLA2 in X.
      laevis, and XTR10 and XTR2 in X. tropicalis, which are orthologous to those of
      human, showing conserved synteny among tetrapods. RNA-Seq data from various
      embryonic stages and adult tissues highlighted the unique expression profiles of 
      orthologous and homeologous keratin genes in developmental stage- and
      tissue-specific manners. Moreover, we identified dozens of epidermal keratin
      proteins from the whole embryo, larval skin, tail, and adult skin using shotgun
      proteomics. In light of our results, we discuss the radiation, diversification,
      and unique expression of the clustered keratin genes, which are closely related
      to epidermal development and terrestrial adaptation during amphibian evolution,
      including Xenopus speciation.

AB  - Xenopus laevis has an allotetraploid genome of 3.1Gb, in contrast to the diploid 
      genome of a closely related species, Xenopus tropicalis. Here, we identified 412 
      genes (189 homeolog pairs, one homeologous gene cluster pair, and 28 singletons) 
      encoding transcription factors (TFs) in the X. laevis genome by comparing them
      with their orthologs from X. tropicalis. Those genes include the homeobox gene
      family (Mix/Bix, Lhx, Nkx, Paired, POU, and Vent), Sox, Fox, Pax, Dmrt, Hes,
      GATA, T-box, and some clock genes. Most homeolog pairs for TFs are retained in
      two X. laevis subgenomes, named L and S, at higher than average rates (87.1% vs
      60.2%). Among the 28 singletons, 82.1% were deleted from chromosomes of the S
      subgenome, a rate similar to the genome-wide average (82.1% vs 74.6%).
      Interestingly, nkx2-1, nkx2-8, and pax9, which reside consecutively in a
      postulated functional gene cluster, were deleted from the S chromosome,
      suggesting cluster-level gene regulation. Transcriptome correlation analysis
      demonstrated that TF homeolog pairs tend to have more conservative developmental 
      expression profiles than most other types of genes. In some cases, however,
      either of the homeologs may show strongly different spatio-temporal expression
      patterns, suggesting neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, or
      nonfunctionalization after allotetraploidization. Analyses of otx1 suggests that 
      homeologs with much lower expression levels have undergone greater amino acid
      sequence diversification. Our comprehensive study implies that TF homeologs are
      highly conservative after allotetraploidization, possibly because the DNA
      sequences that they bind were also duplicated, but in some cases, they differed
      in expression levels or became singletons due to dosage-sensitive regulation of
      their target genes.

AB  - Two siamois-related homeobox genes siamois (sia1) and twin (sia2), have been
      reported in Xenopus laevis. These genes are expressed in the blastula chordin-
      and noggin-expressing (BCNE) center and the Nieuwkoop center, and have complete
      secondary axis-inducing activity when over-expressed on the ventral side of the
      embryo. Using whole genome sequences of X. tropicalis and X. laevis, we
      identified two additional siamois-related genes, which are tandemly duplicated
      near sia1 and sia2 to form the siamois gene cluster. Four siamois genes in X.
      tropicalis are transcribed at blastula to gastrula stages. In X. laevis, the
      siamois gene cluster is present on both homeologous chromosomes, XLA3L and XLA3S.
      Transcripts from seven siamois genes (three on XLA3L and four on XLA3S) in X.
      laevis were detected at blastula to gastrula stages. A transcribed gene, sia1p.
      S, encodes an inactive protein without a homeodomain. When over-expressed
      ventrally, all siamois-related genes tested in this study except for sia1p. S
      induced a complete secondary axis, indicating that X. tropicalis and X. laevis
      have four and six active siamois-related genes, respectively. Of note, each gene 
      required different amounts of mRNA for full activity. These results suggest the
      possibility that siamois cluster genes have functional redundancy to endow
      robustness and quickness to organizer formation in Xenopus species.

AB  - Extracellular factors belonging to the TGF-beta family play pivotal roles in the 
      formation and patterning of germ layers during early Xenopus embryogenesis. Here,
      we show that the vg1 and nodal3 genes of Xenopus laevis are present in gene
      clusters on chromosomes XLA1L and XLA3L, respectively, and that both gene
      clusters have been completely lost from the syntenic S chromosome regions. The
      presence of gene clusters and chromosome-specific gene loss were confirmed by
      cDNA FISH analyses. Sequence and expression analyses revealed that paralogous
      genes in the vg1 and nodal3 clusters on the L chromosomes were also altered
      compared to their Xenopus tropicalis orthologs. X. laevis vg1 and nodal3 paralogs
      have potentially become pseudogenes or sub-functionalized genes and are expressed
      at different levels. As X. tropicalis has a single vg1 gene on chromosome XTR1,
      the ancestral vg1 gene in X. laevis appears to have been expanded on XLA1L. Of
      note, two reported vg1 genes, vg1(S20) and vg1(P20), reside in the cluster on
      XLA1L. The nodal3 gene cluster is also present on X. tropicalis chromosome XTR3, 
      but phylogenetic analysis indicates that nodal3 genes in X. laevis and X.
      tropicalis were independently expanded and/or evolved in concert within each
      cluster by gene conversion. These findings provide insights into the function and
      molecular evolution of TGF-beta family genes in response to
      allotetraploidization.

AB  - Inductive interactions mediated by the TGF-beta and FGF-MAPK pathways are
      essential for specification of the germ layers and embryonic body axes during
      early vertebrate embryogenesis. TGF-beta and FGF ligands signal through receptor 
      Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases, respectively, and these signaling pathways cross-talk to
      regulate transcription and cell behavior. The allotetraploid Xenopus laevis and
      its ancestral diploid Xenopus tropicalis are versatile model organisms with which
      to study the inductive interactions and mechanisms of these signal transduction
      pathways. Here we have analyzed the draft genome of X. laevis with respect to the
      genomic organization and differential expression of genes in the TGF-beta and FGF
      pathways. Genomic structure and gene expression analyses of pathway components in
      X. laevis revealed that genetic modulations, including deletions resulting in
      singletons and differential expression of homeologs, have occurred frequently
      among extracellular regulatory factors of the TGF-beta pathway after
      allotetraploidization. Moreover, differential gene expression was found for
      factors regulating various cellular responses including co-receptors, decoy
      receptors, and intracellular negative regulators in both the TGF-beta and
      FGF-MAPK pathways. We summarize the patterns of genetic alterations in the
      allotetraploid frog X. laevis and discuss the importance of these changes with
      regard to developmental processes.

      embryos.

AB  - Transposable elements are parasitic genomic elements that can be deleterious for 
      host gene function and genome integrity. Heterochromatic histone modifications
      are involved in the repression of transposons. However, it remains unknown how
      these histone modifications mark different types of transposons during embryonic 
      development. Here we document the variety of heterochromatic epigenetic
      signatures at parasitic elements during development in Xenopus tropicalis, using 
      genome-wide ChIP-sequencing data and ChIP-qPCR analysis. We show that specific
      subsets of transposons in various families and subfamilies are marked by
      different combinations of the heterochromatic histone modifications H4K20me3,
      H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me3. Many DNA transposons are marked at the blastula stage
      already, whereas at retrotransposons the histone modifications generally
      accumulate at the gastrula stage or later. Furthermore, transposons marked by
      H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 are more prominent in gene deserts. Using intra-subfamily
      divergence as a proxy for age, we show that relatively young DNA transposons are 
      preferentially marked by early embryonic H4K20me3 and H3K27me3. In contrast,
      relatively young retrotransposons are marked by increasing H3K9me3 and H4K20me3
      during development, and are also linked to piRNA-sized small non-coding RNAs. Our
      results implicate distinct repression mechanisms that operate in a
      transposon-selective and developmental stage-specific fashion.

AB  - The establishment of cell lineages occurs via a dynamic progression of gene
      regulatory networks (GRNs) that underlie developmental commitment and
      differentiation. To investigate how microRNAs (miRs) function in this process, we
      compared miRs and miR targets at the initiation of the two major ectodermal
      lineages in Xenopus. We used next-generation sequencing to identify over 170 miRs
      expressed in midgastrula ectoderm expressing either noggin or a constitutively
      active BMP receptor, reflecting anterior neural or epidermal ectoderm,
      respectively; 125 had not previously been identified in Xenopus. We identified
      the locations of the pre-miR sequences in the X. laevis genome. Neural and
      epidermal ectoderm express broadly similar sets of miRs. To identify targets of
      miR-dependent translational control, we co-immunoprecipitated
      Argonaute-Ribonucleoprotein (Ago-RNP) complexes from early neural and epidermal
      ectoderm and sequenced the associated RNA. The Ago-RNP RNAs from these tissues
      represent overlapping, yet distinct, subsets of genes. Moreover, the profile of
      Ago-RNP associated genes differs substantially from the profile of total RNAs in 
      these tissues. We generated target predictions for the "high confidence" Ago-RNP 
      RNAs using the identified ectodermal miRs; These RNAs generally had target sites 
      for multiple miRs. Oct4 orthologues, as well as many of their previously
      identified transcriptional targets, are represented in the Ago-RNP pool in both
      tissues, suggesting that miR-dependent regulation contributes to the
      downregulation of the oct4 gene regulatory network and the reduction in
      ectodermal pluripotency.

AB  - We describe a novel recessive and nonlethal pigmentation mutant in Xenopus
      tropicalis. The mutant phenotype can be initially observed in tadpoles after
      stage 39/40, when mutant embryos display markedly reduced pigmentation in the
      retina and the trunk. By tadpole stage 50 almost all pigmented melanophores have 
      disappeared. Most interestingly, those embryos fail entirely to make pigmented
      iridophores. The combined reduction/absence of both pigmented iridophores and
      melanophores renders these embryos virtually transparent, permitting one to
      easily observe both the developing internal organs and nervous system;
      accordingly, we named this mutant no privacy (nop). We identified the causative
      genetic lesion as occurring in the Xenopus homolog of the human Hermansky-Pudlak 
      Syndrome 6 (HPS6) gene, combining several approaches that utilized conventional
      gene mapping and classical and modern genetic tools available in Xenopus
      (gynogenesis, BAC transgenesis and TALEN-mediated mutagenesis). The nop allele
      contains a 10-base deletion that results in truncation of the Hps6 protein. In
      humans, HPS6 is one of the genes responsible for the congenital disease HPS,
      pathological symptoms of which include oculocutaneous albinism caused by defects 
      in lysosome-related organelles required for pigment formation. Markers for
      melanin-producing neural crest cells show that the cells that would give rise to 
      melanocytes are present in nop, though unpigmented. Abnormalities develop at
      tadpole stages in the pigmented retina when overall pigmentation becomes reduced 
      and large multi-melanosomes are first formed. Ear development is also affected in
      nop embryos when both zygotic and maternal hsp6 is mutated: otoliths are often
      reduced or abnormal in morphology, as seen in some mouse HPS mutations, but to
      our knowledge not described in the BLOC-2 subset of HPS mutations nor described
      in non-mammalian systems previously. The transparency of the nop line suggests
      that these animals will aid studies of early organogenesis during tadpole stages.
      In addition, because of advantages of the Xenopus system for assessing gene
      expression, cell biological mechanisms, and the ontogeny of melanosome and
      otolith formation, this should be a highly useful model for studying the
      molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of the HPS phenotype and the
      underlying biology of lysosome-related organelle function.

AB  - Regulation of alternative splicing is an important process for cell
      differentiation and development. Down-regulation of Ptbp1, a regulatory
      RNA-binding protein, leads to developmental skin defects in Xenopus laevis. To
      identify Ptbp1-dependent splicing events potentially related to the phenotype, we
      conducted RNAseq experiments following Ptbp1 depletion. We systematically
      compared exon-centric and junction-centric approaches to detect differential
      splicing events. We showed that the junction-centric approach performs far better
      than the exon-centric approach in Xenopus laevis. We carried out the same
      comparisons using simulated data in human, which led us to propose that the
      better performances of the junction-centric approach in Xenopus laevis
      essentially relies on an incomplete exonic annotation associated with a correct
      transcription unit annotation. We assessed the capacity of the exon-centric and
      junction-centric approaches to retrieve known and to discover new Ptbp1-dependent
      splicing events. Notably, the junction-centric approach identified
      Ptbp1-controlled exons in agfg1, itga6, actn4, and tpm4 mRNAs, which were
      independently confirmed. We conclude that the junction-centric approach allows
      for a more complete and informative description of splicing events, and we
      propose that this finding might hold true for other species with incomplete
      annotations.

      transcriptomic upheaval and stability.

AB  - The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) has long been the subject of biological
      research, primarily owing to its outstanding regenerative capabilities. However, 
      the gene expression programs governing its embryonic development are particularly
      underexplored, especially when compared to other amphibian model species.
      Therefore, we performed whole transcriptome polyA+ RNA sequencing experiments on 
      17 stages of embryonic development. As the axolotl genome is unsequenced and its 
      gene annotation is incomplete, we built de novo transcriptome assemblies for each
      stage and garnered functional annotation by comparing expressed contigs with
      known genes in other organisms. In evaluating the number of differentially
      expressed genes over time, we identify three waves of substantial transcriptome
      upheaval each followed by a period of relative transcriptome stability. The first
      wave of upheaval is between the one and two cell stage. We show that the number
      of differentially expressed genes per unit time is higher between the one and two
      cell stage than it is across the mid-blastula transition (MBT), the period of
      zygotic genome activation. We use total RNA sequencing to demonstrate that the
      vast majority of genes with increasing polyA+ signal between the one and two cell
      stage result from polyadenylation rather than de novo transcription. The first
      stable phase begins after the two cell stage and continues until the mid-blastula
      transition, corresponding with the pre-MBT phase of transcriptional quiescence in
      amphibian development. Following this is a peak of differential gene expression
      corresponding with the activation of the zygotic genome and a phase of
      transcriptomic stability from stages 9-11. We observe a third wave of
      transcriptomic change between stages 11 and 14, followed by a final stable
      period. The last two stable phases have not been documented in amphibians
      previously and correspond to times of major morphogenic change in the axolotl
      embryo: gastrulation and neurulation. These results yield new insights into
      global gene expression during early stages of amphibian embryogenesis and will
      help to further develop the axolotl as a model species for developmental and
      regenerative biology.

AB  - Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involve highly combinatorial interactions between
      transcription factors and short sequence motifs in cis-regulatory modules of
      target genes to control cellular phenotypes. The GRNs specifying most cell types 
      are largely unknown and are the subject of wide interest. A catalog of
      transcription factors is a valuable tool toward obtaining a deeper understanding 
      of the role of these critical effectors in any biological setting. Here we
      present a comprehensive catalog of the transcription factors for the diploid frog
      Xenopus tropicalis. We identify 1235 genes encoding DNA-binding transcription
      factors, comparable to the numbers found in typical mammalian species. In detail,
      the repertoire of X. tropicalis transcription factor genes is nearly identical to
      human and mouse, with the exception of zinc finger family members, and a small
      number of species/lineage-specific gene duplications and losses relative to the
      mammalian repertoires. We applied this resource to the identification of
      transcription factors differentially expressed in the early gastrula stage
      embryo. We find transcription factor enrichment in Spemann's organizer, the
      ventral mesoderm, ectoderm and endoderm, and report 218 TFs that show
      regionalized expression patterns at this stage. Many of these have not been
      previously reported as expressed in the early embryo, suggesting thus far
      unappreciated roles for many transcription factors in the GRNs regulating early
      development. We expect our transcription factor catalog will facilitate myriad
      studies using Xenopus as a model system to understand basic biology and human
      disease.

AB  - Unlike adult mammals, adult frogs regrow their optic nerve following a crush
      injury, making Xenopus laevis a compelling model for studying the molecular
      mechanisms that underlie neuronal regeneration. Using Translational Ribosome
      Affinity Purification (TRAP), a method to isolate ribosome-associated mRNAs from 
      a target cell population, we have generated a transcriptional profile by RNA-Seq 
      for retinal ganglion cells (RGC) during the period of recovery following an optic
      nerve injury. Based on bioinformatic analysis using the Xenopus laevis 9.1 genome
      assembly, our results reveal a profound shift in the composition of
      ribosome-associated mRNAs during the early stages of RGC regeneration. As factors
      involved in cell signaling are rapidly down-regulated, those involved in protein 
      biosynthesis are up-regulated alongside key initiators of axon development. Using
      the new genome assembly, we were also able to analyze gene expression profiles of
      homeologous gene pairs arising from a whole-genome duplication in the Xenopus
      lineage. Here we see evidence of divergence in regulatory control among a
      significant proportion of pairs. Our data should provide a valuable resource for 
      identifying genes involved in the regeneration process to target for future
      functional studies, in both naturally regenerative and non-regenerative
      vertebrates.

AB  - Advances in RNA sequencing technologies have led to the surprising discovery that
      a vast number of transcripts emanate from regions of the genome that are not part
      of coding genes. Although some of the smaller ncRNAs such as microRNAs have
      well-characterized functions, the majority of long ncRNA (lncRNA) functions
      remain poorly understood. Understanding the significance of lncRNAs is an
      important challenge facing biology today. A powerful approach to uncovering the
      function of lncRNAs is to explore temporal and spatial expression profiling. This
      may be particularly useful for classes of lncRNAs that have developmentally
      important roles as the expression of such lncRNAs will be expected to be both
      spatially and temporally regulated during development. Here, we take advantage of
      our ultra-high frequency (temporal) sampling of Xenopus embryos to analyze gene
      expression trajectories of lncRNA transcripts over the first 3 days of
      development. We computationally identify 5689 potential single- and multi-exon
      lncRNAs. These lncRNAs demonstrate clear dynamic expression patterns. A subset of
      them displays highly correlative temporal expression profiles with respect to
      those of the neighboring genes. We also identified spatially localized lncRNAs in
      the gastrula stage embryo. These results suggest that lncRNAs have regulatory
      roles during early embryonic development.

AB  - Cell proliferation is strictly regulated by the dosage balance among cell-cycle
      regulators such as CDK/cyclin complexes and CDK-Inhibitors. Even in the
      allotetraploid genome of Xenopus laevis, the dosage balance must be maintained
      for animals to stay alive, and the duplicated homeologous genes seem to have
      gradually changed, through evolution, resulting in the best genes for them to
      thrive. In the Xenopus laevis genome, while homeologous gene pairs of CDKs are
      fundamentally maintained and a few cyclin genes are amplified, homeologous gene
      pairs of the important CDK-Inhibitors, CDKn1c and CDKn2a, are deleted from
      chromosomes L and S. Although losses of CDKn1c and CDKn2a can lead to diseases in
      humans, their loss in X. laevis does not affect the animals' health. Also,
      another gene coding CDKn1b is lost besides CDKn1c and CDKn2a in the genome of
      Xenopus tropicalis. These findings suggest a high resistance of Xenopus to
      diseases. We also found that CDKn2c.S expression is higher than that of CDKn2c.L,
      and a conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) of CDKn2c genomic loci on X. laevis
      chromosome S and X. tropicalis has an enhancement activity in regulating the
      different expression. These findings together indicate a surprising fragility of 
      CDK inhibitor gene loci in the Xenopus genome in spite of their importance, and
      may suggest that factors other than CDK-inhibitors decelerate cell-cycling in
      Xenopus.

AB  - The dorsal ventral axis of vertebrates requires high BMP activity for ventral
      development and inhibition of BMP activity for dorsal development. Presumptive
      dorsal regions of the embryo are protected from the ventralizing activity of BMPs
      by the secretion of BMP antagonists from the mesoderm. Noggin, one such
      antagonist, binds BMP ligands and prevents them from binding their receptors,
      however, a unique role for Noggin in amphibian development has remained unclear. 
      Previously, we used zinc-finger nucleases to mutagenize the noggin locus in
      Xenopus tropicalis. Here, we report on the phenotype of noggin mutant frogs as a 
      result of breeding null mutations to homozygosity. Early homozygous noggin mutant
      embryos are indistinguishable from wildtype siblings, with normal neural
      induction and neural tube closure. However, in late tadpole stages mutants
      present severe ventral craniofacial defects, notably a fusion of Meckel's
      cartilage to the palatoquadrate cartilage. Consistent with a noggin
      loss-of-function, mutants show expansions of BMP target gene expression and the
      mutant phenotype can be rescued with transient BMP inhibition. These results
      demonstrate that in amphibians, Noggin is dispensable for early embryonic
      patterning but is critical for cranial skeletogenesis.

AB  - A large family of highly related and clustered Xenopus nonclassical MHC class Ib 
      (XNC) genes influences Xenopus laevis immunity and potentially other
      physiological functions. Using RNA interference (RNAi) technology, we previously 
      demonstrated that one of XNC genes, XNC10.1, is critical for the development and 
      function of a specialized innate T (iT) cell population. However, RNAi limitation
      such as a variable and unstable degree of gene silencing in F0 and F1 generations
      is hampering a thorough functional analysis of XNC10.1 and other XNC genes. To
      overcome this obstacle, we adapted the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing
      technique for XNC genes. We efficiently and specifically generated single gene
      knockouts of XNC10.1, XNC11, and XNC1 as well as double gene knockouts of XNC10.1
      and XNC11 in X. laevis. In single XNC10.1 knockout X. laevis tadpoles, the
      absence of XNC10.1 and Valpha6-Jalpha1.43 invariant T cell receptor rearrangement
      transcripts indicated XNC10.1 loss-of-function and deficiency in
      Valpha6-Jalpha1.43 iT cells. Notably, targeting XNC10.1 did not affect
      neighboring XNC genes exhibiting high sequence similarity. Furthermore, XNC1 gene
      disruption induced mortality during developmental stage 47, suggesting some
      non-immune but essential function of this gene. These data demonstrate that the
      CRISPR/Cas9 system can be successfully adapted for genetic analysis in F0
      generation of X. laevis.

AB  - Genetic sex-determining systems in vertebrates include two basic types of
      heterogamety; XX (female)/XY (male) and ZZ (male)/ZW (female) types. The African 
      clawed frog Xenopus laevis has a ZZ/ZW-type sex-determining system. In this
      species, we previously identified a W-specific sex (female)-determining gene dmw,
      and specified W and Z chromosomes, which could be morphologically
      indistinguishable (homomorphic). In addition to dmw, we most recently discovered 
      two genes, named scanw and ccdc69w, and one gene, named capn5z in the W- and
      Z-specific regions, respectively. In this study, we revealed the detail
      structures of the W/Z-specific loci and genes. Sequence analysis indicated that
      there is almost no sequence similarity between 278kb W-specific and 83kb
      Z-specific sequences on chromosome 2Lq32-33, where both the transposable elements
      are abundant. Synteny and phylogenic analyses indicated that all the W/Z-specific
      genes might have emerged independently. Expression analysis demonstrated that
      scanw and ccdc69w or capn5z are expressed in early differentiating ZW gonads or
      testes, thereby suggesting possible roles in female or male development,
      respectively. Importantly, the sex-determining gene (SDG) dmw might have been
      generated after allotetraploidization, thereby indicating the construction of the
      new sex-determining system by dmw after species hybridization. Furthermore, by
      direct genotyping, we confirmed that diploid WW embryos developed into normal
      female frogs, which indicate that the Z-specific region is not essential for
      female development. Overall, these findings indicate that sex chromosome
      differentiation has started, although no heteromorphic sex chromosomes are
      evident yet, in X. laevis. Homologous recombination suppression might have
      promoted the accumulation of mutations and transposable elements, and enlarged
      the W/Z-specific regions, thereby resulting in differentiation of the W/Z
      chromosomes.

AB  - Genetic linkage maps are fundamental resources that enable diverse genetic and
      genomic approaches, including quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and
      comparative studies of genome evolution. It is straightforward to build linkage
      maps for species that are amenable to laboratory culture and genetic crossing
      designs, and that have relatively small genomes and few chromosomes. It is more
      difficult to generate linkage maps for species that do not meet these criteria.
      Here, we introduce a method to rapidly build linkage maps for salamanders, which 
      are known for their enormous genome sizes. As proof of principle, we developed a 
      linkage map with thousands of molecular markers (N=2349) for the Eastern newt
      (Notophthalmus viridescens). The map contains 12 linkage groups (152.3-934.7cM), 
      only one more than the number of chromosome pairs. Importantly, this map was
      generated using RNA isolated from a single wild caught female and her 28
      offspring. We used the map to reveal chromosome-scale conservation of synteny
      among N. viridescens, A. mexicanum (Urodela), and chicken (Amniota), and to
      identify large conserved segments between N. viridescens and Xenopus tropicalis
      (Anura). We also show that met1, a major effect QTL that regulates the expression
      of alternate metamorphic and paedomorphic modes of development in Ambystoma,
      associates with a chromosomal fusion that is not found in the N. viridescens map.
      Our results shed new light on the ancestral amphibian karyotype and reveal
      specific fusion and translocation events that shaped the genomes of three
      amphibian model taxa. The ability to rapidly build linkage maps for large
      salamander genomes will enable genetic and genomic analyses within this important
      vertebrate group, and more generally, empower comparative studies of vertebrate
      biology and evolution.

AB  - Injection of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) directly into the dorsal lymph
      sac of Xenopus is a commonly used protocol for induction of ovulation, but recent
      shortages in the stocks of commercially available hCG as well as lack of a well
      tested alternative have resulted in frustrating experimental delays in
      laboratories that predominantly use Xenopus in their research. Mammalian
      Luteinizing Hormones (LH) share structural similarity, functional equivalency,
      and bind the same receptor as hCG; this suggests that LH may serve as a good
      alternative to hCG for promoting ovulation in Xenopus. LH has been found to
      induce maturation of Xenopus oocytes in vitro, but whether it can be used to
      induce ovulation in vivo has not been examined. Here we compared the ability of
      four mammalian LH proteins, bovine (bLH), human (hLH), ovine (oLH), porcine
      (pLH), to induce ovulation in Xenopus when injected into the dorsal lymph sac of 
      sexually mature females. We find that both ovine and human LH, but not bovine or 
      porcine, are good substitutes for hCG for induction of ovulation in WT and J
      strain Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis.

AB  - Large insert genomic DNA libraries are useful resources for genomic studies.
      Although the genome of Xenopus tropicalis stands as the amphibian reference
      genome because it benefitted from large-scale sequencing studies, physical
      mapping resources such as BAC libraries are lagging behind. Here we present the
      construction and characterization of a BAC library that covers the whole X.
      tropicalis genome. We prepared this BAC library from the genomic DNA of X.
      tropicalis females of the Adiopodoume strain. We characterized BAC clones by
      screening for specific loci, by chromosomal localization using FISH and by
      systematic BAC end sequencing. The median insert size is about 110kbp and the
      library coverage is around six genome equivalents. We obtained a total of 163,787
      BAC end sequences with mate pairs for 77,711 BAC clones. We mapped all BAC end
      sequences to the reference X. tropicalis genome assembly to enable the
      identification of BAC clones covering specific loci. Overall, this BAC library
      resource complements the knowledge of the X. tropicalis genome and should further
      promote its use as a reference genome for developmental biology studies and
      amphibian comparative genomics.

AB  - During early vertebrate embryogenesis, cell fate specification is often coupled
      with cell acquisition of specific adhesive, polar and/or motile behaviors. In
      Xenopus gastrulae, tissues fated to form different axial structures display
      distinct motility. The cells in the early organizer move collectively and
      directionally toward the animal pole and contribute to anterior mesendoderm,
      whereas the dorsal and the ventral-posterior trunk tissues surrounding the
      blastopore of mid-gastrula embryos undergo convergent extension and convergent
      thickening movements, respectively. While factors regulating cell lineage
      specification have been described in some detail, the molecular machinery that
      controls cell motility is not understood in depth. To gain insight into the gene 
      battery that regulates both cell fates and motility in particular embryonic
      tissues, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate differentially
      expressed genes in the early organizer, the dorsal and the ventral marginal zone 
      of Xenopus gastrulae. We uncovered many known signaling and transcription factors
      that have been reported to play roles in embryonic patterning during
      gastrulation. We also identified many uncharacterized genes as well as genes that
      encoded extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or potential regulators of actin
      cytoskeleton. Co-expression of a selected subset of the differentially expressed 
      genes with activin in animal caps revealed that they had distinct ability to
      block activin-induced animal cap elongation. Most of these factors did not
      interfere with mesodermal induction by activin, but an ECM protein, EFEMP2,
      inhibited activin signaling and acted downstream of the activated type I
      receptor. By focusing on a secreted protein kinase PKDCC1, we showed with
      overexpression and knockdown experiments that PKDCC1 regulated gastrulation
      movements as well as anterior neural patterning during early Xenopus development.
      Overall, our studies identify many differentially expressed signaling and
      cytoskeleton regulators in different embryonic regions of Xenopus gastrulae and
      imply their functions in regulating cell fates and/or behaviors during
      gastrulation.

AB  - The Xenopus community has embraced recent advances in sequencing technology,
      resulting in the accumulation of numerous RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq datasets. However,
      easily accessing and comparing datasets generated by multiple laboratories is
      challenging. Thus, we have created a central space to view, search and analyze
      data, providing essential information on gene expression changes and regulatory
      elements present in the genome. XenMine (www.xenmine.org) is a user-friendly
      website containing published genomic datasets from both Xenopus tropicalis and
      Xenopus laevis. We have established an analysis pipeline where all published
      datasets are uniformly processed with the latest genome releases. Information
      from these datasets can be extracted and compared using an array of pre-built or 
      custom templates. With these search tools, users can easily extract sequences for
      all putative regulatory domains surrounding a gene of interest, identify the
      expression values of a gene of interest over developmental time, and analyze
      lists of genes for gene ontology terms and publications. Additionally, XenMine
      hosts an in-house genome browser that allows users to visualize all available
      ChIP-Seq data, extract specifically marked sequences, and aid in identifying
      important regulatory elements within the genome. Altogether, XenMine is an
      excellent tool for visualizing, accessing and querying analyzed datasets rapidly 
      and efficiently.

AB  - The amphibian model Xenopus, has been used extensively over the past century to
      study multiple aspects of cell and developmental biology. Xenopus offers
      advantages of a non-mammalian system, including high fecundity, external
      development, and simple housing requirements, with additional advantages of large
      embryos, highly conserved developmental processes, and close evolutionary
      relationship to higher vertebrates. There are two main species of Xenopus used in
      biomedical research, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis; the common perception
      is that both species are excellent models for embryological and cell biological
      studies, but only Xenopus tropicalis is useful as a genetic model. The recent
      completion of the Xenopus laevis genome sequence combined with implementation of 
      genome editing tools, such as TALENs (transcription activator-like effector
      nucleases) and CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeats-CRISPR associated nucleases), greatly facilitates the use of both Xenopus
      laevis and Xenopus tropicalis for understanding gene function in development and 
      disease. In this paper, we review recent advances made in Xenopus laevis and
      Xenopus tropicalis with TALENs and CRISPR-Cas and discuss the various approaches 
      that have been used to generate knockout and knock-in animals in both species.
      These advances show that both Xenopus species are useful for genetic approaches
      and in particular counters the notion that Xenopus laevis is not amenable to
      genetic manipulations.

AB  - The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays multiple roles during
      Xenopus gastrulation, including posteriorization of the neural plate, patterning 
      of the mesoderm, and induction of the neural crest. Wnt signaling stabilizes
      beta-catenin, which then activates target genes. However, few targets of this
      signaling pathway that mediate early developmental processes are known. Here we
      sought to identify transcriptional targets of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      pathway using a genome-wide approach. We selected putative targets using the
      criteria of reduced expression upon zygotic Wnt knockdown, beta-catenin binding
      within 50kb of the gene, and expression in tissues that receive Wnt signaling.
      Using these criteria, we found 21 novel direct transcriptional targets of
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during gastrulation and in addition have identified
      putative regulatory elements for further characterization in future studies.

AB  - The two species of Xenopus most commonly used in biomedical research are the
      diploid Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis and the tetraploid Xenopus laevis. The X.
      tropicalis genome sequence has been available since 2010 and this year the X.
      laevis, genome from two distinct genetic backgrounds has been published. Multiple
      genome assemblies available for both species and transcriptomic and epigenetic
      data sets are growing rapidly, all of which are available from a variety of web
      resources. This review describes the contents of these resources, how to locate
      and download genomic data, and also how to view and manipulate these data on
      various public genome browsers, with an emphasis on Xenbase, the Xenopus model
      organism database.

AB  - RNA sequencing has allowed high-throughput screening of differential gene
      expression in many tissues and organisms. Xenopus laevis is a classical
      embryological and cell-free extract model system, but its genomic sequence had
      been lacking due to difficulties arising from allotetraploidy. There is currently
      much excitement surrounding the release of the completed X. laevis genome
      (version 9.1) by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), which provides a platform for 
      genome-wide studies. Here we present a deep RNA-seq dataset of transcripts
      expressed in dorsal and ventral lips of the early Xenopus gastrula embryo using
      the new genomic information, which was further annotated by blast searches
      against the human proteome. Overall, our findings confirm previous results from
      differential screenings using other methods that uncovered classical dorsal genes
      such as Chordin, Noggin and Cerberus, as well as ventral genes such as Sizzled,
      Ventx, Wnt8 and Bambi. Complete transcriptome-wide tables of mRNAs suitable for
      data mining are presented, which include many novel dorsal- and ventral-specific 
      genes. RNA-seq was very quantitative and reproducible, and allowed us to define
      dorsal and ventral signatures useful for gene set expression analyses (GSEA). As 
      an example of a new gene, we present here data on an organizer-specific secreted 
      protein tyrosine kinase known as Pkdcc (protein kinase domain containing,
      cytoplasmic) or Vlk (vertebrate lonesome kinase). Overexpression experiments
      indicate that Pkdcc can act as a negative regulator of Wnt/ beta-catenin
      signaling independently of its kinase activity. We conclude that RNA-Seq in
      combination with the X. laevis complete genome now available provides a powerful 
      tool for unraveling cell-cell signaling pathways during embryonic induction.

      fibrillary acidic protein gene in Xenopus.

AB  - Intermediate filament proteins are structural components of the cellular
      cytoskeleton with cell-type specific expression and function. Glial fibrillary
      acidic protein (GFAP) is a type III intermediate filament protein and is
      up-regulated in glia of the nervous system in response to injury and during
      neurodegenerative diseases. In the retina, GFAP levels are dramatically increased
      in Muller glia and are thought to play a role in the extensive structural changes
      resulting in Muller cell hypertrophy and glial scar formation. In spite of
      similar changes to the morphology of Xenopus Muller cells following injury, we
      found that Xenopus lack a gfap gene. Other type III intermediate filament
      proteins were, however, significantly induced following rod photoreceptor
      ablation and retinal ganglion cell axotomy. The recently available X. tropicalis 
      and X. laevis genomes indicate a small deletion most likely resulted in the loss 
      of the gfap gene during anuran evolution. Lastly, a survey of representative
      species from all three extant amphibian orders including the Anura (frogs,
      toads), Caudata (salamanders, newts), and Gymnophiona (caecilians) suggests that 
      deletion of the gfap locus occurred in the ancestor of all Anura after its
      divergence from the Caudata ancestor around 290 million years ago. Our results
      demonstrate that extensive changes in Muller cell morphology following retinal
      injury do not require GFAP in Xenopus, and other type III intermediate filament
      proteins may be involved in the gliotic response.

AB  - Completion of the Xenopus laevis genome sequence from inbred J strain animals has
      facilitated the generation of germline mutant X. laevis using targeted genome
      editing. In the last few years, numerous reports have demonstrated that TALENs
      are able to induce mutations in F0 Xenopus embryos, but none has demonstrated
      germline transmission of such mutations in X. laevis. In this report we used the 
      oocyte host-transfer method to generate mutations in both tyrosinase homeologs
      and found highly-penetrant germline mutations; in contrast, embryonic injections 
      yielded few germline mutations. We also compared the distribution of mutations in
      several F0 somatic tissues and germ cells and found that the majority of
      mutations in each tissue were different. These results establish that X. laevis J
      strain animals are very useful for generating germline mutations and that the
      oocyte host-transfer method is an efficient technique for generating mutations in
      both homeologs.

      Drosha or Pasha/DGCR8 activity are sterile and fail to ovulate, indicating that
      miRNAs are required for the process of oocyte maturation and ovulation. Starting 
      with this penetrant sterile phenotype and using new strains created to perform
      tissue specific RNAi, we characterized the roles of the C. elegans Pasha, pash-1,
      and two miRNA-specific Argonautes, alg-1 and alg-2, in somatic gonad cells and in
      germ cells in the regulation of ovulation. Conditional loss of pash-1 activity
      resulted in a reduced rate of ovulation and in basal and ovulatory sheath
      contractions. Similarly, knockdown of miRNA-specific Argonautes in the cells of
      the somatic gonad by tissue-specific RNAi results in a reduction of the ovulation
      rate and in basal and ovulatory sheath contractions. Reduced miRNA pathway gene
      activity resulted in a range of defects, including oocytes that were pinched upon
      entry of the oocyte into the distal end of the spermatheca in about 42% of the
      ovulation events observed following alg-1 RNAi. This phenotype was not observed
      on worms exposed to control RNAi. In contrast, knockdown of alg-1 and alg-2 in
      germ cells results in few defects in oocyte maturation and ovulation. These data 
      identify specific steps in the process of ovulation that require miRNA pathway
      gene activity in the somatic gonad cells.

AB  - Mitochondria is not only a dynamic organelle that produces ATP, but is also an
      important contributor to cell functions in both development and cell death
      processes. These paradoxical functions of mitochondria are partially regulated by
      the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a high-conductance channel
      that can induce loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, impairment of cellular 
      calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and a decrease in ATP production upon
      pathological activation. Interestingly, despite their different etiologies,
      several neurodegenerative diseases and heart ischemic injuries share
      mitochondrial dysfunction as a common element. Generally, mitochondrial
      impairment is triggered by calcium deregulation that could lead to mPTP opening
      and cell death. Several studies have shown that opening of the mPTP not only
      induces mitochondrial damage and cell death, but is also a physiological
      mechanism involved in different cellular functions. The mPTP participates in
      regular calcium-release mechanisms that are required for proper metabolic
      regulation; it is hypothesized that the transient opening of this structure could
      be the principal mediator of cardiac and brain development. The mPTP also plays a
      role in protecting against different brain and cardiac disorders in the elderly
      population. Therefore, the aim of this work was to discuss different studies that
      show this controversial characteristic of the mPTP; although mPTP is normally
      associated with several pathological events, new critical findings suggest its
      importance in mitochondrial function and cell development.

AB  - The differentiation of germ cells into oogonia or spermatogonia is the first step
      that eventually gives rise to fully mature gametes. In the female fetal gonad,
      the RSPO1/WNT/CTNNB1 signalling pathway is involved in primordial germ cell
      proliferation and differentiation into female germ cells, which are able to enter
      meiosis. In the postnatal testis, the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway also mediates
      proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells and progenitor cells. Here we show
      that forced activation of the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway in fetal gonocytes using
      transgenic mice leads to deregulated spermatogonial proliferation, and exhaustion
      of the spermatocytes by apoptosis, resulting in a hypoplastic testis. These
      findings demonstrate that a finely tuned timing in WNT/CTNNB1 signalling activity
      is required for spermatogenesis.

AB  - Adult stem cell proliferation rates are precisely regulated to maintain long-term
      tissue homeostasis. Defects in the mechanisms controlling stem cell proliferation
      result in impaired regeneration and hyperproliferative diseases. Many stem cell
      populations increase proliferation in response to tissue damage and reacquire
      basal proliferation rates after tissue repair is completed. Although
      proliferative signals have been extensively studied, much less is known about the
      molecular mechanisms that restore stem cell quiescence. Here we show that Tis11, 
      an Adenine-uridine Rich Element (ARE) binding protein that promotes mRNA
      degradation, is required to re-establish basal proliferation rates of adult
      Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISC) after a regenerative episode. We find that
      Tis11 limits ISC proliferation specifically after proliferation has been
      stimulated in response to heat stress or infection, and show that Tis11
      expression and activity are increased in ISCs during tissue repair. Based on stem
      cell transcriptome analysis and RNA immunoprecipitation, we propose that Tis11
      activation represents an integral part of a negative feedback mechanism that
      limits the expression of key components of several signaling pathways that
      control ISC function and proliferation. Our results identify Tis11 mediated mRNA 
      decay as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of re-establishing basal
      proliferation rates of stem cells in regenerating tissues.

AB  - Mitochondria are the most prominent organelle in the oocyte. Somatic cells
      maintain a healthy population of mitochondria by degrading damaged mitochondria
      via mitophagy, a specialized autophagy pathway. However, evidence from previous
      work investigating the more general macroautophagy pathway in oocytes suggests
      that mitophagy may not be active in the oocyte. This would leave the vast numbers
      of mitochondria - poised to be inherited by the offspring - vulnerable to damage.
      Here we test the hypothesis that inactive mitophagy in the oocyte underlies
      maternal transmission of dysfunctional mitochondria. To determine whether oocytes
      can complete mitophagy, we used either CCCP or AntimycinA to depolarize
      mitochondria and trigger mitophagy. After depolarization, we did not detect
      co-localization of mitochondria with autophagosomes and mitochondrial DNA copy
      number remained unchanged, indicating the non-functional mitochondrial population
      was not removed. To investigate the impact of an absence of mitophagy in oocytes 
      with damaged mitochondria on offspring mitochondrial function, we utilized in
      vitro fertilization of high fat high sugar (HF/HS)-exposed oocytes, which have
      lower mitochondrial membrane potential and damaged mitochondria. Here, we
      demonstrate that blastocysts generated from HF/HS oocytes have decreased
      mitochondrial membrane potential, lower metabolites involved in ATP generation,
      and accumulation of PINK1, a mitophagy marker protein. This mitochondrial
      phenotype in the blastocyst mirrors the phenotype we show in HF/HS exposed
      oocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that the mechanisms governing oocyte 
      mitophagy are fundamentally distinct from those governing somatic cell mitophagy 
      and that the absence of mitophagy in the setting of HF/HS exposure contributes to
      the oocyte-to-blastocyst transmission of dysfunctional mitochondria.

AB  - Limb synovial joints are composed of distinct tissues, but it is unclear which
      progenitors produce those tissues and how articular cartilage acquires its
      functional postnatal organization characterized by chondrocyte columns,
      zone-specific cell volumes and anisotropic matrix. Using novel Gdf5(CreERT2)
      (Gdf5-CE), Prg4-CE and Dkk3-CE mice mated to R26-Confetti or single-color
      reporters, we found that knee joint progenitors produced small non-migratory
      progenies and distinct local tissues over prenatal and postnatal time.
      Stereological imaging and quantification indicated that the columns present in
      juvenile-adult tibial articular cartilage consisted of non-daughter, partially
      overlapping lineage cells, likely reflecting cell rearrangement and stacking.
      Zone-specific increases in cell volume were major drivers of tissue thickening,
      while cell proliferation or death played minor roles. Second harmonic generation 
      with 2-photon microscopy showed that the collagen matrix went from being
      isotropic and scattered at young stages to being anisotropic and aligned along
      the cell stacks in adults. Progenitor tracing at prenatal or juvenile stages
      showed that joint injury provoked a massive and rapid increase in synovial Prg4+ 
      and CD44+/P75+ cells some of which filling the injury site, while neighboring
      chondrocytes appeared unresponsive. Our data indicate that local cell populations
      produce distinct joint tissues and that articular cartilage growth and zonal
      organization are mainly brought about by cell volume expansion and topographical 
      cell rearrangement. Synovial Prg4+ lineage progenitors are exquisitely responsive
      to acute injury and may represent pioneers in joint tissue repair.

AB  - Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is a mechanism of mRNA regulation prevalent in
      metazoan germ cells; it is largely dependent on Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation
      Element Binding proteins (CPEBs). Two CPEB homologs were identified in the
      planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. Smed-CPEB1 is expressed in ovaries and yolk
      glands of sexually mature planarians, and required for oocyte and yolk gland
      development. In contrast, Smed-CPEB2 is expressed in the testes and the central
      nervous system; its function is required for spermatogenesis as well as
      non-autonomously for development of ovaries and accessory reproductive organs.
      Transcriptome analysis of CPEB knockdown animals uncovered a comprehensive
      collection of molecular markers for reproductive structures in S. mediterranea,
      including ovaries, testes, yolk glands, and the copulatory apparatus. Analysis by
      RNA interference revealed contributions for a dozen of these genes during
      oogenesis, spermatogenesis, or capsule formation. We also present evidence
      suggesting that Smed-CPEB2 promotes translation of Neuropeptide Y-8, a prohormone
      required for planarian sexual maturation. These findings provide mechanistic
      insight into potentially conserved processes of germ cell development, as well as
      events involved in capsule deposition by flatworms.

TI  - Ovaries of the white worm (Enchytraeus albidus, Annelida, Clitellata) are
      composed of 16-celled meroistic germ-line cysts.

AB  - The paired ovaries of E. albidus are like a bunch of grapes and are composed of
      clearly separated units, syncytial germ cysts (clusters), which are surrounded by
      a thin layer of somatic cells. Each cyst maintains the connection with the ovary 
      by an extended stalk that is composed of somatic cells. The spatial architecture 
      of the germ-line cysts found in E. albidus is the same as in other clitellate
      annelids that have been studied to date. As a rule, germ cells are located at the
      cyst periphery and each has only one ring canal that connects it to the common
      and centrally located cytoplasmic mass, the cytophore. Here we present data about
      the F-actin and microtubular cytoskeleton and some molecular components of the
      germ-line cysts. We show that the ring canals have an inner rim that is enriched 
      with microfilaments and proteins that contain phosphotyrosine. The microtubules
      form a loose network in the cytoplasm of the oocyte and nurse cells; moreover,
      some of them pass through the ring canals to the cytophore. Numerous microtubules
      are also located in the somatic cells. The germ-line cysts in E. albidus ovaries 
      consist of 16 cells, which is the lowest known number of interconnected germ
      cells within clitellate annelids. During oogenesis, the fate of interconnected
      germ cells differentiates and only one cell develops as the future egg, while the
      other 15 become nurse cells. This differentiation means ovary meroism. The nurse 
      cells gather cell organelles and storage material that then pass through the ring
      canals and cytophore moving towards the growing oocyte. At the end of oogenesis, 
      the vitellogenic oocyte surrounds the siblings' cells together with the cytophore
      and engulfs their remnants into the ooplasm. No morphological or molecular
      markers of the apoptosis of the nurse cells were found. Moreover, the nurse cells
      did not undergo polyploidisation. The measured DNA level was 4C, which indicates 
      that these cells are not highly-specialised.

AB  - Formation of a functional eye during vertebrate embryogenesis requires different 
      processes such as cell differentiation, cell migration, cell-cell interactions as
      well as intracellular signalling processes. It was previously shown that the
      non-canonical Wnt receptor Frizzled 3 (Fzd3) is required for proper eye
      formation, however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we
      demonstrate that loss of Fzd3 induces severe malformations of the developing eye 
      and that this defect is phenocopied by loss of the activated leukocyte cell
      adhesion molecule (Alcam). Promoter analysis revealed the presence of a Fzd3
      responsive element within the alcam promoter, which is responsible for alcam
      expression during anterior neural development. In-depth analysis identified the
      jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1) and the transcription factor paired box 2 
      (Pax2) to be important for the activation of alcam expression. Altogether our
      study reveals that alcam is activated through non-canonical Wnt signalling during
      embryonic eye development in Xenopus laevis and shows that this pathway plays a
      similar role in different tissues.

AB  - Trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) by the Polycomb repressive
      complex 2 (PRC2) contributes to localized and inherited transcriptional
      repression. Kdm6b (Jmjd3) is a H3K27me3 demethylase that can relieve
      repression-associated H3K27me3 marks, thereby supporting activation of previously
      silenced genes. Kdm6b is proposed to contribute to early developmental cell fate 
      specification, cardiovascular differentiation, and/or later steps of
      organogenesis, including endochondral bone formation and lung development. We
      pursued loss-of-function studies in zebrafish to define the conserved
      developmental roles of Kdm6b. kdm6ba and kdm6bb homozygous deficient zebrafish
      are each viable and fertile. However, loss of both kdm6ba and kdm6bb shows Kdm6b 
      proteins share redundant and pleiotropic roles in organogenesis without impacting
      initial cell fate specification. In the developing heart, co-expressed Kdm6b
      proteins promote cardiomyocyte proliferation coupled with the initial stages of
      cardiac trabeculation. While newly formed trabecular cardiomyocytes display a
      striking transient decrease in bulk cellular H3K27me3 levels, this demethylation 
      is independent of collective Kdm6b. Our results indicate a restricted and likely 
      locus-specific role for Kdm6b demethylases during heart ventricle maturation
      rather than initial cardiogenesis.

AB  - The rapid increase in gene-centric biological knowledge coupled with analytic
      approaches for genomewide data integration provides an opportunity to develop
      systems-level understanding of facial development. Experimental analyses have
      demonstrated the importance of signaling between the surface ectoderm and the
      underlying mesenchyme are coordinating facial patterning. However, current
      transcriptome data from the developing vertebrate face is dominated by the
      mesenchymal component, and the contributions of the ectoderm are not easily
      identified. We have generated transcriptome datasets from critical periods of
      mouse face formation that enable gene expression to be analyzed with respect to
      time, prominence, and tissue layer. Notably, by separating the ectoderm and
      mesenchyme we considerably improved the sensitivity compared to data obtained
      from whole prominences, with more genes detected over a wider dynamic range. From
      these data we generated a detailed description of ectoderm-specific developmental
      programs, including pan-ectodermal programs, prominence- specific programs and
      their temporal dynamics. The genes and pathways represented in these programs
      provide mechanistic insights into several aspects of ectodermal development. We
      also used these data to identify co-expression modules specific to facial
      development. We then used 14 co-expression modules enriched for genes involved in
      orofacial clefts to make specific mechanistic predictions about genes involved in
      tongue specification, in nasal process patterning and in jaw development. Our
      multidimensional gene expression dataset is a unique resource for systems
      analysis of the developing face; our co-expression modules are a resource for
      predicting functions of poorly annotated genes, or for predicting roles for genes
      that have yet to be studied in the context of facial development; and our
      analytic approaches provide a paradigm for analysis of other complex
      developmental programs.

AB  - Many studies have investigated the source and role of epithelial progenitors
      during lung development; such information is limited for fibroblast populations
      and their complex role in the developing lung. In this study, we characterized
      the spatial location, mRNA expression and Immunophenotyping of PDGFRalpha(+)
      fibroblasts during sacculation and alveolarization. Confocal microscopy
      identified spatial association of PDGFRalpha expressing fibroblasts with proximal
      epithelial cells of the branching bronchioles and the dilating acinar tubules at 
      E16.5; with distal terminal saccules at E18.5; and with alveolar epithelial cells
      at PN7 and PN28. Immunohistochemistry for alpha smooth muscle actin revealed that
      PDGFRalpha(+) fibroblasts contribute to proximal peribronchiolar smooth muscle at
      E16.5 and to transient distal alveolar myofibroblasts at PN7. Time series RNA-Seq
      analyses of PDGFRalpha(+) fibroblasts identified differentially expressed genes
      that, based on gene expression similarity were clustered into 7 major gene
      expression profile patterns. The presence of myofibroblast and smooth muscle
      precursors at E16.5 and PN7 was reflected by a two-peak gene expression profile
      on these days and gene ontology enrichment in muscle contraction. Additional
      molecular and functional differences between peribronchiolar smooth muscle cells 
      at E16.5 and transient intraseptal myofibroblasts at PN7 were suggested by a
      single peak in gene expression at PN7 with functional enrichment in cell
      projection and muscle cell differentiation. Immunophenotyping of subsets of
      PDGFRalpha(+) fibroblasts by flow cytometry confirmed the predicted increase in
      proliferation at E16.5 and PN7, and identified subsets of CD29(+) myofibroblasts 
      and CD34(+) lipofibroblasts. These data can be further mined to develop novel
      hypotheses and valuable understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of
      alveolarization.

AB  - The Drosophila compound eye develops from a bilayered epithelial sac composed of 
      an upper peripodial epithelium layer and a lower disc proper, the latter giving
      rise to the eye itself. During larval stages, complex signalling events between
      the layers contribute to the control of cell proliferation and differentiation in
      the disc. Previous work in our lab established the gap junction protein Innexin2 
      (Inx2) as crucial for early larval eye disc growth. By analysing the contribution
      of other Innexins to eye size control, we have identified Innexin3 (Inx3) as an
      important growth regulator. Depleting inx3 during larval eye development reduces 
      eye size, while elevating inx3 levels increases eye size, thus phenocopying the
      inx2 loss- and gain-of-function situation. As demonstrated previously for inx2,
      inx3 regulates disc cell proliferation and interacts genetically with the Dpp
      pathway, being required for the proper activation of the Dpp pathway transducer
      Mad at the furrow and the expression of Dpp receptor Punt in the eye disc. At the
      developmental timepoint corresponding to eye disc growth, Inx3 colocalises with
      Inx2 in disc proper and peripodial epithelium cell membranes. In addition, we
      show that Inx3 protein levels critically depend on inx2 throughout eye
      development and that inx3 modulates Inx2 protein levels in the larval eye disc.
      Rescue experiments demonstrate that Inx3 and Inx2 cooperate functionally to
      enable eye disc growth in Drosophila. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of 
      Inx3 and Inx2 is not only needed in the disc proper but also in the peripodial
      epithelium to regulate growth of the eye disc. Our data provide a functional
      demonstration that putative Inx2/Inx3 heteromeric channels regulate organ size.

      cell myofibrillogenesis and myotomal patterning in intact zebrafish embryos.

AB  - We recently demonstrated a critical role for two-pore channel type 2
      (TPC2)-mediated Ca(2+) release during the differentiation of slow (skeletal)
      muscle cells (SMC) in intact zebrafish embryos, via the introduction of a
      translational-blocking morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO). Here, we extend
      our study and demonstrate that knockdown of TPC2 with a non-overlapping
      splice-blocking MO, knockout of TPC2 (via the generation of a tpcn2(dhkz1a)
      mutant line of zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing), or the pharmacological 
      inhibition of TPC2 action with bafilomycin A1 or trans-ned-19, also lead to a
      significant attenuation of SMC differentiation, characterized by a disruption of 
      SMC myofibrillogenesis and gross morphological changes in the trunk musculature. 
      When the morphants were injected with tpcn2-mRNA or were treated with IP3/BM or
      caffeine (agonists of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and
      ryanodine receptor (RyR), respectively), many aspects of myofibrillogenesis and
      myotomal patterning (and in the case of the pharmacological treatments, the
      Ca(2+) signals generated in the SMCs), were rescued. STED super-resolution
      microscopy revealed a close physical relationship between clusters of RyR in the 
      terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and TPC2 in lysosomes,
      with a mean estimated separation of ~52-87nm. Our data therefore add to the
      increasing body of evidence, which indicate that localized Ca(2+) release via
      TPC2 might trigger the generation of more global Ca(2+) release from the SR via
      Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release.

AB  - How the fetal-placental arterial connection is made and positioned relative to
      the embryonic body axis, thereby ensuring efficient and directed blood flow to
      and from the mother during gestation, is not known. Here we use a combination of 
      genetics, timed pharmacological inhibition in living mouse embryos, and
      three-dimensional modeling to link two novel architectural features that, at
      present, have no status in embryological atlases. The allantoic core domain (ACD)
      is the extraembryonic extension of the primitive streak into the allantois, or
      pre-umbilical tissue; the vessel of confluence (VOC), situated adjacent to the
      ACD, is an extraembryonic vessel that marks the site of fetal-placental arterial 
      union. We show that genesis of the fetal-placental connection involves the ACD
      and VOC in a series of steps, each one dependent upon the last. In the first,
      Brachyury (T) ensures adequate extension of the primitive streak into the
      allantois, which in turn designates the allantoic-yolk sac junction. Next, the
      streak-derived ACD organizes allantoic angioblasts to the axial junction; upon
      signaling from Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor-1 (FGFR1), these endothelialize 
      and branch, forming a sprouting VOC that unites the umbilical and
      omphalomesenteric arteries with the fetal dorsal aortae. Arterial union is
      followed by the appearance of the medial umbilical roots within the VOC, which in
      turn designate the correct axial placement of the lateral umbilical roots/common 
      iliac arteries. In addition, we show that the ACD and VOC are conserved across
      Placentalia, including humans, underscoring their fundamental importance in
      mammalian biology. We conclude that T is required for correct axial positioning
      of the VOC via the primitive streak/ACD, while FGFR1, through its role in
      endothelialization and branching, further patterns it. Together, these genetic,
      molecular and structural elements safeguard the fetus against adverse outcomes
      that can result from vascular mispatterning of the fetal-placental arterial
      connection.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in the central nervous system
      (CNS). A comprehensive understanding of BBB development has been hampered by
      difficulties in observing the differentiation of brain endothelial cells (BECs)
      in real-time. Here, we generated two transgenic zebrafish line,
      Tg(glut1b:mCherry) and Tg(plvap:EGFP), to serve as in vivo reporters of BBB
      development. We showed that barriergenesis (i.e. the induction of BEC
      differentiation) occurs immediately as endothelial tips cells migrate into the
      brain parenchyma. Using the Tg(glut1b:mCherry) transgenic line, we performed a
      genetic screen and identified a zebrafish mutant with a nonsense mutation in
      gpr124, a gene known to play a role in CNS angiogenesis and BBB development. We
      also showed that our transgenic plvap:EGFP line, a reporter of immature brain
      endothelium, is initially expressed in newly formed brain endothelial cells, but 
      subsides during BBB maturation. Our results demonstrate the ability to visualize 
      the in vivo differentiation of brain endothelial cells into the BBB phenotype and
      establish that CNS angiogenesis and barriergenesis occur simultaneously.

AB  - During zebrafish embryogenesis the pronephric kidney arises from a small
      population of posterior mesoderm cells that then undergo expansion during early
      stages of renal organogenesis. While wnt8 is required for posterior mesoderm
      formation during gastrulation, it is also transiently expressed in the
      post-gastrula embryo in the intermediate mesoderm, the precursor to the
      pronephros and some blood/vascular lineages. Here, we show that knockdown of
      wnt8a, using a low dose of morpholino that does not disrupt early mesoderm
      patterning, reduces the number of kidney and blood cells. For the kidney, wnt8a
      deficiency decreases renal progenitor growth during early somitogenesis, as
      detected by EdU incorporation, but has no effect on apoptosis. The depletion of
      the renal progenitor pool in wnt8a knockdown embryos leads to cellular deficits
      in the pronephros at 24 hpf that are characterised by a shortened distal-most
      segment and stretched proximal tubule cells. A pulse of the canonical Wnt pathway
      agonist BIO during early somitogenesis is sufficient to rescue the size of the
      renal progenitor pool while longer treatment expands the number of kidney cells. 
      Taken together, these observations indicate that Wnt8, in addition to its
      well-established role in posterior mesoderm patterning, also plays a later role
      as a factor that expands the renal progenitor pool prior to kidney morphogenesis.

AB  - During vertebrate evolution, whole genome duplications resulted in a number of
      duplicated genes, some of which eventually changed their expression patterns
      and/or levels via alteration of cis-regulatory sequences. However, the initial
      process involved in such cis-regulatory changes remains unclear. Therefore, we
      investigated this process by analyzing the duplicated hand1 genes of Xenopus
      laevis (hand1.L and hand1.S), which were generated by allotetraploidization 17-18
      million years ago, and compared these with their single ortholog in the
      ancestral-type diploid species X. tropicalis. A dN/dS analysis indicated that
      hand1.L and hand1.S are still under purifying selection, and thus, their products
      appear to retain ancestral functional properties. RNA-seq and in situ
      hybridization analyses revealed that hand1.L and hand1.S have similar expression 
      patterns to each other and to X. tropicalis hand1, but the hand1.S expression
      level was much lower than the hand1.L expression level in the primordial heart. A
      comparative sequence analysis, luciferase reporter analysis, ChIP-PCR analysis,
      and transgenic reporter analysis showed that a single nucleotide substitution in 
      the hand1.S promoter was responsible for the reduced expression in the heart.
      These findings demonstrated that a small change in the promoter sequence can
      trigger diversification of duplicated gene expression prior to diversification of
      their encoded protein functions in a young duplicated genome.

TI  - The heterochronic gene Lin28 regulates amphibian metamorphosis through
      disturbance of thyroid hormone function.

AB  - Metamorphosis is a classic example of developmental transition, which involves
      important morphological and physiological changes that prepare the organism for
      the adult life. It has been very well established that amphibian metamorphosis is
      mainly controlled by Thyroid Hormone (TH). Here, we show that the heterochronic
      gene Lin28 is downregulated during Xenopus laevis metamorphosis. Lin28
      overexpression before activation of TH signaling delays metamorphosis and
      inhibits the expression of TH target genes. The delay in metamorphosis is rescued
      by incubation with exogenous TH, indicating that Lin28 works upstream or parallel
      to TH. High-throughput analyses performed before any delay on metamorphosis or
      change in TH signaling showed that overexpression of Lin28 reduces transcript
      levels of several hormones secreted by the pituitary, including the
      Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and regulates the expression of proteins
      involved in TH transport, metabolism and signaling, showing that Lin28 disrupts
      TH function at different levels. Our data demonstrates that the role of Lin28 in 
      controlling developmental transitions is evolutionary conserved and establishes a
      functional interaction between Lin28 and thyroid hormone function introducing a
      new regulatory step in perinatal development with implications for our
      understanding of endocrine disorders.

TI  - Cos2/Kif7 and Osm-3/Kif17 regulate onset of outer segment development in
      zebrafish photoreceptors through distinct mechanisms.

AB  - Zebrafish morphants of osm-3/kif17, a kinesin-2 family member and intraflagellar 
      transport motor, have photoreceptor outer segments that are dramatically reduced 
      in number and size. However, two genetic mutant lines, osm-3/kif17(sa0119) and
      osm-3/kif17(sa18340), reportedly lack any observable morphological outer segment 
      defects. In this work, we use TALENs to generate an independent allele,
      osm-3/kif17(mw405), and show that both osm-3/kif17(sa0119) and osm-3/kif17(mw405)
      have an outer segment developmental delay in both size and density that is fully 
      recovered by 6 days post-fertilization. Additionally, we use CRISPRs to generate 
      cos2/kif7(mw406), a mutation in the kinesin-4 family member cos2/kif7 that has
      been implicated in controlling ciliary architecture and Hedgehog signaling to
      test whether it may be functioning redundantly with osm-3/kif17. We show that
      cos2/kif7(mw406) has an outer segment developmental delay similar to the
      osm-3/kif17 mutants. Using a three-dimensional mathematical model of outer
      segments, we show that while cos2/kif7(mw406) and osm-3/kif17(mw405) outer
      segments are smaller throughout the first 6 days of development, the volumetric
      rates of outer segment morphogenesis are not different among wild-type,
      cos2/kif7(mw406), and osm-3/kif17(mw405) after 60hpf. Instead, our model suggests
      that cos2/kif7(mw406) and osm-3/kif17(mw405) impact outer segment morphogenesis
      through upstream events that that are different for each motor. In the case of
      cos2/kif7(mw406) mutants, we show that early defects in Hedgehog signaling lead
      to a general, non-photoreceptor-specific delay of retinal neurogenesis, which in 
      turn causes the secondary phenotype of delayed outer segment morphogenesis. In
      contrast, the osm-3/kif17(mw405) outer segment morphogenesis delays are linked
      specifically to initial disc morphogenesis of photoreceptors rather than an
      upstream event. Further, we show that osm-3/kif17 mutant mice also exhibit a
      similarly delayed outer segment development, suggesting a role for osm-3/kif17 in
      early outer segment development that is conserved across species. In conclusion, 
      we show that both osm-3/kif17 and cos2/kif7 have comparable outer segment
      developmental delays, although through independent mechanisms.

AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as an important tool for various genome
      engineering applications. A current obstacle to high throughput applications of
      CRISPR/Cas9 is the imprecise prediction of highly active single guide RNAs
      (sgRNAs). We previously implemented the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce
      tissue-specific mutations in the tunicate Ciona. In the present study, we
      designed and tested 83 single guide RNA (sgRNA) vectors targeting 23 genes
      expressed in the cardiopharyngeal progenitors and surrounding tissues of Ciona
      embryo. Using high-throughput sequencing of mutagenized alleles, we identified
      guide sequences that correlate with sgRNA mutagenesis activity and used this
      information for the rational design of all possible sgRNAs targeting the Ciona
      transcriptome. We also describe a one-step cloning-free protocol for the assembly
      of sgRNA expression cassettes. These cassettes can be directly electroporated as 
      unpurified PCR products into Ciona embryos for sgRNA expression in vivo,
      resulting in high frequency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in somatic cells 
      of electroporated embryos. We found a strong correlation between the frequency of
      an Ebf loss-of-function phenotype and the mutagenesis efficacies of individual
      Ebf-targeting sgRNAs tested using this method. We anticipate that our approach
      can be scaled up to systematically design and deliver highly efficient sgRNAs for
      the tissue-specific investigation of gene functions in Ciona.

AB  - The Drosophila lymph gland is a well-characterized hematopoietic organ in which a
      population of multipotent stem-like progenitors is maintained by a combination of
      signals from different cellular populations within the organ. The lymph gland
      serves as an ideal model both for the interrogation of signaling mechanisms
      involved in progenitor maintenance as well as a tool for the identification of
      novel regulatory mechanisms in the highly conserved process of hematopoiesis.
      Here, we demonstrate a requirement for the TEAD transcription factor Scalloped in
      the maintenance and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. We have
      characterized a novel population of hemocytes in the early lymph gland identified
      by the expression of Hand, Scalloped, and the PVR ligand PVF2. In this unique
      population, we show that Scalloped maintains PVF2 expression, which is required
      for hemocyte proliferation and achievement of normal lymph gland size. We further
      demonstrate that STAT signaling marks actively proliferating hemocytes in the
      early lymph gland, and inhibition of this pathway causes decreased lymph gland
      growth similar to loss of Scalloped and PVF2, demonstrating a requirement for
      PVR/STAT signaling in the regulation of lymph gland size. Finally, we demonstrate
      that Scalloped regulates PVR expression and the maintenance of progenitors
      downstream of PVR/STAT/ADGF signaling. These findings further establish the role 
      of the TEAD family transcription factors in the regulation of important signaling
      molecules, and expand our mechanistic insight into the balance between progenitor
      maintenance and proliferation required for the regulation of lymph gland
      homeostasis.

AB  - The embryonic precursor of the vertebrate central nervous system, the neural
      plate, is patterned along the anterior-posterior axis and shaped by morphogenetic
      movements early in development. We previously identified the genes sall1 and
      sall4, known regulators of pluripotency in other contexts, as transcriptional
      targets of developmental signaling pathways that regulate neural development.
      Here, we demonstrate that these two genes are required for induction of posterior
      neural fates, the cell shape changes that contribute to neural tube closure, and 
      later neurogenesis. Upon sall1 or sall4 knockdown, defects are associated with
      the failure of the neural plate to differentiate. Consistent with this,
      sall-deficient neural tissue exhibits an aberrant upregulation of pou5f3 family
      genes, the Xenopus homologs of the mammalian stem cell maintenance factor Pou5f1 
      (Oct4). Furthermore, overexpression of pou5f3 genes in Xenopus causes defects in 
      neural patterning, morphogenesis, and differentiation that phenocopy those
      observed in sall1 and sall4 morphants. In all, this work shows that both sall1
      and sall4 act to repress pou5f3 family gene expression in the neural plate,
      thereby allowing vertebrate neural development to proceed.

AB  - The allantois-derived umbilical component of the chorio-allantoic placenta
      shuttles fetal blood to and from the chorion, thereby ensuring fetal-maternal
      exchange. The progenitor populations that establish and supply the
      fetal-umbilical interface lie, in part, within the base of the allantois, where
      the germ line is claimed to segregate from the soma. Results of recent studies in
      the mouse have reported that STELLA (DPPA-3, PGC7) co-localizes with PRDM1
      (BLIMP1), the bimolecular signature of putative primordial germ cells (PGCs)
      throughout the fetal-placental interface. Thus, if PGCs form extragonadally
      within the posterior region of the mammal, they cannot be distinguished from the 
      soma on the basis of these proteins. We used immunohistochemistry,
      immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy of the mouse gastrula to co-localize 
      STELLA with a variety of gene products, including pluripotency factor OCT-3/4,
      mesendoderm-associated T and MIXl1, mesendoderm- and endoderm-associated FOXa2
      and hematopoietic factor Runx1. While a subpopulation of cells localizing OCT-3/4
      was always found independently of STELLA, STELLA always co-localized with
      OCT-3/4. Despite previous reports that T is involved in specification of the germ
      line, co-localization of STELLA and T was detected only in a small subset of
      cells in the base of the allantois. Slightly later in the hindgut lip,
      STELLA+/(OCT-3/4+) co-localized with FOXa2, as well as with RUNX1, indicative of 
      definitive endoderm and hemangioblasts, respectively. STELLA was never found with
      MIXl1. On the basis of these and previous results, we conclude that STELLA
      identifies at least five distinct cell subpopulations within the allantois and
      hindgut, where they may be involved in mesendodermal differentiation and
      hematopoiesis at the posterior embryonic-extraembryonic interface. These data
      provide a new point of departure for understanding STELLA's potential roles in
      building the fetal-placental connection.

AB  - The Drosophila vestigial gene is required for proliferation and differentiation
      of the adult wing and for differentiation of larval and adult muscle identity.
      Vestigial is part of a multi-protein transcription factor complex, which includes
      Scalloped, a TEAD-class DNA binding protein. Binding Scalloped is necessary for
      translocation of Vestigial into the nucleus. We show that Vestigial is
      extensively post-translationally modified and at least one of these modifications
      is required for proper function during development. We have shown that there is
      p38-dependent phosphorylation of Serine 215 in the carboxyl-terminal region of
      Vestigial. Phosphorylation of Serine 215 occurs in the nucleus and requires the
      presence of Scalloped. Comparison of a phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable
      mutant forms of Vestigial shows differences in the ability to rescue the wing and
      muscle phenotypes associated with a null vestigial allele.

AB  - Paxillin (Pxn) is a key adapter protein and signaling regulator at sites of
      cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Here, we investigated the role of Pxn
      during vertebrate development using the zebrafish embryo as a model system. We
      have characterized two Pxn genes, pxna and pxnb, in zebrafish that are maternally
      supplied and expressed in multiple tissues. Gene editing and antisense gene
      knockdown approaches were used to uncover Pxn functions during zebrafish
      development. While mutation of either pxna or pxnb alone did not cause gross
      embryonic phenotypes, double mutants lacking maternally supplied pxna or pxnb
      displayed defects in cardiovascular, axial, and skeletal muscle development.
      Transient knockdown of Pxn proteins resulted in similar defects. Irregular
      myotome shape and ECM composition were observed, suggesting an "inside-out"
      signaling role for Paxillin genes in the development of myotendinous junctions.
      Inhibiting non-muscle Myosin-II during somitogenesis altered the subcellular
      localization of Pxn protein and phenocopied pxn gene loss-of-function. This
      indicates that Paxillin genes are effectors of actomyosin contractility-driven
      morphogenesis of trunk musculature in zebrafish. Together, these results reveal
      new functions for Pxn during muscle development and provide novel genetic models 
      to elucidate Pxn functions.

AB  - Cranial sensory ganglia are components of the peripheral nervous system that
      possess a significant somatosensory role and include neurons within the
      trigeminal and epibranchial nerve bundles. Although it is well established that
      these ganglia arise from interactions between neural crest and neurogenic placode
      cells, the molecular basis of ganglia assembly is still poorly understood.
      Members of the Annexin protein superfamily play key roles in sensory nervous
      system development throughout metazoans. Annexin A6 is expressed in chick
      trigeminal and epibranchial placode cell-derived neuroblasts and neurons, but its
      function in cranial ganglia formation has not been elucidated. To this end, we
      interrogated the role of Annexin A6 using gene perturbation studies in the chick 
      embryo. Our data reveal that placode cell-derived neuroblasts with reduced
      Annexin A6 levels ingress and migrate normally to the ganglionic anlage, where
      neural crest cell corridors correctly form around them. Strikingly, while Annexin
      A6-depleted placode cell-derived neurons still express mature neuronal markers,
      they fail to form two long processes, which are considered morphological features
      of mature neurons, and no longer innervate their designated targets due to the
      absence of this bipolar morphology. Moreover, overexpression of Annexin A6 causes
      some placode cell-derived neurons to form extra protrusions alongside these
      bipolar processes. These data demonstrate that the molecular program associated
      with neuronal maturation is distinct from that orchestrating changes in neuronal 
      morphology, and, importantly, reveal Annexin A6 to be a key membrane scaffolding 
      protein during sensory neuron membrane biogenesis. Collectively, our results
      provide novel insight into mechanisms underscoring morphological changes within
      placode cell-derived neurons that are essential for cranial gangliogenesis.

AB  - The number of root cortex cell layers varies among plants, and many species have 
      several cortical cell layers. We recently demonstrated that the two rice
      orthologs of the Arabidopsis SHR gene, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2, could complement the A.
      thaliana shr mutant. Moreover, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2 expression in A. thaliana roots 
      induced the formation of extra root cortical cell layers. In this article, we
      demonstrate that the overexpression of AtSHR and OsSHR2 in rice roots leads to
      plants with wide and short roots that contain a high number of extra cortical
      cell layers. We hypothesize that SHR genes share a conserved function in the
      control of cortical cell layer division and the number of ground tissue cell
      layers in land plants.

TI  - Homeostatic response to blocking cell division in Drosophila imaginal discs: Role
      of the Fat/Dachsous (Ft/Ds) pathway.

AB  - One major problem in developmental biology is the identification of the
      mechanisms that control the final size of tissues and organs. We are addressing
      this issue in the imaginal discs of Drosophila by analysing the response to
      blocking cell division in large domains in the wing and leg discs. The affected
      domains may be zones of restricted lineage like compartments, or zones of open
      lineage that may integrate cells from the surrounding territory. Our results
      reveal the existence of a powerful homeostatic mechanism that can compensate for 
      gross differences in growth rates and builds structures of normal size. This
      mechanism functions at the level of whole discs, inducing additional cell
      proliferation to generate the cells that populate the cell division-arrested
      territory and generating an active recruitment process to integrate those cells. 
      The activation of this response mechanism is mediated by alterations in the
      normal activity of PCP genes of the Fat/Ds system: in discs mutant for dachs, ds 
      or four jointed the response mechanism is not activated.

AB  - Ciliopathies are a class of diseases caused by the loss of a ubiquitous,
      microtubule-based organelle called a primary cilium. Ciliopathies commonly result
      in defective development of the craniofacial complex, causing midfacial defects, 
      craniosynostosis, micrognathia and aglossia. Herein, we explored how the
      conditional loss of primary cilia on neural crest cells (Kif3a(f/f);Wnt1-Cre)
      generated aglossia. On a cellular level, our data revealed that aglossia in
      Kif3a(f/f);Wnt1-Cre embryos was due to a loss of mesoderm-derived muscle
      precursors migrating into and surviving in the tongue anlage. To determine the
      molecular basis for this phenotype, we performed RNA-seq, in situ hybridization, 
      qPCR and Western blot analyses. We found that transduction of the Sonic hedgehog 
      (Shh) pathway, rather than other pathways previously implicated in tongue
      development, was aberrant in Kif3a(f/f);Wnt1-Cre embryos. Despite increased
      production of full-length GLI2 and GLI3 isoforms, previously identified GLI
      targets important for mandibular and glossal development (Foxf1, Foxf2, Foxd1 and
      Foxd2) were transcriptionally downregulated in Kif3a(f/f);Wnt1-Cre embryos.
      Genetic removal of GLI activator (GLIA) isoforms in neural crest cells
      recapitulated the aglossia phenotype and downregulated Fox gene expression.
      Genetic addition of GLIA isoforms in neural crest cells partially rescued the
      aglossia phenotype and Fox gene expression in Kif3a(f/f);Wnt1-Cre embryos.
      Together, our data suggested that glossal development requires primary
      cilia-dependent GLIA activity in neural crest cells. Furthermore, these data, in 
      conjunction with our previous work, suggested prominence specific roles for GLI
      isoforms; with development of the frontonasal prominence relying heavily on the
      repressor isoform and the development of the mandibular prominence/tongue relying
      heavily on the activator isoform.

      have functions in numerous biological processes including neuronal proliferation,
      differentiation, migration, axon guidance, and neurite outgrowth, as well as in
      synapse formation and function. However, germline knockout of APP yields
      relatively subtle phenotypes, and brain development appears grossly normal. This 
      is thought to be due in part to functional compensation by APP family members and
      other type I transmembrane proteins. Here, we have generated a conditional mouse 
      knockout for APP that is controlled temporally using Cre(ER) and tamoxifen
      administration. We show that total cortical expression of APP is reduced
      following tamoxifen administration during embryonic time points critical for
      cortical lamination, and that this results in displacement of Reelin-positive
      cells below the cortical plate with a concurrent elevation in Reelin protein
      levels. These results support a role for APP in cortical lamination and
      demonstrate the utility of a conditional knockout approach in which APP can be
      deleted with temporal control in vivo. This new tool should be useful for many
      different applications in the study of APP function across the mammalian life
      span.

AB  - Gonadal atrophy is the most typical and dramatic manifestation of intraspecific
      hybrid dysgenesis syndrome leading to sterility in Drosophila melanogaster
      dysgenic progeny. The P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis is primarily associated
      with germ cell degeneration during the early stages of Drosophila embryonic
      development at elevated temperatures. In the present study, we have defined the
      phase of germ cell death as beginning at the end of embryogenesis immediately
      following gonad formation. However, the temperature-dependent screening of germ
      cell developmental patterns in the dysgenic background showed that early germ
      cells are susceptible to the hybrid dysgenesis at any Drosophila life-cycle
      stage, including in the imago. Electron microscopy of germ cells after dysgenesis
      induction revealed significant changes in subcellular structure, especially
      mitochondria, prior to cellular breakdown. The mitochondrial pathology can
      promote the activation of cell death pathways in dysgenic germ cells, which leads
      to gonadal atrophy.

AB  - We characterize the genetic diversity of Xenopus laevis strains using RNA-seq
      data and allele-specific analysis. This data provides a catalogue of coding
      variation, which can be used for improving the genomic sequence, as well as for
      better sequence alignment, probe design, and proteomic analysis. In addition, we 
      paint a broad picture of the genetic landscape of the species by functionally
      annotating different classes of mutations with a well-established prediction tool
      (PolyPhen-2). Further, we specifically compare the variation in the progeny of
      four crosses: inbred genomic (J)-strain, outbred albino (B)-strain, and two
      hybrid crosses of J and B strains. We identify a subset of mutations specific to 
      the B strain, which allows us to investigate the selection pressures affecting
      duplicated genes in this allotetraploid. From these crosses we find the ratio of 
      non-synonymous to synonymous mutations is lower in duplicated genes, which
      suggests that they are under greater purifying selection. Surprisingly, we also
      find that function-altering ("damaging") mutations constitute a greater fraction 
      of the non-synonymous variants in this group, which suggests a role for
      subfunctionalization in coding variation affecting duplicated genes.

AB  - Satellite cells, also known as muscle stem cells, are responsible for skeletal
      muscle growth and repair in mammals. Pax7 and Pax3 transcription factors are
      established satellite cell markers required for muscle development and
      regeneration, and there is great interest in identifying additional factors that 
      regulate satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or skeletal muscle
      regeneration. Due to the powerful regenerative capacity of many zebrafish
      tissues, even in adults, we are exploring the regenerative potential of adult
      zebrafish skeletal muscle. Here, we show that adult zebrafish skeletal muscle
      contains cells similar to mammalian satellite cells. Adult zebrafish
      satellite-like cells have dense heterochromatin, express Pax7 and Pax3,
      proliferate in response to injury, and show peak myogenic responses 4-5 days
      post-injury (dpi). Furthermore, using a pax7a-driven GFP reporter, we present
      evidence implicating satellite-like cells as a possible source of new muscle. In 
      lieu of central nucleation, which distinguishes regenerating myofibers in
      mammals, we describe several characteristics that robustly identify newly-forming
      myofibers from surrounding fibers in injured adult zebrafish muscle. These
      characteristics include partially overlapping expression in satellite-like cells 
      and regenerating myofibers of two RNA-binding proteins Rbfox2 and Rbfoxl1, known 
      to regulate embryonic muscle development and function. Finally, by analyzing
      pax7a; pax7b double mutant zebrafish, we show that Pax7 is required for adult
      skeletal muscle repair, as it is in the mouse.

AB  - Vasculogenesis involves the differentiation of vascular endothelial progenitors
      de novo from undifferentiated mesoderm, their migration and coalescence to form
      the major embryonic vessels and the acquisition of arterial or venous identity.
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (Vegf) signaling plays multiple roles during
      vascular development. However, its function during embryonic vasculogenesis has
      been controversial. Previous studies have implicated Vegf signaling in either
      regulating arteriovenous specification or overall vascular endothelial
      differentiation. To clarify the role of Vegf in embryonic vasculogenesis and
      identify its downstream targets, we used chemical inhibitors of Vegf receptor
      (Vegfr) signaling in zebrafish embryos as well as zebrafish genetic mutants. A
      high level of chemical inhibition of Vegfr signaling resulted in the reduction of
      overall vascular endothelial marker gene expression, including downregulation of 
      both arterial and venous markers, ultimately leading to the apoptosis of vascular
      endothelial cells. In contrast, a low level of Vegfr inhibition specifically
      blocked arterial specification while the expression of venous markers appeared
      largely unaffected or increased. Inhibition of Vegfr signaling prior to the
      initiation of vasculogenesis reduced overall vascular endothelial
      differentiation, while inhibition of Vegfr signaling starting at
      mid-somitogenesis stages largely inhibited arterial specification. Conversely,
      Vegf overexpression resulted in the expansion of both arterial and
      pan-endothelial markers, while the expression of several venous-specific markers 
      was downregulated. We further show that Vegf signaling affects overall
      endothelial differentiation by modulating the expression of the ETS transcription
      factor etv2/ etsrp. etv2 expression was downregulated in Vegfr- inhibited
      embryos, and expanded in Vegfaa-overexpressing embryos. Furthermore,
      vascular-specific overexpression of etv2 in Vegfr-inhibited embryos rescued
      defects in vascular endothelial differentiation. Similarly, vegfaa genetic
      mutants displayed a combination of the two phenotypes observed with chemical
      Vegfr inhibition: the expression of arterial and pan-endothelial markers
      including etv2 was downregulated while the expression of most venous markers was 
      either expanded or unchanged. Based on these results we propose a revised model
      which explains the different phenotypes observed upon inhibition of Vegf
      signaling: low levels of Vegf signaling promote overall vascular endothelial
      differentiation and cell survival by upregulating etv2 expression, while high

AB  - Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and plays an
      essential role in sex-specific germ cell development in the mammalian gonad. RA
      is essential for male gametogenesis and hence fertility. However, RA can also
      disrupt sexual cell fate in somatic cells of the testis, promoting
      transdifferentiation of male Sertoli cells to female granulosa-like cells when
      the male sexual regulator Dmrt1 is absent. The feminizing ability of RA in the
      Dmrt1 mutant somatic testis suggests that RA might normally play a role in
      somatic cell differentiation or cell fate maintenance in the ovary. To test for
      this possibility we disrupted RA signaling in somatic cells of the early fetal
      ovary using three genetic strategies and one pharmaceutical approach. We found
      that deleting all three RA receptors (RARs) in the XX somatic gonad at the time
      of sex determination did not significantly affect ovarian differentiation,
      follicle development, or female fertility. Transcriptome analysis of adult triple
      mutant ovaries revealed remarkably little effect on gene expression in the
      absence of somatic RAR function. Likewise, deletion of three RA synthesis enzymes
      (Aldh1a1-3) at the time of sex determination did not masculinize the ovary. A
      dominant-negative RAR transgene altered granulosa cell proliferation, likely due 
      to interference with a non-RA signaling pathway, but did not prevent granulosa
      cell specification and oogenesis or abolish fertility. Finally, culture of fetal 
      XX gonads with an RAR antagonist blocked germ cell meiotic initiation but did not
      disrupt sex-biased gene expression. We conclude that RA signaling, although
      crucial in the ovary for meiotic initiation, is not required for granulosa cell
      specification, differentiation, or reproductive function.

AB  - Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a master developmental regulator. In 1995, the SHH
      crystal structure predicted that SHH-E176 (human)/E177 (mouse) regulates
      signaling through a Zn(2+)-dependent mechanism. While Zn(2+) is known to be
      required for SHH protein stability, a regulatory role for SHH-E176 or Zn(2+) has 
      not been described. Here, we show that SHH-E176/177 modulates Zn(2+)-dependent
      cross-linking in vitro and is required for endogenous signaling, in vivo. While
      ectopically expressed SHH-E176A is highly active, mice expressing SHH-E177A at
      endogenous sites (Shh(E177A/-)) are morphologically indistinguishable from mice
      lacking SHH (Shh(-/-)), with patterning defects in both embryonic spinal cord and
      forebrain. SHH-E177A distribution along the embryonic spinal cord ventricle is
      unaltered, suggesting that E177 does not control long-range transport. While
      SHH-E177A association with cilia basal bodies increases in embryonic ventral
      spinal cord, diffusely distributed SHH-E177A is not detected. Together, these
      results reveal a novel role for E177-Zn(2+) in regulating SHH signaling that may 
      involve critical, cilia basal-body localized changes in cross-linking and/or
      conformation.

AB  - The ability of the Spemann organizer to induce dorsal axis formation is dependent
      on downstream factors of the maternal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway has been identified as one of
      the downstream components of the maternal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The
      ability of the FGF signaling pathway to induce the formation of a dorsal axis
      with a complete head structure requires chordin (chd) expression; however, the
      molecular mechanisms involved in this developmental process, due to activation of
      FGF signaling, remain unclear. In this study, we showed that activation of the
      FGF signaling pathway induced the formation of complete head structures through
      the expression of chd and dickkopf-1b (dkk1b). Using the organizer-deficient
      maternal mutant, ichabod, we identified dkk1b as a novel downstream factor in the
      FGF signaling pathway. We also demonstrate that dkk1b expression is necessary,
      after activation of the FGF signaling pathway, to induce neuroectoderm patterning
      along the anteroposterior (AP) axis and for formation of complete head
      structures. Co-injection of chd and dkk1b mRNA resulted in the formation of a
      dorsal axis with a complete head structure in ichabod embryos, confirming the
      role of these factors in this developmental process. Unexpectedly, we found that 
      chd induced dkk1b expression in ichabod embryos at the shield stage. However, chd
      failed to maintain dkk1b expression levels in cells of the shield and,
      subsequently, in the cells of the prechordal plate after mid-gastrula stage. In
      contrast, activation of the FGF signaling pathway maintained the dkk1b expression
      from the beginning of gastrulation to early somitogenesis. In conclusion,
      activation of the FGF signaling pathway induces the formation of a dorsal axis
      with a complete head structure through the expression of chd and subsequent
      maintenance of dkk1b expression levels.

AB  - We previously reported the requirement of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)
      for spermatogenesis through transcriptional repression of somatic genes and
      meiosis-specific genes. To characterize how PRC2's two methyltransferase
      subunits, EZH1 and EZH2, regulate histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation during
      germ cell development, we generated mouse models with a germline ablation of EZH1
      and/or EHZ2. Only the combined loss of EZH1 and EZH2 caused a depletion of global
      H3K27me3 marks and meiotic arrest in spermatocytes. Genome-wide analysis of
      H3K27me3 in spermatogenic cells revealed that a noncanonical EZH1-PRC2 could
      establish and maintain this histone mark on somatic genes and certain meiotic
      genes. Consistent with it having active enhancers in testis, Ezh1 was not only
      abundant in highly differentiated spermatocytes but also in actively
      proliferating progenitor and stem germ cells. Taken together, our findings
      suggest that the expression level of Ezh1 determines the restoration of H3K27
      methylation in the absence of the canonical EZH2-PRC2.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge during development via an
      endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition from hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal 
      aorta (DA). Using in situ hybridization and analysis of a knock-in RedStar
      reporter, we show that the transcriptional regulator Hhex is expressed in
      endothelium of the dorsal aorta (DA) and in clusters of putative HSCs as they are
      specified during murine development. We exploited this observation, using the
      Hhex locus to define cis regulatory elements, enhancers and interacting
      transcription factors that are both necessary and sufficient to support gene
      expression in the emerging HSC. We identify an evolutionarily conserved
      non-coding region (ECR) in the Hhex locus with the capacity to bind the
      hematopoietic-affiliated transcriptional regulators Gata2, SCL, Fli1, Pu.1 and
      Ets1/2. This region is sufficient to drive the expression of a transgenic GFP
      reporter in the DA endothelium and intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters.
      GFP-positive AGM cells co-expressed HSC-associated markers c-Kit, CD34,
      VE-Cadherin, and CD45, and were capable of multipotential differentiation and
      long term engraftment when transplanted into myelo-ablated recipients. The Hhex
      ECR was also sufficient to drive expression at additional blood sites including
      the yolk sac blood islands, fetal liver, vitelline and umbilical arteries and the
      adult bone marrow, suggesting a common mechanism for Hhex regulation throughout
      ontogenesis of the blood system. To explore the physiological requirement for the
      Hhex ECR region during hematoendothelial development, we deleted the ECR element 
      from the endogenous locus in the context of a targeted Hhex-RedStar reporter
      allele. Results indicate a specific requirement for the ECR in blood-associated
      Hhex expression during development and further demonstrate a requirement for this
      region in the adult HSC compartment. Taken together, our results identified the
      ECR region as an enhancer both necessary and sufficient for gene expression in
      HSC development and homeostasis. The Hhex ECR thus appears to be a core node for 
      the convergence of the transcription factor network that governs the emergence of
      HSCs.

AB  - Arthropods have numerous sense organs, which are adapted to their habitat. While 
      some sense organs are similar in structure and function in all arthropod groups, 
      structural differences in functionally related sense organs have been described, 
      as well as the absence of particular sense organ subtypes in individual arthropod
      groups. Here we address the question of how the diverse structures of arthropod
      sense organs have evolved by analysing the underlying molecular developmental
      processes in a crustacean, an arthropod group that has been neglected so far. We 
      have investigated the development of four types of chemo- and mechanosensory
      sense organs in the branchiopod Daphnia magna (Cladocera) that either cannot be
      found in arthropods other than crustaceans or represent adaptations to an aquatic
      environment. The formation of the sensory organ precursors shows greater
      similarity to the arthropod taxa Chelicerata and Myriapoda than to the more
      closely related insects. All analysed sense organ types co-express the proneural 
      genes ASH and atonal regardless of their structure and function. In contrast, in 
      Drosophila melanogaster, ASH and atonal expression does not overlap and the genes
      confer different sense organ subtype identities. We performed experimental
      co-expression studies in D. melanogaster and found that the combinatorial
      expression of ato and ASH can change the external structure of sense organs. Our 
      results indicate a central role for ASH and Atonal family members in the
      emergence of structural variations in arthropod sense organs.

AB  - Directed cell migration is critical for metazoan development. During
      Caenorhabditis elegans development many neuronal, muscle and other cell types
      migrate. Multiple classes of proteins have been implicated in cell migration
      including secreted guidance cues, receptors for guidance cues and intracellular
      proteins that respond to cues to polarize cells and produce the forces that move 
      them. In addition, cell surface and secreted proteases have been identified that 
      may clear the migratory route and process guidance cues. We report here that
      mnp-1 is required for neuronal cell and growth cone migrations. MNP-1 is
      expressed by migrating cells and functions cell autonomously for cell migrations.
      We also find a genetic interaction between mnp-1 and cam-1, which encodes a Ror
      receptor tyrosine kinase required for some of the same cell migrations.

AB  - Wnt proteins are critical for embryonic cardiogenesis and cardiomyogenesis by
      regulating different intracellular signalling pathways. Whereas canonical
      Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is required for mesoderm induction and proliferation 
      of cardiac progenitor cells, beta-catenin independent, non-canonical Wnt
      signalling regulates cardiac specification and terminal differentiation. Although
      the diverse cardiac malformations associated with the loss of non-canonical Wnt11
      in mice such as outflow tract (OFT) defects, reduced ventricular trabeculation,
      myofibrillar disorganization and reduced cardiac marker gene expression are well 
      described, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not completely
      understood. Here we aimed to further characterize Wnt11 mediated signal
      transduction during vertebrate cardiogenesis. Using Xenopus as a model system, we
      show by loss of function and corresponding rescue experiments that the
      non-canonical Wnt signalling mediator Rcsd1 is required downstream of Wnt11 for
      ventricular trabeculation, terminal differentiation of cardiomyocytes and cardiac
      morphogenesis. We here place Rcsd1 downstream of Wnt11 during cardiac development
      thereby providing a novel mechanism for how non-canonical Wnt signalling
      regulates vertebrate cardiogenesis.

AB  - Matching appendage size to body size is fundamental to animal function.
      Generating an appropriately-sized appendage is a robust process executed during
      development which is also critical for regeneration. When challenged, larger
      animals are programmed to regenerate larger limbs than smaller animals within a
      single species. Understanding this process has important implications for
      regenerative medicine. To approach this complex question, models with altered
      appendage size:body size ratios are required. We hypothesized that repeatedly
      challenging axolotls to regrow limb buds would affect their developmental program
      resulting in altered target morphology. We discovered that after 10 months
      following this experimental procedure, limbs that developed were permanently
      miniaturized. This altered target morphology was preserved upon amputation and
      regeneration. Future experiments using this platform should provide critical
      information about how target limb size is encoded within limb progenitors.

TI  - Histone H1 defect in escort cells triggers germline tumor in Drosophila ovary.
PG  - 40-49

AB  - Drosophila ovary is recognized as one of the best model systems to study stem
      cell biology in vivo. We had previously identified an autonomous role of the
      histone H1 in germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance. Here, we found that histone
      H1 depletion in escort cells (ECs) resulted in an increase of
      spectrosome-containing cells (SCCs), an ovary tumor-like phenotype. Further
      analysis showed that the Dpp pathway is excessively activated in these SCC cells,
      while the expression of bam is attenuated. In the H1-depleted ECs, both
      transposon activity and DNA damage had increased dramatically, followed by EC
      apoptosis, which is consistent with the role of H1 in other somatic cells.
      Surprisingly, H1-depleted ECs acquired cap cell characteristics including dpp
      expression, and the resulting abnormal Dpp level inhibits SCC further
      differentiation. Most interestingly, double knockdown of H1 and dpp in ECs can
      reduce the number of SCCs to the normal level, indicating that the additional Dpp
      secreted by ECs contributes to the germline tumor. Taken together, our findings
      indicate that histone H1 is an important epigenetic factor in controlling EC
      characteristics and a key suppressor of germline tumor.

TI  - Tcf7l2 plays crucial roles in forebrain development through regulation of
      thalamic and habenular neuron identity and connectivity.
PG  - 62-76

AB  - The thalamus acts as a central integrator for processing and relaying sensory and
      motor information to and from the cerebral cortex, and the habenula plays pivotal
      roles in emotive decision making by modulating dopaminergic and serotonergic
      circuits. These neural compartments are derived from a common developmental
      progenitor domain, called prosomere 2, in the caudal forebrain. Thalamic and
      habenular neurons exhibit distinct molecular profile, neurochemical identity, and
      axonal circuitry. However, the mechanisms of how their progenitors in prosomere 2
      give rise to these two populations of neurons and contribute to the forebrain
      circuitry remains unclear. In this study, we discovered a previously unrecognized
      role for Tcf7l2, a transcription factor known as the canonical Wnt nuclear
      effector and diabetes risk-conferring gene, in establishing neuronal identity and
      circuits of the caudal forebrain. Using genetic and chemical axon tracers, we
      showed that efferent axons of the thalamus, known as the thalamocortical axons
      (TCAs), failed to elongate normally and strayed from their normal course to
      inappropriate locations in the absence of Tcf7l2. Further experiments with
      thalamic explants revealed that the pathfinding defects of Tcf7l2-deficient TCAs 
      were associated at least in part with downregulation of guidance receptors Robo1 
      and Robo2 expression. Moreover, the fasciculus retroflexus, the main habenular
      output tract, was missing in embryos lacking Tcf7l2. These axonal defects may
      result from dysregulation of Nrp2 guidance receptor. Strikingly, loss of Tcf7l2
      caused a post-mitotic identity switch between thalamic and habenular neurons.
      Despite normal acquisition of progenitor identity in prosomere 2,
      Tcf7l2-deficient thalamic neurons adopted a molecular profile of a neighboring
      forebrain derivative, the habenula. Conversely, habenular neurons failed to
      maintain their normal post-mitotic neuronal identity and acquired a subset of
      thalamic neuronal features in the absence of Tcf7l2. Our findings suggest a
      unique role for Tcf7l2 in generating distinct neuronal phenotypes from
      homogeneous progenitor population, and provide a better understanding of the
      mechanism underlying neuronal specification, differentiation, and connectivity of
      the developing caudal forebrain.

AB  - The diversity of neurons in the nervous system is specified by many genes,
      including those that encode transcription factors (TFs) and play crucial roles in
      coordinating gene transcription. To understand how the spatiotemporal expression 
      of TF genes is regulated to generate neuronal diversity, we used one member of
      the LIM-Hox family, lin-11, as a model that is necessary for the differentiation 
      of amphid neurons in the nematode C. elegans and a related species C. briggsae.
      We characterized transcriptional regulation of lin-11 and uncovered regulatory
      roles of two of the largest introns, intron 3 and intron 7. These introns promote
      lin-11 expression in non-overlapping sets of neurons. Phenotypic rescue
      experiments in C. elegans revealed that intron 3 is capable of restoring lin-11
      function based on gene expression patterns and behavioral assays. Interestingly, 
      intron 3-driven reporter expression showed differences in neuronal cell types
      between C. briggsae and C. elegans, indicating evolutionary changes in lin-11
      regulation between the two species. Reciprocal transformation experiments
      provided further evidence consistent with functional changes in both cis and
      trans regulation of lin-11. To further investigate transcriptional regulation of 
      lin-11, we dissected the intronic regions in C. elegans and identified
      cell-specific enhancers. These enhancers possess multiple sequence blocks that
      are conserved among Caenorhabditis species and possess TF binding sites. We
      tested the role of a subset of predicted TFs and discovered that while three of
      them (SKN-1, CEH-6, and CRH-1) act via the intron 3 enhancer to negatively
      regulate lin-11 expression in neurons, another TF (CES-1) acts positively via the
      intron 7 enhancer. Overall, our findings demonstrate that neuronal expression of 
      lin-11 involves multiple TF regulators and regulatory modules some of which have 
      diverged in Caenorhabditis nematodes.

AB  - The mammalian kidney collecting ducts are critical for water, electrolyte and
      acid-base homeostasis and develop as a branched network of tubular structures
      composed of principal cells intermingled with intercalated cells. The
      intermingled nature of the different collecting duct cell types has made it
      challenging to identify unique and critical factors that mark and/or regulate the
      development of the different collecting duct cell lineages. Here we report that
      the canonical Notch signaling pathway components, RBPJ and Presinilin1 and 2, are
      involved in patterning the mouse collecting duct cell fates by maintaining a
      balance between principal cell and intercalated cell fates. The relatively
      reduced number of principal cells in Notch-signaling-deficient kidneys offered a 
      unique genetic leverage to identify critical principal cell-enriched factors by
      transcriptional profiling. Elf5, which codes for an ETS transcription factor, is 
      one such gene that is down-regulated in kidneys with Notch-signaling-deficient
      collecting ducts. Additionally, Elf5 is among the earliest genes up regulated by 
      ectopic expression of activated Notch1 in the developing collecting ducts. In the
      kidney, Elf5 is first expressed early within developing collecting ducts and
      remains on in mature principal cells. Lineage tracing of Elf5-expressing cells
      revealed that they are committed to the principal cell lineage by as early as
      E16.5. Over-expression of ETS Class IIa transcription factors, including Elf5,
      Elf3 and Ehf, increase the transcriptional activity of the proximal promoters of 
      Aqp2 and Avpr2 in cultured ureteric duct cell lines. Conditional inactivation of 
      Elf5 in the developing collecting ducts results in a small but significant
      reduction in the expression levels of Aqp2 and Avpr2 genes. We have identified
      Elf5 as an early maker of the principal cell lineage that contributes to the
      expression of principal cell specific genes.

AB  - The Drosophila intestine is maintained by multipotent intestinal stem cells
      (ISCs). Although increased intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation has been
      correlated with a decrease in longevity, there is some discrepancy regarding
      whether a decrease or block in proliferation also has negative consequences. Here
      we identify headcase (hdc) as a novel marker of ISCs and enteroblasts (EBs) and
      demonstrate that Hdc function is required to prevent ISC/EB loss through
      apoptosis. Hdc depletion was used as a strategy to ablate ISCs and EBs in order
      to test the ability of flies to survive without ISC function. While flies lacking
      ISCs showed no major decrease in survival under unchallenged conditions, flies
      depleted of ISCs and EBs exhibited decreased survival rates in response to damage
      to mature enterocytes (EC) that line the intestinal lumen. Our findings indicate 
      that constant renewal of the intestinal epithelium is not absolutely necessary
      under normal laboratory conditions, but it is important in the context of
      widespread chemical-induced damage when significant repair is necessary.

      a stochastic model for stem cell proliferation.

AB  - The C. elegans adult hermaphrodite contains a renewable pool of mitotically
      dividing germ cells that are contained within the progenitor zone (PZ), at the
      distal region of the germline. From the PZ, cells enter meiosis and
      differentiate, ensuring the continued production of oocytes. In this study, we
      investigated the proliferation strategy used to maintain the PZ pool by using a
      photoconvertible marker to follow the fate of selected germ cells and their
      descendants in live worms. We found that the most distal pool of 6-8 rows of
      cells in the PZ (the distal third) behave similarly, with a fold expansion
      corresponding to one cell division every 6h on average. Proximal to this region, 
      proliferation decreases, and by the proximal third of the PZ, most cells have
      stopped dividing. In addition, we show that all the descendants of cells in rows 
      3 and above move proximally and leave the PZ over time. Combining our data with
      previous studies, we propose a stochastic model for the C. elegans PZ
      proliferation, where a pool of proliferating stem cells divide symmetrically
      within the distal most 6-8 rows of the germline and exit from this stem cell
      niche occurs by displacement due to competition for limited space.

AB  - How species-specific developmental timing is controlled is largely unknown. By
      following human embryonic stem (ES) cell and mouse epiblast stem (EpiS) cell
      differentiation through detailed RNA-sequencing time courses, here we show that
      pluripotent stem cells closely retain in vivo species-specific developmental
      timing in vitro. In identical neural differentiation conditions in vitro, gene
      expression profiles are accelerated in mouse EpiS cells compared to human ES
      cells with relative rates of differentiation closely reflecting the rates of
      progression through the Carnegie stages in utero. Dynamic Time Warping analysis
      identified 3389 genes that were regulated more quickly in mouse EpiS cells and
      identified none that were regulated more quickly in human ES cells.
      Interestingly, we also find that human ES cells differentiated in teratomas
      maintain the same rate of differentiation observed in vitro in spite of being
      grown in a mouse host. These results suggest the existence of a cell autonomous, 
      species-specific developmental clock that pluripotent stem cells maintain even
      out of context of an intact embryo.

TI  - Vascular budding in Symplegma brakenhielmi and the evolution of coloniality in
      styelid ascidians.

AB  - Individuals of colonial animals (e.g. zooids) are in continuous turnover. In
      ascidians colonial or solitary species have evolved by convergence multiple
      times. Colonial Botryllus and Botrylloides are well-studied genera that exhibit
      colony-wide developmental mechanisms that regulate synchronous and orchestrated
      cycles of budding and turnover of zooids. The origins of modular developmental
      mechanisms that facilitated the evolution of coloniality in this group remain
      unclear. To reconstruct ancestral states of coloniality we studied Symplegma
      brakenhielmi, a sister taxon of the botryllids. S. brakenhielmi zooids are
      embedded in a common tunic and present a similar vascular system as the
      botrylloides, however development and turnover of zooids occurs asynchronously
      and in a more independent manner. We generated a table of common stages of
      budding in Symplegma and Botryllus for comparative studies of asexual
      development. We tested dependent processes of budding among individuals of the
      colony by systemic bud or zooid removals. Although our results showed a higher
      degree of independence in bud development in S. brakenhielmi, we found a subtle
      colony-wide regulatory mechanism of modular development, i.e. new buds expedited 
      development after the removal of all buds in the colony. Next, we characterized
      external morphology, ultrastructure, and abundance of circulatory blood cells in 
      the vascular system of S. brakenhielmi. Macrophage-like cells (MLCs) are involved
      in zooid resorption and turnover. Proportions of MLCs in the blood of S.
      brakenhielmi corresponded to the peak of occurrence of this cell type during the 
      budding cycle of B. schlosseri. We found several new blood cell types in S.
      brakenhielmi, including two cell types that resemble circulatory progenitor stem 
      cells of other botryllid colonial ascidians. These cells showed features of
      undifferentiated cells and expressed mitotic marker Phospho-histone H3.
      Comparative studies of S. brakenhielmi and B. schlosseri allow us to discuss
      possible changes in the regulation of modular development (i.e. regulation of
      life and death in the colony), and a possible contribution of circulatory blood
      cells in budding processes. We propose that the higher degree of developmental
      independence in S. brakenhielmi budding is a result of its ancestral solitary
      mode of development.

TI  - Germ cell regeneration-mediated, enhanced mutagenesis in the ascidian Ciona
      intestinalis reveals flexible germ cell formation from different somatic cells.

AB  - The ascidian Ciona intestinalis has a high regeneration capacity that enables the
      regeneration of artificially removed primordial germ cells (PGCs) from somatic
      cells. We utilized PGC regeneration to establish efficient methods of germ line
      mutagenesis with transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). When
      PGCs were artificially removed from animals in which a TALEN pair was expressed, 
      somatic cells harboring mutations in the target gene were converted into germ
      cells, this germ cell population exhibited higher mutation rates than animals not
      subjected to PGC removal. PGC regeneration enables us to use TALEN expression
      vectors of specific somatic tissues for germ cell mutagenesis. Unexpectedly, cis 
      elements for epidermis, neural tissue and muscle could be used for germ cell
      mutagenesis, indicating there are multiple sources of regenerated PGCs,
      suggesting a flexibility of differentiated Ciona somatic cells to regain
      totipotency. Sperm and eggs of a single hermaphroditic, PGC regenerated animal
      typically have different mutations, suggesting they arise from different cells.
      PGCs can be generated from somatic cells even though the maternal PGCs are not
      removed, suggesting that the PGC regeneration is not solely an artificial event
      but could have an endogenous function in Ciona. This study provides a technical
      innovation in the genome-editing methods, including easy establishment of mutant 
      lines. Moreover, this study suggests cellular mechanisms and the potential
      evolutionary significance of PGC regeneration in Ciona.

AB  - Vestibular hair cells of the inner ear are specialized receptors that detect
      mechanical stimuli from gravity and motion via the deflection of a polarized
      bundle of stereocilia located on their apical cell surfaces. The orientation of
      stereociliary bundles is coordinated between neighboring cells by core PCP
      proteins including the large adhesive G-protein coupled receptor Celsr1. We show 
      that mice lacking Celsr1 have vestibular behavioral phenotypes including
      circling. In addition, we show that Celsr1 is asymmetrically distributed at cell 
      boundaries between hair cells and neighboring supporting cells in the developing 
      vestibular and auditory sensory epithelia. In the absence of Celsr1 the
      stereociliary bundles of vestibular hair cells are misoriented relative to their 
      neighbors, a phenotype that is greatest in the cristae of the semicircular
      canals. Since horizontal semi-circular canal defects lead to circling in other
      mutant mouse lines, we propose that this PCP phenotype is the cellular basis of
      the circling behavior in Celsr1 mutants.

AB  - In mice, implantation always occurs towards the antimesometrial side of the
      uterus, while the placenta develops at the mesometrial side. What determines this
      particular orientation of the implanting blastocyst remains unclear. Uterine
      glands are critical for implantation and pregnancy. In this study, we showed that
      uterine gland development and active Wnt signaling activity is limited to the
      antimesometrial side of the uterus. Dkk2, a known antagonist of Wnt signaling, is
      only present at the mesometrial side of the uterus. Imaging of whole uterus,
      thick uterine sections (100-1000microm), and individual glands revealed that
      uterine glands are simple tubes with branches that are directly connected to the 
      luminal epithelium and are only present towards the antimesometrial side of the
      uterus. By developing a unique mouse model targeting the uterine epithelium, we
      demonstrated that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is essential for prepubertal gland
      formation and normal implantation, but dispensable for postpartum gland
      development and regeneration. Our results for the first time have provided a
      probable explanation for the antimesometrial bias for implantation.

AB  - Formation of motile cilia in vertebrate embryos is essential for proper
      development and tissue function. Key regulators of motile ciliogenesis are the
      transcription factors FOXJ1 and NOTO, which are conserved throughout vertebrates.
      Downstream target genes of FOXJ1 have been identified in a variety of species,
      organs and cultured cell lines; in murine embryonic and foetal tissues, however, 
      FOXJ1 and NOTO effectors have not been comprehensively analysed and our knowledge
      of the downstream genetic programme driving motile ciliogenesis in the mammalian 
      lung and ventral node is fragmentary. We compared genome-wide expression profiles
      of undifferentiated E14.5 vs. abundantly ciliated E18.5 micro-dissected airway
      epithelia as well as Foxj1(+) vs. Foxj1-deficient foetal (E16.5) lungs of the
      mouse using microarray hybridisation. 326 genes deregulated in both screens are
      candidates for FOXJ1-dependent, ciliogenesis-associated factors at the endogenous
      onset of motile ciliogenesis in the lung, including 123 genes that have not been 
      linked to ciliogenesis before; 46% of these novel factors lack known homologues
      outside mammals. Microarray screening of Noto(+) vs. Noto null early headfold
      embryos (E7.75) identified 59 of the lung candidates as NOTO/FOXJ1-dependent
      factors in the embryonic left-right organiser that carries a different subtype of
      motile cilia. For several uncharacterised factors from this small overlap -
      including 1700012B09Rik, 1700026L06Rik and Fam183b - we provide extended
      experimental evidence for a ciliary function.

AB  - During skeletal muscle development, myocytes aggregate and fuse to form
      multinucleated muscle fibers. Inhibition of myocyte fusion is thought to
      significantly derail the differentiation of functional muscle fibers. Despite the
      purported importance of fusion in myogenesis, in vivo studies of this process in 
      vertebrates are rather limited. Myomaker, a multipass transmembrane protein, has 
      been shown to be the first muscle-specific fusion protein essential for myocyte
      fusion in the mouse. We have generated loss-of-function alleles in zebrafish
      myomaker, and found that fusion of myocytes into syncytial fast-twitch muscles
      was significantly compromised. However, mutant myocytes could be recruited to
      fuse with wild-type myocytes in chimeric embryos, albeit rather inefficiently.
      Conversely, overexpression of Myomaker was sufficient to induce hyperfusion among
      fast-twitch myocytes, and it also induced fusion among slow-twitch myocytes that 
      are normally fusion-incompetent. In line with this, Myomaker overexpression also 
      triggered fusion in another myocyte fusion mutant compromised in the function of 
      the junctional cell adhesion molecule, Jam2a. We also provide evidence that Rac, 
      a regulator of actin cytoskeleton, requires Myomaker activity to induce fusion,
      and that an approximately 3kb of myomaker promoter sequence, with multiple E-box 
      motifs, is sufficient to direct expression within the fast-twitch muscle lineage.
      Taken together, our findings underscore a conserved role for Myomaker in
      vertebrate myocyte fusion. Strikingly, and in contrast to the mouse, homozygous
      myomaker mutants are viable and do not exhibit discernible locomotory defects.
      Thus, in the zebrafish, myocyte fusion is not an absolute requirement for
      skeletal muscle morphogenesis and function.

AB  - The eMouseAtlas resource is an online database of 3D digital models of mouse
      development, an ontology of mouse embryo anatomy and a gene-expression database
      with about 30K spatially mapped gene-expression patterns. It is closely linked
      with the MGI/GXD database at the Jackson Laboratory and holds links to almost all
      available image-based gene-expression data for the mouse embryo. In this resource
      article we describe the novel web-based tools we have developed for 3D
      visualisation of embryo anatomy and gene expression. We show how mapping of gene 
      expression data onto spatial models delivers a framework for capturing gene
      expression that enhances our understanding of development, and we review the
      exploratory tools utilised by the EMAGE gene expression database as a means of
      defining co-expression of in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry, and
      lacZ-omic expression patterns. We report on recent developments of the eHistology
      atlas and our use of web-services to support embedding of the online 'The Atlas
      of Mouse Development' in the context of other resources such as the DMDD mouse
      phenotype database. In addition, we discuss new developments including a
      cellular-resolution placental atlas, third-party atlas models, clonal analysis
      data and a new interactive eLearning resource for developmental processes.

AB  - Collective cell migration is involved in numerous processes both physiological,
      such as embryonic development, and pathological such as metastasis. Compared to
      single cell migration, collective motion requires cell behaviour coordination
      through an as-yet poorly understood but critical cell-cell communication
      mechanism. Using Drosophila border cell migration, we show here that the small
      Rho GTPase Cdc42 regulates cell-cell communication. Indeed, we demonstrate that
      Cdc42 controls protrusion formation in a cell non-autonomous manner. Moreover, we
      found that the endocytic small GTPase Rab11, controls Cdc42 localisation to the
      periphery of migrating border cell clusters. Accordingly, over-expression of
      Cdc42 in border cells rescues the loss of Rab11 function. In addition, we showed 
      that Cdc42 acts upstream of Moesin, a cytoskeletal regulator known to function
      downstream of rab11. Thus, our study positions Cdc42 as a new key player in
      cell-cell communication, acting downstream of Rab11.

AB  - The group C SOX transcription factors SOX4, -11 and -12 play important and
      mutually overlapping roles in development of a number of organs. Here, we
      examined the role of SoxC genes during gonadal development in mice. All three
      genes were expressed in developing gonads of both sexes, predominantly in somatic
      cells, with Sox4 being most strongly expressed. Sox4 deficiency resulted in
      elongation of both ovaries and testes, and an increased number of testis cords.
      While female germ cells entered meiosis normally, male germ cells showed reduced 
      levels of differentiation markers Nanos2 and Dnmt3l and increased levels of
      pluripotency genes Cripto and Nanog, suggesting that SOX4 may normally act to
      restrict the pluripotency period of male germ cells and ensure their proper
      differentiation. Finally, our data reveal that SOX4 (and, to a lesser extent,
      SOX11 and -12) repressed transcription of the sex-determining gene Sox9 via an
      upstream testis-specific enhancer core (TESCO) element in fetal gonads, raising
      the possibility that SOXC proteins may function as transcriptional repressors in 
      a context-dependent manner.

AB  - Although p53 is not essential for normal embryonic development, it plays a
      pivotal role in many biological and pathological processes, including cell fate
      determination-dependent and independent events and diseases. The expression and
      activity of p53 largely depend on its two biological inhibitors, MDM2 and MDMX,
      which have been shown to form a complex in order to tightly control p53 to an
      undetectable level during early stages of embryonic development. However, more
      delicate studies using conditional gene-modification mouse models show that MDM2 
      and MDMX may function separately or synergistically on p53 regulation during
      later stages of embryonic development and adulthood in a cell and tissue-specific
      manner. Here, we report the role of the MDM2/MDMX-p53 pathway in pancreatic islet
      morphogenesis and functional maintenance, using mouse lines with specific
      deletion of MDM2 or MDMX in pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells. Interestingly,
      deletion of MDM2 results in defects of embryonic endocrine pancreas development, 
      followed by neonatal hyperglycemia and lethality, by inducing pancreatic
      progenitor cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. However, unlike
      MDM2-knockout animals, mice lacking MDMX in endocrine progenitor cells develop
      normally. But, surprisingly, the survival rate of adult MDMX-knockout mice
      drastically declines compared to control mice, as blockage of neonatal
      development of endocrine pancreas by inhibition of cell proliferation and
      subsequent islet dysfunction and hyperglycemia eventually lead to type 1
      diabetes-like disease with advanced diabetic nephropathy. As expected, both MDM2 
      and MDMX deletion-caused pancreatic defects are completely rescued by loss of
      p53, verifying the crucial role of the MDM2 and/or MDMX in regulating p53 in a
      spatio-temporal manner during the development, functional maintenance, and
      related disease progress of endocrine pancreas. Also, our study suggests a
      possible mouse model of advanced diabetic nephropathy, which is complementary to 
      other established diabetic models and perhaps useful for the development of
      anti-diabetes therapies.

AB  - The present work elucidates the role of miRNA in cell cycle regulation during
      brain development in Drosophila. Here we report that lineage specific depletion
      of dicer-1, a classically acknowledged miRNA biogenesis protein in neuroblasts
      leads to a reduction in their numbers and size in the third instar larval central
      brain. These brains also showed lower number of mitotically active cells and when
      homozygous mitotic clones were generated in an otherwise heterozygous dicer-1
      mutant background via MARCM technique, they showed reduced number of progeny
      cells in individual clones, substantiating the adverse effect of the loss of
      dicer-1 on the proliferative potential of neuroblasts. bantam miRNA, which has
      been classically reported to be involved in tissue growth was found to express in
      neuroblasts and undergo reduced expression in Dicer-1 depleted background in the 
      third instar larval brain. Reduction in the number and proliferative potential of
      neuroblasts in bantam mutant background implies a pivotal role played by bantam
      miRNA in maintenance of neuroblast number. Since, in both Dicer-1 and bantam
      depleted genetic backgrounds, Dacapo, an inhibitor of cyclin E-Cdk complex, was
      found to have elevated expression, we put forward a molecular mechanism involving
      bantam-Dacapo-Cyclin E/Cdk complex that regulates the G1-S phase transition of
      Drosophila neuroblasts.

AB  - In Arabidopsis, leaves produced during the juvenile vegetative phase are simple, 
      while adult leaves are morphologically complex. The juvenile to adult transition 
      is regulated by miR156, a microRNA that promotes juvenility by impeding the
      function of SPL transcription factors, which specify adult leaf traits. Both leaf
      derived sugars, as well as the Mediator Cyclin Dependent Kinase 8 (CDK8) module
      genes CENTER CITY (CCT)/MED12 and GRAND CENTRAL (GCT)/MED13, act upstream of
      miR156 to promote the juvenile to adult transition. However, it is not known
      whether sugar, CCT and GCT repress miR156 independently, as part of the same
      pathway, or in a cooperative manner. Here we show that sugar treatment can
      repress MIR156 expression in the absence of CCT or GCT. Both cct and the
      photosynthetic mutant chlorina1 (ch1) (which decreases sugar synthesis) exhibit
      extended juvenile development and increased MIR156A and MIR156C expression.
      Compared to ch1 and cct single mutants, the ch1 cct double mutant has a stronger 
      effect on juvenile leaf traits, higher MIR156C levels, and a dramatic increase in
      MIR156A. Our results show that sugar and the CDK8 module are capable of
      regulating MIR156 independently, but suggest they normally act together in a
      synergistic manner.

AB  - The Fezzin family member Nedd4-binding protein 3 (N4BP3) is known to regulate
      axonal and dendritic branching. Here, we show that n4bp3 is expressed in the
      neural tissue of the early Xenopus laevis embryo including the eye, the brain and
      neural crest cells. Knockdown of N4bp3 in the Xenopus anterior neural tissue
      results in severe developmental impairment of the eye, the brain and neural crest
      derived cranial cartilage structures. Moreover, we demonstrate that N4bp3
      depletion leads to a significant reduction of both eye and brain specific marker 
      genes and reduced neural crest cell migration. Finally, we demonstrate an impact 
      of N4bp3 deficiency on cell apoptosis and proliferation. Our studies indicate
      that N4bp3 is required for early anterior neural development of vertebrates. This
      is in line with a study implicating that genetic disruption of N4BP3 in humans
      might be related to neurodevelopmental disease.

AB  - The C-X-C motif ligand 14 (CXCL14) is a recently discovered chemokine that is
      highly conserved in vertebrates and expressed in various embryonic and adult
      tissues. CXCL14 signaling has been implicated to function as an antiangiogenic
      and anticancer agent in adults. However, its function during development is
      unknown. We previously identified novel expression of CXCL14 mRNA in various
      ocular tissues during development. Here, we show that CXCL14 protein is expressed
      in the anterior eye at a critical time during neurovascular development and in
      the retina during neurogenesis. We report that RCAS-mediated knockdown of CXCL14 
      causes severe neural defects in the eye including precocious and excessive
      innervation of the cornea and iris. Absence of CXCL14 results in the malformation
      of the neural retina and misprojection of the retinal ganglion neurons. The
      ocular neural defects may be due to loss of CXCL12 modulation since recombinant
      CXCL14 diminishes CXCL12-induced axon growth in vitro. Furthermore, we show that 
      knockdown of CXCL14 causes neovascularization of the cornea. Altogether, our
      results show for the first time that CXCL14 plays a critical role in modulating
      neurogenesis and inhibiting ectopic vascularization of the cornea during ocular
      development.

AB  - Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) control spatiotemporal gene expression patterns in 
      embryos. While measurement of quantitative CRM activities has become efficient,
      measurement of spatial CRM activities still relies on slow, one-by-one methods.
      To overcome this bottleneck, we have developed a high-throughput method that can 
      simultaneously measure quantitative and spatial CRM activities. The new method
      builds profiles of quantitative CRM activities measured at single-embryo
      resolution in many mosaic embryos and uses these profiles as a 'fingerprint' of
      spatial patterns. We show in sea urchin embryos that the new method, Multiplex
      and Mosaic Observation of Spatial Information encoded in Cis-regulatory modules
      (MMOSAIC), can efficiently predict spatial activities of new CRMs and can detect 
      spatial responses of CRMs to gene perturbations. We anticipate that MMOSAIC will 
      facilitate systems-wide functional analyses of CRMs in embryos.

AB  - The importance of juvenile hormone regulating insect oogenesis suggests looking
      for genes whose expression is regulated by this hormone. SPARC is a
      calcium-binding glycoprotein that forms part of the extracellular membranes,
      which in vertebrates participates in bones mineralization or regulating cell
      proliferation in some cancer types. This large number of functions described for 
      SPARC in different species might be related to the significant differences in its
      structure observed when comparing different species-groups. Indeed, these
      structural differences allow characterizing the different clades. In the
      cockroach Blattella germanica, a SPARC homolog emerged from ovarian
      transcriptomes that were constructed to find genes responding to juvenile
      hormone. In insects, SPARC functions have been studied in oogenesis and in embryo
      development of Drosophila melanogaster. In the present work, using RNAi
      approaches, novel functions for SPARC in the B. germanica panoistic ovaries are
      described. We found that depletion of SPARC does not allow to the follicular
      cells to complete mitosis, resulting in giant follicular cells nuclei and in a
      great alteration of the ovarian follicle cytoskeleton. The SPARC contribution to 
      B. germanica oogenesis occurs stabilizing the follicular cell program and helping
      to maintain the nuclear divisions. Moreover, SPARC is necessary to maintain the
      cytoskeleton of the follicular cells. Any modification of these key processes
      disables females for oviposition.

AB  - Sperm selection by females is an important process influencing fertilization and,
      particularly in broadcast-spawning organisms, often occurs before sperm reach the
      egg. Waterborne sperm chemoattractants are one mechanism by which eggs
      selectively influence conspecific sperm behavior, but it remains an open question
      whether the eggs from different females produce different amounts of sperm
      chemoattractant, and how that might influence sperm behavior. Here, we quantify
      the differences in attractant production between females of the sea urchin
      species Lytechinus pictus and use computational models and microfluidic sperm
      chemotaxis assays to determine how differences in chemoattractant production
      between females affects their ability to attract sperm. Our study demonstrates
      that there is significant individual female variation in egg chemoattractant
      production, and that this variation changes the scope and strength of sperm
      attraction. These results provide evidence for the importance of individual
      female variability in differential sperm attraction and fertilization success.

AB  - The thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, control several developmental and homeostatic
      processes. From a molecular point of view, most of their actions depend on the
      activity of the thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs), which are T3-modulated
      transcription factors. Recent studies have not only highlighted that the
      physiological response induced by T3 within a cell depends on the expression of
      specific TRs, but also that the functions of TRs are coordinated by and
      integrated in other signalling pathways. This is particularly the case for the
      multilevel interactions between TRs and the Wnt signalling pathway. Interestingly
      both signals are involved in development and homeostasis, and their alterations
      are responsible for the development of pathologies, such as cancer. Here, we
      present findings on the complex crosstalk between TRs and Wnt in several
      organisms and in different tissue contexts, and speculate on the biological
      relevance of modulating TR-Wnt functionality in therapeutic approaches aimed to
      target cancer cells or applications for regenerative medicine.

AB  - In C. elegans, the anterior-posterior axis is established at the one-cell stage
      when the embryo polarizes along its long axis. One model suggests that a cue from
      the centrosome triggers symmetry breaking and is then dispensable for further
      steps in the process. In the absence of the initial centrosome cue, a redundant
      mechanism, reliant on the centrosome's microtubules, can polarize the cell.
      Despite this model, data from multiple sources suggest that direct
      centrosome-contact with the cortex may play a role in ensuring robust
      polarization. Some of this past work includes analysis of pam-1 mutants, which
      lack a functional puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase and have aberrant centrosome
      positioning and variable polarization defects. To better understand the role of
      centrosome dynamics in polarization, we looked in detail at centrosome behavior
      in relation to key polarity landmarks in pam-1 mutants as well as those lacking
      cortical flows. We provide evidence for a model in which sustained direct contact
      between the centrosome and the cortex acts to reinforce both the actomyosin and
      the microtubule-dependent pathways. This contact is necessary for polarization
      when flows are inhibited.

      genes. Defects in hematopoiesis have also been reported in Cdx mutant murine
      embryonic stem cell models, however, to date no mouse model reflecting the
      zebrafish Cdx mutant hematopoietic phenotype has been described. This is likely
      due, in part, to functional redundancy among Cdx members and the early lethality 
      of Cdx2 null mutants. To circumvent these limitations, we used Cre-mediated
      conditional deletion to assess the impact of concomitant loss of Cdx1 and Cdx2 on
      murine primitive hematopoiesis. We found that Cdx1/Cdx2 double mutants exhibited 
      defects in primitive hematopoiesis and yolk sac vasculature concomitant with
      reduced expression of several genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors 
      including Scl/Tal1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Scl was 
      occupied by Cdx2 in vivo, and Cdx mutant hematopoietic yolk sac differentiation
      defects could be rescued by expression of exogenous Scl. These findings
      demonstrate critical roles for Cdx members in murine primitive hematopoiesis
      upstream of Scl.

AB  - The polarity protein Par3/Bazooka (Baz) has been established as a central
      component of the apical basal polarity system that determines the position of
      cell-cell junctions in epithelial cells. Consistent with that view, we show that 
      shortly before gastrulation in Drosophila, Baz protein in the mesoderm is
      down-regulated from junctional sites in response to Snail (Sna) expression. This 
      down-regulation leads to a specific decrease in adherens junctions without
      affecting other E-Cadherin pools. However, we further show that, interactions
      between Baz and junctions are not unidirectional. During apical constriction and 
      the internalization of the mesoderm, down-regulation of Baz is transiently
      blocked as adherens junctions shift apically and are strengthened in response to 
      tension generated by contractile actomyosin. When such junction remodeling is
      prevented by down-regulating myosin, Baz is lost prematurely in mesodermal
      epithelium. During such apical shifts, Baz is initially left behind as the
      junction shifts position, but then re-accumulates at the new location of the
      junctions. On the dorsal side of the embryo, a similar pattern of myosin activity
      appears to limit the basal shift in junctions normally driven by Baz that
      controls epithelium folding. Our results suggest a model where the sensitivity of
      Baz to Sna expression leads to the Sna-dependent junction disassembly required
      for a complete epithelium-mesenchymal transition. Meanwhile this loss of
      Baz-dependent junction maintenance is countered by the myosin-based mechanism
      which promotes an apical shift and strengthening of junctions accompanied by a
      transient re-positioning and maintenance of Baz proteins.

AB  - Cdx and Hox transcription factors are important regulators of axial patterning
      and are required for tissue generation along the vertebrate body axis. Cdx genes 
      have been demonstrated to act upstream of Hox genes in midgestation embryos.
      Here, we investigate the role of Cdx transcription factors in the gradual
      colinear activation of the Hox clusters. We found that Hox temporally colinear
      expression is severely affected in epiblast stem cells derived from Cdx null
      embryos. We demonstrate that after initiation of 3' Hox gene transcription, Cdx
      activity is crucial for H3K27ac deposition and for accessibility of
      cis-regulatory elements around the central - or 'trunk' - Hox genes. We thereby
      identify a Cdx-responsive segment of HoxA, immediately 5' to the recently defined
      regulatory domain orchestrating initial transcription of the first Hox gene. We
      propose that this partition of HoxA into a Wnt-driven 3' part and the newly found
      Cdx-dependent middle segment of the cluster, forms a structural fundament of Hox 
      colinearity of expression. Subsequently to initial Wnt-induced activation of 3'
      Hox genes, Cdx transcription factors would act as crucial effectors for
      activating central Hox genes, until the last gene of the cluster arrests the
      process.

TI  - The posterior neural plate in axolotl gives rise to neural tube or turns

AB  - Classical grafting experiments in the Mexican axolotl had shown that the
      posterior neural plate of the neurula is no specified neuroectoderm but gives
      rise to somites of the tail and posterior trunk. The bipotentiality of this
      region with neuromesodermal progenitor cell populations was revealed more
      recently also in zebrafish, chick, and mouse. We reinvestigated the potency of
      the posterior plate in axolotl using grafts from transgenic embryos,
      immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. The posterior plate is
      brachyury-positive except for its more anterior parts which express sox2. Between
      anterior and posterior regions of the posterior plate a small domain with sox2+
      and bra+ cells exists. Lineage analysis of grafted GFP-labeled posterior plate
      tissue revealed that posterior GFP+ cells move from dorsal to ventral, form the
      posterior wall, turn anterior bilaterally, and join the gastrulated paraxial
      presomitic mesoderm. More anterior sox2+/GFP+ cells, however, are integrated into
      the developing spinal cord. Tail notochord is formed from axial mesoderm
      involuted already during gastrulation. Thus the posterior neural plate is a
      postgastrula source of paraxial mesoderm, which performs an anterior turn, a
      novel morphogenetic movement. More anterior plate cells, in contrast, do not turn
      anteriorly but become specified to form tail spinal cord.

AB  - Previous studies in the mouse indicated that ARID3A plays a critical role in the 
      first cell fate decision required for generation of trophectoderm (TE). Here, we 
      demonstrate that ARID3A is widely expressed during mouse and human placentation
      and essential for early embryonic viability. ARID3A localizes to trophoblast
      giant cells and other trophoblast-derived cell subtypes in the junctional and
      labyrinth zones of the placenta. Conventional Arid3a knockout embryos suffer
      restricted intrauterine growth with severe defects in placental structural
      organization. Arid3a null placentas show aberrant expression of subtype-specific 
      markers as well as significant alteration in cytokines, chemokines and
      inflammatory response-related genes, including previously established markers of 
      human placentation disorders. BMP4-mediated induction of trophoblast stem
      (TS)-like cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells results in ARID3A
      up-regulation and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation. Overexpression of ARID3A 
      in BMP4-mediated TS-like cells up-regulates TE markers, whereas pluripotency
      markers are down-regulated. Our results reveal an essential, conserved function
      for ARID3A in mammalian placental development through regulation of both
      intrinsic and extrinsic developmental programs.

TI  - Inactivation of maternal Hif-1alpha at mid-pregnancy causes placental defects and

AB  - A critical transition occurs near mid-gestation of mammalian pregnancy. Prior to 
      this transition, low concentrations of oxygen (hypoxia) signaling through Hypoxia
      Inducible Factor (HIF) functions as a morphogen for the placenta and fetal
      organs. Subsequently, functional coupling of the placenta and fetal
      cardiovascular system for oxygen (O2) transport is required to support the
      continued growth and development of the fetus. Here we tested the hypothesis that
      Hif-1alpha is required in maternal cells for placental morphogenesis and
      function. We used Tamoxifen-inducible Cre-Lox to inactivate Hif-1alpha in
      maternal tissues at E8.5 (MATcKO), and used ODD-Luciferase as a reporter of
      hypoxia in placenta and fetal tissues. MATcKO of Hif-1alpha reduced the number of
      uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and Tpbpa-positve trophoblast cells in the
      maternal decidua at E13.5 -15.5. There were dynamic changes in all three layers
      of E13.5-15.5 MATcKO placenta. Of note was the under-development of the labyrinth
      at E15.5 associated with reduced Ki67 and increased TUNEL staining consistent
      with reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Labyrinth defects were
      particularly evident in placentas connected to effectively HIF-1alpha
      heterozygous null embryos. MATcKO had no effect on basal ODD-Luciferase activity 
      in fetal organs (heart, liver, brain) at any stage, but at E13.5-15.5 resulted in
      enhanced induction of the ODD-Luciferase hypoxia reporter when the dam's inspired
      O2 was reduced to 8% for 4 hours. MATcKO also slowed the growth after E13.5 of
      fetuses that were effectively heterozygous for Hif-1alpha, with most being
      non-viable at E15.5. The hearts of these E15.5 fetuses were abnormal with
      reduction in size, thickened epicardium and mesenchymal septum. We conclude that 
      maternal HIF-1alpha is required for placentation including recruitment of uNK and
      trophoblast cells into the maternal decidua and other trophoblast cell behaviors.
      The placental defects render the fetus vulnerable to O2 deprivation after
      mid-gestation.

AB  - The transcription factor Sox10 is a key regulator of vertebrate neural crest
      development and serves crucial functions in the differentiation of multiple
      neural crest lineages. In the chick neural crest, two cis-regulatory elements
      have been identified that mediate Sox10 expression: Sox10E2, which initiates
      expression in cranial neural crest; Sox10E1 driving expression in vagal and trunk
      neural crest. Both also mediate Sox10 expression in the otic placode. Here, we
      have dissected and analyzed the Sox10E1 enhancer element to identify upstream
      regulatory inputs. Via mutational analysis, we found two critical Sox sites with 
      differential impact on trunk versus otic Sox10E1 mediated reporter expression.
      Mutation of a combined SoxD/E motif was sufficient to completely abolish neural
      crest but not ear enhancer activity. However, mutation of both the SoxD/E and
      another SoxE site eliminated otic Sox10E1 expression. Loss-of-function
      experiments reveal Sox5 and Sox8 as critical inputs for trunk neural crest
      enhancer activity, but only Sox8 for its activity in the ear. Finally, we show by
      ChIP and co-immunoprecipitation that Sox5 directly binds to the SoxD/E site, and 
      that it can interact with Sox8, further supporting their combinatorial role in
      activation of Sox10E1 in the trunk neural crest. The results reveal important
      tissue-specific inputs into Sox10 expression in the developing embryo.

AB  - Mechanosensitive Merkel cells are thought to have finite lifespans, but
      controversy surrounds the frequency of their replacement and which precursor
      cells maintain the population. We found by embryonic EdU administration that
      Merkel cells undergo terminal cell division in late embryogenesis and survive
      long into adulthood. We also found that new Merkel cells are produced
      infrequently during normal skin homeostasis and that their numbers do not change 
      during natural or induced hair cycles. In contrast, live imaging and EdU
      experiments showed that mild mechanical injury produced by skin shaving
      dramatically increases Merkel cell production. We confirmed with genetic cell
      ablation and fate-mapping experiments that new touch dome Merkel cells in adult
      mice arise from touch dome keratinocytes. Together, these independent lines of
      evidence show that Merkel cells in adult mice are long-lived, are replaced rarely
      during normal adult skin homeostasis, and that their production can be induced by
      repeated shaving. These results have profound implications for understanding
      sensory neurobiology and human diseases such as Merkel cell carcinoma.

AB  - One of the defining features of the evolutionary success of insects is the
      morphological diversification of their appendages, especially mouthparts.
      Although most insects share a common mouthpart ground plan, there is remarkable
      diversity in the relative size and shapes of these appendages among different
      insect lineages. One of the most prominent examples of mouthpart modification can
      be found in the enlargement of mandibles in stag beetles (Coleoptera, Insecta).
      In order to understand the proximate mechanisms of mouthpart modification, we
      investigated the function of appendage-patterning genes in mandibular enlargement
      during extreme growth of the sexually dimorphic mandibles of the stag beetle
      Cyclommatus metallifer. Based on knowledge from Drosophila and Tribolium studies,
      we focused on seven appendage patterning genes (Distal-less (Dll), aristaless
      (al), dachshund (dac), homothorax (hth), Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr),
      escargot (esg), and Keren (Krn). In order to characterize the developmental
      function of these genes, we performed functional analyses by using RNA
      interference (RNAi). Importantly, we found that RNAi knockdown of dac resulted in
      a significant mandible size reduction in males but not in female mandibles. In
      addition to reducing the size of mandibles, dac knockdown also resulted in a loss
      of the serrate teeth structures on the mandibles of males and females. We found
      that al and hth play a significant role during morphogenesis of the large
      male-specific inner mandibular tooth. On the other hand, knockdown of the distal 
      selector gene Dll did not affect mandible development, supporting the hypothesis 
      that mandibles likely do not contain the distal-most region of the ancestral
      appendage and therefore co-option of Dll expression is unlikely to be involved in
      mandible enlargement in stag beetles. In addition to mandible development, we
      explored possible roles of these genes in controlling the divergent antennal
      morphology of Coleoptera.

      of the female reproductive tract. In the uterus, six members of the Wnt family
      are expressed in the neonatal endometrium and deletion of individual Wnt genes
      often leads to similar phenotypes, suggesting an interaction of these genes in
      uterine development and function. Furthermore, Wnts may have complementary
      functions, which could mask the identification of their individual functional
      role in single gene deletions. To circumvent this issue, we have generated a
      deletion of the Porcupine homolog within the female reproductive tract using
      progesterone receptor-Cre mice (Pgr(Cre/+)); preventing Wnt secretion from the
      producing cells. We show that Porcupine-dependent Wnt signaling, unlike
      previously reported, is dispensable for postnatal gland formation but is required
      for post-pubertal gland maintenance as well as for stromal cell proliferation.
      Furthermore, our results demonstrate that WNT7a is sufficient to restore
      post-pubertal endometrial gland formation. Although WNT5a did not restore gland
      formation, it rescued stromal cell proliferation; up-regulating several secreted 
      factors including Fgf10 and Ihh. Our results further elucidate the roles of Wnt
      signaling in uterine development and function as well as provide an ideal system 
      to address individual Wnt functions in the uterus.

AB  - The zebrafish Posterior Lateral Line primordium (PLLp) has emerged as an
      important model system for studying many aspects of development, including cell
      migration, cell type specification and tissue morphogenesis. Despite this, basic 
      aspects of PLLp biology remain incompletely understood. The PLLp is a group of
      approximately 140 cells which pioneers the formation of the Posterior Lateral
      Line (LL) system by migrating along the length of the embryo, periodically
      depositing clusters of epithelial cells, which will go on to form the mature
      sense organs of the lateral line, called neuromasts. The neuromasts are formed
      within the migrating PLLp as protoneuromasts: the first protoneuromast is formed 
      close to the trailing end and additional protoneuromasts are formed sequentially,
      progressively closer to the leading edge of the migrating collective. We imaged
      the migration of PLL primordia and tracked every cell in the lateral line system 
      over the course of migration. From this data set we unambiguously determined the 
      lineage and fate of every cell deposited by the migrating PLLp. We show that, on 
      average, proliferation across the entire PLLp is weakly patterned, with leading
      cells tending to divide more slowly than trailing cells. Neuromasts are formed
      sequentially by local expansion of existing cells along the length of the PLLp,
      not by self-renewing stem cell-like divisions of a restricted leading population 
      that is highly proliferative. The fate of deposited cells, either within
      neuromasts or as interneuromast cells (in between deposited neuromasts) is not
      determined by any obvious stereotyped lineages. Instead, it is determined
      somewhat stochasitcailly, as a function of a cells distance from the center of a 
      maturing protoneuromast. Together, our data provide a rigorous baseline for the
      behavior of the PLLp, which can be used to inform further study of this important
      model system.

TI  - Dmrt1 is necessary for male sexual development in zebrafish.
PG  - 33-46

LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.12.008 [doi]
AB  - The dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) gene is a key
      regulator of sex determination and/or gonadal sex differentiation across metazoan
      animals. This is unusual given that sex determination genes are typically not
      well conserved. The mechanisms by which zebrafish sex is determined have remained
      elusive due to the lack of sex chromosomes and the complex polygenic nature of
      sex determination in domesticated strains. To investigate the role of dmrt1 in
      zebrafish sex determination and gonad development, we isolated mutations
      disrupting this gene. We found that the majority of dmrt1 mutant fish develop as 
      fertile females suggesting a complete male-to-female sex reversal in mutant
      animals that would have otherwise developed as males. A small percentage of
      mutant animals became males, but were sterile and displayed testicular
      dysgenesis. Therefore zebrafish dmrt1 functions in male sex determination and
      testis development. Mutant males had aberrant gonadal development at the onset of
      gonadal sex-differentiation, displaying reduced oocyte apoptosis followed by
      development of intersex gonads and failed testis morphogenesis and
      spermatogenesis. By contrast, female ovaries developed normally. We found that
      Dmrt1 is necessary for normal transcriptional regulation of the amh
      (anti-Mullerian hormone) and foxl2 (forkhead box L2) genes, which are thought to 
      be important for male or female sexual development respectively. Interestingly,
      we identified one dmrt1 mutant allele that co-operates with a linked segregation 
      distorter locus to generate an apparent XY sex determination mechanism. We
      conclude that dmrt1 is dispensable for ovary development but necessary for testis
      development in zebrafish, and that dmrt1 promotes male development by
      transcriptionally regulating male and female genes as has been described in other
      animals. Furthermore, the strong sex-ratio bias caused by dmrt1
      reduction-of-function points to potential mechanisms through which sex
      chromosomes may evolve.

AB  - Cdc42 is a member of the Rho GTPase family and functions as a molecular switch in
      regulating cell migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. However, 
      the role of Cdc42 in heart development remains largely unknown. To determine the 
      function of Cdc42 in heart formation, we have generated a Cdc42 cardiomyocyte
      knockout (CCKO) mouse line by crossing Cdc42 flox mice with myosin light chain
      (MLC) 2a-Cre mice. The inactivation of Cdc42 in embryonic cardiomyocytes induced 
      lethality after embryonic day 12.5. Histological analysis of CCKO embryos showed 
      cardiac developmental defects that included thin ventricular walls and
      ventricular septum defects. Microarray and real-time PCR data also revealed that 
      the expression level of p21 was significantly increased and cyclin B1 was
      dramatically decreased, suggesting that Cdc42 is required for cardiomyocyte
      proliferation. Phosphorylated Histone H3 staining confirmed that the inactivation
      of Cdc42 inhibited cardiomyocytes proliferation. In addition, transmission
      electron microscope studies showed disorganized sarcomere structure and
      disruption of cell-cell contact among cardiomyocytes in CCKO hearts. Accordingly,
      we found that the distribution of N-cadherin/beta-Catenin in CCKO cardiomyocytes 
      was impaired. Taken together, our data indicate that Cdc42 is essential for
      cardiomyocyte proliferation, sarcomere organization and cell-cell adhesion during
      heart development.

AB  - Among the mechanisms that steer cells to their correct fate during development,
      master regulatory networks are unique in their sufficiency to trigger a
      developmental program outside of its normal context. In this review we discuss
      the key features that underlie master regulatory potency during normal and
      ectopic development, focusing on two examples, the retinal determination gene
      network (RDGN) that directs eye development in the fruit fly and the pluripotency
      gene network (PGN) that maintains cell fate competency in the early mammalian
      embryo. In addition to the hierarchical transcriptional activation, extensive
      positive transcriptional feedback, and cooperative protein-protein interactions
      that enable master regulators to override competing cellular programs, recent
      evidence suggests that network topology must also be dynamic, with extensive
      rewiring of the interactions and feedback loops required to navigate the correct 
      sequence of developmental transitions to reach a final fate. By synthesizing the 
      in vivo evidence provided by the RDGN with the extensive mechanistic insight
      gleaned from the PGN, we highlight the unique regulatory capabilities that
      continual reorganization into new hierarchies confers on master control networks.
      We suggest that deeper understanding of such dynamics should be a priority, as
      accurate spatiotemporal remodeling of network topology will undoubtedly be
      essential for successful stem cell based therapeutic efforts.

AB  - Filamentous ascomycetes produce complex multicellular structures during sexual
      reproduction. Little is known about the genetic pathways enabling the
      construction of such structures. Here, with a combination of classical and
      reverse genetic methods, as well as genetic mosaic and graft analyses, we
      identify and provide evidence for key roles for two genes during the formation of
      perithecia, the sexual fruiting bodies, of the filamentous fungus Podospora
      anserina. Data indicate that the proteins coded by these two genes function
      cell-non-autonomously and that their activity depends upon conserved cysteines,
      making them good candidate for being involved in the transmission of a reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) signal generated by the PaNox1 NADPH oxidase inside the
      maturing fruiting body towards the PaMpk1 MAP kinase, which is located inside the
      underlying mycelium, in which nutrients are stored. These data provide important 
      new insights to our understanding of how fungi build multicellular structures.

AB  - Cell-cell signaling plays a prominent role in the formation of the embryonic
      skeleton of sea urchins, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present
      study, we uncover an essential role for TGF-beta sensu stricto signaling in this 
      process. We show that TgfbrtII, a type II receptor dedicated to signaling through
      TGF-beta sensu stricto, is expressed selectively in skeletogenic primary
      mesenchyme cells (PMCs) during skeleton formation. Morpholino (MO) knockdowns and
      studies with a specific TgfbrtII inhibitor (ITD-1) in both S. purpuratus and
      Lytechinus variegatus embryos show that this receptor is required for biomineral 
      deposition. We provide pharmacological evidence that Alk4/5/7 is the cognate
      TGF-beta type I receptor that pairs with TgfbrtII and show by inhibitor
      treatments of isolated micromeres cultured in vitro that both Alk4/5/7 and
      TgfbrtII function cell-autonomously in PMCs. Gene expression and gene knockdown
      studies suggest that TGF-beta sensu stricto may be the ligand that interacts with
      TgfbrtII and support the view that this TGF-beta superfamily ligand provides an
      essential, permissive cue for skeletogenesis, although it is unlikely to provide 
      spatial patterning information. Taken together, our findings reveal that this
      model morphogenetic process involves an even more diverse suite of cell signaling
      pathways than previously appreciated and show that PMCs integrate a complex set
      of both generalized and spatially localized cues in assembling the endoskeleton.

AB  - Oxygenated blood from the heart is directed into the systemic circulation through
      the aortic arch arteries (AAAs). The AAAs arise by remodeling of three
      symmetrical pairs of pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs), which connect the heart
      with the paired dorsal aortae at mid-gestation. Aberrant PAA formation results in
      defects frequently observed in patients with lethal congenital heart disease. How
      the PAAs form in mammals is not understood. The work presented in this manuscript
      shows that the second heart field (SHF) is the major source of progenitors giving
      rise to the endothelium of the pharyngeal arches 3 - 6, while the endothelium in 
      the pharyngeal arches 1 and 2 is derived from a different source. During the
      formation of the PAAs 3 - 6, endothelial progenitors in the SHF extend cellular
      processes toward the pharyngeal endoderm, migrate from the SHF and assemble into 
      a uniform vascular plexus. This plexus then undergoes remodeling, whereby plexus 
      endothelial cells coalesce into a large PAA in each pharyngeal arch. Taken
      together, our studies establish a platform for investigating cellular and
      molecular mechanisms regulating PAA formation and alterations that lead to
      disease.

AB  - Mutations in SIX1 and in its co-factor, EYA1, underlie Branchiootorenal Spectrum 
      disorder (BOS), which is characterized by variable branchial arch, otic and
      kidney malformations. However, mutations in these two genes are identified in
      only half of patients. We screened for other potential co-factors, and herein
      characterize one of them, Pa2G4 (aka Ebp1/Plfap). In human embryonic kidney
      cells, Pa2G4 binds to Six1 and interferes with the Six1-Eya1 complex. In Xenopus 
      embryos, knock-down of Pa2G4 leads to down-regulation of neural border zone,
      neural crest and cranial placode genes, and concomitant expansion of neural plate
      genes. Gain-of-function leads to a broader neural border zone, expanded neural
      crest and altered cranial placode domains. In loss-of-function assays, the later 
      developing otocyst is reduced in size, which impacts gene expression. In
      contrast, the size of the otocyst in gain-of-function assays is not changed but
      the expression domains of several otocyst genes are reduced. Together these
      findings establish an interaction between Pa2G4 and Six1, and demonstrate that it
      has an important role in the development of tissues affected in BOS. Thereby, we 
      suggest that pa2g4 is a potential candidate gene for BOS.

AB  - Tbx20 is a T-box transcription factor that plays essential roles in the
      development and maintenance of the heart. Although it is expressed by cardiac
      progenitors in all species examined, an involvement of Tbx20 in cardiac
      progenitor formation in vertebrates has not been previously described. Here we
      report the identification of a zebrafish tbx20 mutation that results in an
      inactive, truncated protein lacking any functional domains. The cardiac
      progenitor population is strongly diminished in this mutant, leading to the
      formation of a small, stretched-out heart. We found that overexpression of Tbx20 
      results in an enlarged heart with significantly more cardiomyocytes.
      Interestingly, this increase in cell number is caused by both enhanced cardiac
      progenitor cell formation and the proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes,
      and is dependent upon the activity of Tbx20's T-box and transcription activation 
      domains. Together, our findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for
      Tbx20 in promoting cardiac progenitor formation in vertebrates and reveal a novel
      function for its activation domain in cardiac cell proliferation during
      embryogenesis.

AB  - Hensen's node is the "organizer" of the avian and mammalian early embryo. It has 
      many functions, including neural induction and patterning of the ectoderm and
      mesoderm. Some of the signals responsible for these activities are known but
      these do not explain the full complexity of organizer activity. Here we undertake
      a functional screen to discover new secreted factors expressed by the node at
      this time of development. Using a Signal Sequence Trap in yeast, we identify
      several candidates. Here we focus on Calreticulin. We show that in addition to
      its known functions in intracellular Calcium regulation and protein folding,
      Calreticulin is secreted, it can bind to BMP4 and act as a BMP antagonist in vivo
      and in vitro. Calreticulin is not sufficient to account for all organizer
      functions but may contribute to the complexity of its activity.

      urchin embryos.

AB  - Using sea urchin embryos, we demonstrate that the MEK/MAPK/ERK cascade is
      essential for the proper progression of the cell cycle. Activation of a limited
      fraction of MAPK/ERK is required between S-phase and M-phase. Neither DNA
      replication nor CDK1 activation are impacted by the inhibition of this small
      active MAPK/ERK fraction. Nonetheless, the chromatin and spindle organisations
      are profoundly altered. Early morphological disorders induced by the absence of
      MAPK/ERK activation are correlated with an important inhibition of global protein
      synthesis and modification in the cyclin B accumulation profile. After appearance
      of morphological disorders, there is an increase in the level of the inhibitor of
      protein synthesis, 4E-BP, and, ultimately, an activation of the spindle
      checkpoint. Altogether, our results suggest that MAPK/ERK activity is required
      for the synthesis of (a) protein(s) implicated in an early step of chromatin
      /microtubule attachment. If this MAPK/ERK-dependent step is not achieved, the
      cell activates a new checkpoint mechanism, involving the reappearance of 4E-BP
      that maintains a low level of protein translation, thus saving cellular energy.

AB  - During early embryogenesis, FGF signals regulate the antero-posterior (AP)
      patterning of the neural plate by promoting posterior cell fates. In particular, 
      BMP signal-mediated attenuation of FGF pathway plays a critical role in the
      determination of the anterior neural region. Here we show that Tbx2, a T-box
      transcriptional repressor regulates anterior neural specification by suppressing 
      FGF8 signaling pathway in Xenopus embryo. Tbx2 is expressed in the anterior edge 
      of the neural plate in early neurulae. Overexpression and knockdown of Tbx2
      induce expansion and reduction in the expression of anterior neural markers,
      respectively. It also suppresses FGF8-induced ERK phosphorylation and neural
      caudalization. Tbx2, which is a target gene of BMP signal, down-regulates FGF8
      signaling by inhibiting the expression of Flrt3, a positive regulator of this
      pathway. We found that Tbx2 binds directly to the T-box element located in the
      promoter region of Flrt3 gene, thereby interfering with the activity of the
      promoter. Consistently, Tbx2 augmentation of anterior neural formation is
      inhibited by co-expression of Flrt3. Furthermore, disruption of the anterior-most
      structures such as eyes in Tbx2-depleted embryos can be rescued by inhibition of 
      Flrt3 function or FGF signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that Tbx2
      mediates BMP signal to down-regulate FGF signaling pathway by repressing Flrt3
      expression for anterior tissue formation.

AB  - Formation of the mandible requires progressive morphologic change, proliferation,
      differentiation and organization of chondrocytes preceding osteogenesis. The Wnt 
      signaling pathway is involved in regulating bone development and maintenance.
      Chondrocytes that are fated to become bone require Wnt to polarize and orientate 
      appropriately to initiate the endochondral ossification program. Although the
      canonical Wnt signaling has been well studied in the context of bone development,
      the effects of non-canonical Wnt signaling in regulating the timing of cartilage 
      maturation and subsequent bone formation in shaping ventral craniofacial
      structure is not fully understood.. Here we examined the role of the
      non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway (wls, gpc4, wnt5b and wnt9a) in regulating
      zebrafish Meckel's cartilage maturation to the onset of osteogenic
      differentiation. We found that disruption of wls resulted in a significant loss
      of craniofacial bone, whereas lack of gpc4, wnt5b and wnt9a resulted in severely 
      delayed endochondral ossification. This study demonstrates the importance of the 
      non-canonical Wnt pathway in regulating coordinated ventral cartilage
      morphogenesis and ossification.

AB  - Axonal branching is one of the key processes within the enormous complexity of
      the nervous system to enable a single neuron to send information to multiple
      targets. However, the molecular mechanisms that control branch formation are
      poorly understood. In particular, previous studies have rarely addressed the
      mechanisms underlying axonal bifurcation, in which axons form new branches via
      splitting of the growth cone. We demonstrate that DISCO Interacting Protein 2
      (DIP2) is required for precise axonal bifurcation in Drosophila mushroom body
      (MB) neurons by suppressing ectopic bifurcation and regulating the guidance of
      sister axons. We also found that DIP2 localize to the plasma membrane. Domain
      function analysis revealed that the AMP-synthetase domains of DIP2 are essential 
      for its function, which may involve exerting a catalytic activity that modifies
      fatty acids. Genetic analysis and subsequent biochemical analysis suggested that 
      DIP2 is involved in the fatty acid metabolization of acyl-CoA. Taken together,
      our results reveal a function of DIP2 in the developing nervous system and
      provide a potential functional relationship between fatty acid metabolism and
      axon morphogenesis.

AB  - Lymphatic valves (LVs) are cusped luminal structures that permit the movement of 
      lymph in only one direction and are therefore critical for proper lymphatic
      vessel function. Congenital valve aplasia or agenesis can, in some cases, be a
      direct cause of lymphatic disease. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms
      operating during the development and maintenance of LVs may thus aid in the
      establishment of novel therapeutic approaches to treat lymphatic disorders. In
      this study, we examined the role of Connexin43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein
      expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), during valve development. Mouse 
      embryos with a null mutation in Cx43 (Gja1) were previously shown to completely
      lack mesenteric LVs at embryonic day 18. However, interpreting the phenotype of
      Cx43(-/-) mice was complicated by the fact that global deletion of Cx43 causes
      perinatal death due to heart defects during embryogenesis. We have now generated 
      a mouse model (Cx43(LEC)) with a lymphatic-specific ablation of Cx43 and show
      that the absence of Cx43 in LECs causes a delay (rather than a complete block) in
      LV initiation, an increase in immature valves with incomplete leaflet elongation,
      a reduction in the total number of valves, and altered lymphatic capillary
      patterning. The physiological consequences of these lymphatic changes were leaky 
      valves, insufficient lymph transport and reflux, and a high incidence of lethal
      chylothorax. These results demonstrate that the expression of Cx43 is
      specifically required in LECs for normal development of LVs.

AB  - Somitogenesis and subsequent axial skeletal development is regulated by the
      interaction of pathways that determine the periodicity of somite formation,
      rostrocaudal somite polarity and segment identity. Here we use a hypomorphic
      mutant mouse line to demonstrate that Supt20 (Suppressor of Ty20) is required for
      development of the axial skeleton. Supt20 hypomorphs display fusions of the ribs 
      and vertebrae at lower thoracic levels along with anterior homeotic
      transformation of L1 to T14. These defects are preceded by reduction of the
      rostral somite and posterior shifts in Hox gene expression. While cycling of
      Notch target genes in the posterior presomitic mesoderm (PSM) appeared normal,
      expression of Lfng was reduced. In the anterior PSM, Mesp2 expression levels and 
      cycling were unaffected; yet, expression of downstream targets such as Lfng,
      Ripply2, Mesp1 and Dll3 in the prospective rostral somite was reduced accompanied
      by expansion of caudal somite markers such as EphrinB2 and Hes7. Supt20 interacts
      with the Gcn5-containing SAGA histone acetylation complex. Gcn5 hypomorphic
      mutant embryos show similar defects in axial skeletal development preceded by
      posterior shift of Hoxc8 and Hoxc9 gene expression. We demonstrate that Gcn5 and 
      Supt20 hypomorphs show similar defects in rostral-caudal somite patterning
      potentially suggesting shared mechanisms.

TI  - KirrelL, a member of the Ig-domain superfamily of adhesion proteins, is essential
      for fusion of primary mesenchyme cells in the sea urchin embryo.

AB  - In the sea urchin embryo, primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) adhere to one another
      and fuse via filopodia, forming cable-like structures within which skeletal rods 
      are deposited. Although this process was first described more than a century ago,
      molecules that participate in PMC adhesion and fusion have not been identified.
      Here we show that KirrelL, a PMC-specific, Ig domain-containing transmembrane
      protein, is essential for PMC fusion, probably by mediating filopodial adhesions 
      that are a pre-requisite for subsequent membrane fusion. We show that KirrelL is 
      not required for PMC specification, migration, or for direct filopodial contacts 
      between PMCs. In the absence of KirrelL, however, filopodial contacts do not
      result in fusion. kirrelL is a member of a family of closely related, intronless 
      genes that likely arose through an echinoid-specific gene expansion, possibly via
      retrotransposition. Our findings are significant in that they establish a direct 
      linkage between the transcriptional network deployed in the PMC lineage and an
      effector molecule required for a critically important PMC morphogenetic process. 
      In addition, our results point to a conserved role for Ig domain-containing
      adhesion proteins in facilitating cell fusion in both muscle and non-muscle cell 
      lineages during animal development.

AB  - Embryonic neural retinas of avians produce lenses under spreading culture
      conditions. This phenomenon has been regarded as a paradigm of
      transdifferentiation due to the overt change in cell type. Here we elucidated the
      underlying mechanisms. Retina-to-lens transdifferentiation occurs in spreading
      cultures, suggesting that it is triggered by altered cell-cell interactions.
      Thus, we tested the involvement of Notch signaling based on its role in retinal
      neurogenesis. Starting from E8 retina, a small number of crystallin-expressing
      lens cells began to develop after 20 days in control spreading cultures. By
      contrast, addition of Notch signal inhibitors to cultures after day 2 strongly
      promoted lens development beginning at day 11, and a 10-fold increase in
      delta-crystallin expression level. After Notch signal inhibition, transcription
      factor genes that regulate the early stage of eye development, Prox1 and Pitx3,
      were sequentially activated. These observations indicate that the lens
      differentiation potential is intrinsic to the neural retina, and this potential
      is repressed by Notch signaling during normal embryogenesis. Therefore, Notch
      suppression leads to lens transdifferentiation by disinhibiting the neural
      retina-intrinsic program of lens development.

AB  - Chondrogenesis in the developing skeleton requires transformation of chondrocytes
      from a simple mesenchymal condensation to cells with a highly enriched
      extracellular matrix (ECM). This transition is in part accomplished by
      alterations in the chondrocyte protein transport machinery to cope with both the 
      increased amount and large size of ECM components. In a zebrafish mutagenesis
      screen to identify genes essential for cartilage development, we uncovered a
      mutant that disrupts the gene encoding Sec1 family domain containing 1 (scfd1).
      Homozygous scfd1 mutant embryos exhibit a profound craniofacial abnormality
      caused by a failure of chondrogenesis. Loss of scfd1 was found to hinder ER to
      Golgi transport of ECM proteins and is accompanied with activation of the
      unfolded protein response in chondrocytes. We further demonstrate a conserved
      role for Scfd1 in differentiation of mammalian chondrocytes, in which loss of
      either SCFD1 or STX18, a SLY1 interacting t-SNARE, severely impair transport of
      type II collagen. These results show that the existence of a specific export
      pathway, mediated by a complex containing SCFD1 and STX18 that plays an essential
      role in secretion of large ECM proteins during chondrogenesis.

AB  - Striatal cholinergic interneurons and basal forebrain cholinergic projection
      neurons, which together comprise the forebrain cholinergic system, regulate
      attention, memory, reward pathways, and motor activity through the
      neuromodulation of multiple brain circuits. The importance of these neurons in
      the etiology of neurocognitive disorders has been well documented, but our
      understanding of their specification during embryogenesis is still incomplete.
      All forebrain cholinergic projection neurons and interneurons appear to share a
      common developmental origin in the embryonic ventral telencephalon, a region that
      also gives rise to GABAergic projection neurons and interneurons. Significant
      progress has been made in identifying the key intrinsic and extrinsic factors
      that promote a cholinergic fate in this precursor population. However, how
      cholinergic interneurons and projection neurons differentiate from one another
      during development, as well as how distinct developmental programs contribute to 
      heterogeneity within those two classes, is not yet well understood. In this
      review we summarize the transcription factors and signaling molecules known to
      play a role in the specification and early development of striatal and basal
      forebrain cholinergic neurons. We also discuss the heterogeneity of these
      populations and its possible developmental origins.

TI  - The tbx2a/b transcription factors direct pronephros segmentation and corpuscle of
      Stannius formation in zebrafish.

AB  - The simplified and genetically conserved zebrafish pronephros is an excellent
      model to examine the cryptic processes of cell fate decisions during the
      development of nephron segments as well as the origins of associated endocrine
      cells that comprise the corpuscles of Stannius (CS). Using whole mount in situ
      hybridization, we found that transcripts of the zebrafish genes t-box 2a (tbx2a) 
      and t-box 2b (tbx2b), which belong to the T-box family of transcription factors, 
      were expressed in the caudal intermediate mesoderm progenitors that give rise to 
      the distal pronephros and CS. Deficiency of tbx2a, tbx2b or both tbx2a/b reduced 
      the size of the distal late (DL) segment, which was accompanied by a proximal
      convoluted segment (PCT) expansion. Further, tbx2a/b deficiency led to
      significantly larger CS clusters. These phenotypes were also observed in embryos 
      with the from beyond (fby)(c144) mutation, which encodes a premature stop codon
      in the tbx2b T-box sequence. Conversely, overexpression of tbx2a and tbx2b in
      wild-type embryos expanded the DL segment where cells were comingled with the
      adjacent DE, and also decreased CS cell number, but notably did not alter PCT
      development-providing independent evidence that tbx2a and tbx2b are each
      necessary and sufficient to promote DL fate and suppress CS genesis. Epistasis
      studies indicated that tbx2a acts upstream of tbx2b to regulate the DL and CS
      fates, and likely has other targets as well. Retinoic acid (RA) addition and
      inhibition studies revealed that tbx2a and tbx2b are negatively regulated by RA
      signaling. Interestingly, the CS cell expansion that typifies tbx2a/b deficiency 
      also occurred when blocking Notch signaling with the chemical DAPT
      (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester). Ectopic 
      activation of Notch in Tg(hsp70::Gal4; UAS::NICD)(NICD) embryos led to a reduced 
      CS post heat-shock induction. To further examine the link between the tbx2a/b
      genes and Notch during CS formation, DAPT treatment was used to block Notch
      activity in tbx2a/b deficient embryos, and tbx2a/b knockdown was performed in
      NICD transgenic embryos. Both manipulations caused similar CS expansions,
      indicating that Notch functions upstream of the tbx2a/b genes to suppress CS
      ontogeny. Taken together, these data reveal for the first time that tbx2a/b
      mitigate pronephros segmentation downstream of RA, and that interplay between
      Notch signaling and tbx2a/b regulate CS formation, thus providing several novel
      insights into the genetic regulatory networks that influence these lineages.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex malignancy with poor prognosis. Several
      genetic lesions can lead to the disease. One of these corresponds to the
      NUP98-HOXA9 (NA9) translocation that fuses sequences encoding the N-terminal part
      of NUP98 to those encoding the DNA-binding domain of HOXA9. Despite several
      studies, the mechanism underlying NA9 ability to induce leukemia is still
      unclear. To bridge this gap, we sought to functionally dissect NA9 activity using
      Drosophila. For this, we generated transgenic NA9 fly lines and expressed the
      oncoprotein during larval hematopoiesis. This markedly enhanced cell
      proliferation and tissue growth, but did not alter cell fate specification.
      Moreover, reminiscent to NA9 activity in mammals, strong cooperation was observed
      between NA9 and the MEIS homolog HTH. Genetic characterization of NA9-induced
      phenotypes suggested interference with PVR (Flt1-4 RTK homolog) signaling, which 
      is similar to functional interactions observed in mammals between Flt3 and HOXA9 
      in leukemia. Finally, NA9 expression was also found to induce non-cell autonomous
      effects, raising the possibility that its leukemia-inducing activity also relies 
      on this property. Together, our work suggests that NA9 ability to induce blood
      cell expansion is evolutionarily conserved. The amenability of NA9 activity to a 
      genetically-tractable system should facilitate unraveling its molecular
      underpinnings.

AB  - Zebrafish germ plasm is composed of mRNAs such as vasa and nanos and of proteins 
      such as Bucky ball, all of which localize symmetrically in four aggregates at the
      distal region of the first two cleavage furrows. The coordination of actin
      microfilaments, microtubules and kinesin is essential for the correct
      localization of the germ plasm. Rho-GTPases, through their effectors, coordinate 
      cytoskeletal dynamics. We address the participation of RhoA and its effector ROCK
      in germ plasm localization during the transition from two- to eight-cell embryos.
      We found that active RhoA is enriched along the cleavage furrow during the first 
      two division cycles, whereas ROCK localizes at the distal region of the cleavage 
      furrows in a similar pattern as the germ plasm mRNAs. Specific inhibition of RhoA
      and ROCK affected microtubules organization at the cleavage furrow; these caused 
      the incorrect localization of the germ plasm mRNAs. The incorrect localization of
      the germ plasm led to a dramatic change in the number of germ cells during the
      blastula and 24hpf embryo stages without affecting any other developmental
      processes. We demonstrate that the Rho/ROCK pathway is intimately related to the 
      determination of germ cells in zebrafish embryos.

TI  - Jak1/Stat3 signaling acts as a positive regulator of pluripotency in chicken
      pre-gastrula embryos.

AB  - Pluripotent cells emerging at very early stages of development are the founders
      of differentiated cells. It has been established in mouse that the
      LIF/Jak/Stat-Nanog axis acts as a positive regulator to support the pluripotent
      state of cells whereas Fgf/Erk signaling acts as a negative regulator to direct
      cells to enter the differentiating state. In chicken, although Fgf/Erk signaling 
      is known to act as a negative regulator, positive regulators remained unknown.
      Here, to identify positive regulator(s) of chicken pluripotency, we selected
      Jak1/Stat3 signaling as a candidate based on transcriptome analyses. Jak1/Stat3
      signaling was activated specifically at stages before gastrulation: Stat3 protein
      was localized in nuclei at blastodermal stages, but translocated to cytoplasm
      after gastrulation. We conducted pharmacological and gene transfection analyses
      in the blastoderm-derived colony formation assay, in which Nanog-positive dense
      colonies represent a hallmark of the undifferentiated state, and found that
      Jak1/Stat3 signaling supports pluripotency in chicken early embryos. Jak1
      inhibition abolished the formation of dense colonies, but the colony formation
      was restored when Stat3ER was artificially activated. We propose that the
      molecular mechanisms regulating pluripotency are conserved at the signaling
      network level between mouse and chicken, and possibly among a wider range of
      species.

TI  - Distinct regulation of atonal in a visual organ of Drosophila: Organ-specific
      enhancer and lack of autoregulation in the larval eye.
PG  - 67-76

AB  - Drosophila has three types of visual organs, the larval eyes or Bolwig's organs
      (BO), the ocelli (OC) and the compound eyes (CE). In all, the bHLH protein Atonal
      (Ato) functions as the proneural factor for photoreceptors and effects the
      transition from progenitor cells to differentiating neurons. In this work, we
      investigate the regulation of ato expression in the BO primordium (BOP).
      Surprisingly, we find that ato transcription in the BOP is entirely independent
      of the shared regulatory DNA for the developing CE and OC. The core enhancer for 
      BOP expression, ato(BO), lies ~6kb upstream of the ato gene, in contrast to the
      downstream location of CE and OC regulatory elements. Moreover, maintenance of
      ato expression in the neuronal precursors through autoregulation-a common and
      ancient feature of ato expression that is well-documented in eyes, ocelli and
      chordotonal organs-does not occur in the BO. We also show that the ato(BO)
      enhancer contains two binding sites for the transcription factor Sine oculis
      (So), a core component of the progenitor specification network in all three
      visual organs. These binding sites function in vivo and are specifically bound by
      So in vitro. Taken together, our findings reveal that the control of ato
      transcription in the evolutionarily derived BO has diverged considerably from ato
      regulation in the more ancestral compound eyes and ocelli, to the extent of
      acquiring what appears to be a distinct and evolutionarily novel cis-regulatory
      module.

AB  - The proper regulation of the localization, translation, and stability of
      maternally deposited transcripts is essential for embryonic development in many
      organisms. These different forms of regulation are mediated by the various
      protein subunits of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that assemble on
      maternal mRNAs. However, while many of the subunits that regulate the
      localization and translation of maternal transcripts have been identified,
      relatively little is known about how maternal mRNAs are stockpiled and stored in 
      a stable form to support early development. One of the best characterized
      regulators of maternal transcripts is Cup - a broadly conserved component of the 
      maternal RNP complex that in Drosophila acts as a translational repressor of the 
      localized message oskar. In this study, we have found that loss of cup disrupts
      the localization of both the oskar mRNA and its associated proteins to the
      posterior pole of the developing oocyte. This defect is not due to a failure to
      specify the oocyte or to disruption of RNP transport. Rather, the localization
      defects are due to a drop in oskar mRNA levels in cup mutant egg chambers. Thus, 
      in addition to its role in regulating oskar mRNA translation, Cup also plays a
      critical role in controlling the stability of the oskar transcript. This suggests
      that Cup is ideally positioned to coordinate the translational control function
      of the maternal RNP complex with its role in storing maternal transcripts in a
      stable form.

AB  - Approaches based on genetic modification have been invaluable for investigating a
      wide array of biological processes, with gain- and loss-of-function approaches
      frequently used to investigate gene function. However, the presence of
      paralogues, and hence possible genetic compensation, for many genes necessitates 
      the knockout (KO) of all paralogous genes in order to observe clear phenotypic
      change. CRISPR technology, the most recently described tool for gene editing, can
      generate KOs with unprecedented ease and speed and has been used in adult stem
      cell-derived organoids for single gene knockout, gene knock-in and gene
      correction. However, the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes in organoids by
      CRISPR technology has not previously been described. Here we describe a rapid,
      scalable and cost effective method for generating double knockouts in organoids. 
      By concatemerizing multiple gRNA expression cassettes, we generated a 'gRNA
      concatemer vector'. Our method allows the rapid assembly of annealed synthetic
      DNA oligos into the final vector in a single step. This approach facilitates
      simultaneous delivery of multiple gRNAs to allow up to 4 gene KO in one step, or 
      potentially to increase the efficiency of gene knockout by providing multiple
      gRNAs targeting one gene. As a proof of concept, we knocked out negative
      regulators of the Wnt pathway in small intestinal organoids, thereby removing
      their growth dependence on the exogenous Wnt enhancer, R-spondin1.

AB  - The remarkable regenerative capacity of the lung suggests that stem cells could
      be of therapeutic importance in diverse lung diseases; however, the successful
      exploitation of lung stem cell biology has long been hampered by our inability to
      maintain and expand adult lung stem cells while retaining their multi-lineage
      potential in vitro. Recently, advances in our understanding of stem cell niches
      and the role of key signalling modulators in controlling stem cell maintenance
      and differentiation have fuelled the development of new in vitro
      three-dimensional (3D) culture technologies that sustain the stem cell-driven
      formation of near-physiological, self-organizing structures called organoids.
      Here we review basic approaches to organoid model systems and highlight recent
      achievements in the generation of organoids from adult stem and progenitor cells 
      of both the murine and human lungs. We evaluate current applications in studying 
      cellular changes in proliferation, differentiation, plasticity, and cell
      polarity, and cellular and molecular crosstalk of epithelial cells with stroma.
      Advantages and limitations of organoids for clinical use are also discussed.

AB  - Advances in stem cell research have allowed the development of 3-dimensional (3D)
      primary cell cultures termed organoid cultures, as they closely mimic the in vivo
      organization of different cell lineages. Bridging the gap between 2-dimensional
      (2D) monotypic cancer cell lines and whole organisms, organoids are now widely
      applied to model development and disease. Organoids hold immense promise for
      addressing novel questions in host-microbe interactions, infectious diseases and 
      the resulting inflammatory conditions. Researchers have started to use organoids 
      for modeling infection with pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori or Salmonella 
      enteritica, gut-microbiota interactions and inflammatory bowel disease. Future
      studies will broaden the spectrum of microbes used and continue to establish
      organoids as a standard model for human host-microbial interactions. Moreover,
      they will increasingly exploit the unique advantages of organoids, for example to
      address patient-specific responses to microbes.

AB  - Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can provide us
      any required tissue/cell types by recapitulating the development in vitro. The
      kidney is one of the most challenging organs to generate from hPSCs as the kidney
      progenitors are composed of at least 4 different cell types, including nephron,
      collecting duct, endothelial and interstitium progenitors, that are
      developmentally distinguished populations. Although the actual developmental
      process of the kidney during human embryogenesis has not been clarified yet,
      studies using model animals accumulated knowledge about the origins of kidney
      progenitors. The implications of these findings for the directed differentiation 
      of hPSCs into the kidney include the mechanism of the intermediate mesoderm
      specification and its patterning along with anteroposterior axis. Using this
      knowledge, we previously reported successful generation of hPSCs-derived kidney
      organoids that contained all renal components and modelled human kidney
      development in vitro. In this review, we explain the developmental basis of the
      strategy behind this differentiation protocol and compare strategies of studies
      that also recently reported the induction of kidney cells from hPSCs. We also
      discuss the characterization of such kidney organoids and limitations and future 
      applications of this technology.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is characterized by a self-renewing epithelium fueled 
      by adult stem cells residing at the bottom of the intestinal crypt and gastric
      glands. Their activity and proliferation is strongly dependent on complex
      signaling pathways involving other crypt/gland cells as well as surrounding
      stromal cells. In recent years organoids are becoming increasingly popular as a
      new and powerful tool to study developmental or other biological processes.
      Organoids retain morphological and molecular patterns of the tissue they are
      derived from, are self-organizing, relatively simple to handle and accessible to 
      genetic engineering. This review focuses on the developmental processes and
      signaling molecules involved in epithelial homeostasis and how a profound
      knowledge of these mechanisms allowed the establishment of a three dimensional
      organoid culture derived from adult gastrointestinal stem cells.

AB  - The ability to model human brain development in vitro represents an important
      step in our study of developmental processes and neurological disorders.
      Protocols that utilize human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells can now
      generate organoids which faithfully recapitulate, on a cell-biological and gene
      expression level, the early period of human embryonic and fetal brain
      development. In combination with novel gene editing tools, such as CRISPR, these 
      methods represent an unprecedented model system in the field of mammalian neural 
      development. In this review, we focus on the similarities of current organoid
      methods to in vivo brain development, discuss their limitations and potential
      improvements, and explore the future venues of brain organoid research.

AB  - The self-organizing tissue-based approach coupled with induced pluripotent stem
      (iPS) cell technology is evolving as a promising field for designing organoids in
      culture and is expected to achieve valuable practical outcomes in regenerative
      medicine and drug development. Organoids show properties of functional organs and
      represent an alternative to cell models in conventional two-dimensional
      differentiation platforms; moreover, organoids can be used to investigate
      mechanisms of development and disease, drug discovery and toxicity assessment.
      Towards a more complex and advanced organoid model, it is essential to
      incorporate multiple cell lineages including developing vessels. Using a
      self-condensation method, we recently demonstrated self-organizing "organ buds"
      of diverse systems together with human mesenchymal and endothelial progenitors,
      proposing a new reverse engineering method to generate a more complex organoid
      structure. In this section, we review characters of organ bud technology based on
      two important principles: self-condensation and self-organization focusing on
      liver bud as an example, and discuss their practicality in regenerative medicine 
      and potential as research tools for developmental biology and drug discovery.

      proven challenging and this in turn has hampered studies of liver and pancreas
      stem cell biology, as well as being a roadblock to disease modelling and cell
      replacement therapies for pathologies in these organs. Recently, defined culture 
      conditions have been described which allow the in vitro culture and manipulation 
      of adult-derived liver and pancreatic material. Here we review these systems and 
      assess their physiological relevance, as well as their potential utility in
      biomedicine.

AB  - In vitro human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived tissues are excellent models 
      to study certain aspects of normal human development. Current research in the
      field of hPSC derived tissues reveals these models to be inherently fetal-like on
      both a morphological and gene expression level. In this review we briefly discuss
      current methods for differentiating lung and intestinal tissue from hPSCs into
      individual 3-dimensional units called organoids. We discuss how these methods
      mirror what is known about in vivo signaling pathways of the developing embryo.
      Additionally, we will review how the inherent immaturity of these models lends
      them to be particularly valuable in the study of immature human tissues in the
      clinical setting of premature birth. Human lung organoids (HLOs) and human
      intestinal organoids (HIOs) not only model normal development, but can also be
      utilized to study several important diseases of prematurity such as respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC).

AB  - The vertebrate pancreas is comprised of a highly branched tubular epithelium,
      which is intimately associated with an extensive and specialized vasculature.
      While we know a great deal about basic vascular anatomy of the adult pancreas, as
      well as islet capillaries, surprisingly little is known about the ontogeny of its
      blood vessels. Here, we analyze development of the pancreatic vasculature in the 
      mouse embryo. We show that pancreatic epithelial branches intercalate with the
      fine capillary plexus of the surrounding pancreatic mesenchyme. Endothelial cells
      (ECs) within this mesenchyme are heterogeneous from the onset of organogenesis.
      Pancreatic arteries take shape before veins, in a manner analogous to early
      embryonic vessels. The main central artery forms during mid-gestation, as a
      result of vessel coalescence and remodeling of a vascular plexus. In addition, we
      show that vessels in the forming pancreas display a predictable architecture that
      is dependent on VEGF signaling. Over-expression of VEGF disrupts vascular
      patterning and arteriovenous differentiation within the developing pancreas. This
      study constitutes a first-time in-depth cellular and molecular characterization
      of pancreatic blood vessels, as they coordinately grow along with the pancreatic 
      epithelium.

AB  - Neurogenesis in the post-embryonic vertebrate brain varies in extent and
      efficiency between species and brain territories. Distinct neurogenesis modes may
      account for this diversity, and several neural progenitor subtypes, radial glial 
      cells (RG) and neuroepithelial progenitors (NE), have been identified in the
      adult zebrafish brain. The neurogenic sequences issued from these progenitors,
      and their contribution to brain construction, remain incompletely understood.
      Here we use genetic tracing techniques based on conditional Cre recombination and
      Tet-On neuronal birthdating to unravel the neurogenic sequence operating from NE 
      progenitors in the zebrafish post-embryonic optic tectum. We reveal that a
      subpopulation of her5-positive NE cells of the posterior midbrain layer stands at
      the top of a neurogenic hierarchy involving, in order, the amplification pool of 
      the tectal proliferation zone (TPZ), followed by her4-positive RG cells with
      transient neurogenic activity. We further demonstrate that the adult
      her5-positive NE pool is issued in lineage from an identically located NE pool
      expressing the same gene in the embryonic neural tube. Finally, we show that
      these features are reminiscent of the neurogenic sequence and embryonic origin of
      the her9-positive progenitor NE pool involved in the construction of the lateral 
      pallium at post-embryonic stages. Together, our results highlight the shared
      recruitment of an identical neurogenic strategy by two remote brain territories, 
      where long-lasting NE pools serve both as a growth zone and as the life-long
      source of young neurogenic RG cells.

AB  - The Ciona intestinalis larva has two distinct photoreceptor organs, a
      conventional pigmented ocellus and a nonpigmented ocellus, that are
      asymmetrically situated in the brain. The ciliary photoreceptor cells of these
      ocelli resemble visual cells of the vertebrate retina. Precise elucidation of the
      lineage of the photoreceptor cells will be key to understanding the developmental
      mechanisms of these cells as well as the evolutionary relationships between the
      photoreceptor organs of ascidians and vertebrates. Photoreceptor cells of the
      pigmented ocellus have been thought to develop from anterior animal (a-lineage)
      blastomeres, whereas the developmental origin of the nonpigmented ocellus has not
      been determined. Here, we show that the photoreceptor cells of both ocelli
      develop from the right anterior vegetal hemisphere: those of the pigmented
      ocellus from the right A9.14 cell and those of the nonpigmented ocellus from the 
      right A9.16 cell. The pigmented ocellus is formed by a combination of two
      lineages of cells with distinct embryonic origins: the photoreceptor cells
      originate from a medial portion of the A-lineage neural plate, while the pigment 
      cell originates from the lateral edge of the a-lineage neural plate. In light of 
      the recently proposed close evolutionary relationship between the ocellus pigment
      cell of ascidians and the cephalic neural crest of vertebrates, the ascidian
      ocellus may represent a prototypic contribution of the neural crest to a cranial 
      sensory organ.

      Evidence for defects in neural crest cell migration.

AB  - Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome (WHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
      mental retardation, craniofacial malformation, and defects in skeletal and heart 
      development. The syndrome is associated with irregularities on the short arm of
      chromosome 4, including deletions of varying sizes and microduplications. Many of
      these genotypic aberrations in humans have been correlated with the classic WHS
      phenotype, and animal models have provided a context for mapping these genetic
      irregularities to specific phenotypes; however, there remains a significant
      knowledge gap concerning the cell biological mechanisms underlying these
      phenotypes. This review summarizes literature that has made recent contributions 
      to this topic, drawing from the vast body of knowledge detailing the genetic
      particularities of the disorder and the more limited pool of information on its
      cell biology. Finally, we propose a novel characterization for WHS as a
      pathophysiology owing in part to defects in neural crest cell motility and
      migration during development.

TI  - Transition between synaptic branch formation and synaptogenesis is regulated by
      the lin-4 microRNA.

AB  - Axonal branch formation and synaptogenesis are sequential events that are
      required for the establishment of neuronal connectivity. However, little is known
      about how the transition between these two events is regulated. Here, we report
      that the lin-4 microRNA can regulate the transition between branch formation and 
      synaptogenesis in the PLM axon of C. elegans. The PLM axon grows a collateral
      branch during the early L1 stage and undergoes synaptogenesis during the late L1 
      stage. Loss of the lin-4 microRNA disrupts synaptogenesis during the late L1
      stage, suggesting that lin-4 promotes synaptogenesis. Conversely, the target of
      lin-4, the LIN-14 transcription factor, promotes PLM branch formation and
      inhibits synaptogenesis during the early L1 stage. Moreover, we present genetic
      evidence suggesting that synaptic vesicle transport is required for PLM branch
      formation and that the role of LIN-14 is to promote transport of synaptic
      vesicles to the region of future branch growth. These observations provide a
      novel mechanism whereby lin-4 promotes the transition from branch formation to
      synaptogenesis by repressing the branch-promoting and synaptogenesis-inhibiting
      activities of LIN-14.

      Drosophila melanogaster.

AB  - Dynamitin (Dmn) is a major component of dynactin, a multiprotein complex playing 
      important roles in a variety of intracellular motile events. We previously found 
      that Wolbachia bacterial infection resulted in a reduction of Dmn protein. As
      Wolbachia may modify sperm in male hosts, we speculate that Dmn may have a
      function in male fertility. Here we used nosGal4 to drive Dmn knock down in
      testes of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the functions of Dmn in
      spermatogenesis. We found that knockdown of Dmn in testes dramatically decreased 
      male fertility, overexpression of Dmn in Wolbachia-infected males significantly
      rescued male fertility, indicating an important role of Dmn in inducing male
      fertility defects following Wolbachia infection. Some scattered immature sperm
      with late canoe-shaped head distributed in the end of Dmn knockdown testis and
      only about half mature sperm were observed in the Dmn knockdown testis relative
      to those in the control. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibited fused
      spermatids in cysts and abnormal mitochondrial derivatives. Immunofluorescence
      staining showed significantly less abundance of tubulin around the nucleus of
      spermatid and scattered F-actin cones to different extents in the
      individualization complex (IC) during spermiogenesis in Dmn knockdown testes,
      which may disrupt the nuclear condensation and sperm individualization. Since
      dynein-dynactin complex has been shown to mediate transport of many cellular
      components, including mRNAs and organelles, these results suggest that Dmn may
      play an important role in Drosophila spermiogenesis by affecting transport of
      many important cytoplasmic materials.

AB  - The differentiated cell identities and structure of fully formed organs are
      generally stable after their development. In contrast, we report here that
      development of the C. elegans proximal somatic gonad (hermaphrodite uterus and
      spermathecae, and male vas deferens) can be redirected into intestine-like organs
      by brief expression of the ELT-7 GATA transcription factor. This process converts
      one developing organ into another and can hence be considered
      "transorganogenesis." We show that, following pulsed ELT-7 expression, cells of
      the uterus activate and maintain intestine-specific gene expression and are
      transformed at the ultrastructural level to form an epithelial tube resembling
      the normal intestine formed during embryogenesis. Ubiquitous ELT-7 expression
      activates intestinal markers in many different cell types but only cells in the
      somatic gonad and pharynx appear to become fully reprogrammed. We found that
      ectopic expression of other endoderm-promoting transcription factors, but not
      muscle- or ectoderm- promoting transcription factors, redirects the fate of these
      organs, suggesting that pharyngeal and somatic gonad cells are specifically
      competent to adopt intestine identity. Although the intestine, pharynx, and
      somatic gonad are derived from distant cell lineages, they all express the
      PHA-4/FoxA transcription factor. While we found that post-embryonic PHA-4 is not 
      necessary for pharynx or uterus reprogramming and PHA-4 is not sufficient in
      combination with ELT-7 to induce reprogramming in other cells types, knock down
      of PHA-4 during embryogenesis, which abolishes normal pharynx differentiation,
      prevents pharyngeal precursors from being reprogrammed into intestine. These
      results suggest that differentiated cell identity determines susceptibility to
      transdifferentiation and highlight the importance of cellular context in
      controlling competency for reprogramming.

AB  - How organ growth is regulated in multicellular organisms is a long-standing
      question in developmental biology. It is known that coordination of cell
      apoptosis and proliferation is critical in cell number and overall organ size
      control, while how these processes are regulated is still under investigation. In
      this study, we found that functional loss of a gene in Drosophila, named
      Drosophila defender against apoptotic cell death 1 (dDad1), leads to a reduction 
      of tissue growth due to increased apoptosis and lack of cell proliferation. The
      dDad1 protein, an orthologue of mammalian Dad1, was found to be crucial for
      protein N-glycosylation in developing tissues. Our study demonstrated that loss
      of dDad1 function activates JNK signaling and blocking the JNK pathway in dDad1
      knock-down tissues suppresses cell apoptosis and partially restores organ size.
      In addition, reduction of dDad1 triggers ER stress and activates unfolded protein
      response (UPR) signaling, prior to the activation of JNK signaling. Furthermore, 
      Perk-Atf4 signaling, one branch of UPR pathways, appears to play a dual role in
      inducing cell apoptosis and mediating compensatory cell proliferation in this
      dDad1 knock-down model.

AB  - The visceral musculature of the Drosophila intestine plays important roles in
      digestion as well as development. Detailed studies investigating the embryonic
      development of the visceral muscle exist; comparatively little is known about
      postembryonic development and metamorphosis of this tissue. In this study we have
      combined the use of specific markers with electron microscopy to follow the
      formation of the adult visceral musculature and its involvement in gut
      development during metamorphosis. Unlike the adult somatic musculature, which is 
      derived from a pool of undifferentiated myoblasts, the visceral musculature of
      the adult is a direct descendant of the larval fibers, as shown by activating a
      lineage tracing construct in the larval muscle and obtaining labeled visceral
      fibers in the adult. However, visceral muscles undergo a phase of remodeling that
      coincides with the metamorphosis of the intestinal epithelium. During the first
      day following puparium formation, both circular and longitudinal syncytial fibers
      dedifferentiate, losing their myofibrils and extracellular matrix, and
      dissociating into mononuclear cells ("secondary myoblasts"). Towards the end of
      the second day, this process is reversed, and between 48 and 72h after puparium
      formation, a structurally fully differentiated adult muscle layer has formed. We 
      could not obtain evidence that cells apart from the dedifferentiated larval
      visceral muscle contributed to the adult muscle, nor does it appear that the
      number of adult fibers (or nuclei per fiber) is increased over that of the larva 
      by proliferation. In contrast to the musculature, the intestinal epithelium is
      completely renewed during metamorphosis. The adult midgut epithelium rapidly
      expands over the larval layer during the first few hours after puparium
      formation; in case of the hindgut, replacement takes longer, and proceeds by the 
      gradual caudad extension of a proliferating growth zone, the hindgut
      proliferation zone (HPZ). The subsequent elongation of the hindgut and midgut, as
      well as the establishment of a population of intestinal stem cells active in the 
      adult midgut and hindgut, requires the presence of the visceral muscle layer,
      based on the finding that ablation of this layer causes a severe disruption of
      both processes.

AB  - Multiple aspects of organismal physiology influence the number and activity of
      stem cells and their progeny, including nutritional status. Previous studies
      demonstrated that Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs), follicle stem cells
      (FSCs), and their progeny sense and respond to diet via complex mechanisms
      involving many systemic and local signals. AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK,
      is a highly conserved regulator of energy homeostasis known to be activated under
      low cellular energy conditions; however, its role in the ovarian response to diet
      has not been investigated. Here, we describe nutrient-dependent and -independent 
      requirements for AMPK in Drosophila oogenesis. We found that AMPK is cell
      autonomously required for the slow down in GSC and follicle cell proliferation
      that occurs on a poor diet. Similarly, AMPK activity is necessary in the germline
      for the degeneration of vitellogenic stages in response to nutrient deprivation. 
      In contrast, AMPK activity is not required within the germline to modulate its
      growth. Instead, AMPK acts in follicle cells to negatively regulate their growth 
      and proliferation, thereby indirectly limiting the size of the underlying
      germline cyst within developing follicles. Paradoxically, AMPK is required for
      GSC maintenance in well-fed flies (when AMPK activity is presumably at its
      lowest), suggesting potentially important roles for basal AMPK activity in
      specific cell types. Finally, we identified a nutrient-independent, developmental
      role for AMPK in cyst encapsulation by follicle cells. These results uncover
      specific AMPK requirements in multiple cell types in the ovary and suggest that
      AMPK can function outside of its canonical nutrient-sensing role in specific
      developmental contexts.

AB  - During development of the inner ear, secreted morphogens act coordinately to
      establish otocyst dorsoventral polarity. Among these, Sonic hedgehog (SHH) plays 
      a critical role in determining ventral polarity. However, how this extracellular 
      signal is transduced intracellularly to establish ventral polarity is unknown. In
      this study, we show that cAMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a key
      intracellular factor mediating SHH signaling through regulation of GLI3
      processing. Gain-of-function experiments using targeted gene transfection by
      sonoporation or electroporation revealed that SHH signaling inactivates PKA,
      maintaining a basal level of PKA activity in the ventral otocyst. This, in turn, 
      suppresses partial proteolytic processing of GLI3FL, resulting in a low
      GLI3R/GLI3FL ratio in the ventral otocyst and the expression of ventral-specific 
      genes required for ventral otocyst morphogenesis. Thus, we identify a molecular
      mechanism that links extracellular and intracellular signaling, determines early 
      ventral polarity of the inner ear, and has implications for understanding the
      integration of polarity signals in multiple organ rudiments regulated by
      gradients of signaling molecules.

AB  - Mutations in MSX1 cause craniofacial developmental defects, including tooth
      agenesis, in humans and mice. Previous studies suggest that Msx1 activates Bmp4
      expression in the developing tooth mesenchyme to drive early tooth organogenesis.
      Whereas Msx1(-/-) mice exhibit developmental arrest of all tooth germs at the bud
      stage, mice with neural crest-specific inactivation of Bmp4 (Bmp4(ncko)(/ncko)), 
      which lack Bmp4 expression in the developing tooth mesenchyme, showed
      developmental arrest of only mandibular molars. We recently demonstrated that
      deletion of Osr2, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor expressed in a
      lingual-to-buccal gradient in the developing tooth bud mesenchyme, rescued molar 
      tooth morphogenesis in both Msx1(-/-) and Bmp4(ncko/ncko) mice. In this study,
      through RNA-seq analyses of the developing tooth mesenchyme in mutant and
      wildtype embryos, we found that Msx1 and Osr2 have opposite effects on expression
      of several secreted Wnt antagonists in the tooth bud mesenchyme. Remarkably, both
      Dkk2 and Sfrp2 exhibit Osr2-dependent preferential expression on the lingual side
      of the tooth bud mesenchyme and expression of both genes was up-regulated and
      expanded into the tooth bud mesenchyme in Msx1(-/-) and Bmp4(ncko/ncko) mutant
      embryos. We show that pharmacological activation of canonical Wnt signaling by
      either lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment or by inhibition of DKKs in utero was
      sufficient to rescue mandibular molar tooth morphogenesis in Bmp4(ncko/ncko)
      mice. Furthermore, whereas inhibition of DKKs or inactivation of Sfrp2 alone was 
      insufficient to rescue tooth morphogenesis in Msx1(-/-) mice, pharmacological
      inhibition of DKKs in combination with genetic inactivation of Sfrp2 and Sfrp3
      rescued maxillary molar morphogenesis in Msx1(-/-) mice. Together, these data
      reveal a novel mechanism that the Bmp4-Msx1 pathway and Osr2 control tooth
      organogenesis through antagonistic regulation of expression of secreted Wnt
      antagonists.

AB  - During the development of the vertebrate feeding apparatus, a variety of
      complicated cellular and molecular processes participate in the formation and
      integration of individual skeletal elements. The molecular mechanisms regulating 
      the formation of skeletal primordia and their development into specific
      morphological structures are tightly controlled by a set of interconnected
      signalling pathways. Some of these pathways, such as Bmp, Hedgehog, Notch and
      Wnt, are long known for their pivotal roles in craniofacial skeletogenesis.
      Studies addressing the functional details of their components and downstream
      targets, the mechanisms of their interactions with other signals as well as their
      potential roles in adaptive morphological divergence, are currently attracting
      considerable attention. An increasing number of signalling pathways that had
      previously been described in different biological contexts have been shown to be 
      important in the regulation of jaw skeletal development and morphogenesis. In
      this review, I provide an overview of signalling pathways involved in trophic
      skeletogenesis emphasizing studies of the most species-rich group of vertebrates,
      the teleost fish, which through their evolutionary history have undergone
      repeated episodes of spectacular trophic diversification.

AB  - Growth and maturation of the cerebrovasculature is a vital event in neocortical
      development however mechanisms that control cerebrovascular development remain
      poorly understood. Mutations in or deletions that include the FOXC1 gene are
      associated with congenital cerebrovascular anomalies and increased stroke risk in
      patients. Foxc1 mutant mice display severe cerebrovascular hemorrhage at late
      gestational ages. While these data demonstrate Foxc1 is required for
      cerebrovascular development, its broad expression in the brain vasculature
      combined with Foxc1 mutant's complex developmental defects have made it difficult
      to pinpoint its function(s). Using global and conditional Foxc1 mutants, we find 
      1) significant cerebrovascular growth defects precede cerebral hemorrhage and 2) 
      expression of Foxc1 in neural crest-derived meninges and brain pericytes, though 
      not endothelial cells, is required for normal cerebrovascular development. We
      provide evidence that reduced levels of meninges-derived retinoic acid (RA),
      caused by defects in meninges formation in Foxc1 mutants, is a major contributing
      factor to the cerebrovascular growth defects in Foxc1 mutants. We provide data
      that suggests that meninges-derived RA ensures adequate growth of the neocortical
      vasculature via regulating expression of WNT pathway proteins and neural
      progenitor derived-VEGF-A. Our findings offer the first evidence for a role of
      the meninges in brain vascular development and provide new insight into potential
      causes of cerebrovascular defects in patients with FOXC1 mutations.

AB  - Temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) is the process by which the
      environmental temperature experienced during embryogenesis influences the sex of 
      an organism, as in the red-eared slider turtle Trachemys scripta elegans. In
      accord with current paradigms of vertebrate sex determination, temperature is
      believed to exert its effects on sexual development in T. scripta entirely within
      the middle third of development, when the gonad is forming. However, whether
      temperature regulates the transcriptome in T. scripta early embryos in a manner
      that could influence secondary sex characteristics or establish a pro-male or
      pro-female environment has not been investigated. In addition, apart from a
      handful of candidate genes, very little is known about potential similarities
      between the expression cascade during TSD and the genetic cascade that drives
      mammalian sex determination. Here, we conducted an unbiased transcriptome-wide
      analysis of the effects of male- and female-promoting temperatures on the turtle 
      embryo prior to gonad formation, and on the gonad during the temperature
      sensitive period. We found sexually dimorphic expression reflecting differences
      in steroidogenic enzymes and brain development prior to gonad formation. Within
      the gonad, we mapped a cascade of differential expression similar to the genetic 
      cascade established in mammals. Using a Hidden Markov Model based clustering
      approach, we identified groups of genes that show heterochronic shifts between M.
      musculus and T. scripta. We propose a model in which multiple factors influenced 
      by temperature accumulate during early gonadogenesis, and converge on the
      antagonistic regulation of aromatase to canalize sex determination near the end
      of the temperature sensitive window of development.

AB  - In this work, we report the use of iodine-contrast microCT to perform
      high-throughput 3D morphological analysis of mouse embryos and neonates between
      embryonic day 8.5 to postnatal day 3, with high spatial resolution up to
      3microm/voxel. We show that mouse embryos at early stages can be imaged either
      within extra embryonic tissues such as the yolk sac or the decidua without
      physically disturbing the embryos. This method enables a full, undisturbed
      analysis of embryo turning, allantois development, vitelline vessels remodeling, 
      yolk sac and early placenta development, which provides increased insights into
      early embryonic lethality in mutant lines. Moreover, these methods are
      inexpensive, simple to learn and do not require substantial processing time,
      making them ideal for high throughput analysis of mouse mutants with embryonic
      and early postnatal lethality.

AB  - Collective cell migration is an essential process during embryonic development
      and diseases such as cancer, and still much remains to be learned about how cell 
      intrinsic and environmental cues are coordinated to guide cells to their targets.
      The migration-dependent development of the zebrafish sensory lateral line proves 
      to be an excellent model to study how proteoglycans control collective cell
      migration in a vertebrate. Proteoglycans are extracellular matrix glycoproteins
      essential for the control of several signaling pathways including
      Wnt/beta-catenin, Fgf, BMP and Hh. In the lateral line primordium the modified
      sugar chains on proteoglycans are important regulators of cell polarity, ligand
      distribution and Fgf signaling. At least five proteoglycans show distinct
      expression patterns in the primordium; however, their individual functions have
      not been studied. Here, we describe the function of glypican4 during zebrafish
      lateral line development. glypican4 is expressed in neuromasts, interneuromast
      cells and muscle cells underlying the lateral line. knypek(fr6)/glypican4 mutants
      show severe primordium migration defects and the primordium often U-turns and
      migrates back toward the head. Our analysis shows that Glypican4 regulates the
      feedback loop between Wnt/beta-catenin/Fgf signaling in the primordium
      redundantly with other Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans. In addition, the primordium
      migration defect is caused non-cell autonomously by the loss of
      cxcl12a-expressing muscle precursors along the myoseptum via downregulation of
      Hh. Our results show that glypican4 has distinct functions in primordium cells
      and cells in the environment and that both of these functions are essential for
      collective cell migration.

AB  - The neural crest (NC) is a remarkable transient structure generated during early 
      vertebrate development. The neural crest progenitors have extensive migratory
      capacity and multipotency, harboring stem cell-like characteristics such as
      self-renewal. They can differentiate into a variety of cell types from
      craniofacial skeletal tissues to the trunk peripheral nervous system (PNS).
      Multiple regulators such as signaling factors, transcription factors, and
      migration machinery components are expressed at different stages of NC
      development. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in various vertebrate species
      revealed epistatic relationships of these molecules that could be assembled into 
      a gene regulatory network defining the processes of NC induction, specification, 
      migration, and differentiation. These basic developmental studies led to the
      subsequent establishment and molecular validation of neural crest stem cells
      (NCSCs) derived by various strategies. We provide here an overview of the
      isolation and characterization of NCSCs from embryonic, fetal, and adult tissues;
      the experimental strategies for the derivation of NCSCs from embryonic stem
      cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and skin fibroblasts; and recent
      developments in the use of patient-derived NCSCs for modeling and treating
      neurocristopathies. We discuss future research on further refinement of the
      culture conditions required for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells
      into axial-specific NC progenitors and their derivatives, developing non-viral
      approaches for the generation of induced NC cells (NCCs), and using a genomic
      editing approach to correct genetic mutations in patient-derived NCSCs for
      transplantation therapy. These future endeavors should facilitate the therapeutic
      applications of NCSCs in the clinical setting.

AB  - Gene regulatory networks orchestrate the assembly of functionally related cells
      within a cellular network. Subtle differences often exist among functionally
      related cells within such networks. How differences are created among cells with 
      similar functions has been difficult to determine due to the complexity of both
      the gene and the cellular networks. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the DD and VD
      motor neurons compose a cross-inhibitory, GABAergic network that coordinates
      dorsal and ventral muscle contractions during locomotion. The Pitx2 homologue,
      UNC-30, acts as a terminal selector gene to create similarities and the Coup-TFII
      homologue, UNC-55, is necessary for creating differences between the two motor
      neuron classes. What is the organizing gene regulatory network responsible for
      initiating the expression of UNC-55 and thus creating differences between the DD 
      and VD motor neurons? We show that the unc-55 promoter has modules that contain
      Meis/UNC-62 binding sites. These sites can be subdivided into regions that are
      capable of activating or repressing UNC-55 expression in different motor neurons.
      Interestingly, different isoforms of UNC-62 are responsible for the activation
      and the stabilization of unc-55 transcription. Furthermore, specific isoforms of 
      UNC-62 are required for proper synaptic patterning of the VD motor neurons.
      Isoform specific regulation of differentiating neurons is a relatively unexplored
      area of research and presents a mechanism for creating differences among
      functionally related cells within a network.

AB  - Septins are guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins that are evolutionally
      conserved in all eukaryotes other than plants. They function as multimeric
      complexes that interact with membrane lipids, actomyosin, and microtubules. Based
      on these interactions, septins play essential roles in the morphogenesis and
      physiological functions of many mammalian cell types including the regulation of 
      microtubule stability, vesicle trafficking, cortical rigidity, planar cell
      polarity, and apoptosis. The inner ear, which perceives auditory and equilibrium 
      sensation with highly differentiated hair cells, has a complicated gross
      morphology. Furthermore, its development including morphogenesis is dependent on 
      various molecular mechanisms, such as apoptosis, convergent extension, and cell
      fate determination. To determine the roles of septins in the development of the
      inner ear, we specifically deleted Septin7 (Sept7), the non-redundant subunit in 
      the canonical septin complex, in the inner ear at different times during
      development. Foxg1Cre-mediated deletion of Sept7, which achieved the complete
      knockout of Sept7 within the inner ear at E9.5, caused cystic malformation of
      inner ears and a reduced numbers of sensory epithelial cells despite the
      existence of mature hair cells. Excessive apoptosis was observed at E10.5,E11.5
      and E12.5 in all inner ear epithelial cells and at E10.5 and E11.5 in prosensory 
      epithelial cells of the inner ears of Foxg1Cre;Septin7(floxed/floxed) mice. In
      contrast with apoptosis, cell proliferation in the inner ear did not
      significantly change between control and mutant mice. Deletion of Sept7 within
      the cochlea at a later stage (around E15.5) with Emx2Cre did not result in any
      apparent morphological anomalies observed in Foxg1Cre;Septin7(floxed/floxed)
      mice. These results suggest that SEPT7 regulates gross morphogenesis of the inner
      ear and maintains the size of the inner ear sensory epithelial area and exerts
      its effects at an early developmental stage of the inner ear.

AB  - MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit protein expression
      post-transcriptionally. They have been implicated in many different physiological
      processes, but little is known about their individual involvement in learning and
      memory. We recently identified several miRNAs that either increased or decreased 
      intermediate-term memory when inhibited in the central nervous system, including 
      miR-iab8-3p. We report here a new developmental role for this miRNA. Blocking the
      expression of miR-iab8-3p during the development of the organism leads to
      hypertrophy of individual mushroom body neuron soma, a reduction in the field
      size occupied by axonal projections, and adult intellectual disability. We
      further identified four potential mRNA targets of miR-iab8-3p whose inhibition
      modulates intermediate-term memory including ceramide phosphoethanolamine
      synthase, which may account for the behavioral effects produced by miR-iab8-3p
      inhibition. Our results offer important new information on a microRNA required
      for normal neurodevelopment and the capacity to learn and remember normally.

TI  - The hyaloid vasculature facilitates basement membrane breakdown during choroid
      fissure closure in the zebrafish eye.
PG  - 262-272
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.09.008 [doi]
AB  - A critical aspect of vertebrate eye development is closure of the choroid fissure
      (CF). Defects in CF closure result in colobomas, which are a significant cause of
      childhood blindness worldwide. Despite the growing number of mutated loci
      associated with colobomas, we have a limited understanding of the cell biological
      underpinnings of CF closure. Here, we utilize the zebrafish embryo to identify
      key phases of CF closure and regulators of the process. Utilizing Laminin-111 as 
      a marker for the basement membrane (BM) lining the CF, we determine the spatial
      and temporal patterns of BM breakdown in the CF, a prerequisite for CF closure.
      Similarly, utilizing a combination of in vivo time-lapse imaging, beta-catenin
      immunohistochemistry and F-actin staining, we determine that tissue fusion, which
      serves to close the fissure, follows BM breakdown closely. Periocular mesenchyme 
      (POM)-derived endothelial cells, which migrate through the CF to give rise to the
      hyaloid vasculature, possess distinct actin foci that correlate with regions of
      BM breakdown. Disruption of talin1, which encodes a regulator of the actin
      cytoskeleton, results in colobomas and these correlate with structural defects in
      the hyaloid vasculature and defects in BM breakdown. cloche mutants, which

AB  - Collective cell migration is the coordinated movement of cells, which organize
      tissues during morphogenesis, repair and some cancers. The motile cell membrane
      of the advancing front in collective cell migration is termed the Leading Edge.
      The embryonic development of the vertebrate and Drosophila hearts are both
      characterized by the coordinated medial migration of a bilateral cluster of
      mesodermal cells. In Drosophila, the cardioblasts form cohesive bilateral rows
      that migrate collectively as a unit towards the dorsal midline to form the dorsal
      vessel. We have characterized the collective cell migration of cardioblasts as an
      in vivo quantitative model to study the behaviour of the Leading Edge. We
      investigated whether guidance signalling through Slit and Netrin pathways plays a
      role in cell migration during heart development. Through time-lapse imaging and
      quantitative assessment of migratory behaviour of the cardioblasts in
      loss-of-function mutants, we demonstrate that both Slit and Netrin mediated
      signals are autonomously and concomitantly required to maximize migration
      velocity, filopodial and lamellipodial activities. Additionally, we show that
      another Slit and Netrin receptor, Dscam1, the role of which during heart
      development was previously unknown, is required for both normal migration of
      cardioblasts and luminal expansion. Leading edge behaviour analysis revealed a
      dosage dependent genetic interaction between Slit and Netrin receptors suggesting
      that downstream signalling through these receptors converge on a common output
      that increases leading edge activity of the cardioblasts. Finally, we found that 
      guidance signalling maintains the balance between epithelial and mesenchymal
      characteristics of the migrating cardioblasts.

AB  - Determining how organs attain precise positioning within an organism is a crucial
      facet of developmental biology. The Fox family winged-helix transcription factors
      are known to play key roles in development of multiple organs. Drosophila FoxL1
      (aka Fd64A) is dynamically expressed in embryos but its function is completely
      uncharacterized. FoxL1 is expressed in a single group of body wall - muscles in
      the 2nd and 3rd thoracic segments, in homologous abdominal muscles at earlier
      stages, and in the hindgut mesoderm from early through late embryogenesis. We
      show that FoxL1 expression in T2 and T3 is in VIS5, which is not a single muscle 
      spanning the entire thorax, as previously published, but is, instead, three
      individual muscles, each spanning a single thoracic segment. We generate
      mutations in foxL1 and show that, surprisingly, none of the tissues that express 
      FoxL1 are affected by its loss. Instead, loss of foxL1 results in defects in
      salivary gland positioning and morphology, as well as defects in the migration of
      hemocytes, germ cells and Malpighian tubules. We also show that FoxL1-dependent
      expression of secreted Sema2a in T3 VIS5 is required for normal salivary gland
      positioning. Altogether, these findings suggest that Drosophila FoxL1 functions
      like its mammalian counterpart in non-autonomously orchestrating the behaviors of
      surrounding tissues.

TI  - Yap is essential for retinal progenitor cell cycle progression and RPE cell fate 
      acquisition in the developing mouse eye.

AB  - Yap functions as a transcriptional regulator by acting together with
      sequence-specific DNA binding factors and transcription cofactors to mediate cell
      proliferation in developing epithelial tissues and tumors. An upstream kinase
      cascade controls nuclear localization and function in response to partially
      identified exogenous signals, including cell-to-cell contact. Nevertheless, its
      role in CNS development is poorly understood. In order to investigate Yap
      function in developing CNS, we characterized the cellular outcomes after
      selective Yap gene ablation in developing ocular tissues. When Yap was lost,
      presumptive retinal pigment epithelium acquired anatomical and molecular
      characteristics resembling those of the retinal epithelium rather than of RPE,
      including loss of pigmentation, pseudostratified epithelial morphology and
      ectopic induction of markers for retinal progenitor cells, like Chx10, and
      neurons, like beta-Tubulin III. In addition, developing retina showed signs of
      progressive degeneration, including laminar folding, thinning and cell loss,
      which resulted from multiple defects in cell proliferation and survival, and in
      junction integrity. Furthermore, Yap-deficient retinal progenitors displayed
      decreased S-phase cells and altered cell cycle progression. Altogether, our
      studies not only illustrate the canonical function of Yap in promoting the
      proliferation of progenitors, but also shed new light on its evolutionarily
      conserved, instructive role in regional specification, maintenance of junctional 
      integrity and precise regulation of cell proliferation during neuroepithelial
      development.

      assessment of planar cell polarity signaling.

AB  - The dorsal surface of the mouse tongue is covered by ~7000 papillae, asymmetric
      epithelial protrusions that are precisely oriented to create a stereotyped
      macroscopic pattern. Within the context of this large-scale pattern, neighboring 
      papillae exhibit a high degree of local order that minimizes the differences in
      their orientations. We show here that the orientations of lingual papillae are
      under the control of the core planar cell polarity (PCP) genes Vangl1, Vangl2,
      and Celsr1. Using K14-Cre and Nkx2.5-Cre to induce conditional knockout of Vangl1
      and/or Vangl2 in the tongue epithelium, we observe more severe disruptions to
      local order among papillae with inactivation of larger numbers of Vangl genes, a 
      greater role for Vangl2 than Vangl1, and a more severe phenotype with the Vangl2 
      Looptail (Lp) allele than the Vangl2 null allele, consistent with a dominant
      negative mode of action of the Vangl2(Lp) allele. Interestingly, Celsr1(-/-)
      tongues show disruption of both local and global order, with many papillae in the
      anterior tongue showing a reversed orientation. To quantify each of these
      phenotypes, we have developed and applied three procedures for sampling the
      orientations of papillae and assessing the degree of order on different spatial
      scales. The experiments reported here establish the dorsal surface of the mouse
      tongue as a favorable system for studying PCP control of epithelial patterning.

AB  - Fidelity of histone gene expression is important for normal cell growth and
      differentiation that is stringently controlled during development but is
      compromised during tumorigenesis. Efficient production of histones for packaging 
      newly replicated DNA is particularly important for proper cell division and
      epigenetic control during the initial pre-implantation stages of embryonic
      development. Here, we addressed the unresolved question of when the machinery for
      histone gene transcription is activated in the developing zygote to accommodate
      temporal demands for histone gene expression. We examined induction of Histone
      Nuclear Factor P (HINFP), the only known transcription factor required for
      histone H4 gene expression, that binds directly to a unique H4 promoter-specific 
      element to regulate histone H4 transcription. We show that Hinfp gene transcripts
      are stored in oocytes and maternally transmitted to the zygote. Transcripts from 
      the paternal Hinfp gene, which reflect induction of zygotic gene expression, are 
      apparent at the 4- to 8-cell stage, when most maternal mRNA pools are depleted.
      Loss of Hinfp expression due to gene ablation reduces cell numbers in E3.5 stage 
      embryos and compromises implantation. Reduced cell proliferation is attributable 
      to severe reduction in histone mRNA levels accompanied by reduced cell survival
      and genomic damage as measured by cleaved Caspase 3 and phospho-H2AX staining,
      respectively. We conclude that transmission of maternal Hinfp transcripts and
      zygotic activation of the Hinfp gene together are necessary to control H4 gene
      expression in early pre-implantation embryos in order to support normal embryonic
      development.

AB  - Hypertrophy, hyperplasia and altered mucus secretion from the respiratory
      submucosal glands (SMG) are characteristics of airway diseases such as cystic
      fibrosis, asthma and chronic bronchitis. More commonly, hyper-secretion of the
      nasal SMGs contributes to allergic rhinitis and upper airway infection.
      Considering the role of these glands in disease states, there is a significant
      dearth in understanding the molecular signals that regulate SMG development and
      patterning. Due to the imperative role of FGF signalling during the development
      of other branched structures, we investigated the role of Fgf10 during initiation
      and branching morphogenesis of murine nasal SMGs. Fgf10 is expressed in the
      mesenchyme around developing SMGs while expression of its receptor Fgfr2 is seen 
      within glandular epithelial cells. In the Fgf10 null embryo, Steno's gland and
      the maxillary sinus gland were completely absent while other neighbouring nasal
      glands showed normal duct elongation but defective branching. Interestingly, the 
      medial nasal glands were present in Fgf10 homozygotes but missing in Fgfr2b
      mutants, with expression of Fgf7 specifically expressed around these developing
      glands, indicating that Fgf7 might compensate for loss of Fgf10 in this group of 
      glands. Intriguingly the lateral nasal glands were only mildly affected by loss
      of FGF signalling, while these glands were missing in Eda mutant mice, where the 
      Steno's and maxillary sinus gland developed as normal. This analysis reveals that
      regulation of nasal gland development is complex with different subsets of glands
      being regulated by different signalling pathways. This analysis helps shed light 
      on the nasal gland defects observed in patients with hypohidrotic ectodermal
      dysplasia (HED) (defect EDA pathway) and LADD syndrome (defect FGFR2b pathway).

      Drosophila midgut metamorphosis.

AB  - Mitophagy is the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy, which is an 
      important mitochondrial quality and quantity control process. During Drosophila
      metamorphosis, the degradation of midgut involves a large change in length and
      organization, which is mediated by autophagy. Here we noticed a cell-type
      specific mitochondrial clearance process that occurs in enterocytes (ECs), while 
      most mitochondria remain in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during metamorphosis.
      Although PINK1/PARKIN represent the canonical pathway for the elimination of
      impaired mitochondria in varied pathological conditions, their roles in
      developmental processes or normal physiological conditions have been less
      studied. To examine the potential contribution of PINK1 in developmental
      processes, we monitored the dynamic expression pattern of PINK1 in the midgut
      development by taking advantage of a newly CRISPR/Cas9 generated knock-in fly
      strain expressing PINK1-mCherry fusion protein that presumably recapitulates the 
      endogenous expression pattern of PINK1. We disclosed a spatiotemporal correlation
      between the expression pattern of PINK1 and the mitochondrial clearance or
      persistence in ECs or ISCs respectively. By mosaic genetic analysis, we then
      demonstrated that PINK1 and PARKIN function epistatically to mediate the specific
      timely removal of mitochondria, and are involved in global autophagy in ECs
      during Drosophila midgut metamorphosis, with kinase-dead PINK1 exerting dominant 
      negative effects. Taken together, our studies concluded that the PINK1/PARKIN is 
      crucial for timely cell-type specific mitophagy under physiological conditions
      and demonstrated again that Drosophila midgut metamorphosis might serve as an
      elegant in vivo model to study autophagy.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of metazoans is lined by a series of regionally
      distinct epithelia. To maintain structure and function of the GI tract,
      regionally diversified differentiation of somatic stem cell (SC) lineages is
      critical. The adult Drosophila midgut provides an accessible model to study SC
      regulation and specification in a regionally defined manner. SCs of the posterior
      midgut (PM) have been studied extensively, but the control of SCs in the middle
      midgut (MM) is less well understood. The MM contains a stomach-like copper cell
      region (CCR) that is regenerated by gastric stem cells (GSSCs) and contains
      acid-secreting copper cells (CCs). Bmp-like Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling
      determines the identity of GSSCs, and is required for CC regeneration, yet the
      precise control of Dpp signaling activity in this lineage remains to be fully
      established. Here, we show that Dad, a negative feedback regulator of Dpp
      signaling, is dynamically regulated in the GSSC lineage to allow CC
      differentiation. Dad is highly expressed in GSSCs and their first daughter cells,
      the gastroblasts (GBs), but has to be repressed in differentiating CCs to allow
      Dpp-mediated differentiation into CCs. We find that the Hox gene ultrabithorax
      (Ubx) is required for this regulation. Loss of Ubx prevents Dad repression in the
      CCR, resulting in defective CC regeneration. Our study highlights the need for
      dynamic control of Dpp signaling activity in the differentiation of the GSSC
      lineage and identifies Ubx as a critical regulator of this process.

AB  - The spatiotemporal localization of the plant hormone auxin acts as a positional
      cue during early leaf and flower organogenesis. One of the main contributors to
      auxin localization is the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). Phylogenetic
      analysis has revealed that PIN1 genes are split into two sister clades; PIN1 and 
      the relatively uncharacterized Sister-Of-PIN1 (SoPIN1). In this paper we identify
      entire-2 as a loss-of-function SlSoPIN1a (Solyc10g078370) mutant in Solanum
      lycopersicum. The entire-2 plants are unable to specify proper leaf initiation
      leading to a frequent switch from the wild type spiral phyllotactic pattern to
      distichous and decussate patterns. Leaves in entire-2 are large and less complex 
      and the leaflets display spatial deformities in lamina expansion, vascular
      development, and margin specification. During sympodial growth in entire-2 the
      specification of organ position and identity is greatly affected resulting in
      variable branching patterns on the main sympodial and inflorescence axes. To
      understand how SlSoPIN1a functions in establishing proper auxin maxima we used
      the auxin signaling reporter DR5: Venus to visualize differences in auxin
      localization between entire-2 and wild type. DR5: Venus visualization shows a
      widening of auxin localization which spreads to subepidermal tissue layers during
      early leaf and flower organogenesis, showing that SoPIN1 functions to focus auxin
      signaling to the epidermal layer. The striking spatial deformities observed in
      entire-2 help provide a mechanistic framework for explaining the function of the 
      SoPIN1 clade in S.lycopersicum.

AB  - Climate change is multi-faceted, and includes changing concentrations of
      greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, rising temperatures, changes in precipitation
      patterns, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events. Here, we focus on
      the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, rising temperature, and
      drought stress and their interaction on plant developmental processes in leaves, 
      roots, and in reproductive structures. While in some cases these responses are
      conserved across species, such as decreased root elongation, perturbation of root
      growth angle and reduced seed yield in response to drought, or an increase in
      root biomass in shallow soil in response to elevated CO2, most responses are
      variable within and between species and are dependent on developmental stage.
      These variable responses include species-specific thresholds that arrest
      development of reproductive structures, reduce root growth rate and the rate of
      leaf initiation and expansion in response to elevated temperature. Leaf
      developmental responses to elevated CO2 vary by cell type and by species.
      Variability also exists between C3 and C4 species in response to elevated CO2,
      especially in terms of growth and seed yield stimulation. At the molecular level,
      significantly less is understood regarding conservation and variability in
      molecular mechanisms underlying these traits. Abscisic acid-mediated changes in
      cell wall expansion likely underlie reductions in growth rate in response to
      drought, and changes in known regulators of flowering time likely underlie
      altered reproductive transitions in response to elevated temperature and CO2.
      Genes that underlie most other organ or tissue-level responses have largely only 
      been identified in a single species in response to a single stress and their
      level of conservation is unknown. We conclude that there is a need for further
      research regarding the molecular mechanisms of plant developmental responses to
      climate change factors in general, and that this lack of data is particularly
      prevalent in the case of interactive effects of multiple climate change factors. 
      As future growing conditions will likely expose plants to multiple climate change
      factors simultaneously, with a sum negative influence on global agriculture,
      further research in this area is critical.

AB  - Plant MADS-box genes have duplicated extensively, allegedly contributing to the
      immense diversity of floral form in angiosperms. In Arabidopsis thaliana (a core 
      eudicot model plant), four SEPALLATA (SEP) genes comprise the E-class from the
      extended ABCE model of flower development. They are redundantly involved in the
      development of the four types of floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens and
      carpels) and in floral meristem determinacy. E-class genes have been examined in 
      other core eudicots and monocots, but have been less investigated in non-core
      eudicots. Our goal was to functionally characterize the E-class genes in the
      early-diverging eudicot Thalictrum thalictroides (Ranunculaceae), whose flowers
      are apetalous. We identified four SEP orthologs, which when placed in a
      phylogenetic context, resulted from a major gene duplication event before the
      origin of angiosperms and a subsequent duplication at the origin of the
      Ranunculales. We used Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) to down-regulate the
      three expressed paralogs individually and in combination to investigate their
      function and to determine the degree of conservation versus divergence of this
      important plant transcription factor. All loci were partially redundant in sepal 
      and stamen identity and in promoting petaloidy of sepals, yet the SEP3 ortholog
      had a more pronounced role in carpel identity and development. The two other
      paralogs appear to have subfunctionalized in their cadastral roles to keep the
      boundaries between either sepal and stamen zones or stamen and carpel zones.
      Double knockdowns had enhanced phenotypes and the triple knockdown had an even
      more severe phenotype that included partial to complete homeotic conversion of
      stamens and carpels to sepaloid organs and green sepals, highlighting a role of
      E-class genes in petaloidy of sepals in this species. While no floral meristem
      determinacy defects were observed, this could be due to residual amounts of gene 
      expression in the VIGS experiments being sufficient to perform this function or
      to the masking role of a redundant gene.

AB  - Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is universally required for the development of
      multicellular organisms. Unlike animal cells, plant cells have a rigid cellulosic
      extracellular matrix, the cell wall, which provides physical support and forms
      communication routes. This fundamental difference leads to some unique mechanisms
      in plants for generating asymmetries during cell division. However, plants also
      utilize intrinsically polarized proteins to regulate asymmetric signaling and
      cell division, a strategy similar to the differentiation mechanism found in
      animals. Current progress suggests that common regulatory modes, i.e. protein
      spontaneous clustering and cytoskeleton reorganization, underlie protein
      polarization in both animal and plant cells. Despite these commonalities, it is
      important to note that intrinsic mechanisms in plants are heavily influenced by
      extrinsic cues. To control physical asymmetry in cell division, although our
      understanding is fragmentary thus far, plants might have evolved novel
      polarization strategies to orientate cell division plane. Recent studies also
      suggest that the phytohormone auxin, one of the most pivotal small molecules in
      plant development, regulates ACD in plants.

AB  - Patterning of a multicellular body plan involves a coordinated set of
      developmental processes that includes cell division, morphogenesis, and cellular 
      differentiation. These processes have been most intensively studied in animals
      and land plants; however, deep insight can also be gained by studying development
      in simpler multicellular organisms. The multicellular green alga Volvox carteri
      (Volvox) is an excellent model for the investigation of developmental mechanisms 
      and their evolutionary origins. Volvox has a streamlined body plan that contains 
      only a few thousand cells and two distinct cell types: reproductive germ cells
      and terminally differentiated somatic cells. Patterning of the Volvox body plan
      is achieved through a stereotyped developmental program that includes embryonic
      cleavage with asymmetric cell division, morphogenesis, and cell-type
      differentiation. In this review we provide an overview of how these three
      developmental processes give rise to the adult form in Volvox and how
      developmental mutants have provided insights into the mechanisms behind these
      events. We highlight the accessibility and tractability of Volvox and its
      relatives that provide a unique opportunity for studying development.

AB  - Within living systems, striking juxtapositions in symmetry and asymmetry can be
      observed and the superficial appearance of symmetric organization often gives way
      to cellular asymmetries at higher resolution. It is frequently asymmetry and
      polarity that fascinate and challenge developmental biologists. In multicellular 
      eukaryotes, cell polarity and asymmetry are essential for diverse cellular,
      tissue, and organismal level function and physiology and are particularly crucial
      for developmental processes. In plants, where cells are surrounded by rigid cell 
      walls, asymmetric cell divisions are the foundation of pattern formation and
      differential cell fate specification. Thus, cellular asymmetry is a key feature
      of plant biology and in the plant root the consequences of these asymmetries are 
      elegantly displayed. Yet despite the frequency of asymmetric (formative) cell
      divisions, cell/tissue polarity and the proposed roles for directional signaling 
      in these processes, polarly localized proteins, beyond those involved in auxin or
      nutrient transport, are exceedingly rare. Indeed, although half of the asymmetric
      cell divisions in root patterning are oriented parallel to the axis of growth,
      laterally localized proteins directly involved in patterning are largely missing 
      in action. Here, various asymmetric cell divisions and cellular and structural
      polarities observed in roots are highlighted and discussed in the context of the 
      proposed roles for positional and/or directional signaling in these processes.
      The importance of directional signaling and the weight given to polarity in the
      root-shoot axis is contrasted with how little we currently understand about
      laterally oriented asymmetry and polarity in the root.

AB  - Chimeras - organisms that are composed of cells of more than one genotype -
      captured the human imagination long before they were formally described and used 
      in the laboratory. These organisms owe their namesake to a fire-breathing monster
      from Greek mythology that has the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the
      tail of a serpent. The first description of a non-fictional chimera dates back to
      the middle of the seventeenth century when the Florentine gardener Pietro Nati
      discovered an adventitious shoot growing from the graft junction between sour
      orange (Citrus aurantium) and citron (Citrus medica). This perplexing chimera
      that grows with sectors phenotypically resembling each of the citrus progenitors 
      inspired discussion and wonder from the scientific community and was fittingly
      named the 'Bizzaria'. Initially, the 'Bizzaria' was believed to be an asexual
      hybrid that formed from a cellular fusion between the grafted parents; however,
      in-depth cellular analyses carried out centuries later demonstrated that the
      'Bizzaria', along with other chimeras, owe their unique sectored appearance to a 
      conglomeration of cells from the two donors. Since this pivotal discovery at the 
      turn of the twentieth century, chimeras have served both as tools and as unique
      biological phenomena that have contributed to our understanding of plant
      development at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level. Rapid advancements in 
      genome sequencing technologies have enabled the establishment of new model
      species with novel morphological and developmental features that enable the
      generation of chimeric organisms. In this review, we show that genetic mosaic and
      chimera studies provide a technologically simple way to delve into the
      organismal, genetic, and genomic inner workings underlying the development of
      diverse model organisms. Moreover, we discuss the unique opportunity that
      chimeras present to explore universal principles governing intercellular
      communication and the coordination of organismal biology in a heterogenomic
      landscape.

AB  - Leaf development serves as a model for plant developmental flexibility. Flexible 
      balancing of morphogenesis and differentiation during leaf development results in
      a large diversity of leaf forms, both between different species and within the
      same species. This diversity is particularly evident in compound leaves. Hormones
      are prominent regulators of leaf development. Here we discuss some of the roles
      of plant hormones and the cross-talk between different hormones in tomato
      compound-leaf development.

AB  - Mediator is a multiprotein complex that regulates transcription at the level of
      RNA pol II assembly, as well as through regulation of chromatin architecture, RNA
      processing and recruitment of epigenetic marks. Though its modular structure is
      conserved in eukaryotes, its subunit composition has diverged during evolution
      and varies in response to environmental and tissue-specific inputs, suggesting
      different functions for each subunit and/or Mediator conformation. In animals,
      Mediator has been implicated in the control of differentiation and morphogenesis 
      through modulation of numerous signaling pathways. In plants, studies have
      revealed roles for Mediator in regulation of cell division, cell fate and
      organogenesis, as well as developmental timing and hormone responses. We begin
      this review with an overview of biochemical mechanisms of yeast and animal
      Mediator that are likely to be conserved in all eukaryotes, as well as a brief
      discussion of the role of Mediator in animal development. We then present a
      comprehensive review of studies of the role of Mediator in plant development.
      Finally, we point to important questions for future research on the role of
      Mediator as a master coordinator of development.

AB  - Time-course imaging experiments on live organisms are critical for understanding 
      the dynamics of growth and development. Light-sheet microscopy has advanced the
      field of long-term imaging of live specimens by significantly reducing
      photo-toxicity and allowing fast acquisition of three-dimensional data over time.
      However, current light-sheet technology does not allow the imaging of multiple
      plant specimens in parallel. To achieve higher throughput, we have developed a
      Multi-sample Arabidopsis Growth and Imaging Chamber (MAGIC) that provides
      near-physiological imaging conditions and allows high-throughput time-course
      imaging experiments in the ZEISS Lightsheet Z.1. Here, we illustrate MAGIC's
      imaging capabilities by following cell divisions, as an indicator of plant growth
      and development, over prolonged time periods. To automatically quantify the
      number of cell divisions in long-term experiments, we present a FIJI-based image 
      processing pipeline. We demonstrate that plants imaged with our chamber undergo
      cell divisions for >16 times longer than those with the glass capillary system
      supplied by the ZEISS Z1.

AB  - Vascular plants have an open body plan and continuously generate new axes of
      growth, such as shoot or root branches. Apical-to-basal transport of the hormone 
      auxin is a hallmark of every axis, and the resulting pattern of auxin
      distribution affects plant development across scales, from overall architecture
      to cellular differentiation. How the first axis is initiated in the early embryo 
      is a long-standing question. While our knowledge is still sparse, some of the key
      players of axialization have emerged, and recent work points to specific models
      for connecting cellular polarity to the asymmetric division of the zygote and
      domain specific gene expression to the organization of basipetal auxin flux.

AB  - Adaptive phenotypic evolution is shaped by natural selection on multiple
      organismal traits as well as by genetic correlations among traits. Genetic
      correlations can arise through pleiotropy and can bias the production of
      phenotypic variation to certain combinations of traits. This phenomenon is
      referred to as developmental bias or constraint. Developmental bias may
      accelerate or constrain phenotypic evolution, depending on whether selection acts
      parallel or in opposition to genetic correlations among traits. We discuss
      examples from floral evolution where genetic correlations among floral traits
      contribute to rapid, coordinated evolution in multiple floral organ phenotypes
      and suggest future research directions that will explore the relationship between
      the genetic basis of adaptation and the pre-existing structure of genetic
      correlations. On the other hand, natural selection may act perpendicular to a
      strong genetic correlation, for example when two traits are encoded by a subset
      of the same genes and natural selection favors change in one trait and stability 
      in the second trait. In such cases, adaptation is constrained by the availability
      of genetic variation that can influence the focal trait with minimal pleiotropic 
      effects. Examples from plant diversification suggest that the origin of certain
      adaptations depends on the prior evolution of a gene copy with reduced
      pleiotropic effects, generated through the process of gene duplication followed
      by subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. A history of gene duplication in
      some developmental pathways appears to have allowed particular flowering plant
      linages to have repeatedly evolved adaptations that might otherwise have been
      developmentally constrained.

AB  - The brown color of Arabidopsis seeds is caused by the deposition of
      proanthocyanidins (PAs or condensed tannins) in their inner testa layer. A
      transcription factor complex consisting of TT2, TT8 and TTG1 controls expression 
      of PA biosynthetic genes, just as similar TTG1-dependent complexes have been
      shown to control flavonoid pigment pathway gene expression in general. However,
      PA synthesis is controlled by at least one other gene. TTG2 mutants lack the
      pigmentation found in wild-type seeds, but produce other flavonoid compounds,
      such as anthocyanins in the shoot, suggesting that TTG2 regulates genes in the PA
      biosynthetic branch of the flavonoid pathway. We analyzed the expression of PA
      biosynthetic genes within the developing seeds of ttg2-1 and wild-type plants for
      potential TTG2 regulatory targets. We found that expression of TT12, encoding a
      MATE type transporter, is dependent on TTG2 and that TTG2 can bind to the
      upstream regulatory region of TT12 suggesting that TTG2 directly regulates TT12. 
      Ectopic expression of TT12 in ttg2-1 plants partially restores seed coat
      pigmentation. Moreover, we show that TTG2 regulation of TT12 is dependent on TTG1
      and that TTG1 and TTG2 physically interact. The observation that TTG1 interacts
      with TTG2, a WRKY type transcription factor, proposes the existence of a novel
      TTG1-containing complex, and an addendum to the existing paradigm of flavonoid
      pathway regulation.

AB  - Organogenesis requires the coordination of many highly-regulated developmental
      processes, including cell fate determination, cell division and growth, and
      cell-cell communication. For tissue- and organ-scale coordination, a network of
      regulators enables molecular events in individual cells to translate into
      multicellular changes in structure and functional capacity. One recurrent theme
      in plant developmental networks is a central role for plant hormones, especially 
      auxin. Here, we focus first on describing recent advances in understanding
      lateral root development, one of the best-studied examples of auxin-mediated
      organogenesis. We then use this framework to examine the parallel process of
      emergence of lateral organs in the shoot-a process called phyllotaxy. This
      comparison reveals a high degree of conservation, highlighting auxin's pivotal
      role determining overall plant architecture.

AB  - In seed plants, anthers are critical for sexual reproduction, because they foster
      both meiosis and subsequent pollen development of male germinal cells.
      Male-sterile mutants are analyzed to define steps in anther development.
      Historically the major topics in these studies are meiotic arrest and
      post-meiotic gametophyte failure, while relatively few studies focus on
      pre-meiotic defects of anther somatic cells. Utilizing morphometric analysis we
      demonstrate that pre-meiotic mutants can be impaired in anticlinal or periclinal 
      cell division patterns and that final cell number in the pre-meiotic anther lobe 
      is independent of cell number changes of individual differentiated somatic cell
      types. Data derived from microarrays and from cell wall NMR analyses allow us to 
      further refine our understanding of the onset of phenotypes. Collectively the
      data highlight that even minor deviations from the correct spatiotemporal pattern
      of somatic cell proliferation can result in male sterility in Zea mays.

AB  - Recent advances in confocal microscopy, coupled with the development of numerous 
      fluorescent reporters, provide us with a powerful tool to study the development
      of plants. Live confocal imaging has been used extensively to further our
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation of roots, shoots and
      leaves. However, it has not been widely applied to flowers, partly because of
      specific challenges associated with the imaging of flower buds. Here, we describe
      how to prepare and grow shoot apices of Arabidopsis in vitro, to perform both
      single-point and time-lapse imaging of live, developing flower buds with either
      an upright or an inverted confocal microscope.

AB  - Land plant bodies develop from meristems, groups of pluripotent stem cells, which
      may persist throughout the life of a plant or, alternatively, have a transitory
      existence. Early diverging land plants exhibit indeterminate (persistent) growth 
      in their haploid gametophytic generation, whereas later diverging lineages
      exhibit indeterminate growth in their diploid sporophytic generation, raising the
      question of whether genetic machinery directing meristematic functions was
      co-opted between generations. Class III HD-Zip (C3HDZ) genes are required for the
      establishment and maintenance of shoot apical meristems in flowering plants. We
      demonstrate that in the moss Physcomitrella patens, C3HDZ genes are expressed in 
      transitory meristems in both the gametophytic and sporophytic generations, but
      not in the persistent shoot meristem of the gametyphyte. Loss-of-function of P.
      patens C3HDZ was engineered using ectopic expression of miR166, an endogenous
      regulator of C3HDZ gene activity. Loss of C3HDZ gene function impaired the
      function of gametophytic transitory meristematic activity but did not compromise 
      the functioning of the persistent shoot apical meristem during the gametophyte
      generation. These results argue against a wholesale co-option of meristematic
      gene regulatory networks from the gametophyte to the sporophyte during land plant
      evolution, instead suggesting that persistent meristems with a single apical cell
      in P. patens and persistent complex meristems in flowering plants are regulated
      by different genetic programs.

TI  - Functional consequences of I56ii Dlx enhancer deletion in the developing mouse
      forebrain.

LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.10.015 [doi]
AB  - Dlx homeobox genes encode a group of transcription factors that play an essential
      role during developmental processes including maintaining the differentiation,
      proliferation and migration of GABAergic interneurons. The Dlx1/2 and Dlx5/6
      genes are expressed in the forebrain and are arranged in convergently transcribed
      bigene clusters, with I12a/I12b and I56i/I56ii cis-regulatory elements (CREs)
      located in the intergenic region of each cluster respectively. We have
      characterized the phenotypic consequences of deleting I56ii on forebrain
      development and spatial patterning of corridor cells that are involved in guiding
      thalamocortical projections. Here we report that deletion of I56ii impairs
      expression of Dlx genes and that of potential targets including Gad2 as well as
      striatal markers Islet1, Meis2, and Ebf1. In addition, I56ii deletion reduces
      both the binding of DLX2 in the Dlx5/Dlx6 intergenic region and the presence of
      H3K9Ac at the Dlx5/Dlx6 locus, consistent with the reduced expression of these
      genes. Deletion of I56ii reduces the expression of the ISLET1 and CTIP2 in the
      striatum and disrupts the number of parvalbumin and calretinin expressing cells
      in the adult somatosensory cortex of the DeltaI56ii mice. These data suggest an
      important regulatory role for I56ii in the developing forebrain by means of a
      potential regulatory mechanism which may regulate the expression of Dlx genes,
      notably Dlx6 as well as the spatial patterning of the ventral telencephalon,
      including possibly corridor cells.

AB  - The pericellular matrix (PCM) is a component of the extracellular matrix that is 
      found immediately surrounding individual chondrocytes in developing and adult
      cartilage, and is rich in the proteoglycan perlecan. Mutations in perlecan are
      the basis of several developmental disorders, which are thought to arise from
      disruptions in the mechanical stability of the PCM. We tested the hypothesis that
      defects in PCM organization will reduce the stiffness of chondrocytes in
      developing cartilage by combining a murine model of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, in 
      which perlecan is knocked down, with our novel atomic force microscopy technique 
      that can measure the stiffness of living cells and surrounding matrix in
      embryonic and postnatal tissues in situ. Perlecan knockdown altered matrix
      organization and significantly decreased the stiffness of both chondrocytes and
      interstitial matrix as a function of age and genotype. Our results demonstrate
      that the knockdown of a spatially restricted matrix molecule can have a profound 
      influence on cell and tissue stiffness, implicating a role for outside-in
      mechanical signals from the PCM in regulating the intracellular mechanisms
      required for the overall development of cartilage.

AB  - Plexins (Plexs) comprise a large family of cell surface receptors for semaphorins
      (Semas) that function as evolutionarily conserved guidance molecules. GTPase
      activating protein (GAP) activity for Ras family small GTPases has been
      implicated in plexin signaling cascades through its RasGAP domain. However,
      little is known about how Ras family GTPases are controlled in vivo by plexin
      signaling. Here, we found that Drosophila Rap1, a member of the Ras family of
      GTPases, plays an important role controlling intersegmental nerve b motor axon
      guidance during neural development. Gain-of-function studies using
      dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of Rap1 indicate that Rap1
      contributes to axonal growth and guidance. Genetic interaction analyses
      demonstrate that the Sema-1a/PlexA-mediated repulsive guidance function is
      regulated positively by Rap1. Furthermore, neuronal expression of mutant PlexA
      robustly restored defasciculation defects in PlexA null mutants when the
      catalytic arginine fingers of the PlexA RasGAP domain critical for GAP activity
      were disrupted. However, deleting the RasGAP domain abolished the ability of
      PlexA to rescue the PlexA guidance phenotypes. These findings suggest that
      PlexA-mediated motor axon guidance is dependent on the presence of the PlexA
      RasGAP domain, but not on its GAP activity toward Ras family small GTPases.

AB  - The Notch signaling cascade is an evolutionarily ancient system that allows cells
      to interact with their microenvironmental neighbors through direct cell-cell
      interactions, thereby directing a variety of developmental processes. Recent
      research is discovering that Notch signaling is also responsive to a broad
      variety of stimuli beyond cell-cell interactions, including: ECM composition,
      crosstalk with other signaling systems, shear stress, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia.
      Given this emerging understanding of Notch responsiveness to microenvironmental
      conditions, it appears that the classical view of Notch as a mechanism enabling
      cell-cell interactions, is only a part of a broader function to integrate
      microenvironmental cues. In this review, we summarize and discuss published data 
      supporting the idea that the full function of Notch signaling is to serve as an
      integrator of microenvironmental signals thus allowing cells to sense and respond
      to a multitude of conditions around them.

AB  - The avian thymus and parathyroids (T/PT) common primordium derives from the
      endoderm of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches (3/4PP). The molecular
      mechanisms that govern T/PT development are not fully understood. Here we study
      the effects of Notch and Hedgehog (Hh) signalling modulation during common
      primordium development using in vitro, in vivo and in ovo approaches. The
      impairment of Notch activity reduced Foxn1/thymus-fated and
      Gcm2/Pth/parathyroid-fated domains in the 3/4PP and further compromised the
      development of the parathyroid glands. When Hh signalling was abolished, we
      observed a reduction in the Gata3/Gcm2- and Lfng-expression domains at the
      median/anterior and median/posterior territories of the pouches, respectively. In
      contrast, the Foxn1 expression-domain at the dorsal tip of the pouches expanded
      ventrally into the Lfng-expression domain. This study offers novel evidence on
      the role of Notch signalling in T/PT common primordium development, in an
      Hh-dependent manner.

AB  - Head development in vertebrates proceeds through a series of elaborate patterning
      mechanisms and cell-cell interactions involving cephalic neural crest cells
      (CNCC). These cells undergo extensive migration along stereotypical paths after
      their separation from the dorsal margins of the neural tube and they give rise to
      most of the craniofacial skeleton. Here, we report that the silencing of the LKB1
      tumor suppressor affects the delamination of pre-migratory CNCC from the neural
      primordium as well as their polarization and survival, thus resulting in severe
      facial and brain defects. We further show that LKB1-mediated effects on the
      development of CNCC involve the sequential activation of the AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK), the Rho-dependent kinase (ROCK) and the actin-based motor 
      protein myosin II. Collectively, these results establish that the complex
      morphogenetic processes governing head formation critically depends on the
      activation of the LKB1 signaling network in CNCC.

      in an adult nematode are germline, it is likely that regulatory miRNAs are
      important for germline development and maintenance. In C. elegans the miR35
      family has strong maternal effects, contributing to normal embryogenesis and to
      adult fecundity. To determine whether any particular miRNAs are greatly enriched 
      in the C. elegans germline we used RNA-seq to compare the miRNA populations in
      several germline-defective strains of adult C. elegans worms, including
      glp-4(germline proliferation-4), glh-1(germline helicase-1) and dcr-1(dicer-1).
      Statistical analyses of RNA-seq comparisons identified 13 miRNAs that are
      germline-enriched, including seven members of the well-studied miR35 family that 
      were reduced as much as 1000-fold in TaqMan qRT PCR miRNA assays. Along with the 
      miR35s, six others: miR-56 (a member of the miR51 family),-70, -244, -260 , -788 
      and -4813, none of which previously considered as such, were also identified by
      RNA-seq as germline-enriched candidates. We went on to develop a successful miRNA
      in situ hybridization protocol for C. elegans, revealing miR35s specifically
      concentrate during oogenesis in the pachytene region of the gonad, and persist
      throughout early embryogenesis, while in adult animals neither let-7 nor miR-228 
      has a germline-bias.

AB  - Morphogenesis of the mammalian kidney requires reciprocal interactions between
      two cellular domains at the periphery of the developing organ: the tips of the
      epithelial ureteric tree and adjacent regions of cap mesenchyme. While the
      presence of the cap mesenchyme is essential for ureteric branching, how it is
      specifically maintained at the tips is unclear. Using ex vivo timelapse imaging
      we show that cells of the cap mesenchyme are highly motile. Individual cap
      mesenchyme cells move within and between cap domains. They also attach and detach
      from the ureteric tip across time. Timelapse tracks collected for >800 cells
      showed evidence that this movement was largely stochastic, with cell autonomous
      migration influenced by opposing attractive, repulsive and cell adhesion cues.
      The resulting swarming behaviour maintains a distinct cap mesenchyme domain while
      facilitating dynamic remodelling in response to underlying changes in the tip.

AB  - RacGAP1 is one of the two components of the centralspindlin complex essential for
      orchestrating cytokinesis in all animal cells. We report here that the early
      arrest mutant ogre is a maternal and zygotic loss of function mutation in the
      zebrafish homolog of racgap1. Like the other model organisms in which racgap1 is 
      mutated, cells in the mutant stop dividing. In vivo cell recordings reveal that
      gradual loss of wild-type RacGAP1 leads progressively from a failure of
      abscission, then to cleavage furrow ingression, and finally complete absence of
      furrow formation. Despite the lack of cytokinesis, gross patterning occurs
      overtly normally in ogre mutants and cells continue to cycle slowly, some even
      attaining four or eight nuclei. Many multinucleate cells differentiate and
      survive, but the majority of cells enter apoptosis that we demonstrate is due to 
      cumulative rounds of defective cytokinesis. Investigation of the cells that
      differentiate in the mutant indicate that RacGAP1 is also needed for long-term
      survival of motoneurons and the cytoskeletal organization of sensory axons. We
      conclude that while RacGAP1 function is crucial for cytokinesis and its activity 
      at different levels controls different aspects of cytokinesis, these defects have
      occluded other critical roles of this interesting protein.

AB  - Centroacinar cells (CACs) are ductal Notch-responsive progenitors that in the
      larval zebrafish pancreas differentiate to form new islets and ultimately
      contribute to the majority of the adult endocrine mass. Uncovering the mechanisms
      regulating CAC differentiation will facilitate understanding how
      insulin-producing beta cells are formed. Previously we reported retinoic acid
      (RA) signaling and Notch signaling both regulate larval CAC differentiation,
      suggesting a shared downstream intermediate. Sox9b is a transcription factor
      important for islet formation whose expression is upregulated by Notch signaling 
      in larval CACs. Here we report that sox9b expression in larval CACs is also
      regulated by RA signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized that Sox9b is an
      intermediate between both RA- and Notch-signaling pathways. In order to study the
      role of Sox9b in larval CACs, we generated two cre/lox based transgenic tools,
      which allowed us to express full-length or truncated Sox9b in larval CACs. In
      this way we were able to perform spatiotemporal-controlled Sox9b gain- and
      loss-of-function studies and observe the subsequent effect on progenitor
      differentiation. Our results are consistent with Sox9b regulating CAC
      differentiation by being a downstream intermediate of both RA- and
      Notch-signaling pathways. We also demonstrate that adult zebrafish with only one 
      functional allele of sox9b undergo accelerated beta-cell regeneration, an
      observation consistent with sox9b regulating CAC differentiation in adults.

AB  - The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has two types of external visual organs, a 
      pair of compound eyes and a group of three ocelli. At the time of neurogenesis,
      the proneural transcription factor Atonal mediates the transition from progenitor
      cells to differentiating photoreceptor neurons in both organs. In the developing 
      compound eye, atonal (ato) expression is directly induced by transcriptional
      regulators that confer retinal identity, the Retinal Determination (RD) factors. 
      Little is known, however, about control of ato transcription in the ocelli. Here 
      we show that a 2kb genomic DNA fragment contains distinct and common regulatory
      elements necessary for ato induction in compound eyes and ocelli. The three
      binding sites that mediate direct regulation by the RD factors Sine oculis and
      Eyeless in the compound eye are also required in the ocelli. However, in the
      latter, these sites mediate control by Sine oculis and the other Pax6 factor of
      Drosophila, Twin of eyeless, which can bind the Pax6 sites in vitro. Moreover,
      the three sites are differentially utilized in the ocelli: all three are
      similarly essential for atonal induction in the posterior ocelli, but show
      considerable redundancy in the anterior ocellus. Strikingly, this difference
      parallels the distinct control of ato transcription in the posterior and anterior
      progenitors of the developing compound eyes. From a comparative perspective, our 
      findings suggest that the ocelli of arthropods may have originated through
      spatial partitioning from the dorsal edge of an ancestral compound eye.

AB  - The Mesp family of transcription factors have been implicated in the early
      formation and migration of the cardiac lineage, although the precise molecular
      mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. In this study we examine the
      function of Mesp family members in zebrafish cardiac development and find that
      Mespaa is remarkably efficient at promoting cardiac fates in normally
      non-cardiogenic cells. However, Mespaa is dispensable for normal cardiac
      formation. Despite no overt defects in cardiovascular specification, we find a
      consistent defect in cardiac laterality in mespaa null embryos. This is further
      exacerbated by the depletion of other mesp paralogues, highlighting a conserved
      role for the mesp family in left-right asymmetry, distinct from a function in
      cardiac specification. Despite an early requirement for mespaa to promote
      cardiogenesis, cells over-expressing mespaa are found to both exhibit unique
      cellular behaviors and activate the transcription of gata5 only after the
      completion of gastrulation. We propose that while mespaa remains capable of
      driving cardiac progenitor formation in zebrafish, it may not play an essential
      role in the cardiac regulatory network. Furthermore, the late activation of
      migration and cardiac gene transcription in mespaa over-expressing cells
      challenges previous studies on the timing of these events and provides intriguing
      questions for future study.

TI  - Transcriptional targets of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm regulate cell-matrix
      interactions and mesenchyme maintenance.

AB  - TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is essential for the
      development of cranial mesoderm and cranial neural crest-derived craniofacial
      structures. We have previously shown that, in the absence of TWIST1, cells within
      the cranial mesoderm adopt an abnormal epithelial configuration via a process
      reminiscent of a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Here, we show by
      gene expression analysis that loss of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm is
      accompanied by a reduction in the expression of genes that are associated with
      cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the acquisition of mesenchymal
      characteristics. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of cranial
      mesoderm-specific Twist1 loss-of-function mutant and control mouse embryos, we
      identified a set of genes that are both TWIST1-dependent and predominantly
      expressed in the mesoderm. ChIP-seq was used to identify TWIST1-binding sites in 
      an in vitro model of a TWIST1-dependent mesenchymal cell state, and the data were
      combined with the transcriptome data to identify potential target genes. Three
      direct transcriptional targets of TWIST1 (Ddr2, Pcolce and Tgfbi) were validated 
      by ChIP-PCR using mouse embryonic tissues and by luciferase assays. Our findings 
      reveal that the mesenchymal properties of the cranial mesoderm are likely to be
      regulated by a network of TWIST1 targets that influences the extracellular matrix
      and cell-matrix interactions, and collectively they are required for the
      morphogenesis of the craniofacial structures.

AB  - The size and shape of dendrite arbors are defining features of neurons and
      critical determinants of neuronal function. The molecular mechanisms establishing
      arborization patterns during development are not well understood, though properly
      regulated microtubule (MT) dynamics and polarity are essential. We previously
      found that FoxO regulates axonal MTs, raising the question of whether it also
      regulates dendritic MTs and morphology. Here we demonstrate that FoxO promotes
      dendrite branching in all classes of Drosophila dendritic arborization (da)
      neurons. FoxO is required both for initiating growth of new branches and for
      maintaining existing branches. To elucidate FoxO function, we characterized MT
      organization in both foxO null and overexpressing neurons. We find that FoxO
      directs MT organization and dynamics in dendrites. Moreover, it is both necessary
      and sufficient for anterograde MT polymerization, which is known to promote
      dendrite branching. Lastly, FoxO promotes proper larval nociception, indicating a
      functional consequence of impaired da neuron morphology in foxO mutants.
      Together, our results indicate that FoxO regulates dendrite structure and
      function and suggest that FoxO-mediated pathways control MT dynamics and
      polarity.

AB  - Imprinted genes are expressed primarily from one parental allele by virtue of a
      germ line epigenetic process. Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (Ascl2 aka Mash2)
      is a maternally expressed imprinted gene that plays a key role in placental and
      intestinal development. Loss-of-function of Ascl2 results in an expansion of the 
      parietal trophoblast giant cell (P-TGC) lineage, an almost complete loss of
      Trophoblast specific protein alpha (Tpbpa) positive cells in the ectoplacental
      cone and embryonic failure by E10.5. Tpbpa expression marks the progenitors of
      some P-TGCs, two additional trophoblast giant cell lineages (spiral artery and
      canal), the spongiotrophoblast and the glycogen cell lineage. Using a transgenic 
      model, here we show that elevated expression of Ascl2 reduced the number of P-TGC
      cells by 40%. Elevated Ascl2 also resulted in a marked loss of the
      spongiotrophoblast and a substantial mislocalisation of glycogen cells into the
      labyrinth. In addition, Ascl2-Tg placenta contained considerably more placental
      glycogen than wild type. Glycogen cells are normally located within the
      junctional zone in close contact with spongiotrophoblast cells, before migrating 
      through the P-TGC layer into the maternal decidua late in gestation where their
      stores of glycogen are released. The failure of glycogen cells to release their
      stores of glycogen may explain both the inappropriate accumulation of glycogen
      and fetal growth restriction observed late in gestation in this model. In
      addition, using in a genetic cross we provide evidence that Ascl2 requires the
      activity of a second maternally expressed imprinted gene, Pleckstrin
      homology-like domain, family a, member 2 (Phlda2) to limit the expansion of the
      spongiotrophoblast. This "belts and braces" approach demonstrates the importance 
      of genomic imprinting in regulating the size of the placental endocrine
      compartment for optimal placental development and fetal growth.

AB  - Previous studies have shown CD34 family member Podocalyxin is required for
      epithelial lumen formation in vitro. We demonstrate that Endoglycan, a CD34
      family member with homology to Podocalyxin, is produced prior to lumen formation 
      in developing nephrons. Endoglycan localizes to Rab11-containing vesicles in
      nephron progenitors, and then relocalizes to the apical surface as progenitors
      epithelialize. Once an apical/luminal surface is formed, Endoglycan (and the
      actin-binding protein Ezrin) localize to large, intraluminal structures that may 
      be vesicles/exosomes. We generated mice lacking Endoglycan and found mutants had 
      timely initiation of lumen formation and continuous lumens, similar to controls. 
      Mice with conditional deletion of both Endoglycan and Podocalyxin in developing
      nephrons also had normal tubular lumens. Despite this, Endoglycan/Podocalyxin is 
      required for apical recruitment of the adaptor protein NHERF1, but not Ezrin, in 
      podocyte precursors, a subset of the epithelia. In summary, while CD34 family
      members appear dispensable for lumen formation, our data identify Endoglycan as a
      novel pre-luminal marker and suggest lumen formation occurs via vesicular
      trafficking of apical cargo that includes Endoglycan.

AB  - The cellular turnover of adult tissues and injury-induced repair proceed through 
      an exquisite integration of proliferation, differentiation, and survival signals 
      that involve stem/progenitor cell populations, their progeny, and differentiated 
      tissues. GATA factors are DNA binding proteins that control stem cells and the
      development of tissues by activating or repressing transcription. Here we
      examined the role of GATA transcription factors in Schmidtea mediterranea, a
      freshwater planarian that provides an excellent model to investigate gene
      function in adult stem cells, regeneration, and differentiation. Smed-gata4/5/6, 
      the homolog of the three mammalian GATA-4,-5,-6 factors is expressed at high
      levels in differentiated gut cells but also at lower levels in neoblast
      populations, the planarian stem cells. Smed-gata4/5/6 knock-down results in broad
      differentiation defects, especially in response to injury. These defects are not 
      restricted to the intestinal lineage. In particular, at late time points during
      the response to injury, loss of Smed-gata4/5/6 leads to decreased neoblast
      proliferation and to gene expression changes in several neoblast subpopulations. 
      Thus, Smed-gata4/5/6 plays a key evolutionary conserved role in intestinal
      differentiation in planarians. These data further support a model in which
      defects in the intestinal lineage can indirectly affect other differentiation
      pathways in planarians.

AB  - Mammalian Host-Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1), a transcriptional co-regulator, plays
      important roles during the cell-division cycle in cell culture, embryogenesis as 
      well as adult tissue. In mice, HCF-1 is encoded by the X-chromosome-linked Hcfc1 
      gene. Induced Hcfc1(cKO/+) heterozygosity with a conditional knockout (cKO)
      allele in the epiblast of female embryos leads to a mixture of HCF-1-positive and
      -deficient cells owing to random X-chromosome inactivation. These embryos survive
      owing to the replacement of all HCF-1-deficient cells by HCF-1-positive cells
      during E5.5 to E8.5 of development. In contrast, complete epiblast-specific loss 
      of HCF-1 in male embryos, Hcfc1(epiKO/Y), leads to embryonic lethality. Here, we 
      characterize this lethality. We show that male epiblast-specific loss of Hcfc1
      leads to a developmental arrest at E6.5 with a rapid progressive cell-cycle exit 
      and an associated failure of anterior visceral endoderm migration and primitive
      streak formation. Subsequently, gastrulation does not take place. We note that
      the pattern of Hcfc1(epiKO/Y) lethality displays many similarities to loss of
      beta-catenin function. These results reveal essential new roles for HCF-1 in
      early embryonic cell proliferation and development.

AB  - The embryonic-maternal interface of the placental labyrinth, allantois, and yolk 
      sac are vital during embryogenesis; however, the precise mechanism underlying the
      vascularization of these structures remains unknown. Herein we focus on the role 
      of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3R), which are intracellular
      Ca(2+) release channels, in placentation. Double knockout (DKO) of type 1 and 3
      IP3Rs (IP3R1 and IP3R3, respectively) in mice resulted in embryonic lethality
      around embryonic day (E) 11.5. Because IP3R1 and IP3R3 were co-expressed in
      endothelial cells in the labyrinth, allantois, and yolk sac, we investigated
      extra-embryonic vascular development in IP3R1- and IP3R3-DKO mice. The formation 
      of chorionic plates and yolk sac vessels seemed dysregulated around the timing of
      the chorio-allantoic attachment, immediately followed by the disorganization of
      allantoic vessels, the decreased expression of the spongiotrophoblast cell marker
      Tpbpa and the growth retardation of the embryos in DKO mice. Fluorescent
      immunohistochemistry demonstrated downregulation of a vascular endothelial
      marker, CD31, in labyrinth embryonic vessels and poor elongation of
      extra-embryonic mesoderm into the labyrinth layer in DKO placenta, whereas the
      branching of the DKO chorionic trophoblast was initiated. In addition, allantoic 
      and yolk sac vessels in extra-embryonic tissues were less remodeled in DKO mice. 
      In vitro endothelial cord formation and migration activities of cultured vascular
      endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein were downregulated under the 
      inhibition of IP3R. Our results suggest that IP3R1 and IP3R3 are required for
      extra-embryonic vascularization in the placenta, allantois, and yolk sac. This is
      the first demonstration of the essential role of IP3/IP3Rs signaling in the
      development of the vasculature at the embryonic-maternal interface.

AB  - Retinoic acid (RA) repression of Fgf8 is required for many different aspects of
      organogenesis, however relatively little is known about how endogenous RA
      controls gene repression as opposed to gene activation. Here, we show that
      nuclear receptor corepressors NCOR1 and NCOR2 (SMRT) redundantly mediate the
      ability of RA to repress Fgf8. Ncor1;Ncor2 double mutants generated by
      CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing exhibited a small somite and distended heart phenotype
      similar to that of RA-deficient Raldh2-/- embryos, associated with increased Fgf8
      expression and FGF signaling in caudal progenitors and heart progenitors. Embryo 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NCOR1/2 but not coactivators 
      are recruited to the Fgf8 RA response element (RARE) in an RA-dependent manner,
      whereas coactivators but not NCOR1/2 are recruited RA-dependently to a RARE near 
      Rarb that is activated by RA. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion of the Fgf8
      RARE in mouse embryos often resulted in a small somite defect with Fgf8
      derepression caudally, but no defect was observed in heart development or heart
      Fgf8 expression. This suggests the existence of another DNA element whose
      function overlaps with the Fgf8 RARE to mediate Fgf8 repression by RA and
      NCOR1/2. Our studies support a model in which NCOR1/2 mediates direct
      RA-dependent repression of Fgf8 in caudal progenitors in order to control
      somitogenesis.

AB  - During organ development, the progenitor state is transient, and depends on
      specific combinations of transcription factors and extracellular signals. Not
      surprisingly, abnormal maintenance of progenitor transcription factors may lead
      to tissue overgrowth, and the concurrence of signals from the local environment
      is often critical to trigger this overgrowth. Therefore, identifying specific
      combinations of transcription factors/signals promoting -or opposing-
      proliferation in progenitors is essential to understand normal development and
      disease. We have investigated this issue using the Drosophila eye as model.
      Transcription factors hth and tsh are transiently expressed in eye progenitors
      causing the expansion of the progenitor pool. However, if their co-expression is 
      maintained experimentally, cell proliferation continues and differentiation is
      halted. Here we show that Hth+Tsh-induced tissue overgrowth requires the BMP2 Dpp
      and the abnormal hyperactivation of its pathway. Rather than using autocrine Dpp 
      expression, Hth+Tsh cells increase their avidity for Dpp, produced locally, by
      upregulating extracellular matrix components. During normal development, Dpp
      represses hth and tsh ensuring that the progenitor state is transient. However,
      cells in which Hth+Tsh expression is forcibly maintained use Dpp to enhance their
      proliferation.

      importance of differential expression for evolution of protein activity.

AB  - Vertebrate SoxE genes (Sox8, 9, and 10) are key regulators of neural crest cell
      (NCC) development. These genes arose by duplication from a single SoxE gene in
      the vertebrate ancestor. Although SoxE paralogs are coexpressed early in NCC
      development, later, Sox9 is restricted to skeletogenic lineages in the head, and 
      Sox10 to non-skeletogenic NCC in the trunk and head. When this
      subfunctionalization evolved and its possible role in the evolution of the neural
      crest are unknown. Sea lampreys are basal vertebrates that also possess three
      SoxE genes, while only a single SoxE is present in the cephalochordate amphioxus.
      In order to address the functional divergence of SoxE genes, and to determine if 
      differences in their biochemical functions may be linked to changes in neural
      crest developmental potential, we examined the ability of lamprey and amphioxus
      SoxE genes to regulate differentiation of NCC derivatives in zebrafish colourless
      (cls) mutants lacking expression of sox10. Our findings suggest that the
      proto-vertebrate SoxE gene possessed both melanogenic and neurogenic capabilities
      prior to SoxE gene duplication. Following the agnathan-gnathostome split, lamprey
      SoxE1 and SoxE3 largely lost their melanogenic and/or enteric neurogenic
      properties, while gnathostome SoxE paralogs have retained functional
      conservation. We posit that this difference in protein subfunctionalization is a 
      direct consequence of the independent regulation of SoxE paralog expression
      between the two lineages. Specifically, we propose that the overlapping
      expression of gnathostome SoxE paralogs in early neural crest largely constrained
      the function of gnathostome SoxE proteins. In contrast, the largely
      non-overlapping expression of lamprey SoxE paralogs allowed them to specialize
      with regard to their DNA-binding and/or protein interaction properties.
      Restriction of developmental potential among cranial and trunk neural crest in
      lampreys may be related to constraints on SoxE activity among duplicates, but
      such specialization does not appear to have occurred in gnathostomes. This
      highlights an important difference in the evolution of SoxE activity between
      these two divergent vertebrate lineages and provides insights for understanding
      how cell fate restriction in different NCC populations may be dependent on
      subfunctionalization among SoxE duplicates.

AB  - Cell fate specification during organogenesis is usually followed by a phase of
      cell proliferation to produce the required number of differentiated cells. The
      Caenorhabditis elegans vulva is an excellent model to study how cell fate
      specification and cell proliferation are coordinated. The six vulval precursor
      cells (VPCs) are born at the first larval stage, but they arrest in the G1 phase 
      of the cell cycle until the beginning of the third larval stage, when their fates
      are specified and the three proximal VPCs proliferate to generate 22 vulval
      cells. An epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal from the gonadal anchor cell
      combined with lateral DELTA/NOTCH signaling between the VPCs determine the
      primary (1 degrees ) and secondary (2 degrees ) fates, respectively. The hox gene
      lin-39 plays a key role in integrating these spatial patterning signals and in
      maintaining the VPCs as polarized epithelial cells. Using a fusion-defective
      eff-1(lf) mutation to keep the VPCs polarized, we find that VPCs lacking lin-39
      can neither activate lateral NOTCH signaling nor proliferate. LIN-39 promotes
      cell cycle progression through two distinct mechanisms. First, LIN-39 maintains
      the VPCs competent to proliferate by inducing cdk-4 cdk and cye-1 cyclinE
      expression via a non-canonical HOX binding motif. Second, LIN-39 activates in the
      adjacent VPCs the NOTCH signaling pathway, which promotes VPC proliferation
      independently of LIN-39. The hox gene lin-39 is therefore a central node in a
      regulatory network coordinating VPC differentiation and proliferation.

AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for elucidating the roles of genes in a
      wide variety of organisms including mice. To obtain genetically modified embryos 
      or mice by this method, Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA are usually introduced into zygotes
      by microinjection or electroporation. However, most mutants generated with this
      method are genetically mosaic, composed of several types of cells carrying
      different mutations, which complicates phenotype analysis in founder embryos or
      mice. To simplify the analysis and to elucidate the roles of genes involved in
      developmental processes, a method for producing non-mosaic mutants is needed.
      Here, we established a method for generating non-mosaic mouse mutant embryos. We 
      introduced Cas9 protein and sgRNA into in vitro fertilized (IVF) zygotes by
      electroporation, which enabled the genome editing to occur before the first
      replication of the mouse genome. As a result, all of the cells in the mutant
      carried the same set of mutations. This method solves the problem of
      mosaicism/allele complexity in founder mutant embryos or mice generated by the
      CRIPSR/Cas9 system.

AB  - The stepwise progression of common endoderm progenitors into differentiated liver
      and pancreas organs is regulated by a dynamic array of signals that are not well 
      understood. The nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 gene nr5a2, also 
      known as Liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) is expressed in several tissues
      including the developing liver and pancreas. Here, we interrogate the role of
      Nr5a2 at multiple developmental stages using genetic and chemical approaches and 
      uncover novel pleiotropic requirements during zebrafish liver and pancreas
      development. Zygotic loss of nr5a2 in a targeted genetic null mutant disrupted
      the development of the exocrine pancreas and liver, while leaving the endocrine
      pancreas intact. Loss of nr5a2 abrogated exocrine pancreas markers such as
      trypsin, while pancreas progenitors marked by ptf1a or pdx1 remained unaffected, 
      suggesting a role for Nr5a2 in regulating pancreatic acinar cell differentiation.
      In the developing liver, Nr5a2 regulates hepatic progenitor outgrowth and
      differentiation, as nr5a2 mutants exhibited reduced hepatoblast markers hnf4alpha
      and prox1 as well as differentiated hepatocyte marker fabp10a. Through the first 
      in vivo use of Nr5a2 chemical antagonist Cpd3, the iterative requirement for
      Nr5a2 for exocrine pancreas and liver differentiation was temporally elucidated: 
      chemical inhibition of Nr5a2 function during hepatopancreas progenitor
      specification was sufficient to disrupt exocrine pancreas formation and enhance
      the size of the embryonic liver, suggesting that Nr5a2 regulates hepatic vs.
      pancreatic progenitor fate choice. Chemical inhibition of Nr5a2 at a later time
      during pancreas and liver differentiation was sufficient to block the formation
      of mature acinar cells and hepatocytes. These findings define critical iterative 
      and pleiotropic roles for Nr5a2 at distinct stages of pancreas and liver
      organogenesis, and provide novel perspectives for interpreting the role of Nr5a2 
      in disease.

AB  - Regulation of final organ size is a complex developmental process that involves
      the integration of systemic and organ-specific processes. Previously, we have
      shown that in developing Drosophila, perturbing the growth of one imaginal disc -
      the parts of a holometabolous larva that become the external adult organs -
      retards growth of other discs and delays development, resulting in tight
      inter-organ growth coordination and the generation of a correctly proportioned
      adult. Whether different parts of the same imaginal disc similarly coordinate
      their growth to generate a functioning adult organ is, however, unclear. In this 
      study, we use the wing imaginal disc in Drosophila to study and identify
      mechanisms of intra-organ growth coordination. We generate larvae in which the
      two compartments of the wing imaginal disc have ostensibly different growth rates
      (wild-type or growth-perturbed). We find that there is tightly coordinated growth
      between the wild-type and growth-perturbed compartments, where growth of the
      wild-type compartment is retarded to match that of the growth-perturbed
      compartment. Crucially, this coordination is disrupted by application of
      exogenous 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which accelerates growth of the wild-type
      compartment. We further elucidate the role of 20E signaling in growth
      coordination by showing that in wild-type discs, compartment-autonomous
      up-regulation of 20E signaling accelerates compartment growth and disrupts
      coordination. Interestingly, growth acceleration through exogenous application of
      20E is inhibited with suppression of the Insulin/Insulin-like Growth Factor
      Signaling (IIS) pathway. This suggests that an active IIS pathway is necessary
      for ecdysone to accelerate compartment growth. Collectively, our data indicate
      that discs utilize systemic mechanisms, specifically ecdysone signaling, to
      coordinate intra-organ growth.

AB  - Nanos is a translational regulator required for the survival and maintenance of
      primordial germ cells. In the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp),
      Nanos 2 mRNA is broadly transcribed but accumulates specifically in the small
      micromere (sMic) lineage, in part because of the 3'UTR element GNARLE leads to
      turnover in somatic cells but retention in the sMics. Here we found that the
      Nanos 2 protein is also selectively stabilized; it is initially translated
      throughout the embryo but turned over in the future somatic cells and retained
      only in the sMics, the future germ line in this animal. This differential
      stability of Nanos protein is dependent on the open reading frame (ORF), and is
      independent of the sumoylation and ubiquitylation pathways. Manipulation of the
      ORF indicates that 68 amino acids in the N terminus of the Nanos protein are
      essential for its stability in the sMics whereas a 45 amino acid element adjacent
      to the zinc fingers targets its degradation. Further, this regulation of Nanos
      protein is cell autonomous, following formation of the germ line. These results
      are paradigmatic for the unique presence of Nanos in the germ line by a
      combination of selective RNA retention, distinctive translational control
      mechanisms (Oulhen et al., 2013), and now also by defined Nanos protein
      stability.

AB  - Generating the correct balance of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in a neural
      network is essential for normal functioning of a nervous system. The neural
      network in the dorsal spinal cord functions in somatosensation where it modulates
      and relays sensory information from the periphery. PTF1A is a key transcriptional
      regulator present in a specific subset of neural progenitor cells in the dorsal
      spinal cord, cerebellum and retina that functions to specify an inhibitory
      neuronal fate while suppressing excitatory neuronal fates. Thus, the regulation
      of Ptf1a expression is critical for determining mechanisms controlling neuronal
      diversity in these regions of the nervous system. Here we identify a sequence
      conserved, tissue-specific enhancer located 10.8kb 3' of the Ptf1a coding region 
      that is sufficient to direct expression to dorsal neural tube progenitors that
      give rise to neurons in the dorsal spinal cord in chick and mouse. DNA binding
      motifs for Paired homeodomain (Pd-HD) and zinc finger (ZF) transcription factors 
      are required for enhancer activity. Mutations in these sequences implicate the
      Pd-HD motif for activator function and the ZF motif for repressor function.
      Although no repressor transcription factor was identified, both PAX6 and SOX3 can
      increase enhancer activity in reporter assays. Thus, Ptf1a is regulated by active
      and repressive inputs integrated through multiple sequence elements within a
      highly conserved sequence downstream of the Ptf1a gene.

AB  - Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that acts via G
      protein-coupled receptors. The S1P receptor S1P1, encoded by S1pr1, is expressed 
      in developing heart but its roles there remain largely unexplored. Analysis of
      S1pr1 LacZ knockin embryos revealed beta-galactosidase staining in cardiomyocytes
      in the septum and in the trabecular layer of hearts collected at 12.5 days post
      coitus (dpc) and weak staining in the inner aspect of the compact layer at 15.5
      dpc and later. Nkx2-5-Cre- and Mlc2a-Cre-mediated conditional knockout of S1pr1
      led to ventricular noncompaction and ventricular septal defects at 18.5 dpc and
      to perinatal lethality in the majority of mutants. Further analysis of Mlc2a-Cre 
      conditional mutants revealed no gross phenotype at 12.5 dpc but absence of the
      normal increase in the number of cardiomyocytes and the thickness of the compact 
      layer at 13.5 dpc and after. Consistent with relative lack of a compact layer, in
      situ hybridization at 13.5 dpc revealed expression of trabecular markers
      extending almost to the epicardium in mutants. Mutant hearts also showed
      decreased myofibril organization in the compact but not trabecular myocardium at 
      12.5 dpc. These results suggest that S1P signaling via S1P1 in cardiomyocytes
      plays a previously unknown and necessary role in heart development in mice.

AB  - Abnormal development or disturbed functioning of the enteric nervous system
      (ENS), the intrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract, is associated
      with the development of neuropathic gastrointestinal motility disorders. Here, we
      review the underlying molecular basis of these disorders and hypothesize that
      many of them have a common defective biological mechanism. Genetic burden and
      environmental components affecting this common mechanism are ultimately
      responsible for disease severity and symptom heterogeneity. We believe that they 
      act together as the fulcrum in a seesaw balanced with harmful and protective
      factors, and are responsible for a continuum of symptoms ranging from neuronal
      hyperplasia to absence of neurons.

AB  - Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, intestinal aganglionosis) is a multigenic disorder
      with variable penetrance and severity that has a general population incidence of 
      1/5000 live births. Studies using animal models have contributed to our
      understanding of the developmental origins of HSCR and the genetic complexity of 
      this disease. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding control of 
      enteric nervous system (ENS) development through analyses in mouse models. An
      overview of signaling pathways that have long been known to control the
      migration, proliferation and differentiation of enteric neural progenitors into
      and along the developing gut is provided as a framework for the latest
      information on factors that influence enteric ganglia formation and maintenance. 
      Newly identified genes and additional factors beyond discrete genes that
      contribute to ENS pathology including regulatory sequences, miRNAs and
      environmental factors are also introduced. Finally, because HSCR has become a
      paradigm for complex oligogenic diseases with non-Mendelian inheritance, the
      importance of gene interactions, modifier genes, and initial studies on genetic
      background effects are outlined.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS), considered a separate branch of the autonomic
      nervous system, is located throughout the length of the gastrointestinal (GI)
      tract as a series of interconnected ganglionated plexi. Given the proximity of
      the intestinal microbiota to the ENS, it is perhaps not surprising that the gut
      microbiota can influence its development and function. However, these
      interactions are complex and may be either direct or indirect, often involving
      signalling initiated by microbe-derived components, metabolites or host-derived
      intermediaries which subsequently affect enteric nerve excitability and GI
      function. Individual microbes and strains can differentially influence ENS
      activity and neurochemistry. In this review we will briefly summarise the role of
      the microbiota on ENS development, and, in some more detail, explore the
      mechanisms by which the microbiota can influence ENS activity and function.

AB  - Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, OMIM 142623) is a neurocristopathy caused by a
      failure of the enteric nervous system (ENS) progenitors derived from neural crest
      cells (NCCs), to migrate, proliferate, differentiate or survive to and within the
      gastrointestinal tract, resulting in aganglionosis in the distal colon. The
      formation of the ENS is a complex process, which is regulated by a large range of
      molecules and signalling pathways involving both the NCCs and the intestinal
      environment. This tightly regulated process needs correct regulation of the
      expression of ENS specific genes. Alterations in the expression of these genes
      can have dramatic consequences. Several mechanisms that control the expression of
      genes have been described, such as DNA modification (epigenetic mechanisms),
      regulation of transcription (transcription factor, enhancers, repressors and
      silencers), post-transcriptional regulation (3'UTR and miRNAs) and regulation of 
      translation. In this review, we focus on the epigenetic DNA modifications that
      have been described so far in the context of the ENS development. Moreover we
      describe the changes that are found in relation to the onset of HSCR.

AB  - Co-ordinated gastrointestinal function is the result of integrated communication 
      between the enteric nervous system (ENS) and "effector" cells in the
      gastrointestinal tract. Unlike smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells, and the
      vast majority of cell types residing in the mucosa, enteric neurons and glia are 
      not generated within the gut. Instead, they arise from neural crest cells that
      migrate into and colonise the developing gastrointestinal tract. Although they
      are "later" arrivals into the developing gut, enteric neural crest-derived cells 
      (ENCCs) respond to many of the same secreted signalling molecules as the
      "resident" epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and several factors that control the
      development of smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells and epithelial cells also 
      regulate ENCCs. Much progress has been made towards understanding the migration
      of ENCCs along the gastrointestinal tract and their differentiation into neurons 
      and glia. However, our understanding of how enteric neurons begin to communicate 
      with each other and extend their neurites out of the developing plexus layers to 
      innervate the various cell types lining the concentric layers of the
      gastrointestinal tract is only beginning. It is critical for postpartum survival 
      that the gastrointestinal tract and its enteric circuitry are sufficiently mature
      to cope with the influx of nutrients and their absorption that occurs shortly
      after birth. Subsequently, colonisation of the gut by immune cells and microbiota
      during postnatal development has an important impact that determines the ultimate
      outline of the intrinsic neural networks of the gut. In this review, we describe 
      the integrated development of the ENS and its target cells.

AB  - Our current understanding of the developmental biology of the enteric nervous
      system (ENS) and the genesis of ENS diseases is founded almost entirely on
      studies using model systems. Although genetic studies in the mouse have been at
      the forefront of this field over the last 20 years or so, historically it was the
      easy accessibility of the chick embryo for experimental manipulations that
      allowed the first descriptions of the neural crest origins of the ENS in the
      1950s. More recently, studies in the chick and other non-mammalian model systems,
      notably zebrafish, have continued to advance our understanding of the basic
      biology of ENS development, with each animal model providing unique experimental 
      advantages. Here we review the basic biology of ENS development in chick and
      zebrafish, highlighting conserved and unique features, and emphasising novel
      contributions to our general understanding of ENS development due to technical or
      biological features.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is innervated by intrinsic enteric neurons and by
      extrinsic efferent and afferent nerves. The enteric (intrinsic) nervous system
      (ENS) in most regions of the gut consists of two main ganglionated layers;
      myenteric and submucosal ganglia, containing numerous types of enteric neurons
      and glial cells. Axons arising from the ENS and from extrinsic neurons innervate 
      most layers of the gut wall and regulate many gut functions. The majority of ENS 
      cells are derived from vagal neural crest cells (NCCs), which proliferate,
      colonize the entire gut, and first populate the myenteric region. After gut
      colonization by vagal NCCs, the extrinsic nerve fibers reach the GI tract, and
      Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) enter the gut along the extrinsic nerves.
      Furthermore, a subpopulation of cells in myenteric ganglia undergoes a radial
      (inward) migration to form the submucosal plexus, and the intrinsic and extrinsic
      innervation to the mucosal region develops. Here, we focus on recent progress in 
      understanding the developmental processes that occur after the gut is colonized
      by vagal ENS precursors, and provide an up-to-date overview of molecular
      mechanisms regulating the development of the intrinsic and extrinsic innervation 
      of the GI tract.

AB  - Over the last 20 years, there has been increasing focus on the development of
      novel stem cell based therapies for the treatment of disorders and diseases
      affecting the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal tract
      (so-called enteric neuropathies). Here, the idea is that ENS progenitor/stem
      cells could be transplanted into the gut wall to replace the damaged or absent
      neurons and glia of the ENS. This White Paper sets out experts' views on the
      commonly used methods and approaches to identify, isolate, purify, expand and
      optimize ENS stem cells, transplant them into the bowel, and assess transplant
      success, including restoration of gut function. We also highlight obstacles that 
      must be overcome in order to progress from successful preclinical studies in
      animal models to ENS stem cell therapies in the clinic.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) is involved in the regulation of virtually all
      gut functions. Conditions referred to as enteric neuropathies are the result of
      various mechanisms including abnormal development, degeneration or loss of
      enteric neurons that affect the structure and functional integrity of the ENS. In
      the past decade, clinical and molecular research has led to important conceptual 
      advances in our knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these disorders. In
      this review we consider ENS disorders from a clinical perspective and highlight
      the advancing knowledge regarding their pathophysiology. We also review current
      therapies for these diseases and present potential novel reparative approaches
      for their treatment.

AB  - Intestinal function is primarily controlled by an intrinsic nervous system of the
      bowel called the enteric nervous system (ENS). The cells of the ENS are neural
      crest derivatives that migrate into and through the bowel during early stages of 
      organogenesis before differentiating into a wide variety of neurons and glia.
      Although genetic factors critically underlie ENS development, it is now clear
      that many non-genetic factors may influence the number of enteric neurons, types 
      of enteric neurons, and ratio of neurons to glia. These non-genetic influences
      include dietary nutrients and medicines that may impact ENS structure and
      function before or after birth. This review summarizes current data about
      gene-environment interactions that affect ENS development and suggests that these
      factors may contribute to human intestinal motility disorders like Hirschsprung
      disease or irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - In contrast with Drosophila melanogaster, practically nothing is known about the 
      involvement of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in the metamorphosis of
      hemimetabolan insects. To partially fill this gap, we have studied the role of
      Smad factors in the metamorphosis of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica.
      In D. melanogaster, Mad is the canonical R-Smad of the BMP branch of the TGF-beta
      signaling pathway, Smox is the canonical R-Smad of the TGF-beta/Activin branch
      and Medea participates in both branches. In insects, metamorphosis is regulated
      by the MEKRE93 pathway, which starts with juvenile hormone (JH), whose signal is 
      transduced by Methoprene-tolerant (Met), which stimulates the expression of
      Kruppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) that acts to repress E93, the metamorphosis trigger. In
      B. germanica, metamorphosis is determined at the beginning of the sixth (final)
      nymphal instar (N6), when JH production ceases, the expression of Kr-h1 declines,
      and the transcription of E93 begins to increase. The RNAi of Mad, Smox and Medea 
      in N6 of B. germanica reveals that the BMP branch of the TGF-beta signaling
      pathway regulates adult ecdysis and wing extension, mainly through regulating the
      expression of bursicon, whereas the TGF-beta/Activin branch contributes to
      increasing E93 and decreasing Kr-h1 at the beginning of N6, crucial for
      triggering adult morphogenesis, as well as to regulating the imaginal molt
      timing.

AB  - Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are a highly migratory cell population that gives
      rise to eggs and sperm. Much is known about PGC specification, but less about the
      processes that control PGC migration. In this study, we document a deficiency in 
      PGC development in embryos carrying global homozygous null mutations in Msx1 and 
      Msx2, both immediate downstream effectors of Bmp signaling pathway. We show that 
      Msx1(-/-);Msx2(-/-) mutant embryos have defects in PGC migration as well as a
      reduced number of PGCs. These phenotypes are also evident in a Mesp1-Cre-mediated
      mesoderm-specific mutant line of Msx1 and Msx2. Since PGCs are not marked in
      Mesp1-lineage tracing, our results suggest that Msx1 and Msx2 function cell
      non-autonomously in directing PGC migration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we 
      noted an upregulation of fibronectin, well known as a mediator of cell migration,
      in tissues through which PGCs migrate. We also noted a reduction in the
      expression of Wnt5a and an increase in the expression in Bmp4 in such tissues in 
      Msx1(-/-);Msx2(-/-) mutants, both known effectors of PGC development.

AB  - Urodele amphibians have a remarkable organ regeneration ability that is regulated
      by neural inputs. The identification of these neural inputs has been a challenge.
      Recently, Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and Bone morphogenic protein (Bmp) were 
      shown to substitute for nerve functions in limb and tail regeneration in urodele 
      amphibians. However, direct evidence of Fgf and Bmp being secreted from nerve
      endings and regulating regeneration has not yet been shown. Thus, it remained
      uncertain whether they were the nerve factors responsible for successful limb
      regeneration. To gather experimental evidence, the technical difficulties
      involved in the usage of axolotls had to be overcome. We achieved this by
      modifying the electroporation method. When Fgf8-AcGFP or Bmp7-AcGFP was
      electroporated into the axolotl dorsal root ganglia (DRG), GFP signals were
      detectable in the regenerating limb region. This suggested that Fgf8 and Bmp7
      synthesized in neural cells in the DRG were delivered to the limbs through the
      long axons. Further knockdown experiments with double-stranded RNA interference
      resulted in impaired limb regeneration ability. These results strongly suggest
      that Fgf and Bmp are the major neural inputs that control the organ regeneration 
      ability.

AB  - A transposon-mediated gene trap screen identified the zebrafish line qmc551 that 
      expresses a GFP reporter in primitive erythrocytes and also in haemogenic
      endothelial cells, which give rise to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
      (HSPCs) that seed sites of larval and adult haematopoiesis. The transposon that
      mediates this GFP expression is located in intron 1 of the gfi1aa gene, one of
      three zebrafish paralogs that encode transcriptional repressors homologous to
      mammalian Gfi1 and Gfi1b proteins. In qmc551 transgenics, GFP expression is under
      the control of the endogenous gfi1aa promoter, recapitulates early gfi1aa
      expression and allows live observation of gfi1aa promoter activity. While the
      transposon integration interferes with the expression of gfi1aa mRNA in
      haematopoietic cells, homozygous qmc551 fish are viable and fertile, and display 
      normal primitive and definitive haematopoiesis. Retained expression of Gfi1b in
      primitive erythrocytes and up-regulation of Gfi1ab at the onset of definitive
      haematopoiesis in homozygous qmc551 carriers, are sufficient to allow normal
      haematopoiesis. This finding contradicts previously published morpholino data
      that suggested an essential role for zebrafish Gfi1aa in primitive
      erythropoiesis.

AB  - Double strand breaks (DSBs) are highly damaging DNA lesions that can destabilize 
      the genome and generate a suite of adverse physiological outcomes in the oocyte
      and early embryo. While it is therefore likely that these cells possess a
      sophisticated suite of protective mechanisms to ameliorate such damage, the
      precise nature of these defense systems are yet to be fully elucidated. This
      study characterizes the sensitivity of the oocyte to etoposide, a
      chemotherapeutic agent with the ability to elicit DSBs. We demonstrate
      significant developmental changes in etoposide vulnerability, with fertilization 
      of the oocyte leading to an enhancement of its cellular defense machinery. Using 
      a parthenogenic model we show that this response is mediated, at least in part,
      by permeability glycoprotein (PGP), an endogenous multidrug efflux transporter
      that is up-regulated, translocated to the oolemma and phosphorylated upon oocyte 
      activation. Moreover, evidence from dye exclusion assays in the presence of a
      specific PGP pharmacological inhibitor (PSC833), illustrates that these events
      effectively increase oocyte efflux activity, thereby enhancing the ability of
      these cells to exclude genotoxicants capable of eliciting DSB formation.

AB  - The skull is essential for protecting the brain from damage, and birth defects
      involving disorganization of skull bones are common. However, the developmental
      trajectories and molecular etiologies by which many craniofacial phenotypes arise
      remain poorly understood. Here, we report a novel skull defect in ciliopathic Fuz
      mutant mice in which only a single bone pair encases the forebrain, instead of
      the usual paired frontal and parietal bones. Through genetic lineage analysis, we
      show that this defect stems from a massive expansion of the neural crest-derived 
      frontal bone. This expansion occurs at the expense of the mesodermally-derived
      parietal bones, which are either severely reduced or absent. A similar, though
      less severe, phenotype was observed in Gli3 mutant mice, consistent with a role
      for Gli3 in cilia-mediated signaling. Excess crest has also been shown to drive
      defective palate morphogenesis in ciliopathic mice, and that defect is
      ameliorated by reduction of Fgf8 gene dosage. Strikingly, skull defects in Fuz
      mutant mice are also rescued by loss of one allele of fgf8, suggesting a
      potential route to therapy. In sum, this work is significant for revealing a
      novel skull defect with a previously un-described developmental etiology and for 
      suggesting a common developmental origin for skull and palate defects in
      ciliopathies.

AB  - The caudal migration of facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons from rhombomere (r) 4 
      to r6 in the hindbrain is an excellent model to study neuronal migration
      mechanisms. Although several Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) components are
      required for FBM neuron migration, only Celsr1, an atypical cadherin, regulates
      the direction of migration in mice. In Celsr1 mutants, a subset of FBM neurons
      migrates rostrally instead of caudally. Interestingly, Celsr1 is not expressed in
      the migrating FBM neurons, but rather in the adjacent floor plate and adjoining
      ventricular zone. To evaluate the contribution of different expression domains to
      neuronal migration, we conditionally inactivated Celsr1 in specific cell types.
      Intriguingly, inactivation of Celsr1 in the ventricular zone of r3-r5, but not in
      the floor plate, leads to rostral migration of FBM neurons, greatly resembling
      the migration defect of Celsr1 mutants. Dye fill experiments indicate that the
      rostrally-migrated FBM neurons in Celsr1 mutants originate from the anterior
      margin of r4. These data suggest strongly that Celsr1 ensures that FBM neurons
      migrate caudally by suppressing molecular cues in the rostral hindbrain that can 
      attract FBM neurons.

AB  - The mechanisms that modulate and limit the signaling output of adult stem cell
      niches remain poorly understood. To gain further insights into how these
      microenvironments are regulated in vivo, we performed a candidate gene screen
      designed to identify factors that restrict BMP signal production to the cap cells
      that comprise the germline stem cell (GSC) niche of Drosophila ovaries. Through
      these efforts, we found that disruption of Wnt4 and components of the canonical
      Wnt pathway results in a complex germ cell phenotype marked by an expansion of
      GSC-like cells, pre-cystoblasts and cystoblasts in young females. This phenotype 
      correlates with an increase of decapentaplegic (dpp) mRNA levels within escort
      cells and varying levels of BMP responsiveness in the germline. Further genetic
      experiments show that Wnt4, which exhibits graded expression in somatic cells of 
      germaria, activates the Wnt pathway in posteriorly positioned escort cells. The
      activation of the Wnt pathway appears to be limited by the BMP pathway itself, as
      loss of Mad in escort cells results in the expansion of Wnt pathway activation.
      Wnt pathway activity changes within germaria during the course of aging,
      coincident with changes in dpp production. These data suggest that mutual
      antagonism between the BMP and Wnt pathways in somatic cells helps to regulate
      germ cell differentiation.

AB  - Canonical Wnt signaling plays a dominant role in the development of the neural
      crest (NC), a highly migratory cell population that generates a vast array of
      cell types. Canonical Wnt signaling is required for NC induction as well as
      differentiation, however its role in NC migration remains largely unknown.
      Analyzing nuclear localization of beta-catenin as readout for canonical Wnt
      activity, we detect nuclear beta-catenin in premigratory but not migratory
      Xenopus NC cells suggesting that canonical Wnt activity has to decrease to basal 
      levels to enable NC migration. To define a possible function of canonical Wnt
      signaling in Xenopus NC migration, canonical Wnt signaling was modulated at
      different time points after NC induction. This was accomplished using either
      chemical modulators affecting beta-catenin stability or inducible glucocorticoid 
      fusion constructs of Lef/Tcf transcription factors. In vivo analysis of NC
      migration by whole mount in situ hybridization demonstrates that ectopic
      activation of canonical Wnt signaling inhibits cranial NC migration. Further, NC 
      transplantation experiments confirm that this effect is tissue-autonomous. In
      addition, live-cell imaging in combination with biophysical data analysis of
      explanted NC cells confirms the in vivo findings and demonstrates that modulation
      of canonical Wnt signaling affects the ability of NC cells to perform single cell
      migration. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that canonical Wnt signaling
      needs to be tightly controlled to enable migration of NC cells.

AB  - The fin-to-limb transition is an important evolutionary step in the colonization 
      of land and diversification of all terrestrial vertebrates. We previously
      identified a gene family in zebrafish, termed actinodin, which codes for
      structural proteins crucial for the formation of actinotrichia, rigid fibrils of 
      the teleost fin. Interestingly, this gene family is absent from all tetrapod
      genomes examined to date, suggesting that it was lost during limb evolution. To
      shed light on the disappearance of this gene family, and the consequences on
      fin-to-limb transition, we characterized actinodin regulatory elements. Using
      fluorescent reporters in transgenic zebrafish, we identified tissue-specific
      cis-acting regulatory elements responsible for actinodin1 (and1) expression in
      the ectodermal and mesenchymal cell populations of the fins, respectively.
      Mutagenesis of potential transcription factor binding sites led to the
      identification of one binding site crucial for and1 expression in ectodermal
      cells. We show that these regulatory elements are partially functional in mouse
      limb buds in a tissue-specific manner. Indeed, the zebrafish regulatory elements 
      target expression to the dorsal and ventral ectoderm of mouse limb buds. Absence 
      of expression in the apical ectodermal ridge is observed in both mouse and
      zebrafish. However, cells of the mouse limb bud mesoderm do not express the
      transgene, in contrast to zebrafish. Altogether these results hint for a change
      in regulation of and1 during evolution that led to the downregulation and
      eventual loss of this gene from tetrapod genomes.

AB  - Unlike in mammals, persistent postembryonic retinal growth is a characteristic
      feature of fish, which includes major remodeling events that affect all cell
      types including photoreceptors. Consequently, visual capabilities change during
      development, where retinal sensitivity to different wavelengths of light
      (photopic vision), -and to limited photons (scotopic vision) are central
      capabilities for survival. Differently from well-established model fish, Atlantic
      cod has a prolonged larval stage where only cone photoreceptors are present. Rods
      do not appear until juvenile transition (metamorphosis), a hallmark of indirect
      developing species. Previously we showed that whole gene families of lws
      (red-sensitive) and sws1 (UV-sensitive) opsins have been lost in cod, while rh2a 
      (green-sensitive) and sws2 (blue-sensitive) genes have tandem duplicated. Here,
      we provide a comprehensive characterization of a two-step developing duplex
      retina in Atlantic cod. The study focuses on cone subtype dynamics and delayed
      rod neurogenesis and differentiation in all cod life stages. Using transcriptomic
      and histological approaches we show that different opsins disappear in a
      topographic manner during development where central to peripheral retina is a key
      axis of expressional change. Early cone differentiation was initiated in
      dorso-temporal retina different from previously described in fish. Rods first
      appeared during initiation of metamorphosis and expression of the nuclear
      receptor transcription factor nr2e3-1, suggest involvement in rod specification. 
      The indirect developmental strategy thus allows for separate studies of cones and
      rods development, which in nature correlates with visual changes linked to
      habitat shifts. The clustering of key retinal genes according to life stage,
      suggests that Atlantic cod with its sequenced genome may be an important resource
      for identification of underlying factors required for development and function of
      photopic and scotopic vision.

AB  - Dictyostelium morphogenesis requires the tip, which acts as an organizer and
      conducts orchestrated cell movement and cell differentiation. At the slug stage
      the tip region contains prestalk A (pstA) cells, which are usually recognized by 
      their expression of reporter constructs that utilize a fragment of the promoter
      of the ecmA gene. Here, using the promoter region of the o-methyl transferase 12 
      gene (omt12) to drive reporter expression, we demonstrate the presence, also
      within the pstA region, of a novel prestalk cell subtype: the pstV(A) cells.
      Surprisingly, a sub-population of the vegetative cells express a pstV(A): GFP
      marker and, sort out to the tip, both when developing alone and when co-developed
      with an excess of unmarked cells. The development of such a purified GFP-marked
      population is greatly accelerated: by precocious cell aggregation and tip
      formation with accompanying precocious elevation of developmental gene
      transcription. We therefore suggest that the tip contains at least two prestalk
      cell subtypes: the developmentally-specified pstA cells and the lineage-primed
      pstV(A) cells. It is presumably the pstV(A) cells that play the dominant role in 
      morphogenesis during the earlier stages of development. The basis for the lineage
      priming is, however, unclear because we can find no correlation between pstV(A)
      differentiation and nutrient status during growth or cell cycle position at the
      time of starvation, the two known determinants of probable cell fate.

      shown to be important in stem cells and tumour cells, but its role in the whole
      animal is only now being fully explored. Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a
      multipotent population of cells that migrate during early development from the
      dorsal neural tube throughout the embryo where they differentiate into a variety 
      of cell types including pigment cells, cranio-facial skeleton and sensory
      neurons. Specification of NCCs is both spatially and temporally regulated during 
      embryonic development. Here we show that components of the transcriptional
      elongation regulatory machinery, CDK9 and CYCLINT1 of the P-TEFb complex, are
      required to regulate neural crest specification. In particular, we show that
      expression of the proto-oncogene c-Myc and c-Myc responsive genes are affected.
      Our data suggest that P-TEFb is crucial to drive expression of c-Myc, which acts 
      as a 'gate-keeper' for the correct temporal and spatial development of the neural
      crest.

AB  - The embryonic brain and spinal cord initially form through the process of neural 
      tube closure (NTC). NTC is thought to be highly similar between rodents and
      humans, and studies of mouse genetic mutants have greatly increased our
      understanding of the molecular basis of NTC with relevance for human neural tube 
      defects. In addition, studies using amphibian and chick embryos have shed light
      into the cellular and tissue dynamics underlying NTC. However, the dynamics of
      mammalian NTC has been difficult to study due to in utero development until
      recently when advances in mouse embryo ex vivo culture techniques along with
      confocal microscopy have allowed for imaging of mouse NTC in real time. Here, we 
      have performed live imaging of mouse embryos with a particular focus on the
      non-neural ectoderm (NNE). Previous studies in multiple model systems have found 
      that the NNE is important for proper NTC, but little is known about the behavior 
      of these cells during mammalian NTC. Here we utilized a NNE-specific genetic
      labeling system to assess NNE dynamics during murine NTC and identified different
      NNE cell behaviors as the cranial region undergoes NTC. These results bring
      valuable new insight into regional differences in cellular behavior during NTC
      that may be driven by different molecular regulators and which may underlie the
      various positional disruptions of NTC observed in humans with neural tube
      defects.

AB  - Changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlie the evolution of
      morphological novelty and developmental system drift. The fruitfly Drosophila
      melanogaster and the dengue and Zika vector mosquito Aedes aegypti have
      substantially similar nervous system morphology. Nevertheless, they show
      significant divergence in a set of genes co-expressed in the midline of the
      Drosophila central nervous system, including the master regulator single minded
      and downstream genes including short gastrulation, Star, and NetrinA. In contrast
      to Drosophila, we find that midline expression of these genes is either absent or
      severely diminished in A. aegypti. Instead, they are co-expressed in the lateral 
      nervous system. This suggests that in A. aegypti this "midline GRN" has been
      redeployed to a new location while lost from its previous site of activity. In
      order to characterize the relevant GRNs, we employed the SCRMshaw method we
      previously developed to identify transcriptional cis-regulatory modules in both
      species. Analysis of these regulatory sequences in transgenic Drosophila suggests
      that the altered gene expression observed in A. aegypti is the result of
      trans-dependent redeployment of the GRN, potentially stemming from cis-mediated
      changes in the expression of sim and other as-yet unidentified regulators. Our
      results illustrate a novel "repeal, replace, and redeploy" mode of evolution in
      which a conserved GRN acquires a different function at a new site while its
      original function is co-opted by a different GRN. This represents a striking
      example of developmental system drift in which the dramatic shift in gene
      expression does not result in gross morphological changes, but in more subtle
      differences in development and function of the late embryonic nervous system.

AB  - Spatial polarity cues in animals are used repeatedly during development for many 
      processes, including cell fate determination, cell migration, and axon guidance. 
      In Caenorhabditis elegans, the body wall muscle extends the length of the animal 
      in four distinct quadrants and generates an UNC-129/TGF-beta-related signal that 
      is much higher in the dorsal two muscle quadrants compared to their ventral
      counterparts. This pattern of unc-129 expression requires the activity of the
      proposed transcriptional repressor UNC-130/FOXD whose body wall muscle activity
      is restricted to the ventral two body wall muscle quadrants. To understand how
      these dorsal-ventral differences in UNC-130 activity are established and
      maintained, we have analyzed the regulation of unc-130 expression and the
      distribution of UNC-130 protein. We have identified widespread, cis-acting
      elements in the unc-130 promoter that function to positively regulate ventral
      body wall muscle expression and negatively regulate dorsal body wall muscle
      expression. We have defined the temporal distribution of UNC-130 protein in body 
      wall muscle cells during embryogenesis, demonstrated that this pattern is
      required to establish the dorsal-ventral polarity of UNC-129/TGF-beta, and shown 
      that UNC-130 is not required post-embryonically to maintain the asymmetry of body
      wall muscle unc-129 expression. Finally, we have tested the impact of the
      depletion of a variety of transcription factors, repressors, and signaling
      molecules to identify additional regulators of body wall muscle UNC-130 polarity.
      Our results confirm and extend earlier studies to clarify the mechanisms by which
      UNC-130 is controlled and affects the pattern of unc-129 expression in body wall 
      muscle. These results further our understanding of the transcriptional logic
      behind the generation of polarity cues involving this poorly understood subclass 
      of Forkhead factors.

AB  - The inhibitory mechanisms that prevent gene expression programs from one tissue
      to be expressed in another are poorly understood. Foxp1/2/4 are forkhead
      transcription factors that repress gene expression and are individually important
      for endoderm development. We show that combined loss of all three Foxp1/2/4
      family members in the developing anterior foregut endoderm leads to a loss of
      lung endoderm lineage commitment and subsequent development. Foxp1/2/4 deficient 
      lungs express high levels of transcriptional regulators not normally expressed in
      the developing lung, including Pax2, Pax8, Pax9 and the Hoxa9-13 cluster. Ectopic
      expression of these transcriptional regulators is accompanied by decreased
      expression of lung restricted transcription factors including Nkx2-1, Sox2, and
      Sox9. Foxp1 binds to conserved forkhead DNA binding sites within the Hoxa9-13
      cluster, indicating a direct repression mechanism. Thus, Foxp1/2/4 are essential 
      for promoting lung endoderm development by repressing expression of non-pulmonary
      transcription factors.

AB  - The vertebrate eye forms via a complex set of morphogenetic events. The optic
      vesicle evaginates and undergoes transformative shape changes to form the optic
      cup, in which neural retina and retinal pigmented epithelium enwrap the lens. It 
      has long been known that a complex, glycoprotein-rich extracellular matrix layer 
      surrounds the developing optic cup throughout the process, yet the functions of
      the matrix and its specific molecular components have remained unclear. Previous 
      work established a role for laminin extracellular matrix in particular steps of
      eye development, including optic vesicle evagination, lens differentiation, and
      retinal ganglion cell polarization, yet it is unknown what role laminin might
      play in the early process of optic cup formation subsequent to the initial step
      of optic vesicle evagination. Here, we use the zebrafish lama1 mutant
      (lama1(UW1)) to determine the function of laminin during optic cup morphogenesis.
      Using live imaging, we find, surprisingly, that loss of laminin leads to
      divergent effects on focal adhesion assembly in a spatiotemporally-specific
      manner, and that laminin is required for multiple steps of optic cup
      morphogenesis, including optic stalk constriction, invagination, and formation of
      a spherical lens. Laminin is not required for single cell behaviors and changes
      in cell shape. Rather, in lama1(UW1) mutants, loss of epithelial polarity and
      altered adhesion lead to defective tissue architecture and formation of a
      disorganized retina. These results demonstrate that the laminin extracellular
      matrix plays multiple critical roles regulating adhesion and polarity to
      establish and maintain tissue structure during optic cup morphogenesis.

AB  - The Drosophila larval ovary morphogenesis mainly involves coordinated development
      of somatic and germ cell lineages that is essential for forming a correct number 
      of niche-germline stem cell (GSC) units (ovarioles) in the adult ovary. Ecdysone,
      Insulin, Activin, Dpp and EGFR signaling pathways form a regulatory network that 
      orchestrates ovarian soma and germ line throughout larval development.
      Identification and characterization of additional genes or machineries involved
      in this process will provide more insights into the underlying mechanisms. Here, 
      we show that the core microRNA (miRNA) pathway components Drosha and Pasha are
      required for coordinated development of somatic and germ cell precursors in the
      larval ovary. Drosha or pasha mutants display defective proliferation of
      primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of GSCs prior to late third larval
      instar (LL3) and promoted PGC differentiation at LL3. In the mean time, loss of
      Drosha or Pasha function perturbs somatic precursor development, causing defects 
      in formation of terminal filaments (TFs), a major composition of the GSC niche at
      LL3, as well as in TF precursor accumulation at early larval stages. Comparative 
      analysis of the mutant phenotypes reveals that three other key miRNA pathway
      components, Dicer-1 (Dcr-1), Loquacious (Loqs) and Argonaute-1 (Ago-1) have
      similar effects as Drosha and Pasha indicated above, suggesting a role of the
      canonical miRNA pathway in the ovary development. Furthermore, genome-wide
      screening and genetic studies identify a set of Drosha-controlled miRNAs
      including miR-8, miR-14, miR-33, miR-184, miR-317 and let-7-C that function in
      this gonadogenesis. Taken together, this study provides the first ever
      demonstration that miRNA-mediated regulation is involved in the Drosophila larval
      ovary morphogenesis.

AB  - Proliferating intestinal stem cells (ISCs) generate all cell types of the
      Drosophila midgut, including enterocytes, endocrine cells, and gland cells (e.g.,
      copper cells), throughout the lifetime of the animal. Among the signaling
      mechanisms controlling the balance between ISC self-renewal and the production of
      different cell types, Notch (N) plays a pivotal role. In this paper we
      investigated the emergence of ISCs during metamorphosis and the role of N in this
      process. Precursors of the Drosophila adult intestinal stem cells (pISCs) can be 
      first detected within the pupal midgut during the first hours after onset of
      metamorphosis as motile mesenchymal cells. pISCs perform 2-3 rounds of
      parasynchronous divisions. The first mitosis yields only an increase in pISC
      number. During the following rounds of mitosis, dividing pISCs give rise to more 
      pISCs, as well as the endocrine cells that populate the midgut of the eclosing
      fly. Enterocytes do not appear among the pISC progeny until around the time of
      eclosion. The "proendocrine" gene prospero (pros), expressed from mid-pupal
      stages onward in pISCs, is responsible to advance the endocrine fate in these
      cells; following removal of pros, pISCs continue to proliferate, but endocrine
      cells do not form. Conversely, the onset of N activity that occurs around the
      stage when pros comes on restricts pros expression among pISCs. Loss of N
      abrogates proliferation and switches on an endocrine fate among all pISCs. Our
      results suggest that a switch depending on the activity of N and pros acts at the
      level of the pISC to decide between continued proliferation and endocrine
      differentiation.

AB  - Adprhl1, a member of the ADP-ribosylhydrolase protein family, is expressed
      exclusively in the developing heart of all vertebrates. In the amphibian Xenopus 
      laevis, distribution of its mRNA is biased towards actively growing chamber
      myocardium. Morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of all Adprhl1 variants
      inhibits striated myofibril assembly and prevents outgrowth of the ventricle. The
      resulting ventricles retain normal electrical conduction and express markers of
      chamber muscle differentiation but are functionally inert. Using a
      cardiac-specific Gal4 binary expression system, we show that the abundance of
      Adprhl1 protein in tadpole hearts is tightly controlled through a negative
      regulatory mechanism targeting the 5'-coding sequence of Xenopus adprhl1.
      Over-expression of full length (40kDa) Adprhl1 variants modified to escape such
      repression, also disrupts cardiac myofibrillogenesis. Disarrayed myofibrils
      persist that show extensive branching, with sarcomere division occurring at the
      actin-Z-disc boundary. Ultimately, Adprhl1-positive cells contain thin actin
      threads, connected to numerous circular branch points. Recombinant Adprhl1 can
      localize to stripes adjacent to the Z-disc, suggesting a direct role for Adprhl1 
      in modifying Z-disc and actin dynamics as heart chambers grow. Modelling the
      structure of Adprhl1 suggests this cardiac-specific protein is a pseudoenzyme,
      lacking key residues necessary for ADP-ribosylhydrolase catalytic activity.

AB  - The Mexican Axolotl is one of the few tetrapod species that is capable of
      regenerating complete skeletal elements in injured adult limbs. Whether the
      skeleton (bone and cartilage) plays a role in the patterning and contribution to 
      the skeletal regenerate is currently unresolved. We tested the induction of
      pattern formation, the effect on cell proliferation, and contributions of
      skeletal tissues (cartilage, bone, and periosteum) to the regenerating axolotl
      limb. We found that bone tissue grafts from transgenic donors expressing GFP fail
      to induce pattern formation and do not contribute to the newly regenerated
      skeleton. Periosteum tissue grafts, on the other hand, have both of these
      activities. These observations reveal that skeletal tissue does not contribute to
      the regeneration of skeletal elements; rather, these structures are patterned by 
      and derived from cells of non-skeletal connective tissue origin.

AB  - Polarized epithelia define boundaries, spaces, and cavities within organisms.
      Cavitation, a process by which multicellular hollow balls or tubes are produced, 
      is typically associated with the formation of organized epithelia. In order for
      these epithelial layers to form, cells must ultimately establish a distinct
      apical-basal polarity. Atypical PKCs have been proposed to be required for
      apical-basal polarity in diverse species. Here we show that while cells null for 
      the Prkci isozyme exhibit some polarity characteristics, they fail to properly
      segregate apical-basal proteins, form a coordinated ectodermal epithelium, or
      participate in normal cavitation. A failure to cavitate could be due to an
      overgrowth of interior cells or to an inability of interior cells to die. Null
      cells however, do not have a marked change in proliferation rate and are still
      capable of undergoing cell death, suggesting that alterations in these processes 
      are not the predominant cause of the failed cavitation. Overexpression of BMP4 or
      EZRIN can partially rescue the phenotype possibly by promoting cell death,
      polarity, and differentiation. However, neither is sufficient to provide the
      required cues to generate a polarized epithelium and fully rescue cavitation.
      Interestingly, when wildtype and Prkci(-/-) ES cells are mixed together, a
      polarized ectodermal epithelium forms and cavitation is rescued, likely due to
      the ability of wildtype cells to produce non-autonomous polarity cues. We
      conclude that Prkci is not required for cells to respond to these cues, though it
      is required to produce them. Together these findings indicate that environmental 
      cues can facilitate the formation of polarized epithelia and that cavitation
      requires the proper coordination of multiple basic cellular processes including
      proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and apical-basal polarization.

AB  - Developmental transitions include molting in some invertebrates and the
      metamorphosis of insects and amphibians. While the study of Caenorhabditis
      elegans larval transitions was crucial to determine the genetic control of these 
      transitions, Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis have been classic models 
      to study the role of hormones in metamorphosis. Here we review how heterochronic 
      genes (lin-4, let-7, lin-28, lin-41), hormones (dafachronic acid, ecdysone,
      thyroid hormone) and the environment regulate developmental transitions. Recent
      evidence suggests that some heterochronic genes also regulate transitions in
      higher organisms that they are controlled by hormones involved in metamorphosis. 
      We also discuss evidence demonstrating that heterochronic genes and hormones
      regulate the proliferation and differentiation of embryonic and neural stem
      cells. We propose the hypothesis that developmental transitions are regulated by 
      an evolutionary conserved mechanism in which heterochronic genes and hormones
      interact to control stem/progenitor cells proliferation, cell cycle exit,
      quiescence and differentiation and determine the proper timing of developmental
      transitions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these studies to understand
      post-embryonic development, puberty and regeneration in humans.

TI  - Mutations in zebrafish pitx2 model congenital malformations in Axenfeld-Rieger
      syndrome but do not disrupt left-right placement of visceral organs.

AB  - Pitx2 is a conserved homeodomain transcription factor that has multiple functions
      during embryonic development. Mutations in human PITX2 cause autosomal dominant
      Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS), characterized by congenital eye and tooth
      malformations. Pitx2(-/-) knockout mouse models recapitulate aspects of ARS, but 
      are embryonic lethal. To date, ARS treatments remain limited to managing
      individual symptoms due to an incomplete understanding of PITX2 function. In
      addition to regulating eye and tooth development, Pitx2 is a target of a
      conserved Nodal (TGFbeta) signaling pathway that mediates left-right (LR)
      asymmetry of visceral organs. Based on its highly conserved asymmetric expression
      domain, the Nodal-Pitx2 axis has long been considered a common denominator of LR 
      development in vertebrate embryos. However, functions of Pitx2 during asymmetric 
      organ morphogenesis are not well understood. To gain new insight into Pitx2
      function we used genome editing to create mutations in the zebrafish pitx2 gene. 
      Mutations in the pitx2 homeodomain caused phenotypes reminiscent of ARS,
      including aberrant development of the cornea and anterior chamber of the eye and 
      reduced or absent teeth. Intriguingly, LR asymmetric looping of the heart and gut
      was normal in pitx2 mutants. These results suggest conserved roles for Pitx2 in
      eye and tooth development and indicate Pitx2 is not required for asymmetric
      looping of zebrafish visceral organs. This work establishes zebrafish pitx2
      mutants as a new animal model for investigating mechanisms underlying congenital 
      malformations in ARS and high-throughput drug screening for ARS therapeutics.
      Additionally, pitx2 mutants present a unique opportunity to identify new genes
      involved in vertebrate LR patterning. We show Nodal signaling-independent of
      Pitx2-controls asymmetric expression of the fatty acid elongase elovl6 in
      zebrafish, pointing to a potential novel pathway during LR organogenesis.

AB  - Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) adds O-linked fucose to Thrombospondin
      Type 1 Repeats (TSR) in 49 potential target proteins. Nearly half the POFUT2
      targets belong to the A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin
      type-1 motifs (ADAMTS) or ADAMTS-like family of proteins. Both the mouse Pofut2
      RST434 gene trap allele and the Adamts9 knockout were reported to result in early
      embryonic lethality, suggesting that defects in Pofut2 mutant embryos could
      result from loss of O-fucosylation on ADAMTS9. To address this question, we
      compared the Pofut2 and Adamts9 knockout phenotypes and used Cre-mediated
      deletion of Pofut2 and Adamts9 to dissect the tissue-specific role of
      O-fucosylated ADAMTS9 during gastrulation. Disruption of Pofut2 using the
      knockout (LoxP) or gene trap (RST434) allele, as well as deletion of Adamts9,
      resulted in disorganized epithelia (epiblast, extraembryonic ectoderm, and
      visceral endoderm) and blocked mesoderm formation during gastrulation. The
      similarity between Pofut2 and Adamts9 mutants suggested that disruption of
      ADAMTS9 function could be responsible for the gastrulation defects observed in
      Pofut2 mutants. Consistent with this prediction, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of POFUT2
      in HEK293T cells blocked secretion of ADAMTS9. We determined that Adamts9 was
      dynamically expressed during mouse gastrulation by trophoblast giant cells,
      parietal endoderm, the most proximal visceral endoderm adjacent to the
      ectoplacental cone, extraembryonic mesoderm, and anterior primitive streak.
      Conditional deletion of either Pofut2 or Adamts9 in the epiblast rescues the
      gastrulation defects, and identified a new role for O-fucosylated ADAMTS9 during 
      morphogenesis of the amnion and axial mesendoderm. Combined, these results
      suggested that loss of ADAMTS9 function in the extra embryonic tissue is
      responsible for gastrulation defects in the Pofut2 knockout. We hypothesize that 
      loss of ADAMTS9 function in the most proximal visceral endoderm leads to slippage
      of the visceral endoderm and altered characteristics of the extraembryonic
      ectoderm. Consequently, loss of input from the extraembryonic ectoderm and/or
      compression of the epiblast by Reichert's membrane blocks gastrulation. In the
      future, the Pofut2 and Adamts9 knockouts will be valuable tools for understanding
      how local changes in the properties of the extracellular matrix influence the
      organization of tissues during mammalian development.

TI  - JNK does not regulate meiotic progression in Xenopus oocytes: The strange case of
      pJNK and pERK.

AB  - Xenopus ERK2, also known as Xp42 MAPK, is activated by progesterone and regulates
      meiotic progression in the oocytes through activation of the phosphatase Cdc25C
      and inhibition of the protein kinase Myt1, thus promoting dephosphorylation and
      activation of cyclinB/Cdc2 (MPF). Indeed, it has been reported that stress
      protein kinases p38 and JNK are activated during meiotic progression and, more
      specifically, that p38gamma regulates meiosis through activation of Cdc25C.
      However, the role of JNK in meiotic progression is not so clear, and despite a
      42kDa protein is detected with pJNK antibodies (XpJNK-p42), the specific isoform 
      activated by progesterone has not been characterized in detail. The
      serine/threonine kinase MEKK1, an upstream activator of JNK and p38, is activated
      during stress conditions and regulates apoptosis in different cell types. Here we
      show that ectopic expression of a constitutively active MEKK1 in Xenopus oocytes 
      induces phosphorylation of p38, JNK and ERK and accelerates meiotic progression
      induced by progesterone. Inhibition of each individual pathway reduces the
      acceleration of meiosis induced by MEKK1. However, constitutively active MEKK1
      induces phosphorylation of two JNK isoforms (p40 and p49, corresponding to JNK1-1
      and JNK1-2 respectively) distinct to the p42 protein detected with pJNK
      antibodies during meiotic progression (XpJNK-p42). Moreover, a constitutively
      active MKK7, which specifically activates the JNK signaling pathway and induces
      phosphorylation of the p40 and p49 isoforms, does not accelerate meiotic
      progression. Immunoprecipitation of the p42 protein with pJNK antibodies and
      subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry shows that XpJNK-p42 is, in fact, pERK2.
      Ectopic expression of ERK2 in oocytes treated with progesterone or hyperosmotic
      shock indicates that ERK2 is phosphorylated in both conditions but is only
      detected with pJNK antibodies in progesterone-treated oocytes. In addition,
      mature oocytes only present a moderate increase of Jun kinase activity, which is 
      not inhibited by SP600125. In conclusion, JNKs are not activated during meiotic
      progression and XpJNK-p42 is a post-translational modification of pERK induced by
      progesterone.

AB  - Gap junctions are intercellular channels made of connexins (Cxs) that allow
      direct communication between adjacent cells. Modulation of Cxs has been
      associated with abnormal development and function of the mammary gland and breast
      cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying their expression during normal mammary
      gland are not yet known. Cxs interact with components of tight and adherens
      junctions. Thus, we hypothesized that the expression levels of Cxs vary during
      mammary gland development and are regulated through stage-dependent interactions 
      with members of the tight and adherens junctions. Our specific objectives were
      to: 1) determine the expression of Cxs and tight and adherens junction proteins
      throughout development and 2) characterize Cxs interactions with components of
      tight and adherens junctions. Murine mammary glands were sampled at various
      developmental stages (pre-pubescent to post-weaning). RT-qPCR and western-blot
      analyses demonstrated differential expression patterns for all gap (Cx43, Cx32,
      Cx26, Cx30), tight (Claudin-1, -3, -4, -7) and adherens (beta-catenin, E- and
      P-cadherins) junctions throughout development. Interestingly,
      co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated interactions between these different types of
      junctions. Cx30 interacted with Cx26 just at the late pregnancy stage. While Cx43
      showed a persistent interaction with beta-catenin from virginity to post-weaning,
      its interactions with E-cadherin and Claudin-7 were transient. Cx32 interacted
      with Cx26, E-cadherin and beta-catenin during lactation. Immunofluorescence
      results confirmed the existence of a junctional nexus that remodeled during
      mammary gland development. Together, our results confirm that the expression
      levels of Cxs vary concomitantly and that Cxs form junctional nexuses with tight 
      and adherens junctions, suggesting the existence of common regulatory pathways.

AB  - The term "epigenetics" was introduced in 1942 by embryologist Conrad Waddington, 
      who, relating it to the 17th century concept of "epigenesis", defined it as the
      complex of developmental processes between the genotype and phenotype. While in
      the years that followed, these processes - in particular gene regulation - were
      tackled, not in the frame of epigenetics but of genetics, research labelled
      "epigenetics" rose strongly only in the 21st century. Then it consisted of
      research on chromatin modifications, i.e. chemical modifications of DNA or
      histone proteins around DNA that do not change the base sequence. This rise was
      accompanied by far-reaching claims, such as that epigenetics provides a mechanism
      for "Lamarckian" inheritance. This article highlights the origin of epigenetics, 
      the major phases of epigenetic research, and the changes in the meaning of the
      term. It also calls into question some of the far-reaching claims that have
      accompanied the recent rise of epigenetics.

AB  - How cells coordinate their spatial positioning through intercellular signaling
      events is poorly understood. Here we address this topic using Caenorhabditis
      elegans vulval patterning during which hypodermal vulval precursor cells (VPCs)
      adopt distinct cell fates determined by their relative positions to the gonadal
      anchor cell (AC). LIN-3/EGF signaling by the AC induces the central VPC, P6.p, to
      adopt a 1 degrees vulval fate. Exact alignment of AC and VPCs is thus critical
      for correct fate patterning, yet, as we show here, the initial AC-VPC positioning
      is both highly variable and asymmetric among individuals, with AC and P6.p only
      becoming aligned at the early L3 stage. Cell ablations and mutant analysis
      indicate that VPCs, most prominently 1 degrees cells, move towards the AC. We
      identify AC-released LIN-3/EGF as a major attractive signal, which therefore
      plays a dual role in vulval patterning (cell alignment and fate induction).
      Additionally, compromising Wnt pathway components also induces AC-VPC alignment
      errors, with loss of posterior Wnt signaling increasing stochastic vulval
      centering on P5.p. Our results illustrate how intercellular signaling reduces
      initial spatial variability in cell positioning to generate reproducible
      interactions across tissues.

AB  - Germ cells provide maternal mRNAs that are stored in the oocyte, and later
      translated at a specific time of development. In this context, gene regulation
      depends mainly on post-transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to keep
      maternal transcripts in a stable and translationally silent state. In recent
      years, small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs have emerged as key
      post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. microRNAs control the
      translation efficiency and/or stability of targeted mRNAs. microRNAs are present 
      in animal germ cells and maternally inherited microRNAs are abundant in early
      embryos. However, it is not known how microRNAs control the stability and
      translation of maternal transcripts. In this review, we will discuss the
      implication of germline microRNAs in regulating animal oogenesis and early
      embryogenesis as well as compare their roles with endo-siRNAs, small RNA species 
      that share key molecular components with the microRNA pathway.

AB  - Molecular mechanisms underlying the development and morphogenesis of oral
      epithelia, comprising the gustatory and nongustatory epithelium, remain unclear. 
      Here, we show that Bcl11b, a zinc finger transcription factor, plays an important
      role in the development of lingual papillae, especially filiform papillae. In
      both gustatory and nongustatory epithelium, Bcl11b was expressed in keratin
      14-positive epithelial basal cells, which differentiate into keratinocytes and/or
      taste cells. Loss of Bcl11b function resulted in abnormal morphology of the
      gustatory papillae: flattened fungiform papillae, shorter trench wall in the
      foliate and circumvallate papillae, and ectopic invagination in more than half of
      circumvallate papillae. However, Bcl11b loss caused no effect on differentiation 
      of taste receptor cells. In nongustatory epithelium, the impact of Bcl11b
      deficiency was much more striking, resulting in a smooth surface on the tongue
      tip and hypoplastic filiform papillae in the dorsal lingual epithelium.
      Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that a keratinocyte differentiation marker,
      Tchh expression was severely decreased in the Bcl11b(-/-) filiform papillae. In
      addition, expression of Pax9, required for morphogenesis of filiform papillae and
      its downstream target genes, hard keratins, almost disappeared in the tongue tip 
      and was decreased in the dorsal tongue of Bcl11b(-/-) mice. Gene expression
      analyses demonstrated a delayed onset of expression of epithelial differentiation
      complex genes, which disturbed barrier formation in the mutant tongue. These
      results indicate that Bcl11b regulates the differentiation of keratinocytes in
      the tongue and identify Bcl11b as an essential factor for the lingual papilla
      morphogenesis.

TI  - Regulators of gene expression in Enteric Neural Crest Cells are putative
      Hirschsprung disease genes.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) is required for peristalsis of the gut and is
      derived from Enteric Neural Crest Cells (ENCCs). During ENS development, the RET 
      receptor tyrosine kinase plays a critical role in the proliferation and survival 
      of ENCCs, their migration along the developing gut, and differentiation into
      enteric neurons. Mutations in RET and its ligand GDNF cause Hirschsprung disease 
      (HSCR), a complex genetic disorder in which ENCCs fail to colonize variable
      lengths of the distal bowel. To identify key regulators of ENCCs and the pathways
      underlying RET signaling, gene expression profiles of untreated and GDNF-treated 
      ENCCs from E14.5 mouse embryos were generated. ENCCs express genes that are
      involved in both early and late neuronal development, whereas GDNF treatment
      induced neuronal maturation. Predicted regulators of gene expression in ENCCs
      include the known HSCR genes Ret and Sox10, as well as Bdnf, App and Mapk10. The 
      regulatory overlap and functional interactions between these genes were used to
      construct a regulatory network that is underlying ENS development and connects to
      known HSCR genes. In addition, the adenosine receptor A2a (Adora2a) and
      neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (Npy2r) were identified as possible regulators of
      terminal neuronal differentiation in GDNF-treated ENCCs. The human orthologue of 
      Npy2r maps to the HSCR susceptibility locus 4q31.3-q32.3, suggesting a role for
      NPY2R both in ENS development and in HSCR.

TI  - Function of the C. elegans T-box factor TBX-2 depends on interaction with the
      UNC-37/Groucho corepressor.

AB  - T-box transcription factors are important regulators of development in all
      animals, and altered expression of T-box factors has been identified in an
      increasing number of diseases and cancers. Despite these important roles, the
      mechanism of T-box factor activity is not well understood. We have previously
      shown that the Caenorhabditis elegans Tbx2 subfamily member TBX-2 functions as a 
      transcriptional repressor to specify ABa-derived pharyngeal muscle, and that this
      function depends on SUMOylation. Here we show that TBX-2 function also depends on
      interaction with the Groucho-family corepressor UNC-37. TBX-2 interacts with
      UNC-37 in yeast two-hybrid assays via a highly conserved engrailed homology 1
      (eh1) motif located near the TBX-2 C-terminus. Reducing unc-37 phenocopies tbx-2 
      mutants, resulting in a specific loss of anterior ABa-derived pharyngeal muscles 
      and derepression of the tbx-2 promoter. Moreover, double mutants containing
      hypomorphic alleles of unc-37 and tbx-2 exhibit enhanced phenotypes, providing
      strong genetic evidence that unc-37 and tbx-2 share common functions in vivo. To 
      test whether interaction with UNC-37 is necessary for TBX-2 activity, we
      developed a transgene rescue assay using a tbx-2 containing fosmid and found that
      mutating the tbx-2 eh1 motif reduced rescue of a tbx-2 null mutant. These results
      indicate that TBX-2 function in vivo depends on interaction with UNC-37. As many 
      T-box factors contain eh1 motifs, we suggest that interaction with Groucho-family
      corepressors is a common mechanism contributing to their activity.

AB  - During embryonic induction, the responding cells invoke an induced developmental 
      program, whereas in the absence of an inducing signal, they assume a default
      uninduced cell fate. Suppression of the default fate during the inductive event
      is crucial for choice of the binary cell fate. In contrast to the mechanisms that
      promote an induced cell fate, those that suppress the default fate have been
      overlooked. Upon induction, intracellular signal transduction results in
      activation of genes encoding key transcription factors for induced tissue
      differentiation. It is elusive whether an induced key transcription factor has
      dual functions involving suppression of the default fates and promotion of the
      induced fate, or whether suppression of the default fate is independently
      regulated by other factors that are also downstream of the signaling cascade. We 
      show that during ascidian embryonic induction, default fates were suppressed by
      multifold redundant mechanisms. The key transcription factor, Twist-related.a,
      which is required for mesenchyme differentiation, and another independent
      transcription factor, Lhx3, which is dispensable for mesenchyme differentiation, 
      sequentially and redundantly suppress the default muscle fate in induced
      mesenchyme cells. Similarly in notochord induction, Brachyury, which is required 
      for notochord differentiation, and other factors, Lhx3 and Mnx, are likely to
      suppress the default nerve cord fate redundantly. Lhx3 commonly suppresses the
      default fates in two kinds of induction. Mis-activation of the autonomously
      executed default program in induced cells is detrimental to choice of the binary 
      cell fate. Multifold redundant mechanisms would be required for suppression of
      the default fate to be secure.

TI  - A conserved alternative form of the purple sea urchin HEB/E2-2/E2A transcription

AB  - E-proteins are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with essential
      roles in animal development. In mammals, these are encoded by three loci: E2-2
      (ITF-2/ME2/SEF2/TCF4), E2A (TCF3), and HEB (ME1/REB/TCF12). The HEB and E2-2
      paralogs are expressed as alternative (Alt) isoforms with distinct N-terminal
      sequences encoded by unique exons under separate regulatory control. Expression
      of these alternative transcripts is restricted relative to the longer (Can)
      forms, suggesting distinct regulatory roles, although the functions of the Alt
      proteins remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the single sea urchin
      E-protein ortholog (SpE-protein). The organization of the SpE-protein gene
      closely resembles that of the extended HEB/E2-2 vertebrate loci, including a
      transcript that initiates at a homologous alternative transcription start site
      (SpE-Alt). The existence of an Alt form in the sea urchin indicates that this
      feature predates the emergence of the vertebrates. We present additional evidence
      indicating that this transcript was present in the common bilaterian ancestor. In
      contrast to the widely expressed canonical form (SpE-Can), SpE-Alt expression is 
      tightly restricted. SpE-Alt is expressed in two phases: first in aboral
      non-skeletogenic mesenchyme (NSM) cells and then in oral NSM cells preceding
      their differentiation and ingression into the blastocoel. Derivatives of these
      cells mediate immune response in the larval stage. Inhibition of SpE-Alt activity
      interferes with these events. Notably, although the two isoforms are initially
      co-expressed, as these cells differentiate, SpE-Can is excluded from the
      SpE-Alt(+) cell population. This mutually exclusive expression is dependent on
      SpE-Alt function, which reveals a previously undescribed negative regulatory
      linkage between the two E-protein forms. Collectively, these findings reorient
      our understanding of the evolution of this transcription factor family and
      highlight fundamental properties of E-protein biology.

TI  - Pharyngeal morphogenesis requires fras1-itga8-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal
      interaction.

AB  - Both Fras1 and Itga8 connect mesenchymal cells to epithelia by way of an
      extracellular 'Fraser protein complex' that functions in signaling and adhesion; 
      these proteins are vital to the development of several vertebrate organs. We
      previously found that zebrafish fras1 mutants have craniofacial defects,
      specifically, shortened symplectic cartilages and cartilage fusions that spare
      joint elements. During a forward mutagenesis screen, we identified a new
      zebrafish mutation, b1161, that we show here disrupts itga8, as confirmed using
      CRISPR-generated itga8 alleles. fras1 and itga8 single mutants and double mutants
      have similar craniofacial phenotypes, a result expected if loss of either gene
      disrupts function of the Fraser protein complex. Unlike fras1 mutants or other
      Fraser-related mutants, itga8 mutants do not show blistered tail fins. Thus, the 
      function of the Fraser complex differs in the craniofacial skeleton and the tail 
      fin. Focusing on the face, we find that itga8 mutants consistently show defective
      outpocketing of a late-forming portion of the first pharyngeal pouch, and
      variably express skeletal defects, matching previously characterized fras1 mutant
      phenotypes. In itga8 and fras1 mutants, skeletal severity varies markedly between
      sides, indicating that both mutants have increased developmental instability.
      Whereas fras1 is expressed in epithelia, we show that itga8 is expressed
      complementarily in facial mesenchyme. Paired with the observed phenotypic
      similarity, this expression indicates that the genes function in
      epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Similar interactions between Fras1 and Itga8
      have previously been found in mouse kidney, where these genes both regulate
      Nephronectin (Npnt) protein abundance. We find that zebrafish facial tissues
      express both npnt and the Fraser gene fibrillin2b (fbn2b), but their transcript
      levels do not depend on fras1 or itga8 function. Using a revertible fras1 allele,
      we find that the critical window for fras1 function in the craniofacial skeleton 
      is between 1.5 and 3 days post fertilization, which coincides with the onset of
      fras1-dependent and itga8-dependent morphogenesis. We propose a model wherein
      Fras1 and Itga8 interact during late pharyngeal pouch morphogenesis to sculpt
      pharyngeal arches through epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, thereby
      stabilizing the developing craniofacial skeleton.

AB  - Hematopoietic cell generation in the midgestation mouse embryo occurs through the
      natural transdifferentiation of temporally and spatially restricted set of
      hemogenic endothelial cells. These cells take on hematopoietic fate in the aorta,
      vitelline and umbilical arteries and appear as hematopoietic cell clusters that
      emerge from the vascular wall. Genetic and live imaging data have supported this.
      Recently, the embryonic head has been shown to contain fully functional
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). By lineage tracing, cerebrovascular specific
      endothelial cells were shown to contribute to the postnatal mouse hematopoietic
      system. Since Ly6aGFP is a marker of all HSCs, some hematopoietic cluster cells
      and hemogenic endothelial cells in the midgestation mouse aorta, we examine here 
      whether embryonic head HSCs and vascular endothelial cells are positive for this 
      marker. Whereas some head vasculature, single hematopoietic cells and all HSCs
      are Ly6aGFP expressing, we do not find clusters of hematopoietic cells emerging
      from the cerebrovasculature that are characteristic of
      endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition.

      blastula stage. Morpholino antisense-mediated knockdown of Sp-Elk causes
      blastula-stage developmental arrest and embryo disintegration due to apoptosis, a
      phenotype that is rescued by wild-type Elk mRNA. Development is also rescued by
      Elk mRNA encoding a serine to aspartic acid substitution (S402D) that mimics
      ERK-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved site that enhances DNA binding, but
      not by Elk mRNA encoding an alanine substitution at the same site (S402A). This
      demonstrates both that the apoptotic phenotype of the morphants is specifically
      caused by Elk depletion, and that phosphorylation of serine 402 of Sp-Elk is
      critical for its anti-apoptotic function. Knockdown of Sp-Elk results in
      under-expression of several regulatory genes involved in cell fate specification,
      cell cycle control, and survival signaling, including the transcriptional
      regulator Sp-Runt-1 and its target Sp-PKC1, both of which were shown previously
      to be required for cell survival during embryogenesis. Both Sp-Runt-1 and Sp-PKC1
      have sequences upstream of their transcription start sites that specifically bind
      Sp-Elk. These results indicate that Sp-Elk is the signal-dependent activator of a
      feed-forward gene regulatory circuit, consisting also of Sp-Runt-1 and Sp-PKC1,
      which actively suppresses apoptosis in the early embryo.

AB  - Temporally and spatially dynamic Wnt and BMP signals are essential to pattern
      foregut endoderm progenitors that give rise to the liver, pancreas and lungs, but
      how these two signaling pathways are coordinated in the extracellular space is
      unknown. Here we identify the transmembrane heparan sulphate proteoglycan
      Syndecan-4 (Sdc4), as a key regulator of both non-canonical Wnt and BMP signaling
      in the Xenopus foregut. Foregut-specific Sdc4 depletion results in a disrupted
      Fibronectin (Fn1) matrix, reduced cell adhesion, and failure to maintain foregut 
      gene expression ultimately leading to foregut organ hypoplasia. Sdc4 is required 
      to maintain robust Wnt/JNK and BMP/Smad1 signaling in the hhex+ foregut
      progenitors. Pathway analysis suggests that Sdc4 functionally interacts with Fzd7
      to promote Wnt/JNK signaling, which maintains foregut identity and cell adhesion.
      In addition, the Sdc4 ectodomain is required to support Fn1 matrix assembly,
      which is essential for the robust BMP signaling that promotes foregut gene
      expression. This work sheds lights on how the extracellular matrix can coordinate
      different signaling pathways during organogenesis.

TI  - Novel action of FOXL2 as mediator of Col1a2 gene autoregulation.
PG  - 200-211
LID - S0012-1606(16)30070-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.05.022 [doi]
AB  - FOXL2 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved forkhead box (FOX) superfamily and 
      is a master transcription factor in a spectrum of developmental pathways,
      including ovarian and eyelid development and bone, cartilage and uterine
      maturation. To analyse its action, we searched for proteins that interact with
      FOXL2. We found that FOXL2 interacts with specific C-terminal propeptides of
      several fibrillary collagens. Because these propeptides can participate in
      feedback regulation of collagen biosynthesis, we inferred that FOXL2 could
      thereby affect the transcription of the cognate collagen genes. Focusing on
      COL1A2, we found that FOXL2 indeed affects collagen synthesis, by binding to a
      DNA response element located about 65Kb upstream of this gene. According to our
      hypothesis we found that in Foxl2(-/-) mouse ovaries, Col1a2 was elevated from
      birth to adulthood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) compartmentalizes the ovary
      during folliculogenesis, (with type I, type III and type IV collagens as primary 
      components), and ECM composition changes during the reproductive lifespan. In
      Foxl2(-/-) mouse ovaries, in addition to up-regulation of Col1a2, Col3a1, Col4a1 
      and fibronectin were also upregulated, while laminin expression was reduced.
      Thus, by regulating levels of extracellular matrix components, FOXL2 may
      contribute to both ovarian histogenesis and the fibrosis attendant on depletion
      of the follicle reserve during reproductive aging and menopause.

AB  - The hypothalamus is a region of the anterior forebrain that controls basic
      aspects of vertebrate physiology, but the genes involved in its development are
      still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the function of the homeobox gene
      Rax/Rx in early hypothalamic development using a conditional targeted
      inactivation strategy in the mouse. We found that lack of Rax expression prior to
      embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) caused a general underdevelopment of the hypothalamic
      neuroepithelium, while inactivation at later timepoints had little effect. The
      early absence of Rax impaired neurogenesis and prevented the expression of
      molecular markers of the dorsomedial hypothalamus, including neuropeptides
      Proopiomelanocortin and Somatostatin. Interestingly, the expression domains of
      genes expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamus and infundibulum invaded dorsal 
      hypothalamic territory, showing that Rax is needed for the proper dorsoventral
      patterning of the developing medial hypothalamus. The phenotypes caused by the
      early loss of Rax are similar to those of eliminating the expression of the
      morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) specifically from the hypothalamus. Consistent
      with this similarity in phenotypes, we observed that Shh and Rax are coexpressed 
      in the rostral forebrain at late head fold stages and that loss of Rax caused a
      downregulation of Shh expression in the dorsomedial portion of the hypothalamus.

AB  - Animal morphogenesis requires folds or clefts to separate populations of cells
      which are often associated with different cell affinities. In the Drosophila wing
      imaginal disc, the regional expression of the Iroquois complex (Iro-C) in the
      notum leads to the formation of the hinge/notum (H/N) fold that separates the
      wing hinge and notum territories. Although Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling has
      been revealed as essential for the hinge/notum subdivision through the
      restriction of Iro-C toward the notum region, the mechanism by which the H/N
      border develops into a fold is unknown. Here, we report that a Dpp target gene,
      optomotor-blind (omb), mediates the role of Dpp signaling in Iro-C inhibition.
      omb is complementarily expressed on the dorsal hinge side, abutting the Iro-C
      domain along the H/N border. Ectopic omb expression inhibits Iro-C in the notum
      territory, independent of known Iro-C regulators Msh and Stat92E. Uniform
      manipulation of either omb or Iro-C genes spanning the presumptive H/N border
      significantly suppresses H/N fold formation via inhibition of the apical
      microtubule enrichment. Ectopically sharp border or discontinuity in level of
      Iro-C or Omb is enough to generate ectopic fold formation. These results reveal
      that omb and Iro-C not only are complementarily expressed but also cooperate to
      promote H/N fold formation. Our data help to understand how Dpp signaling is
      interpreted region-specifically during tissue subdivision.

AB  - In all non-vertebrate metazoan phyla, species that evolved non-embryonic
      developmental pathways as means of propagation or regeneration can be found. In
      this context, new bodies arise through asexual reproduction processes (such as
      budding) or whole body regeneration, that lack the familiar temporal and spatial 
      cues classically associated with embryogenesis, like maternal determinants, or
      gastrulation. The molecular mechanisms underlying those non-embryonic
      developments (i.e., regeneration and asexual reproduction), and their
      relationship to those deployed during embryogenesis are poorly understood. We
      have addressed this question in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, which
      undergoes an asexual reproductive process via palleal budding (PB), as well as a 
      whole body regeneration by vascular budding (VB). We identified early
      regenerative structures during VB and then followed the fate of differentiating
      tissues during both non-embryonic developments (PB and VB) by monitoring the
      expression of genes known to play key functions in germ layer specification with 
      well conserved expression patterns in solitary ascidian embryogenesis. The
      expression patterns of FoxA1, GATAa, GATAb, Otx, Bra, Gsc and Tbx2/3 were
      analysed during both PB and VB. We found that the majority of these transcription
      factors were expressed during both non-embryonic developmental processes,
      revealing a regionalization of the palleal and vascular buds. Knockdown of GATAa 
      by siRNA in palleal buds confirmed that preventing the correct development of one
      of these regions blocks further tissue specification. Our results indicate that
      during both normal and injury-induced budding, a similar alternative
      developmental program operates via early commitment of epithelial regions.

AB  - The neurocranium generates most of the craniofacial skeleton and consists of
      prechordal and postchordal regions. Although development of the prechordal is
      well studied, little is known of the postchordal region. Here we characterize a
      signaling hierarchy necessary for postchordal neurocranial development involving 
      Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling for early specification of
      mesodermally-derived progenitor cells. The expression of hyaluron synthetase 2
      (has2) in the cephalic mesoderm requires Fgf signaling and Has2 function, in
      turn, is required for postchordal neurocranial development. While Hedgehog
      (Hh)-deficient embryos also lack a postchordal neurocranium, this appears
      primarily due to a later defect in chondrocyte differentiation. Inhibitor studies
      demonstrate that postchordal neurocranial development requires early Fgf and
      later Hh signaling. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic understanding
      of early postchordal neurocranial development and demonstrate a hierarchy of
      signaling between Fgf and Hh in the development of this structure.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) signaling is critical for proper
      craniofacial development. A gain-of-function mutation in the 2c splice variant of
      the receptor's gene is associated with Crouzon syndrome, which is characterized
      by craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of one or more of the cranial vault
      sutures, leading to craniofacial maldevelopment. Insight into the molecular
      mechanism of craniosynostosis has identified the ERK-MAPK signaling cascade as a 
      critical regulator of suture patency. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      role of FGFR2c-induced ERK-MAPK activation in the regulation of coronal suture
      development. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function Fgfr2c mutant mice have
      overlapping phenotypes, including coronal synostosis and craniofacial dysmorphia.
      In vivo analysis of coronal sutures in loss-of-function and gain-of-function
      models demonstrated fundamentally different pathogenesis underlying coronal
      suture synostosis. Calvarial osteoblasts from gain-of-function mice demonstrated 
      enhanced osteoblastic function and maturation with concomitant increase in
      ERK-MAPK activation. In vitro inhibition with the ERK protein inhibitor U0126
      mitigated ERK protein activation levels with a concomitant reduction in alkaline 
      phosphatase activity. This study identifies FGFR2c-mediated ERK-MAPK signaling as
      a key mediator of craniofacial growth and coronal suture development.
      Furthermore, our results solve the apparent paradox between loss-of-function and 
      gain-of-function FGFR2c mutants with respect to coronal suture synostosis.

AB  - We compared apparent origins, cellular diversity and regulation of initial axon
      growth for differentiating cranial sensory neurons. We assessed the molecular and
      cellular composition of the developing olfactory and otic placodes, and cranial
      sensory ganglia to evaluate contributions of ectodermal placode versus neural
      crest at each site. Special sensory neuron populations-the olfactory and otic
      placodes, as well as those in vestibulo-acoustic ganglion- are entirely populated
      with cells expressing cranial placode-associated, rather than neural
      crest-associated markers. The remaining cranial sensory ganglia are a mosaic of
      cells that express placode-associated as well as neural crest-associated markers.
      We found two distinct populations of neural crest in the cranial ganglia: the
      first, as expected, is labeled by Wnt1:Cre mediated recombination. The second is 
      not labeled by Wnt1:Cre recombination, and expresses both Sox10 and FoxD3. These 
      populations-Wnt1:Cre recombined, and Sox10/Foxd3-expressing- are proliferatively 
      distinct from one another. Together, the two neural crest-associated populations 
      are substantially more proliferative than their placode-associated counterparts. 
      Nevertheless, the apparently placode- and neural crest-associated populations are
      similarly sensitive to altered signaling that compromises cranial morphogenesis
      and differentiation. Acute disruption of either Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) or
      Retinoic acid (RA) signaling alters axon growth and cell death, but does not
      preferentially target any of the three distinct populations. Apparently, mosaic
      derivation and diversity of precursors and early differentiating neurons,
      modulated uniformly by local signals, supports early cranial sensory neuron
      differentiation and growth.

AB  - The Hedgehog signalling pathway plays a fundamental role in orchestrating normal 
      craniofacial development in vertebrates. In particular, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is
      produced in three key domains during the early formation of the head;
      neuroectoderm of the ventral forebrain, facial ectoderm and the pharyngeal
      endoderm; with signal transduction evident in both ectodermal and mesenchymal
      tissue compartments. Shh signalling from the prechordal plate and ventral midline
      of the diencephalon is required for appropriate division of the eyefield and
      forebrain, with mutation in a number of pathway components associated with
      Holoprosencephaly, a clinically heterogeneous developmental defect characterized 
      by a failure of the early forebrain vesicle to divide into distinct halves. In
      addition, signalling from the pharyngeal endoderm and facial ectoderm plays an
      essential role during development of the face, influencing cranial neural crest
      cells that migrate into the early facial processes. In recent years, the
      complexity of Shh signalling has been highlighted by the identification of
      multiple novel proteins that are involved in regulating both the release and
      reception of this protein. Here, we review the contributions of Shh signalling
      during early craniofacial development, focusing on Hedgehog receptor function and
      describing the consequences of disruption for inherited anomalies of this region 
      in both mouse models and human populations.

AB  - Mandibulofacial dysostosis (MFD) is a human developmental disorder characterized 
      by defects of the facial bones. It is the second most frequent craniofacial
      malformation after cleft lip and palate. Nager syndrome combines many features of
      MFD with a variety of limb defects. Mutations in SF3B4 (splicing factor 3b,
      subunit 4) gene, which encodes a component of the pre-mRNA spliceosomal complex, 
      were recently identified as a cause of Nager syndrome, accounting for 60% of
      affected individuals. Nothing is known about the cellular pathogenesis underlying
      Nager type MFD. Here we describe the first animal model for Nager syndrome,
      generated by knocking down Sf3b4 function in Xenopus laevis embryos, using
      morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. Our results indicate that Sf3b4-depleted
      embryos show reduced expression of the neural crest genes sox10, snail2 and twist
      at the neural plate border, associated with a broadening of the neural plate.
      This phenotype can be rescued by injection of wild-type human SF3B4 mRNA but not 
      by mRNAs carrying mutations that cause Nager syndrome. At the tailbud stage,
      morphant embryos had decreased sox10 and tfap2a expression in the pharyngeal
      arches, indicative of a reduced number of neural crest cells. Later in
      development, Sf3b4-depleted tadpoles exhibited hypoplasia of neural crest-derived
      craniofacial cartilages, phenocopying aspects of the craniofacial skeletal
      defects seen in Nager syndrome patients. With this animal model we are now poised
      to gain important insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of Nager type MFD, 
      and to identify the molecular targets of Sf3b4.

AB  - The evolution of oral teeth is considered a major contributor to the overall
      success of jawed vertebrates. This is especially apparent in cartilaginous fishes
      including sharks and rays, which develop elaborate arrays of highly specialized
      teeth, organized in rows and retain the capacity for life-long regeneration.
      Perpetual regeneration of oral teeth has been either lost or highly reduced in
      many other lineages including important developmental model species, so
      cartilaginous fishes are uniquely suited for deep comparative analyses of tooth
      development and regeneration. Additionally, sharks and rays can offer crucial
      insights into the characters of the dentition in the ancestor of all jawed
      vertebrates. Despite this, tooth development and regeneration in chondrichthyans 
      is poorly understood and remains virtually uncharacterized from a developmental
      genetic standpoint. Using the emerging chondrichthyan model, the catshark
      (Scyliorhinus spp.), we characterized the expression of genes homologous to those
      known to be expressed during stages of early dental competence, tooth initiation,
      morphogenesis, and regeneration in bony vertebrates. We have found that
      expression patterns of several genes from Hh, Wnt/beta-catenin, Bmp and Fgf
      signalling pathways indicate deep conservation over ~450 million years of tooth
      development and regeneration. We describe how these genes participate in the
      initial emergence of the shark dentition and how they are redeployed during
      regeneration of successive tooth generations. We suggest that at the dawn of the 
      vertebrate lineage, teeth (i) were most likely continuously regenerative
      structures, and (ii) utilised a core set of genes from members of key
      developmental signalling pathways that were instrumental in creating a dental
      legacy redeployed throughout vertebrate evolution. These data lay the foundation 
      for further experimental investigations utilizing the unique regenerative
      capacity of chondrichthyan models to answer evolutionary, developmental, and
      regenerative biological questions that are impossible to explore in classical
      models.

AB  - The craniofacial skeletal structures that comprise the human head develop from
      multiple tissues that converge to form the bones and cartilage of the face.
      Because of their complex development and morphogenesis, many human birth defects 
      arise due to disruptions in these cellular populations. Thus, determining how
      these structures normally develop is vital if we are to gain a deeper
      understanding of craniofacial birth defects and devise treatment and prevention
      options. In this review, we will focus on how animal model systems have been used
      historically and in an ongoing context to enhance our understanding of human
      craniofacial development. We do this by first highlighting "animal to man"
      approaches; that is, how animal models are being utilized to understand
      fundamental mechanisms of craniofacial development. We discuss emerging
      technologies, including high throughput sequencing and genome editing, and new
      animal repository resources, and how their application can revolutionize the
      future of animal models in craniofacial research. Secondly, we highlight "man to 
      animal" approaches, including the current use of animal models to test the
      function of candidate human disease variants. Specifically, we outline a common
      workflow deployed after discovery of a potentially disease causing variant based 
      on a select set of recent examples in which human mutations are investigated in
      vivo using animal models. Collectively, these topics will provide a pipeline for 
      the use of animal models in understanding human craniofacial development and
      disease for clinical geneticist and basic researchers alike.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to ethanol results in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a
      syndrome characterised by a broad range of clinical manifestations including
      craniofacial dysmorphologies and neurological defects. The characterisation of
      the mechanisms by which ethanol exerts its teratogenic effects is difficult due
      to the pleiotropic nature of its actions. Different experimental model systems
      have been employed to investigate the aetiology of FASD. Here, I will review
      studies using these different model organisms that have helped to elucidate how
      ethanol causes the craniofacial abnormalities characteristic of FASD. In these
      studies, ethanol was found to impair the prechordal plate-an important embryonic 
      signalling centre-during gastrulation and to negatively affect the induction,
      migration and survival of the neural crest, a cell population that generates the 
      cartilage and most of the bones of the skull. At the cellular level, ethanol
      appears to inhibit Sonic hedgehog signalling, alter levels of retionoic acid
      activity, trigger a Ca(2+)-CamKII-dependent pathway that antagonises WNT
      signalling, affect cytoskeletal dynamics and increase oxidative stress. Embryos
      of the domestic chick Gallus gallus domesticus have played a central role in
      developing a working model for the effects of ethanol on craniofacial development
      because they are easily accessible and because key steps in craniofacial
      development are particularly well established in the avian embryo. I will finish 
      this review by highlighting some potential future avenues of fetal alcohol
      research.

AB  - The palate functions as the roof of the mouth in mammals, separating the oral and
      nasal cavities. Its complex embryonic development and assembly poses unique
      susceptibilities to intrinsic and extrinsic disruptions. Such disruptions may
      cause failure of the developing palatal shelves to fuse along the midline
      resulting in a cleft. In other cases the palate may fuse at an arch, resulting in
      a vaulted oral cavity, termed high-arched palate. There are many models available
      for studying the pathogenesis of cleft palate but a relative paucity for
      high-arched palate. One condition exhibiting either cleft palate or high-arched
      palate is Treacher Collins syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by
      numerous craniofacial anomalies. We quantitatively analyzed palatal perturbations
      in the Tcof1(+/-) mouse model of Treacher Collins syndrome, which phenocopies the
      condition in humans. We discovered that 46% of Tcof1(+/-) mutant embryos and new 
      born pups exhibit either soft clefts or full clefts. In addition, 17% of
      Tcof1(+/-) mutants were found to exhibit high-arched palate, defined as two sigma
      above the corresponding wild-type population mean for height and angular based
      arch measurements. Furthermore, palatal shelf length and shelf width were
      decreased in all Tcof1(+/-) mutant embryos and pups compared to controls.
      Interestingly, these phenotypes were subsequently ameliorated through genetic
      inhibition of p53. The results of our study therefore provide a simple,
      reproducible and quantitative method for investigating models of high-arched
      palate.

AB  - The cranial base is a component of the neurocranium and has a central role in the
      structural integration of the face, brain and vertebral column. Consequently,
      alteration in the shape of the human cranial base has been intimately linked with
      primate evolution and defective development is associated with numerous human
      facial abnormalities. Here we describe a novel recessive mutant mouse strain that
      presented with a domed head and fully penetrant cleft secondary palate coupled
      with defects in the formation of the underlying cranial base. Mapping and
      non-complementation studies revealed a specific mutation in Memo1 - a gene
      originally associated with cell migration. Expression analysis of Memo1
      identified robust expression in the perichondrium and periosteum of the
      developing cranial base, but only modest expression in the palatal shelves.
      Fittingly, although the palatal shelves failed to elevate in Memo1 mutants,
      expression changes were modest within the shelves themselves. In contrast, the
      cranial base, which forms via endochondral ossification had major reductions in
      the expression of genes responsible for bone formation, notably matrix
      metalloproteinases and markers of the osteoblast lineage, mirrored by an increase
      in markers of cartilage and extracellular matrix development. Concomitant with
      these changes, mutant cranial bases showed an increased zone of hypertrophic
      chondrocytes accompanied by a reduction in both vascular invasion and
      mineralization. Finally, neural crest cell-specific deletion of Memo1 caused a
      failure of anterior cranial base ossification indicating a cell autonomous role
      for MEMO1 in the development of these neural crest cell derived structures.
      However, palate formation was largely normal in these conditional mutants,
      suggesting a non-autonomous role for MEMO1 in palatal closure. Overall, these
      findings assign a new function to MEMO1 in driving endochondral ossification in
      the cranium, and also link abnormal development of the cranial base with more
      widespread effects on craniofacial shape relevant to human craniofacial
      dysmorphology.

AB  - Craniofacial disease phenotypes exhibit significant variation in penetrance and
      severity. Although many genetic contributions to phenotypic variation have been
      identified, genotype-phenotype correlations remain imprecise. Recent work in
      evolutionary developmental biology has exposed intriguing developmental
      mechanisms that potentially explain incongruities in genotype-phenotype
      relationships. This review focuses on two observations from work in comparative
      and experimental animal model systems that highlight how development structures
      variation. First, multiple genetic inputs converge on relatively few
      developmental processes. Investigation of when and how variation in developmental
      processes occurs may therefore help predict potential genetic interactions and
      phenotypic outcomes. Second, genetic mutation is typically associated with an
      increase in phenotypic variance. Several models outlining developmental
      mechanisms underlying mutational increases in phenotypic variance are discussed
      using Satb2-mediated variation in jaw size as an example. These data highlight
      development as a critical mediator of genotype-phenotype correlations. Future
      research in evolutionary developmental biology focusing on tissue-level processes
      may help elucidate the "black box" between genotype and phenotype, potentially
      leading to novel treatment, earlier diagnoses, and better clinical consultations 
      for individuals affected by craniofacial anomalies.

      precise and delicate interactions among genes, cells, and tissues. Thus, it is
      perhaps unsurprising that craniofacial abnormalities are among the most common
      birth defects in people, or that these defects have a complex genetic basis
      involving interactions among multiple loci. Developmental processes that depend
      on such epistatic interactions become exponentially more difficult to study in
      diploid organisms as the number of genes involved increases. Here, we present
      hybrid haploid males of the wasp species pair Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia
      giraulti, which have distinct male head morphologies, as a genetic model of
      craniofacial development that possesses the genetic advantages of haploidy, along
      with many powerful genomic tools. Viable, fertile hybrids can be made between the
      species, and quantitative trail loci related to shape differences have been
      identified. In addition, a subset of hybrid males show head abnormalities,
      including clefting at the midline and asymmetries. Crucially, epistatic
      interactions among multiple loci underlie several developmental differences and
      defects observed in the F2 hybrid males. Furthermore, we demonstrate an
      introgression of a chromosomal region from N. giraulti into N. vitripennis that
      shows an abnormality in relative eye size, which maps to a region containing a
      major QTL for this trait. Therefore, the genetic sources of head morphology can, 
      in principle, be identified by positional cloning. Thus, Nasonia is well
      positioned to be a uniquely powerful model invertebrate system with which to
      probe both development and complex genetics of craniofacial patterning and
      defects.

AB  - We have made great strides towards understanding the etiology of craniofacial
      disorders, especially for 'simple' Mendelian traits. However, the facial skeleton
      is a complex trait, and the full spectrum of genetic, developmental, and
      environmental factors that contribute to its final geometry remain unresolved.
      Forward genetic screens are constrained with respect to complex traits due to the
      types of genes and alleles commonly identified, developmental pleiotropy, and
      limited information about the impact of environmental interactions. Here, we
      discuss how studies in an evolutionary model - African cichlid fishes - can
      complement traditional approaches to understand the genetic and developmental
      origins of complex shape. Cichlids exhibit an unparalleled range of natural
      craniofacial morphologies that model normal human variation, and in certain
      instances mimic human facial dysmorphologies. Moreover, the evolutionary history 
      and genomic architecture of cichlids make them an ideal system to identify the
      genetic basis of these phenotypes via quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and
      population genomics. Given the molecular conservation of developmental genes and 
      pathways, insights from cichlids are applicable to human facial variation and
      disease. We review recent work in this system, which has identified lbh as a
      novel regulator of neural crest cell migration, determined the Wnt and Hedgehog
      pathways mediate species-specific bone morphologies, and examined how plastic
      responses to diet modulate adult facial shapes. These studies have not only
      revealed new roles for existing pathways in craniofacial development, but have
      identified new genes and mechanisms involved in shaping the craniofacial
      skeleton. In all, we suggest that combining work in traditional laboratory and
      evolutionary models offers significant potential to provide a more complete and
      comprehensive picture of the myriad factors that are involved in the development 
      of complex traits.

AB  - The chicken has been a particularly useful model for the study of craniofacial
      development and disease for over a century due to their relatively large size,
      accessibility, and amenability for classical bead implantation and transplant
      experiments. Several naturally occurring mutant lines with craniofacial anomalies
      also exist and have been heavily utilized by developmental biologist for several 
      decades. Two of the most well known lines, talpid(2) (ta(2)) and talpid(3)
      (ta(3)), represent the first spontaneous mutants to have the causative genes
      identified. Despite having distinct genetic causes, both mutants have recently
      been identified as ciliopathic. Excitingly, both of these mutants have been
      classified as models for human craniofacial ciliopathies: Oral-facial-digital
      syndrome (ta(2)) and Joubert syndrome (ta(3)). Herein, we review and compare
      these two models of craniofacial disease and highlight what they have revealed
      about the molecular and cellular etiology of ciliopathies. Furthermore, we
      outline how applying classical avian experiments and new technological advances
      (transgenics and genome editing) with naturally occurring avian mutants can add a
      tremendous amount to what we currently know about craniofacial ciliopathies.

AB  - The transcription factor BCL11B plays essential roles during development of the
      immune, nervous, and cutaneous systems. Here we show that BCL11B is expressed in 
      both osteogenic and sutural mesenchyme of the developing craniofacial complex.
      Bcl11b(-/-) mice exhibit increased proliferation of osteoprogenitors, premature
      osteoblast differentiation, and enhanced skull mineralization leading to
      synostoses of facial and calvarial sutures. Ectopic expression of Fgfr2c, a gene 
      implicated in craniosynostosis in mice and humans, and that of Runx2 was detected
      within the affected sutures of Bcl11b(-/-) mice. These data suggest that ectopic 
      expression of Fgfr2c in the sutural mesenchyme, without concomitant changes in
      the expression of FGF ligands, appears to induce the RUNX2-dependent osteogenic
      program and craniosynostosis in Bcl11b(-/-) mice.

AB  - Craniofacial abnormalities are among the most common features of human genetic
      syndromes and disorders. The etiology of these conditions is often complex,
      influenced by both genetic context and the environment. Frequently, craniofacial 
      abnormalities present as part of a syndrome with clear comorbid phenotypes,
      providing additional insight into mechanisms of the causative gene or pathway.
      The mouse has been a key tool in our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of
      craniofacial development and disease, and can provide excellent models for human 
      craniofacial abnormalities. While powerful genetic engineering tools in the mouse
      have contributed significantly our understanding of craniofacial development and 
      dysmorphology, forward genetic approaches provide an unbiased means to identify
      new genes and pathways. Moreover, spontaneous mutations can occur on any number
      of genetic backgrounds, potentially revealing critical genes that require a
      specific genetic context. Here we report discovery and phenotyping of 43
      craniofacial mouse models, derived primarily from a screen for spontaneous
      mutations in production colonies at the Jackson Laboratory. We identify the
      causative gene for 33 lines, including novel genes in pathways not previously
      connected to craniofacial development, and novel alleles of known genes that
      present with unique phenotypes. Together with our detailed characterization, this
      work provides a valuable gene discovery resource for the craniofacial community, 
      and a rich source of mouse models for further investigation.

TI  - ADAM13 cleavage of cadherin-11 promotes CNC migration independently of the
      homophilic binding site.

AB  - The cranial neural crest (CNC) is a highly motile population of cells that is
      responsible for forming the face and jaw in all vertebrates and perturbing their 
      migration can lead to craniofacial birth defects. Cell motility requires a
      dynamic modification of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. In the CNC, cleavage 
      of the cell adhesion molecule cadherin-11 by ADAM13 is essential for cell
      migration. This cleavage generates a shed extracellular fragment of cadherin-11
      (EC1-3) that possesses pro-migratory activity via an unknown mechanism.
      Cadherin-11 plays an important role in modulating contact inhibition of
      locomotion (CIL) in the CNC to regulate directional cell migration. Here, we show
      that while the integral cadherin-11 requires the homophilic binding site to
      promote CNC migration in vivo, the EC1-3 fragment does not. In addition, we show 
      that increased ADAM13 activity or expression of the EC1-3 fragment increases CNC 
      invasiveness in vitro and blocks the repulsive CIL response in colliding cells.
      This activity requires the presence of an intact homophilic binding site on the
      EC1-3 suggesting that the cleavage fragment may function as a competitive
      inhibitor of cadherin-11 adhesion in CIL but not to promote cell migration in
      vivo.

AB  - Cleft palate is among the most common human birth defects. Submucous cleft palate
      (SMCP) is a subgroup of cleft palate, which may be as common as overt cleft
      palate. Despite the high frequency of SMCP in humans, only recently have several 
      animal models of SMCP begun to provide insight into the mechanisms by which SMCP 
      develops. In this study, we show that enhanced BMP signaling through
      constitutively active ACVR1 in palatal epithelium causes submucous cleft palate
      in mice. In these mutant mice, the fusion of both palatal mesenchyme in hard
      palate, and muscles in soft palate were hampered by epithelial tissue. During
      palatal fusion, enhanced SMAD-dependent BMP signaling impaired cell death and
      altered cell proliferation rate in medial edge epithelium (MEE), and resulted in 
      MEE persistence. At the molecular level, downregulation of DeltaNp63, which is
      crucial for normal palatal fusion, in MEE cells was impaired, leading to a
      reduction in caspase-3 activation. Our study provides a new insight into the
      etiology of SMCP caused by augmented BMP signaling.

AB  - Signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) generates diverse
      developmental patterns. This requires precise control over the location and
      intensity of signaling. Elucidation of these regulatory mechanisms is important
      for understanding development and disease pathogenesis. In Caenorhabditis
      elegans, LIN-3/EGF induces vulval formation in the mid-body, which requires
      LET-23/EGFR activation only in P6.p, the vulval progenitor nearest the LIN-3
      source. To identify mechanisms regulating this signaling pattern, we screened for
      mutations that cooperate with a let-23 gain-of-function allele to cause ectopic
      vulval induction. Here, we describe a dominant gain-of-function mutation in
      swsn-4, a component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes. Loss-of-function
      mutations in multiple SWI/SNF components reveal that weak reduction in SWI/SNF
      activity causes ectopic vulval induction, while stronger reduction prevents
      adoption of vulval fates, a phenomenon also observed with increasing loss of
      LET-23 activity. High levels of LET-23 expression in P6.p are thought to locally 
      sequester LIN-3, thereby preventing ectopic vulval induction, with slight
      reductions in its expression interfering with LIN-3 sequestration, but not vulval
      fate signaling. We find that SWI/SNF positively regulates LET-23 expression in
      P6.p descendants, providing an explanation for the similarities between let-23
      and SWI/SNF mutant phenotypes. However, SWI/SNF regulation of LET-23 expression
      is cell-specific, with SWI/SNF repressing its expression in the ALA neuron. The
      swsn-4 gain-of-function mutation affects the PTH domain, and provides the first
      evidence that its auto-inhibitory function in yeast Sth1p is conserved in
      metazoan chromatin remodelers. Finally, our work supports broad use of SWI/SNF in
      regulating EGFR signaling during development, and suggests that dominant SWI/SNF 
      mutations in certain human congenital anomaly syndromes may be gain-of-functions.

AB  - Fertilization is a central event in sexual reproduction, and understanding its
      molecular mechanisms has both basic and applicative biological importance. Recent
      studies have uncovered the molecules that mediate this process in a variety of
      organisms, making it intriguing to consider conservation and evolution of the
      mechanisms of sexual reproduction across phyla. The social amoeba Dictyostelium
      discoideum undergoes sexual maturation and forms gametes under dark and humid
      conditions. It exhibits three mating types, type-I, -II, and -III, for the
      heterothallic mating system. Based on proteome analyses of the gamete membranes, 
      we detected expression of two homologs of the plant fertilization protein
      HAP2-GCS1. When their coding genes were disrupted in type-I and type-II strains, 
      sexual potency was completely lost, whereas disruption in the type-III strain did
      not affect mating behavior, suggesting that the latter acts as female in complex 
      organisms. Our results demonstrate the highly conserved function of HAP2-GCS1 in 
      gamete interactions and suggest the presence of additional allo-recognition
      mechanisms in D. discoideum gametes.

AB  - The secondary palate separates the oral from the nasal cavity and its closure
      during embryonic development is sensitive to genetic perturbations. Mice with
      deleted Foxf2, encoding a forkhead transcription factor, are born with cleft
      palate, and an abnormal tongue morphology has been proposed as the underlying
      cause. Here, we show that Foxf2(-/-) maxillary explants cultured in vitro, in the
      absence of tongue and mandible, failed to close the secondary palate.
      Proliferation and collagen content were decreased in Foxf2(-/-) palatal shelf
      mesenchyme. Phosphorylation of Smad2/3 was reduced in mutant palatal shelf,
      diagnostic of attenuated canonical Tgfbeta signaling, whereas phosphorylation of 
      p38 was increased. The amount of Tgfbeta2 protein was diminished, whereas the
      Tgfb2 mRNA level was unaltered. Expression of several genes encoding
      extracellular proteins important for Tgfbeta signaling were reduced in
      Foxf2(-)(/)(-) palatal shelves: a fibronectin splice-isoform essential for
      formation of extracellular Tgfbeta latency complexes; Tgfbr3 - or betaglycan -
      which acts as a co-receptor and an extracellular reservoir of Tgfbeta; and
      integrins alphaV and beta1, which are both Tgfbeta targets and required for
      activation of latent Tgfbeta. Decreased proliferation and reduced extracellular
      matrix content are consistent with diminished Tgfbeta signaling. We therefore
      propose that gene expression changes in palatal shelf mesenchyme that lead to
      reduced Tgfbeta signaling contribute to cleft palate in Foxf2(-)(/)(-) mice.

AB  - Growing evidence in diverse organisms shows that genes originally thought to
      function uniquely in the germ line may also function in somatic cells, and in
      some cases even contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we review the somatic functions
      of Vasa, one of the most conserved "germ line" factors among metazoans. Vasa
      expression in somatic cells is tightly regulated and often transient during
      normal development, and appears to play essential roles in regulation of
      embryonic cells and regenerative tissues. Its dysregulation, however, is believed
      to be an important element of tumorigenic cell regulation. In this perspectives
      paper, we propose how some conserved functions of Vasa may be selected for
      somatic cell regulation, including its potential impact on efficient and
      localized translational activities and in some cases on cellular malfunctioning
      and tumorigenesis.

AB  - In order to interact with the egg and undergo acrosomal exocytosis or the
      acrosome reaction (AR), mammalian spermatozoa must undergo a series of
      biochemical changes in the female reproductive tract, collectively called
      capacitation. We showed that F-actin is formed during sperm capacitation and fast
      depolymerization occurs prior to the AR. We hypothesized that F-actin protects
      the sperm from undergoing spontaneous-AR (sAR) which decreases fertilization
      rate. We show that activation of the actin-severing protein gelsolin induces a
      significant increase in sAR. Moreover, inhibition of CaMKII or PLD during sperm
      capacitation, caused an increase in sAR and inhibition of F-actin formation.
      Spermine, which leads to PLD activation, was able to reverse the effects of
      CaMKII inhibition on sAR-increase and F-actin-decrease. Furthermore, the increase
      in sAR and the decrease in F-actin caused by the inactivation of the PLD-pathway,
      were reversed by activation of CaMKII using H2O2 or by inhibiting protein
      phosphatase 1 which enhance the phosphorylation and oxidation states of CaMKII.
      These results indicate that two distinct pathways lead to F-actin formation in
      the sperm capacitation process which prevents the occurrence of sAR.

AB  - Drosophila eye development is a complex process that involves many transcription 
      factors (TFs) and interactions with their cofactors and targets. The TF Sine
      oculis (So) and its cofactor Eyes absent (Eya) are highly conserved and are both 
      necessary and sufficient for eye development. Despite their many important roles 
      during development, the direct targets of So are still largely unknown. Therefore
      the So-dependent regulatory network governing eye determination and
      differentiation is poorly understood. In this study, we intersected gene
      expression profiles of so or eya mutant eye tissue prepared from three different 
      developmental stages and identified 1731 differentially expressed genes across
      the Drosophila genome. A combination of co-expression analyses and motif
      discovery identified a set of twelve putative direct So targets, including three 
      known and nine novel targets. We also used our previous So ChIP-seq data to
      assess motif predictions for So and identified a canonical So binding motif.
      Finally, we performed in vivo enhancer reporter assays to test predicted
      enhancers from six candidate target genes and find that at least one enhancer
      from each gene is expressed in the developing eye disc and that their expression 
      patterns overlap with that of So. We furthermore confirmed that the expression
      level of predicted direct So targets, for which antibodies are available, are
      reduced in so or eya post-mitotic knockout eye discs. In summary, we expand the
      set of putative So targets and show for the first time that the combined use of
      expression profiling of so with its cofactor eya is an effective method to
      identify novel So targets. Moreover, since So is highly conserved throughout the 
      metazoa, our results provide the basis for future functional studies in a wide
      variety of organisms.

AB  - Hoxa3(null) mice have severe defects in the development of pharyngeal organs
      including athymia, aparathyroidism, thyroid hypoplasia, and ultimobranchial body 
      persistence, in addition to defects of the throat cartilages and cranial nerves. 
      Some of the structures altered in the Hoxa3(null) mutant embryos are anterior to 
      the described Hoxa3 gene expression boundary: the thyroid, soft palate, and
      lesser hyoid horn. All of these structures develop over time and through the
      interactions of multiple cell types. To investigate the specific cellular targets
      for HOXA3 function in these structures across developmental time, we performed a 
      comprehensive analysis of the temporal and tissue-specific requirements for
      Hoxa3, including a lineage analysis using Hoxa3(Cre). The combination of these
      approaches showed that HOXA3 functions in both a cell autonomous and non-cell
      autonomous manner during development of the 3rd and 4th arch derivatives, and
      functions in a neural crest cell (NCC)-specific, non-cell autonomous manner for
      structures that were Hoxa3-negative by lineage tracing. Our data indicate that
      HOXA3 is required for tissue organization and organ differentiation in endodermal
      cells (in the tracheal epithelium, thymus, and parathyroid), and contributes to
      organ migration and morphogenesis in NCCs. These data provide a detailed picture 
      of where and when HOXA3 acts to promote the development of the diverse structures
      that are altered in the Hoxa3(null) mutant. Data presented here, combined with
      our previous studies, indicate that the regionally restricted defects in Hoxa3
      mutants do not reflect a role in positional identity (establishment of cell or
      tissue fate), but instead indicate a wider variety of functions including
      controlling distinct genetic programs for differentiation and morphogenesis in
      different cell types during development.

AB  - The processes of development leading up to gastrulation have been markedly
      altered during the evolution of amniotes, and it is uncertain how the mechanisms 
      of axis formation are conserved and diverged between mouse and chick embryos. To 
      assess the conservation and divergence of these mechanisms, this study examined
      gene expression patterns during the axis formation process in Chinese soft-shell 
      turtle and Madagascar ground gecko preovipositional embryos. The data suggest
      that NODAL signaling, similarly to avian embryos but in contrast to eutherian
      embryos, does not have a role in epiblast and hypoblast development in reptilian 
      embryos. The posterior marginal epiblast (PME) is the initial molecular landmark 
      of axis formation in reptilian embryos prior to primitive plate development.
      Ontogenetically, PME may be the precursor of the primitive plate, and
      phylogenetically, Koller's sickle and posterior marginal zone in avian
      development may have been derived from the PME. Most of the genes expressed in
      the mouse anterior visceral endoderm (AVE genes), especially signaling antagonist
      genes, are not expressed in the hypoblast of turtle and gecko embryos, though
      they are expressed in the avian hypoblast. This study proposes that AVE gene
      expression in the hypoblast and the visceral endoderm could have been
      independently established in avian and eutherian lineages, similar to the
      primitive streak that has been independently acquired in these lineages.

TI  - Drosophila male and female germline stem cell niches require the nuclear lamina
      protein Otefin.
PG  - 75-86
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.05.001 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear lamina is an extensive protein network that underlies the inner
      nuclear envelope. This network includes the LAP2-emerin-MAN1-domain (LEM-D)
      protein family, proteins that share an association with the chromatin binding
      protein Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). Loss of individual LEM-D
      proteins causes progressive, tissue-restricted diseases, known as laminopathies. 
      Mechanisms associated with laminopathies are not yet understood. Here we present 
      our studies of one of the Drosophila nuclear lamina LEM-D proteins, Otefin (Ote),
      a homologue of emerin. Previous studies have shown that Ote is autonomously
      required for the survival of female germline stem cells (GSCs). We demonstrate
      that Ote is also required for survival of somatic cells in the ovarian niche,
      with loss of Ote causing a decrease in cap cell number and altered signal
      transduction. We show germ cell-restricted expression of Ote rescues these
      defects, revealing a non-autonomous function for Ote in niche maintenance and
      emphasizing that GSCs contribute to the maintenance of their own niches. Further,
      we investigate the requirement of Ote in the male fertility. We show that ote
      mutant males become prematurely sterile as they age. Parallel to observations in 
      females, this sterility is associated with GSC loss and changes in somatic cells 
      of the niche, phenotypes that are largely rescued by germ cell-restricted Ote
      expression. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that Ote is required
      autonomously for survival of two stem cell populations, as well as
      non-autonomously for maintenance of two somatic niches. Finally, our data add to 
      growing evidence that LEM-D proteins have critical roles in stem cell survival
      and tissue homeostasis.

AB  - The protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 (PIAS1) is one of the few known SUMO E3
      ligases. PIAS1 has been implicated in several biological processes including
      repression of innate immunity and DNA repair. However, PIAS1 function during
      development and tissue differentiation has not been studied. Here, we report that
      Pias1 is required for proper embryonic development. Approximately 90% of Pias1
      null embryos die in utero between E10.5 and E12.5. We found significant apoptosis
      within the yolk sac (YS) blood vessels and concomitant loss of red blood cells
      (RBCs) resulting in profound anemia. In addition, Pias1 loss impairs YS
      angiogenesis and results in defective capillary plexus formation and blood vessel
      occlusions. Moreover, heart development is impaired as a result of loss of
      myocardium muscle mass. Accordingly, we found that Pias1 expression in primary
      myoblasts enhances the induction of cardiac muscle genes MyoD, Myogenin and
      Myomaker. PIAS1 protein regulation of cardiac gene transcription is dependent on 
      transcription factors Myocardin and Gata-4. Finally, endothelial cell specific
      inactivation of Pias1 in vivo impairs YS erythrogenesis, angiogenesis and
      recapitulates loss of myocardium muscle mass. However, these defects are not
      sufficient to recapitulate the lethal phenotype of Pias1 null embryos. These
      findings highlight Pias1 as an essential gene for YS erythropoiesis and
      vasculogenesis in vivo.

AB  - Cephalopods possess the most complex centralized nervous system among molluscs
      and the molecular determinants of its development have only begun to be explored.
      To better understand how evolved their brain and body axes, we studied Sepia
      officinalis embryos and investigated the expression patterns of neural
      regionalization genes involved in the mediolateral patterning of the
      neuroectoderm in model species. SoxB1 expression reveals that the embryonic
      neuroectoderm is made of several distinct territories that constitute a large
      part of the animal pole disc. Concentric nkx2.1, pax6/gsx, and
      pax3/7/msx/pax2/5/8 positive domains subdivide this neuroectoderm. Looking from
      dorsal to ventral sides, the sequence of these expressions is reminiscent of the 
      mediolateral subdivision in model species, which provides good evidence for
      "mediolateral patterning" conservation in cephalopods. A specific feature of
      cephalopod development, however, includes an unconventional orientation to this
      mediolateral sequence: median markers (like nkx2.1) are unexpectedly expressed at
      the periphery of the cuttlefish embryo and lateral markers (like Pax3/7) are
      expressed centrally. As the egg is rich with yolk, the lips of the blastopore
      (that classically organizes the neural midline) remain unclosed at the lateral
      side of the animal pole until late stages of organogenesis, therefore reversing
      the whole embryo topology. These findings confirm - by means of molecular tools -
      the location of both ventral and dorsal poles in cephalopod embryos.

AB  - Cell death can have both cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles in normal
      development. Previous studies have shown that the central cell death regulators
      grim and reaper are required for the developmentally important elimination of
      stem cells and neurons in the developing central nervous system (CNS). Here we
      show that cell death in the nervous system is also required for normal muscle
      development. In the absence of grim and reaper, there is an increase in the
      number of fibers in the ventral abdominal muscles in the Drosophila adult. This
      phenotype can be partially recapitulated by inhibition of cell death specifically
      in the CNS, indicating a non-autonomous role for neuronal death in limiting
      muscle fiber number. We also show that FGFs produced in the cell death defective 
      nervous system are required for the increase in muscle fiber number. Cell death
      in the muscle lineage during pupal stages also plays a role in specifying fiber
      number. Our work suggests that FGFs from the CNS act as a survival signal for
      muscle founder cells. Thus, proper muscle fiber specification requires cell death
      in both the nervous system and in the developing muscle itself.

AB  - The de novo generation of hematopoietic cells occurs during midgestation when a
      population of endothelial cells called hemogenic endothelium transitions into
      hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells. In mammalian embryos, the newly formed 
      hematopoietic cells form clusters in the lumens of the major arteries in the
      embryo proper and in the vascular plexus of the yolk sac. Small clusters of
      hematopoietic cells that are independent of the vasculature (referred to here as 
      extravascular islands) were shown to form in the mesentery during vascular
      remodeling of the vitelline artery. Using three-dimensional imaging of whole
      mouse embryos we demonstrate that extravascular budding of hematopoietic clusters
      is a more widespread phenomenon that occurs from the vitelline and the umbilical 
      arteries both proximal to the embryo proper and distal in the extraembryonic yolk
      sac and placenta. Furthermore, we show that there are several mechanisms by which
      hematopoietic clusters leave the arteries, including vascular remodeling and
      extrusion. Lastly, we provide static images suggesting that extravascular islands
      contribute to the formation of new blood vessels. Thus, extravascular islands may
      represent a novel mechanism of vasculogenesis whereby established vessels
      contribute endothelial and hematopoietic cells to developing vascular beds.

AB  - Formation of the heart tube requires synchronized migration of endocardial and
      myocardial precursors. Our previous studies indicated that in
      S1pr2/Galpha13-deficient embryos, impaired endoderm convergence disrupted the
      medial migration of myocardial precursors, resulting in the formation of two
      myocardial populations. Here we show that endoderm convergence also regulates
      endocardial migration. In embryos defective for S1pr2/Galpha13 signaling,
      endocardial precursors failed to migrate towards the midline, and the presumptive
      endocardium surrounded the bilaterally-located myocardial cells rather than being
      encompassed by them. In vivo imaging of control embryos revealed that, like their
      myocardial counterparts, endocardial precursors migrated with the converging
      endoderm, though from a more anterior point, then moved from the dorsal to the
      ventral side of the endoderm (subduction), and finally migrated posteriorly
      towards myocardial precursors, ultimately forming the inner layer of the heart
      tube. In embryos defective for endoderm convergence due to an S1pr2/Galpha13
      deficiency, both the medial migration and the subduction of endocardial
      precursors were impaired, and their posterior migration towards the myocardial
      precursors was premature. This placed them medial to the myocardial populations, 
      physically blocking the medial migration of the myocardial precursors.
      Furthermore, contact between the endocardial and myocardial precursor populations
      disrupted the epithelial architecture of the myocardial precursors, and thus
      their medial migration; in embryos depleted of endocardial cells, the myocardial 
      migration defect was partially rescued. Our data indicate that endoderm
      convergence regulates the medial migration of endocardial precursors, and that
      premature association of the endocardial and myocardial populations contributes
      to myocardial migration defects observed in S1pr2/Galpha13-deficient embryos. The
      demonstration that endoderm convergence regulates the synchronized migration of
      endocardial and myocardial precursors reveals a new role of the endoderm in heart
      development.

AB  - It is now becoming evident that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is constantly
      produced by nearly all cells, contributes to bona fide physiological processes.
      However, little is known regarding the distribution and functions of H2O2 during 
      embryonic development. To address this question, we used a dedicated genetic
      sensor and revealed a highly dynamic spatio-temporal pattern of H2O2 levels
      during zebrafish morphogenesis. The highest H2O2 levels are observed during
      somitogenesis and organogenesis, and these levels gradually decrease in the
      mature tissues. Biochemical and pharmacological approaches revealed that H2O2
      distribution is mainly controlled by its enzymatic degradation. Here we show that
      H2O2 is enriched in different regions of the developing brain and demonstrate
      that it participates to axonal guidance. Retinal ganglion cell axonal projections
      are impaired upon H2O2 depletion and this defect is rescued by H2O2 or ectopic
      activation of the Hedgehog pathway. We further show that ex vivo, H2O2 directly
      modifies Hedgehog secretion. We propose that physiological levels of H2O2
      regulate RGCs axonal growth through the modulation of Hedgehog pathway.

TI  - Bhlhb5::flpo allele uncovers a requirement for Bhlhb5 for the development of the 
      dorsal cochlear nucleus.

AB  - Auditory information is initially processed in the cochlear nuclei before being
      relayed to the brain. The cochlear nuclei are subdivided into dorsal, anterior
      ventral, and posterior ventral domains, each containing several subtypes of
      neurons that are thought to play discrete roles in the processing of sound.
      However, the ontogeny of these neurons is poorly understood, and this gap in
      knowledge hampers efforts to understand the basic neural circuitry of this
      nucleus. Here, we reveal that Bhlhb5 is expressed in both excitatory (unipolar
      brush cells) and inhibitory neurons (cartwheel cells) of the DCN during
      development. To gain genetic access to Bhlhb5-expressing neurons in the DCN, we
      generated a Bhlhb5::flpo knockin allele. Using an intersectional genetic
      strategy, we labeled cartwheel cells, thereby providing proof of concept that
      subpopulations of Bhlhb5-expressing neurons can be genetically targeted.
      Moreover, fate-mapping experiments using this allele revealed that Bhlhb5 is
      required for the proper development of the DCN, since mice lacking Bhlhb5 showed 
      a dramatically diminished number of neurons, including unipolar brush and
      cartwheel cells. Intriguingly, the Bhlhb5::flpo allele also genetically labels
      numerous other regions of the nervous system that process sensory input,
      including the dorsal horn, the retina, and the nucleus of the lateral olfactory
      tract, hinting at a more general role for Bhlhb5 in the development of neurons
      that mediate sensory integration.

AB  - Epithelial stem cells undergo constant self-renewal and differentiation to
      maintain the homeostasis of epithelial tissues that undergo rapid turnover.
      Recent studies have shown that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which
      is primarily mediated by Snail via the suppression of E-cadherin, is able to
      generate cells with stem cell properties. However, the role of Snail in
      epithelial stem cells remains unclear. Here, we report that Snail directly
      controls proliferation of follicle stem cells (FSCs) in Drosophila females.
      Disruption of Snail expression in FSCs compromises their proliferation, but not
      their maintenance. Conversely, FSCs with excessive Snail expression display
      increased proliferation and lifespan, which is accompanied by a moderate decrease
      in the expression of E-cadherin (required for adhesion of FSCs to their niche) at
      the junction between their adjacent cells, indicating a conserved role of Snail
      in E-cadherin inhibition, which promote epithelial cell proliferation.
      Interestingly, a decrease in E-cadherin in snail-knock down FSCs does not restore
      the decreased proliferation of snail-knock down FSCs, suggesting that adhesion
      strength of FSCs to their niche is dispensable for Snail-mediated FSC division.
      Our results demonstrate that Snail controls epithelial stem cell division
      independently of its known role in the EMT, which contributes to induction of
      cancer stem cells.

      differentiation by regulating a Wnt signaling niche in the lung.

AB  - The commitment and differentiation of the alveolar type I (AT1) cell lineage is a
      critical step for the formation of distal lung saccules, which are the primitive 
      alveolar units required for postnatal respiration. How AT1 cells arise from the
      distal lung epithelial progenitor cells prior to birth and whether this process
      depends on a developmental niche instructed by mesenchymal cells is poorly
      understood. We show that mice lacking histone deacetylase 3 specifically in the
      developing lung mesenchyme display lung hypoplasia including decreased
      mesenchymal proliferation and a severe impairment of AT1 cell differentiation.
      This is correlated with a decrease in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the lung
      epithelium. We demonstrate that inhibition of Wnt signaling causes defective AT1 
      cell lineage differentiation ex vivo. Importantly, systemic activation of Wnt
      signaling at specific stages of lung development can partially rescue the AT1
      cell differentiation defect in vivo. These studies show that histone deacetylase 
      3 expression generates an important developmental niche in the lung mesenchyme
      through regulation of Wnt signaling, which is required for proper AT1 cell
      differentiation and lung sacculation.

AB  - Ensheathment of axons by glial processes is essential for normal brain function. 
      While considerable progress has been made to define molecular and cellular
      mechanisms underlying the maintenance of axon ensheathment, less is known about
      molecular details of early events for the wrapping of axons by glial processes in
      the developing nervous system. In this study, we investigate the role of the
      transmembrane protein Borderless (Bdl) in the developing Drosophila visual
      system. Bdl belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, and its in vivo
      function is unknown. We show that Bdl is expressed in wrapping glia (WG) in the
      developing eye disc. Cell-type-specific transgene rescue and knockdown indicate
      that Bdl is specifically required in WG for the extension of glial processes
      along photoreceptor axons in the optic lobe, and axon ensheathment. Our results
      identify Bdl as a novel glia-specific cell-surface recognition molecule in
      regulating glial extension and axon ensheathment.

AB  - Cell migration plays crucial roles during development. An excellent model to
      study coordinated cell movements is provided by the migration of border cell
      clusters within a developing Drosophila egg chamber. In a mutagenesis screen, we 
      isolated two alleles of the gene rickets (rk) encoding a G-protein-coupled
      receptor. The rk alleles result in border cell migration defects in a significant
      fraction of egg chambers. In rk mutants, border cells are properly specified and 
      express the marker Slbo. Yet, analysis of both fixed as well as live samples
      revealed that some single border cells lag behind the main border cell cluster
      during migration, or, in other cases, the entire border cell cluster can remain
      tethered to the anterior epithelium as it migrates. These defects are observed
      significantly more often in mosaic border cell clusters, than in full mutant
      clusters. Reduction of the Rk ligand, Bursicon, in the border cell cluster also
      resulted in migration defects, strongly suggesting that Rk signaling is utilized 
      for communication within the border cell cluster itself. The mutant border cell
      clusters show defects in localization of the adhesion protein E-cadherin, and
      apical polarity proteins during migration. E-cadherin mislocalization occurs in
      mosaic clusters, but not in full mutant clusters, correlating well with the rk
      border cell migration phenotype. Our work has identified a receptor with a
      previously unknown role in border cell migration that appears to regulate
      detachment and polarity of the border cell cluster coordinating processes within 
      the cells of the cluster themselves.

AB  - Angioblasts of the developing vascular system require many signaling inputs to
      initiate their migration, proliferation and differentiation into endothelial
      cells. What is less studied is which intrinsic cell factors interpret these
      extrinsic signals. Here, we show the Lim homeodomain transcription factor islet2a
      (isl2a) is expressed in the lateral posterior mesoderm prior to angioblast
      migration. isl2a deficient angioblasts show disorganized migration to the midline
      to form axial vessels and fail to spread around the tailbud of the embryo. Isl2a 
      morphants have fewer vein cells and decreased vein marker expression. We
      demonstrate that isl2a is required cell autonomously in angioblasts to promote
      their incorporation into the vein, and is permissive for vein identity. Knockout 
      of isl2a results in decreased migration and proliferation of angioblasts during
      intersegmental artery growth. Since Notch signaling controls both artery-vein
      identity and tip-stalk cell formation, we explored the interaction of isl2a and
      Notch. We find that isl2a expression is negatively regulated by Notch activity,
      and that isl2a positively regulates flt4, a VEGF-C receptor repressed by Notch
      during angiogenesis. Thus Isl2a may act as an intermediate between Notch
      signaling and genetic programs controlling angioblast number and migration,
      placing it as a novel transcriptional regulator of early angiogenesis.

AB  - In vertebrates, stomach smooth muscle development is a complex process that
      involves the tight transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of
      different signalling pathways. Here, we identified the RNA-binding protein
      Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1) as an early marker of developing
      and undifferentiated stomach mesenchyme. Using a gain-of-function approach, we
      found that in chicken embryos, sustained expression of ESRP1 impairs stomach
      smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation and FGFR2 splicing profile. ESRP1
      overexpression in primary differentiated stomach SMCs induced their
      dedifferentiation, promoted specific-FGFR2b splicing and decreased
      FGFR2c-dependent activity. Moreover, co-expression of ESRP1 and RBPMS2, another
      RNA-binding protein that regulates SMC plasticity and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 
      (BMP) pathway inhibition, synergistically promoted SMC dedifferentiation.
      Finally, we also demonstrated that ESRP1 interacts with RBPMS2 and that
      RBPMS2-mediated SMC dedifferentiation requires ESRP1. Altogether, these results
      show that ESRP1 is expressed also in undifferentiated stomach mesenchyme and
      demonstrate its role in SMC development and plasticity.

AB  - The importance of canonical Wnt signaling to murine uterine development is well
      established. Mouse models in which uterine-specific Wnt ligands, beta-catenin, or
      Lef1 are disrupted result in failure of postnatal endometrial gland development. 
      Sox17 is a transcription factor characterized in numerous tissues as an
      antagonist of Wnt signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that conditional ablation of
      Sox17 would lead to hyperproliferation of endometrial glands in mice. Contrary to
      our prediction, disruption of Sox17 in epithelial and stromal compartments led to
      inhibition of endometrial adenogenesis and a loss of reproductive capacity.
      Epithelium-specific Sox17 disruption resulted in normal adenogenesis although
      reproductive capacity remained impaired. These findings suggest that
      non-epithelial, Sox17-positive cells are necessary for adenogenesis and that
      glands require Sox17 to properly function. To our knowledge, these findings are
      the first to implicate Sox17 in endometrial gland formation and reproductive
      success. The data presented herein underscore the importance of studying Sox17 in
      uterine homeostasis and function.

AB  - Much progress has been made in elucidating the molecular networks required for
      specifying retinal cells, including photoreceptors, but the downstream mechanisms
      that maintain identity and regulate differentiation remain poorly understood.
      Here, we report that the transcription factor Glass has a dual role in
      establishing a functional Drosophila eye. Utilizing conditional rescue
      approaches, we confirm that persistent defects in ommatidium patterning combined 
      with cell death correlate with the overall disruption of eye morphology in glass 
      mutants. In addition, we reveal that Glass exhibits a separable role in
      regulating photoreceptor differentiation. In particular, we demonstrate the
      apparent loss of glass mutant photoreceptors is not only due to cell death but
      also a failure of the surviving photoreceptors to complete differentiation.
      Moreover, the late reintroduction of Glass in these developmentally stalled
      photoreceptors is capable of restoring differentiation in the absence of correct 
      ommatidium patterning. Mechanistically, transcription profiling at the time of
      differentiation reveals that Glass is necessary for the expression of many genes 
      implicated in differentiation, i.e. rhabdomere morphogenesis, phototransduction, 
      and synaptogenesis. Specifically, we show Glass directly regulates the expression
      of Pph13, which encodes a transcription factor necessary for opsin expression and
      rhabdomere morphogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of Glass to
      choreograph photoreceptor differentiation is conserved between Drosophila and
      Tribolium, two holometabolous insects. Altogether, our work identifies a
      fundamental regulatory mechanism to generate the full complement of cells
      required for a functional rhabdomeric visual system and provides a critical
      framework to investigate the basis of differentiation and maintenance of
      photoreceptor identity.

AB  - Glypicans are members of the heparan sulfate (HS) subfamily of proteoglycans that
      can function in cell adhesion, cell crosstalk and as modulators of the major
      developmental signalling pathways in bilaterians. The evolutionary origin of
      these multiple functions is not well understood. In this study we investigate the
      role of glypicans in the embryonic and larval development of the sea anemone
      Nematostella vectensis, a member of the non-bilaterian clade Cnidaria.
      Nematostella has two glypican (gpc) genes that are expressed in mutually
      exclusive ectodermal domains, NvGpc1/2/4/6 in a broad aboral domain, and NvGpc3/5
      in narrow oral territory. The endosulfatase NvSulf (an extracellular modifier of 
      HS chains) is expressed in a broad oral domain, partially overlapping with both
      glypicans. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of NvGpc1/2/4/6 leads to an expansion of
      the expression domains of aboral marker genes and a reduction of oral markers at 
      gastrula stage, strikingly similar to knockdown of the Wnt receptor
      NvFrizzled5/8. We further show that treatment with sodium chlorate, an inhibitor 
      of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sulfation, phenocopies knockdown of NvGpc1/2/4/6 at
      gastrula stage. At planula stage, knockdown of NvGpc1/2/4/6 and sodium chlorate
      treatment result in alterations in aboral marker gene expression that suggest
      additional roles in the fine-tuning of patterning within the aboral domain. These
      results reveal a role for NvGpc1/2/4/6 and sulfated GAGs in the patterning of the
      primary body axis in Nematostella and suggest an ancient function in regulating
      Frizzled-mediated Wnt signalling.

AB  - The transcription factor Sox2 is both necessary and sufficient for the generation
      of sensory regions of the inner ear. It regulates expression of the Notch ligand 
      Jag1 in prosensory progenitors, which signal to neighboring cells to up-regulate 
      Sox2 and sustain prosensory identity. However, the expression pattern of Sox2 in 
      the early inner ear is very broad, suggesting that Sox2-expressing progenitors
      form a wide variety of cell types in addition to generating the sensory regions
      of the ear. We used Sox2-CreER mice to follow the fates of Sox2-expressing cells 
      at different stages in ear development. We find that Sox2-expressing cells in the
      early otocyst give rise to large numbers of non-sensory structures throughout the
      inner ear, and that Sox2 only becomes a truly prosensory marker at embryonic day 
      (E)11.5. Our fate map reveals the organ of Corti derives from a central domain on
      the medial side of the otocyst and shows that a significant amount of the organ
      of Corti derives from a Sox2-negative population in this region.

TI  - FoxH1 mediates a Grg4 and Smad2 dependent transcriptional switch in Nodal
      signaling during Xenopus mesoderm development.
PG  - 34-44
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.04.006 [doi]
AB  - In the vertebrate blastula and gastrula the Nodal pathway is essential for
      formation of the primary germ layers and the organizer. Nodal autoregulatory
      feedback potentiates signaling activity, but mechanisms limiting embryonic Nodal 
      ligand transcription are poorly understood. Here we describe a transcriptional
      switch mechanism mediated by FoxH1, the principle effector of Nodal
      autoregulation. FoxH1 contains a conserved engrailed homology (EH1) motif that
      mediates direct binding of groucho-related gene 4 (Grg4), a Groucho family
      corepressor. Nodal-dependent gene expression is suppressed by FoxH1, but enhanced
      by a FoxH1 EH1 mutant, indicating that the EH1 motif is necessary for repression.
      Grg4 blocks Nodal-induced mesodermal gene expression and Nodal autoregulation,
      suggesting that Grg4 limits Nodal pathway activity. Conversely, blocking Grg4
      function in the ectoderm results in ectopic expression of Nodal target genes.
      FoxH1 and Grg4 occupy the Xnr1 enhancer, and Grg4 occupancy is dependent on the
      FoxH1 EH1 motif. Grg4 occupancy at the Xnr1 enhancer significantly decreases with
      Nodal activation or Smad2 overexpression, while FoxH1 occupancy is unaffected.
      These results suggest that Nodal-activated Smad2 physically displaces Grg4 from
      FoxH1, an essential feature of the transcriptional switch mechanism. In support
      of this model, when FoxH1 is unable to bind Smad2, Grg4 occupancy is maintained
      at the Xnr1 enhancer, even in the presence of Nodal signaling. Our findings
      reveal that FoxH1 mediates both activation and repression of Nodal gene
      expression. We propose that this transcriptional switch is essential to delimit
      Nodal pathway activity in vertebrate germ layer formation.

AB  - Early in embryogenesis, maternally deposited transcripts are degraded and new
      zygotic transcripts are generated during the maternal to zygotic transition.
      Recent works have shown that early zygotic transcripts are short compared to
      maternal transcripts, in zebrafish and Drosophila species. The reduced zygotic
      transcript length was attributed to the short cell cycle in these organisms that 
      prevents the transcription of long primary transcripts (intron delay). Here we
      study the length of maternal mRNAs and their degradation kinetics in two sea
      urchin species to further the understanding of maternal gene usage and
      processing. Early zygotic primary transcripts and mRNAs are shorter than maternal
      ones in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Yet, while primary
      transcripts length increases when cell cycle lengthens, typical for intron delay,
      the relatively short length of zygotic mRNAs is consistent. The enhanced mRNA
      length is due to significantly longer maternal open reading frames and 3'UTRs
      compared to the zygotic lengths, a ratio that does not change with developmental 
      time. This implies unique usage of both coding sequences and regulatory
      information in the maternal stage compared to the zygotic stages. We extracted
      the half-lifetimes due to maternal and zygotic degradation mechanisms from
      high-density time course of a set of maternal mRNAs in Paracentrotus lividus. The
      degradation rates due to maternal and zygotic degradation mechanisms are not
      correlated, indicating that these mechanisms are independent and relay on
      different regulatory information. Our studies illuminate specific structural and 
      kinetic properties of sea urchin maternal mRNAs that might be broadly shared by
      other organisms.

AB  - The inner ear is a complex organ comprised of various specialized sensory organs 
      for detecting sound and head movements. The timing of specification for these
      sensory organs, however, is not clear. Previous fate mapping results of the inner
      ear indicate that vestibular and auditory ganglia and two of the vestibular
      sensory organs, the utricular macula (UM) and saccular macula (SM), are lineage
      related. Based on the medial-lateral relationship where respective auditory and
      vestibular neuroblasts exit from the otic epithelium and the subsequent formation
      of the medial SM and lateral UM in these regions, we hypothesized that
      specification of the two lateral structures, the vestibular ganglion and the UM
      are coupled and likewise for the two medial structures, the auditory ganglion and
      the SM. We tested this hypothesis by surgically inverting the primary axes of the
      otic cup in ovo and investigating the fate of the vestibular neurogenic region,
      which had been spotted with a lipophilic dye. Our results showed that the
      laterally-positioned, dye-associated, vestibular ganglion and UM were largely
      normal in transplanted ears, whereas both auditory ganglion and SM showed
      abnormalities suggesting the lateral but not the medial-derived structures were
      mostly specified at the time of transplantation. Both of these results are
      consistent with a temporal coupling between neuronal and macular fate
      specifications.

AB  - Many organs are specified far from the location they occupy when functional,
      having to migrate long distances through the heterogeneous and dynamic
      environment of the early embryo. We study the formation of the main Drosophila
      endocrine organ, the ring gland, as a new model to investigate in vivo the
      genetic regulation of collective cell migration. The ring gland results from the 
      fusion of three independent gland primordia that migrate from the head towards
      the anterior aorta as the embryo is experiencing major morphogenetic movements.
      To complete their long-range migration, the glands extend filopodia moving
      sequentially towards a nearby intermediate target and from there to more distal
      ones. Thus, the apparent long-range migration is composed of several short-range 
      migratory steps that facilitate reaching the final destination. We find that the 
      target tissues react to the gland's proximity by sending filopodia towards it.
      Our finding of a succession of independent migration stages is consistent with
      the stepwise evolution of ring gland assembly and fits with the observed gland
      locations found in extant crustaceans, basal insects and flies.

AB  - CACN-1/Cactin is a conserved protein identified in a genome-wide screen for genes
      that regulate distal tip cell migration in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
      In addition to possessing distal tip cells that migrate past their correct
      stopping point, animals depleted of cacn-1 are sterile. In this study, we show
      that CACN-1 is needed in the soma for proper germ line development and
      maturation. When CACN-1 is depleted, sheath cells are absent and/or abnormal.
      When sheath cells are absent, hermaphrodites produce sperm, but do not switch
      appropriately to oocyte production. When sheath cells are abnormal, some oocytes 
      develop but are not successfully ovulated and undergo endomitotic reduplication
      (Emo). Our previous proteomic studies show that CACN-1 interacts with a network
      of splicing factors. Here, these interactors were screened using RNAi. Depletion 
      of many of these factors led to missing or abnormal sheath cells and germ line
      defects, particularly absent and/or Emo oocytes. These results suggest CACN-1 is 
      part of a protein network that influences somatic gonad development and function 
      through alternative splicing or post-transcriptional gene regulation.

AB  - We analyzed the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the adhesive and
      migratory behavior of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) during their collective 
      migration within the developing mouse gut. We aimed to decipher the role of the
      complement anaphylatoxin C3a during this process, because this well-known immune 
      system attractant has been implicated in cephalic NCC co-attraction, a process
      controlling directional migration. We used the conditional Ht-PA-cre transgenic
      mouse model allowing a specific ablation of the N-cadherin gene and the
      expression of a fluorescent reporter in migratory ENCCs without affecting the
      central nervous system. We performed time-lapse videomicroscopy of ENCCs from
      control and N-cadherin mutant gut explants cultured on fibronectin (FN) and
      micropatterned FN-stripes with C3a or C3aR antagonist, and studied cell migration
      behavior with the use of triangulation analysis to quantify cell dispersion. We
      performed ex vivo gut cultures with or without C3aR antagonist to determine the
      effect on ENCC behavior. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze the cell-matrix 
      adhesion properties. We provide the first demonstration of the localization of
      the complement anaphylatoxin C3a and its receptor on ENCCs during their migration
      in the embryonic gut. C3aR receptor inhibition alters ENCC adhesion and
      migration, perturbing directionality and increasing cell dispersion both in vitro
      and ex vivo. N-cadherin-null ENCCs do not respond to C3a co-attraction. These
      findings indicate that C3a regulates cell migration in a N-cadherin-dependent
      process. Our results shed light on the role of C3a in regulating collective and
      directional cell migration, and in ganglia network organization during enteric
      nervous system ontogenesis. The detection of an immune system chemokine in ENCCs 
      during ENS development may also shed light on new mechanisms for gastrointestinal
      disorders.

AB  - G-protein signaling is known to be required for cell-cell contacts during the
      development of the Drosophila dorsal vessel. However, the identity of the G
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates this signaling pathway activity is
      unknown. Here we describe the identification of a novel cardiac specific GPCR,
      called Gia, for "GPCR in aorta". Gia is the only heart-specific GPCR identified
      in Drosophila to date and it is specifically expressed in cardioblasts that fuse 
      at the dorsal midline to become the aorta. Gia is the only Drosophila gene so far
      identified for which expression is entirely restricted to cells of the aorta.
      Deletion of Gia led to a broken-hearted phenotype, characterized by pericardial
      cells dissociated from cardioblasts and abnormal distribution of cell junction
      proteins. Both phenotypes were similar to those observed in mutants of the
      heterotrimeric cardiac G proteins. Lack of Gia also led to defects in the
      alignment and fusion of cardioblasts in the aorta. Gia forms a protein complex
      with G-alphao47A, the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric cardiac G proteins and 
      interacts genetically with G-alphao47A during cardiac morphogenesis. Our study
      identified Gia as an essential aorta-specific GPCR that functions upstream of
      cardiac heterotrimeric G proteins and is required for morphological integrity of 
      the aorta during heart tube formation. These studies lead to a redefinition of
      the bro phenotype, to encompass morphological integrity of the heart tube as well
      as cardioblast-pericardial cell spatial interactions.

      progenitor cell specification.

AB  - The Olig2 basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor promotes oligodendrocyte
      specification in early neural progenitor cells (NPCs), including radial glial
      cells, in part by recruiting SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes to the
      enhancers of genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation. How Olig2
      expression is regulated during oligodendrogliogenesis is not clear. Here, we find
      that the Brg1 subunit of SWI/SNF complexes interacts with a proximal Olig2
      promoter and represses Olig2 transcription in the mouse cortex at E14, when
      oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) are not yet found in this location. Brg1 does 
      not interact with the Olig2 promoter in the E14 ganglionic eminence, where NPCs
      differentiate into Olig2-positive OPCs. Consistent with these findings, Brg1-null
      NPCs demonstrate precocious expression of Olig2 in the cortex. However, these
      cells fail to differentiate into OPCs. We further find that Brg1 is necessary for
      neuroepithelial-to-radial glial cell transition, but not neuronal differentiation
      despite a reduction in expression of the pro-neural transcription factor Pax6.
      Collectively, these and earlier findings support a model whereby Brg1 promotes
      neurogenic radial glial progenitor cell specification but is dispensable for
      neuronal differentiation. Concurrently, Brg1 represses Olig2 expression and the
      specification of OPCs, but is required for OPC differentiation and
      oligodendrocyte maturation.

AB  - A pair of massive secretory cells exists within each thoracic and the nine
      abdominal segments of Manduca larvae. Each of these cells is nestled between the 
      dorsal integument and underlying muscles. Contents of large vacuoles in these
      cells are abruptly discharged at each molt and have always been considered to
      contribute to shedding and/or formation of cuticle. Peanut agglutinin is a
      specific lectin label for these secretory vacuoles; vacuoles label intensely
      immediately before each molt as vacuoles attain their maximal size. Contents of
      vacuoles are restored after each molt and throughout most of each intermolt.
      During the molt cycle these cells secrete contents of their vacuoles into the
      interior hemocoel rather than onto the exterior cuticle. Vacuoles discharge via a
      distinctive mechanism involving partitioning of contents into numerous vesicles
      that move to the cell surface. Dermal secretory cells were dissected from larvae 
      before and after the 4th-5th instar molt. Proteins from pre-molt and post-molt
      secretory cells were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis to establish
      which proteins are discharged at the molt. While secreted proteins are novel, all
      have presumptive roles in immune responses. Dermal secretory cells may represent 
      a new, unsuspected component of the innate immune system that release their
      proteins during the vulnerable molting period of an insect's life.

AB  - Insect segment number within species appears to be fixed irrespective of germ
      types: long vs. short/intermediate. The present study showed induction of
      supernumerary segment formation by the knockdown of Bombyx hunchback (Bm-hb),
      presumably by terminal segment addition, a short/intermediate-like-segmentation
      mode that is not observed in normal Bombyx embryogenesis. This suggests that
      Bm-hb suppresses segmentation. The results obtained also suggest that the gap
      gene Bm-Kr (Bombyx Kruppel) provides a permissive environment for the progression
      of segmentation by suppressing the expression Bm-hb, which terminates
      segmentation. This indicates a novel mechanism by which the gap gene is involved 
      in segmentation. It appears that Bm-Kr and Bm-hb are involved in segment counting
      and their interplay contributes to the correct number of segments being formed in
      Bombyx. Similar mechanisms may be operating in insects that employ the
      non-Drosophilan mode of segmentation such as in short/intermediate-germ insects.

AB  - The roof plate is a crucial signaling center located at the dorsal midline of the
      developing central nervous system (CNS) along its rostro-caudal axis. By virtue
      of secreting multiple signaling molecules, it regulates diverse processes such as
      specification of dorsal fate, proliferation and axon guidance. In the forebrain, 
      the roof plate is not only involved in patterning but is also involved in the
      division of the single forebrain vesicle into the two cerebral hemispheres, the
      failure of which leads to certain forms of holoprosencephaly. Although several
      molecular players such as Fgfs, BMPs, Wnts and Shh have been identified as
      crucial regulators of development of the forebrain, little is known about how
      they interact to bring about the morphological changes associated with the
      division of the forebrain vesicle into the cerebral hemispheres. Recent studies
      have now identified the dorsal mesenchyme as an additional source of signaling
      cues, which is likely to influence the division of the forebrain vesicle into
      cerebral hemispheres. In this review, we discuss the current understanding about 
      the molecular mechanisms of roof plate mediated patterning and morphogenesis of
      the forebrain including some recently identified factors that influence this
      process and also highlight the gaps in our knowledge that remain.

AB  - The Drosophila ostia are valve-like structures in the heart with functional
      similarity to vertebrate cardiac valves. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway
      is critical for valve development in zebrafish and mouse, but the key ligand(s)
      for valve induction remains unclear. We observed high levels of Wnt4 gene
      expression in Drosophila ostia progenitor cells, immediately prior to
      morphological differentiation of these cells associated with ostia formation.
      This differentiation was blocked in Wnt4 mutants and in flies expressing
      canonical Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors but not inhibitors of the planar cell 
      polarity pathway. High levels of Wnt4 dependent activation of a canonical Wnt
      signaling reporter was observed specifically in ostia progenitor cells. In
      vertebrate valve formation Wnt signaling is active in cells undergoing early
      endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the Wnt9 homolog of Drosophila Wnt4 
      is expressed in valve progenitors. In demonstrating an essential role for Wnt4 in
      ostia development we have identified similarities between molecular and cellular 
      events associated with early EMT during vertebrate valve development and the
      differentiation and partial delamination of ostia progenitor cells in the process
      of ostia formation.

AB  - During growth, individual skull bones overlap at sutures, where osteoblast
      differentiation and bone deposition occur. Mutations causing skull malformations 
      have revealed some required genes, but many aspects of suture regulation remain
      poorly understood. We describe a zebrafish mutation in osterix/sp7, which causes 
      a generalized delay in osteoblast maturation. While most of the skeleton is
      patterned normally, mutants have specific defects in the anterior skull and upper
      jaw, and the top of the skull comprises a random mosaic of bones derived from
      individual initiation sites. Osteoblasts at the edges of the bones are highly
      proliferative and fail to differentiate, consistent with global changes in gene
      expression. We propose that signals from the bone itself are required for orderly
      recruitment of precursor cells and growth along the edges. The delay in bone
      maturation caused by loss of Sp7 leads to unregulated bone formation, revealing a
      new mechanism for patterning the skull and sutures.

PG  - 153-159

AB  - A subset of macrophages that reside in adult tissues originate from the fetal
      yolk sac, while others derive from circulating monocytes. These ontologically
      different macrophage subsets have distinct roles in tissue injury responses, with
      the embryonic population overall having beneficial activity in cardiac repair.
      Here we show that fetal yolk macrophages are recruited to a niche within and just
      below the epicardium, the mesothelial covering of the heart. The epicardium was
      required for establishment of yolk sac macrophages in this region of the fetal
      heart, and this function of epicardium depended on its expression of the
      transcription factor WT1. Thus, tissue-specific cues and transcriptional programs
      recruit or retain embryonic macrophages in their final abodes, where they help to
      shape organ homeostasis and injury responses.

AB  - The light-sensitive neural retina (NR) and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE)
      develop from a common primordium, the optic vesicle, raising the question of how 
      they acquire and maintain distinct identities. Here, we demonstrate that
      sustained misexpression of the Chx10 homeobox gene in the presumptive RPE in
      chick suppresses accumulation of melanin pigments and promotes ectopic NR-like
      neural differentiation. This phenotypic change involved ectopic expression of NR 
      transcription factor genes, Sox2, Six3, Rx1 and Optx2, which, when misexpressed, 
      counteracted RPE development without upregulating Chx10. These results suggest
      that Chx10 can function as a cell autonomous regulator of the regional identity
      in the primordial retina, presumably through a downstream transcriptional
      cascade.

AB  - Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that has been the
      subject of intense research because of its implication in Alzheimer's disease.
      However, the physiological function of APP in the development and maintenance of 
      the central nervous system remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that
      the APP homologue in zebrafish (Danio rerio), Appb, is required for motor neuron 
      patterning and formation. Here we study the function of Appb during neurogenesis 
      in the zebrafish hindbrain. Partial knockdown of Appb using antisense morpholino 
      oligonucleotides blocked the formation of the Mauthner neurons, uni- or
      bilaterally, with an aberrant behavior as a consequence of this cellular change. 
      The Appb morphants had decreased neurogenesis, increased notch signaling and
      notch1a expression at the expense of deltaA/D expression. The Mauthner cell
      development could be restored either by a general decrease in Notch signaling
      through gamma-secretase inhibition or by a partial knock down of Notch1a.
      Together, this demonstrates the importance of Appb in neurogenesis and for the
      first time shows the essential requirement of Appb in the formation of a specific
      cell type, the Mauthner cell, in the hindbrain during development. Our results
      suggest that Appb-regulated neurogenesis is mediated through balancing the
      Notch1a signaling pathway and provide new insights into the development of the
      Mauthner cell.

AB  - Two major morphological changes occurred during the fin-to-limb transition: the
      appearance of the autopod, and the reduction of anterior skeletal elements. In
      the past decades, numerous approaches to the study of genetic developmental
      systems involved in patterning of fins/limbs among different taxa have provided
      clues to better understand the mechanism of the fin-to-limb transition. In this
      article, I discuss recent progress toward elucidating the evolutionary origin of 
      the autopod and the mechanism through which the multiple-basal bones of ancestral
      fins were reduced into a single bone (humerus/femur). A particular focus of this 
      article is the patterning mechanism of the tetrapod limb and chondrichthyan fin
      controlled by gene networks involving the 5'Hox genes, Gli3 and Shh. These recent
      data provide possible scenarios that could have led to the transformation of fins
      into limbs.

AB  - During amniote embryogenesis the nervous and vascular systems interact in a
      process that significantly affects the respective morphogenesis of each network
      by forming a "neurovascular" link. The importance of neurovascular cross-talk in 
      the central nervous system has recently come into focus with the growing
      awareness that these two systems interact extensively both during development, in
      the stem-cell niche, and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's
      Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. With respect to the peripheral nervous
      system, however, there have been no live, real-time investigations of the
      potential relationship between these two developing systems. To address this
      deficit, we used multispectral 4D time-lapse imaging in a transgenic quail model 
      in which endothelial cells (ECs) express a yellow fluorescent marker, while
      neural crest cells (NCCs) express an electroporated red fluorescent marker. We
      monitored EC and NCC migration in real-time during formation of the peripheral
      nervous system. Our time-lapse recordings indicate that NCCs and ECs are
      physically juxtaposed and dynamically interact at multiple locations along their 
      trajectories. These interactions are stereotypical and occur at precise
      anatomical locations along the NCC migratory pathway. NCCs migrate alongside the 
      posterior surface of developing intersomitic vessels, but fail to cross these
      continuous streams of motile ECs. NCCs change their morphology and migration
      trajectory when they encounter gaps in the developing vasculature. Within the
      nascent dorsal root ganglion, proximity to ECs causes filopodial retraction which
      curtails forward persistence of NCC motility. Overall, our time-lapse recordings 
      support the conclusion that primary vascular networks substantially influence the
      distribution and migratory behavior of NCCs and the patterned formation of dorsal
      root and sympathetic ganglia.

AB  - In the lesser spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), as in most non-mammalian 
      vertebrates, the dentition renews throughout life. To contribute to our
      understanding of how continuous tooth replacement is achieved, we searched for
      evidence for the presence of stem cells in this species. Three-dimensional
      reconstructions of juvenile (2-3 weeks post-hatch) specimens showed that tooth
      families merge imperceptibly with so-called interdental zones within a continuous
      and permanent dental lamina. Interdental regions are composed of three layers,
      continuous with cervical loop, middle, and outer dental epithelium of the tooth
      families, respectively. A BrdU pulse-chase experiment revealed that cell
      proliferation is initiated in the lingual part of the dental lamina and the
      resulting population shifts one tooth position towards the oral epithelium in
      around four to five weeks. In the longest chase time (114 days) label-retaining
      and arguably non-differentiated cells were present at the lingual border of the
      dental lamina. These were found in the outer and middle dental epithelium, both
      within and between tooth families. This area of the dental lamina did not show
      expression or distribution of Sox2. Our data support the hypothesis that stem
      cells reside at the lingual border of the continuous dental lamina, more
      specifically in the middle dental epithelium at the level of the tooth families, 
      and in its extension between the tooth families. To demonstrate their true
      stemness and their role in continuous tooth replacement, it remains to be shown
      that these cells have the potential to give rise to a complete new successor.

AB  - The inflow tracts of the embryonic Drosophila cardiac tube, termed ostia, arise
      in its posterior three segments from cardiac cells that co-express the homeotic
      transcription factor Abdominal-A (abdA), the orphan nuclear receptor Seven-up
      (Svp), and the signaling molecule Wingless (Wg). To define the roles of these
      factors in inflow tract development, we assessed their function in inflow tract
      formation. We demonstrate, using several criteria, that abdA, svp, and wg are
      each critical for normal inflow tract formation. We further show that Wg acts in 
      an autocrine manner to impact ostia fate, and that it mediates this effect at
      least partially through the canonical Wg signaling pathway. By contrast, neither 
      wg expression nor Wg signaling are sufficient for inflow tract formation when
      expressed in anterior Svp cells that do not normally form inflow tracts in the
      embryo. Instead, ectopic abd-A expression throughout the cardiac tube is required
      for the formation of ectopic inflow tracts, indicating that autocrine Wg
      signaling must be supplemented by additional Hox-dependent factors to effect
      inflow tract formation. Taken together, these studies define important cellular
      and molecular events that contribute to cardiac inflow tract development in
      Drosophila. Given the broad conservation of the cardiac regulatory network
      through evolution, our studies provide insight into mechanisms of cardiac
      development in higher animals.

AB  - Regulated Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death, PCD) maintains tissue homeostasis in 
      adults, and ensures proper growth and morphogenesis of tissues during development
      of metazoans. Accordingly, defects in cellular processes triggering or executing 
      apoptotic programs have been implicated in a variety of degenerative and
      neoplastic diseases. Here, we report the identification of DCAF12, an
      evolutionary conserved member of the WD40-motif repeat family of proteins, as a
      new regulator of apoptosis in Drosophila. We find that DCAF12 is required for
      Diap1 cleavage in response to pro-apoptotic signals, and is thus necessary and
      sufficient for RHG (Reaper, Hid, and Grim)-mediated apoptosis. Loss of DCAF12
      perturbs the elimination of supernumerary or proliferation-impaired cells during 
      development, and enhances tumor growth induced by loss of neoplastic tumor
      suppressors, highlighting the wide requirement for DCAF12 in PCD.

AB  - Sensory dendrite morphogenesis is directed by intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
      The extracellular environment plays instructive roles in patterning dendrite
      growth and branching. However, the molecular mechanism is not well understood. In
      Caenorhabditis elegans, the proprioceptive neuron PVD forms highly branched
      sensory dendrites adjacent to the hypodermis. We report that receptor tyrosine
      phosphatase CLR-1 functions in the hypodermis to pattern the PVD dendritic
      branches. Mutations in clr-1 lead to loss of quaternary branches, reduced
      secondary branches and increased ectopic branches. CLR-1 is necessary for the
      dendrite extension but not for the initial filopodia formation. Its role is
      dependent on the intracellular phosphatase domain but not the extracellular
      adhesion domain, indicating that it functions through dephosphorylating
      downstream factors but not through direct adhesion with neurons. Genetic analysis
      reveals that clr-1 also functions in parallel with SAX-7/DMA-1 pathway to control
      PVD primary dendrite development. We provide evidence of a new environmental
      factor for PVD dendrite morphogenesis.

AB  - The process of regeneration serves to heal injury by replacing missing cells.
      Understanding regeneration can help us replace cell populations lost during
      disease, such as the insulin-producing beta cells lost in diabetic patients.
      Centroacinar cells (CACs) are a specialized ductal pancreatic cell type that act 
      as progenitors to replace beta cells in the zebrafish. However, whether CACs
      contribute to beta-cell regeneration in adult mammals remains controversial. Here
      we review the current understanding of the role of CACs as endocrine progenitors 
      during regeneration in zebrafish and mammals.

TI  - A 44 bp intestine-specific hermaphrodite-specific enhancer from the C. elegans
      vit-2 vitellogenin gene is directly regulated by ELT-2, MAB-3, FKH-9 and DAF-16
      and indirectly regulated by the germline, by daf-2/insulin signaling and by the
      TGF-beta/Sma/Mab pathway.

AB  - The Caenorhabditis elegans vitellogenin genes are transcribed in the intestine of
      adult hermaphrodites but not of males. A 44-bp region from the vit-2 gene
      promoter is able largely to reconstitute this tissue-, stage- and
      sex-specific-expression. This "enhancer" contains a binding site for the
      DM-domain factor MAB-3, the male-specific repressor of vitellogenesis, as well as
      an activator site that we show is the direct target of the intestinal GATA factor
      ELT-2. We further show that the enhancer is directly activated by the
      winged-helix/forkhead-factor FKH-9, (whose gene has been shown by others to be a 
      direct target of DAF-16), by an unknown activator binding to the MAB-3 site, and 
      by the full C. elegans TGF-beta/Sma/Mab pathway acting within the intestine. The 
      vit-2 gene has been shown by others to be repressed by the daf-2/daf-16 insulin
      signaling pathway, which so strongly influences aging and longevity in C.
      elegans. We show that the activity of the 44 bp vit-2 enhancer is abolished by
      loss of daf-2 but is restored by simultaneous loss of daf-16. DAF-2 acts from
      outside of the intestine but DAF-16 acts both from outside of the intestine and
      from within the intestine where it binds directly to the same non-canonical
      target site that interacts with FKH-9. Activity of the 44 bp vit-2 enhancer is
      also inhibited by loss of the germline, in a manner that is only weakly
      influenced by DAF-16 but that is strongly influenced by KRI-1, a key downstream
      effector in the pathway by which germline loss increases C. elegans lifespan. The
      complex behavior of this enhancer presumably allows vitellogenin gene
      transcription to adjust to demands of body size, germline proliferation and
      nutritional state but we suggest that the apparent involvement of this enhancer
      in aging and longevity "pathways" could be incidental.

AB  - C/EBPalpha plays an instructive role in the macrophage-neutrophil cell-fate
      decision and its expression is necessary for neutrophil development. How Cebpa
      itself is regulated in the myeloid lineage is not known. We decoded the
      cis-regulatory logic of Cebpa, and two other myeloid transcription factors, Egr1 
      and Egr2, using a combined experimental-computational approach. With a reporter
      design capable of detecting both distal enhancers and silencers, we analyzed 46
      putative cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in cells representing myeloid progenitors,
      and derived early macrophages or neutrophils. In addition to novel enhancers,
      this analysis revealed a surprisingly large number of silencers. We determined
      the regulatory roles of 15 potential transcriptional regulators by testing 32,768
      alternative sequence-based transcriptional models against CRM activity data. This
      comprehensive analysis allowed us to infer the cis-regulatory logic for most of
      the CRMs. Silencer-mediated repression of Cebpa was found to be effected mainly
      by TFs expressed in non-myeloid lineages, highlighting a previously unappreciated
      contribution of long-distance silencing to hematopoietic lineage resolution. The 
      repression of Cebpa by multiple factors expressed in alternative lineages
      suggests that hematopoietic genes are organized into densely interconnected
      repressive networks instead of hierarchies of mutually repressive pairs of
      pivotal TFs. More generally, our results demonstrate that de novo cis-regulatory 
      dissection is feasible on a large scale with the aid of transcriptional modeling.

AB  - During development of the CNS, stem and progenitor cell proliferation, cell fate 
      designation, and patterning decisions are tightly regulated by interdependent
      networks of key transcriptional regulators. In a genetic approach we analyzed
      divergent functionality of the PAI and RED sub-domains of the Pax6 Paired domain 
      (PD) during progenitor zone formation, motor and interneuron development, and
      peripheral connectivity at distinct levels within the neural tube: within the
      hindbrain, mutation of the PAI sub-domain severely affected patterning of the p3 
      and pMN domains and establishment of the corresponding motor neurons. Exit point 
      designation of hypoglossal axons was disturbed in embryos harboring either
      mutations in the PD sub-domains or containing a functional Pax6 Null allele. At
      brachial spinal levels, we propose a selective involvement of the PAI sub-domain 
      during patterning of ventral p2 and pMN domains, critically disturbing generation
      of specific motor neuron subtypes and increasing V2 interneuron numbers. Our
      findings present a novel aspect of how Pax6 not only utilizes its modular
      structure to perform distinct functions via its paired and homeodomain.
      Individual sub-domains can exert distinct functions, generating a new level of
      complexity for transcriptional regulation by one single transcription factor not 
      only in dorso-ventral, but also rostro-caudal neural tube patterning.

AB  - Venous valves (VVs) are critical for unidirectional blood flow from superficial
      and deep veins towards the heart. Congenital valve aplasia or agenesis may, in
      some cases, be a direct cause of vascular disease, motivating an understanding of
      the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of VVs. Three
      gap junction proteins (Connexins), Cx37, Cx43, and Cx47, are specifically
      expressed at VVs in a highly polarized fashion. VVs are absent from adult mice
      lacking Cx37; however it is not known if Cx37 is required for the initial
      formation of valves. In addition, the requirement of Cx43 and Cx47 for VV
      development has not been studied. Here, we provide a detailed description of
      Cx37, Cx43, and Cx47 expression during mouse vein development and show by gene
      knockout that each Cx is necessary for normal valve development. The valve
      phenotypes in the knockout lines exhibit Cx-specific differences, however,
      including whether peripheral or central VVs are affected by gene inactivation. In
      addition, we show that a Cx47 null mutation impairs peripheral VV development but
      does not affect lymphatic valve formation, a finding of significance for
      understanding how some CX47 mutations cause inherited lymphedema in humans.
      Finally, we demonstrate a striking segregation of Foxc2 and NFATc1 transcription 
      factor expression between the downstream and upstream faces, respectively, of
      developing VV leaflets and show that this segregation is closely associated with 
      the highly polarized expression of Cx37, Cx43, and Cx47. The partition of Foxc2
      and NFATc1 expression at VV leaflets makes it unlikely that these factors
      directly cooperate during the leaflet elongation stage of VV development.

AB  - The development of the single cell layer skin or hypodermis of Caenorhabditis
      elegans is an excellent model for understanding cell fate specification and
      differentiation. Early in C. elegans embryogenesis, six rows of hypodermal cells 
      adopt dorsal, lateral or ventral fates that go on to display distinct behaviors
      during larval life. Several transcription factors are known that function in
      specifying these major hypodermal cell fates, but our knowledge of the
      specification of these cell types is sparse, particularly in the case of the
      ventral hypodermal cells, which become Vulval Precursor Cells and form the vulval
      opening in response to extracellular signals. Previously, the gene pvl-4 was
      identified in a screen for mutants with defects in vulval development. We found
      by whole genome sequencing that pvl-4 is the Paired-box gene pax-3, which encodes
      the sole PAX-3 transcription factor homolog in C. elegans. pax-3 mutants show
      embryonic and larval lethality, and body morphology abnormalities indicative of
      hypodermal cell defects. We report that pax-3 is expressed in ventral P cells and
      their descendants during embryogenesis and early larval stages, and that in pax-3
      reduction-of-function animals the ventral P cells undergo a cell fate
      transformation and express several markers of the lateral seam cell fate.
      Furthermore, forced expression of pax-3 in the lateral hypodermal cells causes
      them to lose expression of seam cell markers. We propose that pax-3 functions in 
      the ventral hypodermal cells to prevent these cells from adopting the lateral
      seam cell fate. pax-3 represents the first gene required for specification solely
      of the ventral hypodermal fate in C. elegans providing insights into cell type
      diversification.

AB  - Spermiogenesis is the differentiation of spermatids into motile sperm consisting 
      of a head and a tail. The head harbors a condensed elongated nucleus partially
      covered by the acrosome-acroplaxome complex. Defects in the acrosome-acroplaxome 
      complex are associated with abnormalities in sperm head shaping. The head-tail
      coupling apparatus (HTCA), a complex structure consisting of two cylindrical
      microtubule-based centrioles and associated components, connects the tail or
      flagellum to the sperm head. Defects in the development of the HTCA cause sperm
      decapitation and disrupt sperm motility, two major contributors to male
      infertility. Here, we provide data indicating that mutations in the gene
      Coiled-coil domain containing 42 (Ccdc42) is associated with malformation of the 
      mouse sperm flagella. In contrast to many other flagella and motile cilia genes, 
      Ccdc42 expression is only observed in the brain and developing sperm. Male mice
      homozygous for a loss-of-function Ccdc42 allele (Ccdc42(KO)) display defects in
      the number and location of the HTCA, lack flagellated sperm, and are sterile. The
      testes enriched expression of Ccdc42 and lack of other phenotypes in mutant mice 
      make it an ideal candidate for screening cases of azoospermia in humans.

AB  - The Rho associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK) plays crucial roles in
      development across bilaterian animals. The fact that the Rho/Rock pathway is
      required to initiate epithelial morphogenesis and thus to establish body plans in
      bilaterians makes this conserved signaling pathway key for studying the molecular
      mechanisms that may control early development of basally branching metazoans. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not the main components of this 
      signaling pathway exist in sponges, and if present, to investigate the possible
      role of the regulatory network in an early branching non-bilaterian species by
      evaluating ROCK function during Ephydatia muelleri development. Molecular
      phylogenetic analyses and protein domain predictions revealed the existence of
      Rho/Rock components in all studied poriferan lineages. Binding assays revealed
      that both Y-27632 and GSK429286A are capable of inhibiting Em-ROCK activity in
      vitro. Treatment with both drugs leads to impairment of growth and formation of
      the basal pinacoderm layer in the developing sponge. Furthermore, inhibition of
      Em-Rock prevents the establishment of a functional aquiferous system, including
      the absence of an osculum. In contrast, no effect of ROCK inhibition was observed
      in juvenile sponges that already possess a fully developed and functional
      aquiferous system. Thus, the Rho/Rock pathway appears to be essential for the
      proper development of the freshwater sponge, and may play a role in various cell 
      behaviors (e.g. cell proliferation, cell adhesion and cell motility). Taken
      together, these data are consistent with an ancestral function of Rho/Rock
      signaling in playing roles in early developmental processes and may provide a new
      framework to study the interaction between Wnt signaling and the Rho/Rock
      pathway.

AB  - The Wolffian duct, the proximal end of the mesonephric duct, undergoes
      non-branching morphogenesis to achieve an optimal length and size for sperm
      maturation. It is important to examine the mechanisms by which the developing
      mouse Wolffian duct elongates and coils for without proper morphogenesis, male
      infertility will result. Here we show that highly proliferative epithelial cells 
      divide in a random orientation relative to the elongation axis in the developing 
      Wolffian duct. Convergent extension (CE)-like of cell rearrangements is required 
      for elongating the duct while maintaining a relatively unchanged duct diameter.
      The Wolffian duct epithelium is planar polarized, which is characterized by
      oriented cell elongation, oriented cell rearrangements, and polarized activity of
      regulatory light chain of myosin II. Conditional deletion of protein tyrosine
      kinase 7 (PTK7), a regulator of planar cell polarity (PCP), from mesoderm results
      in loss of the PCP characteristics in the Wolffian duct epithelium. Although loss
      of Ptk7 does not alter cell proliferation or division orientation, it affects CE 
      and leads to the duct with significantly shortened length, increased diameter,
      and reduced coiling, which eventually results in loss of sperm motility, a key
      component of sperm maturation. In vitro experiments utilizing inhibitors of
      myosin II results in reduced elongation and coiling, similar to the phenotype of 
      Ptk7 knockout. This data suggest that PTK7 signaling through myosin II regulates 
      PCP, which in turn ensures CE-like of cell rearrangements to drive elongation and
      coiling of the Wolffian duct. Therefore, PTK7 is essential for Wolffian duct
      morphogenesis and male fertility.

AB  - Sexual development is initiated through differentiation of testicular Sertoli
      cells or ovarian granulosa cells. Although these supporting cells are considered 
      to develop from common bipotential precursors, recent evidence suggests that
      distinct supporting cell populations are present in the ovary, with one providing
      granulosa cells of the medullary follicles and the other providing granulosa
      cells of the cortical follicles, the latter of which support lifelong fertility. 
      Here, we demonstrate that XX fetal gonads contain GATA4 expressing supporting
      cells that either enter mitotic arrest, or remain proliferative. Blocking WNT
      signalling reduces XX supporting cell proliferation, while stabilising
      beta-catenin signalling promotes proliferation, indicating that the renewal of
      pre-granulosa cells is dependent on WNT/beta-catenin signalling in the
      proliferative supporting cell population. In contrast, XX supporting cells
      express p27 and FOXL2 and are maintained in mitotic arrest. Although FOXL2 is
      required for maintaining high levels of p27 expression, it is dispensable for
      entry and maintenance of mitotic arrest in XX supporting cells. Combined our data
      suggest that both medullary and cortical precursors arise from a common GATA4
      expressing cell type. In addition, this work indicates that a balance between
      supporting cell self-renewal and differentiation is maintained in the developing 
      ovary by relative WNT/beta-catenin and p27/FOXL2 activities. This study provides 
      significant new insights into the origin and formation of ovarian follicles and
      evidence supporting a common fetal origin of medullary and cortical granulosa
      cells.

AB  - Organ shape and size are important determinants of their physiological functions.
      Epithelial tubes are anlagen of many complex organs. How these tubes acquire
      their complex shape and size is a fundamental question in biology. In male mice, 
      the Wolffian duct (WD; postnatally known as epididymis) undergoes an astonishing 
      transformation, where a straight tube only a few millimetres long elongates to
      over 1000 times its original length and fits into a very small space, due to
      extensive coiling of epithelium, to perform the highly specialized function of
      sperm maturation. Defective coiling disrupts sperm maturation and leads to male
      infertility. Recent work has shown that epithelial cell proliferation is a major 
      driver of WD coiling. Still, very little is known about the molecular signals
      involved in this process. Testicular androgens are known regulators of WD
      development. However, epithelial androgen receptor signalling is dispensable for 
      WD coiling. In this study, we have shown that Wnt signalling is highly active in 
      the entire WD epithelium during its coiling, and is limited to only a few
      segments of the epididymis in later life. Pharmacological and genetic suppression
      of Wnt signalling inhibited WD coiling by decreasing cell proliferation and
      promoting apoptosis. Comparative gene expression analysis identified Fibroblast
      growth factor 7 (Fgf7) as a prime Wnt target gene involved in WD coiling and in
      vitro treatment with Fgf7 protein increased coiling of WDs. In summary, our work 
      has established that epithelial canonical Wnt signalling is a critical regulator 
      of WD coiling and its precise regulation is essential for WD/epididymal
      differentiation.

AB  - The hedgehog family includes Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Desert hedgehog, and Indian
      hedgehog, which are well known as a morphogens that play many important roles
      during development of numerous organs such as the tongue, pancreas, kidney,
      cartilage, teeth and salivary glands (SMG). In Shh null mice, abnormal
      development of the salivary gland is seen after embryonic day 14 (E14). Shh also 
      induced lobule formation and lumen formation in acini-like structures in cultured
      E14 SMG. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Shh and
      epidermal growth factor (EGF)/ErbB signaling in developing fetal mouse SMG.
      Administration of Shh to cultured E13 SMG stimulated branching morphogenesis
      (BrM) and induced synthesis of mRNAs for EGF ligands and receptors of the ErbB
      family. Shh also stimulated activation of ErbB signaling system such as ERK1/2.
      AG1478, a specific inhibitor of ErbB receptors, completely suppressed BrM and
      activation of EGF/ErbB/ERK1/2 cascade in E13 SMGs cultured with Shh. The
      expressions of mRNA for Egf in mesenchyme and mRNA for Erbb1, Erbb2 and Erbb3 in 
      epithelium of E13 SMG were specifically induced by administration of Shh. These
      results show that Shh stimulates BrM of fetal mouse SMG, at least in part,
      through activation of the EGF/ErbB/ERK1/2 signaling system.

AB  - Tissue morphogenesis requires myosin-dependent events such as cell shape changes 
      and migration to be coordinated between cells within a tissue, and/or with cells 
      from other tissues. However, few studies have investigated the simultaneous
      morphogenesis of multiple tissues in vivo. We found that during Caenorhabditis
      elegans ventral enclosure, when epidermal cells collectively migrate to cover the
      ventral surface of the embryo, the underlying neuroblasts (neuronal precursor
      cells) also undergo morphogenesis. We found that myosin accumulates as foci along
      the junction-free edges of the ventral epidermal cells to form a ring, whose
      closure is myosin-dependent. We also observed the accumulation of myosin foci and
      the adhesion junction proteins E-cadherin and alpha-catenin in the underlying
      neuroblasts. Myosin may help to reorganize a subset of neuroblasts into a
      rosette-like pattern, and decrease their surface area as the overlying epidermal 
      cells constrict. Since myosin is required in the neuroblasts for ventral
      enclosure, we propose that mechanical forces in the neuroblasts influence
      constriction of the overlying epidermal cells. In support of this model,
      disrupting neuroblast cell division or altering their fate influences myosin
      localization in the overlying epidermal cells. The coordination of
      myosin-dependent events and forces between cells in different tissues could be a 
      common theme for coordinating morphogenetic events during metazoan development.

TI  - The 14-3-3 protein PAR-5 regulates the asymmetric localization of the LET-99
      spindle positioning protein.
PG  - 288-297
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.02.020 [doi]
AB  - PAR proteins play important roles in establishing cytoplasmic polarity as well as
      regulating spindle positioning during asymmetric division. However, the molecular
      mechanisms by which the PAR proteins generate asymmetry in different cell types
      are still being elucidated. Previous studies in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed
      that PAR-3 and PAR-1 regulate the asymmetric localization of LET-99, which in
      turn controls spindle positioning by affecting the distribution of the conserved 
      force generating complex. In wild-type embryos, LET-99 is localized in a lateral 
      cortical band pattern, via inhibition at the anterior by PAR-3 and at the
      posterior by PAR-1. In this report, we show that the 14-3-3 protein PAR-5 is also
      required for cortical LET-99 asymmetry. PAR-5 associated with LET-99 in pull-down
      assays, and two PAR-5 binding sites were identified in LET-99 using the yeast
      two-hybrid assay. Mutation of these sites abolished binding in yeast and altered 
      LET-99 localization in vivo: LET-99 was present at the highest levels at the
      posterior pole of the embryo instead of a band in par-5 embryos. Together the

AB  - Eric Harris Davidson was a unique and creative intellectual force who grappled
      with the diversity of developmental processes used by animal embryos and wrestled
      them into an intelligible set of principles, then spent his life translating
      these process elements into molecularly definable terms through the architecture 
      of gene regulatory networks. He took speculative risks in his theoretical writing
      but ran a highly organized, rigorous experimental program that yielded an
      unprecedentedly full characterization of a developing organism. His writings
      created logical order and a framework for mechanism from the complex phenomena at
      the heart of advanced multicellular organism development. This is a reminiscence 
      of intellectual currents in his work as observed by the author through the last
      30-35 years of Davidson's life.

AB  - The nervous system plays a critical role in the regulation of animal body sizes. 
      In Caenorhabditis elegans, an amine neurotransmitter, dopamine, is required for
      the tactile perception of food and food-dependent behavioral changes, while its
      role in development is unknown. In this study, we show that dopamine negatively
      regulates body size through a D2-like dopamine receptor, DOP-3, in C. elegans.
      Dopamine alters body size without affecting food intake or developmental rate. We
      also found that dopamine promotes egg-laying, although the regulation of body
      size by dopamine was not solely caused by this effect. Furthermore, dopamine
      negatively regulates body size through the suppression of signaling by octopamine
      and Gq-coupled octopamine receptors, SER-3 and SER-6. Our results demonstrate
      that dopamine and octopamine regulate the body size of C. elegans and suggest a
      potential role for perception in addition to ingestion of food for growth.

AB  - Apical-basal and planar cell polarities are hallmarks of metazoan epithelia
      required to separate internal and external environments and to regulate trans-
      and intracellular transport, cytoskeletal organization, and morphogenesis.
      Mechanisms of cell polarization have been intensively studied in bilaterian model
      organisms, particularly in early embryos and cultured cells, while cell polarity 
      in pre-bilaterian tissues is poorly understood. Here, we have studied
      apical-basal and planar polarization in regenerating (aggregating) clusters of
      epitheliomuscular cells of Hydra, a simple representative of the ancestral,
      pre-bilaterian phylum Cnidaria. Immediately after dissociation, single
      epitheliomuscular cells do not exhibit cellular polarity, but they polarize de
      novo during aggregation. Reestablishment of the Hydra-specific epithelial bilayer
      is a result of short-range cell sorting. In the early phase of aggregation,
      apical-basal polarization starts with an enlargement of the epithelial
      apical-basal diameter and by the development of belt-like apical septate
      junctions. Specification of the basal pole of epithelial cells occurs shortly
      later and is linked to synthesis of mesoglea, development of hemidesmosome-like
      junctions, and formation of desmosome-like junctions connecting the basal
      myonemes of neighbouring cells. Planar polarization starts, while apical-basal
      polarization is already ongoing. It is executed gradually starting with
      cell-autonomous formation, parallelization, and condensation of myonemes at the
      basal end of each epithelial cell and continuing with a final planar alignment of
      epitheliomuscular cells at the tissue level. Our findings reveal that epithelial 
      polarization in Hydra aggregates occurs in defined steps well accessible by
      histological and ultrastructural techniques and they will provide a basis for
      future molecular studies.

AB  - Early in female mammalian embryonic development, cells randomly inactivate one of
      the two X chromosomes to achieve overall equal inactivation of parental X-linked 
      alleles. Hcfc1 is a highly conserved X-linked mouse gene that encodes HCF-1 - a
      transcriptional co-regulator implicated in cell proliferation in tissue culture
      cells. By generating a Cre-recombinase inducible Hcfc1 knock-out (Hcfc1(lox))
      allele in mice, we have probed the role of HCF-1 in actively proliferating
      embryonic cells and in cell-cycle re-entry of resting differentiated adult cells 
      using a liver regeneration model. HCF-1 function is required for both
      extraembryonic and embryonic development. In heterozygous Hcfc1(lox/+) female
      embryos, however, embryonic epiblast-specific Cre-induced Hcfc1 deletion
      (creating an Hcfc1(epiKO) allele) around E5.5 is well tolerated; it leads to a
      mixture of HCF-1-positive and -negative epiblast cells owing to random
      X-chromosome inactivation of the wild-type or Hcfc1(epiKO) mutant allele. At E6.5
      and E7.5, both HCF-1-positive and -negative epiblast cells proliferate, but
      gradually by E8.5, HCF-1-negative cells disappear owing to cell-cycle exit and
      apoptosis. Although generating a temporary developmental retardation, the loss of
      HCF-1-negative cells is tolerated, leading to viable heterozygous offspring with 
      100% skewed inactivation of the X-linked Hcfc1(epiKO) allele. In resting adult
      liver cells, the requirement for HCF-1 in cell proliferation was more evident as 
      hepatocytes lacking HCF-1 fail to re-enter the cell cycle and thus to proliferate
      during liver regeneration. The survival of the heterozygous Hcfc1(epiKO/+) female
      embryos, even with half the cells genetically compromised, illustrates the
      developmental plasticity of the post-implantation mouse embryo - in this
      instance, permitting survival of females heterozygous for an X-linked embryonic
      lethal allele.

      deployment.

AB  - Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt ligand critical for outflow tract (OFT) morphogenesis,
      is expressed specifically in second heart field (SHF) progenitors in the caudal
      splanchnic mesoderm (SpM) near the inflow tract (IFT). Using a conditional Wnt5a 
      gain of function (GOF) allele and Islet1-Cre, we broadly over-expressed Wnt5a
      throughout the SHF lineage, including the entire SpM between the IFT and OFT.
      Wnt5a over-expression in Wnt5a null mutants can rescue the cell polarity and
      actin polymerization defects as well as severe SpM shortening, but fails to
      rescue OFT shortening. Moreover, Wnt5a over-expression in wild-type background is
      able to cause OFT shortening. We find that Wnt5a over-expression does not perturb
      SHF cell proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation, but affects the deployment 
      of SHF cells by causing them to accumulate into a large bulge at the rostral SpM 
      and fail to enter the OFT. Our immunostaining analyses suggest an inverse
      correlation between cell cohesion and Wnt5a level in the wild-type SpM. Ectopic
      Wnt5a expression in the rostral SpM of Wn5a-GOF mutants diminishes the
      upregulation of adherens junction; whereas loss of Wnt5a in Wnt5a null mutants
      causes premature increase in adherens junction level in the caudal SpM.
      Over-expression of mouse Wnt5a in Xenopus animal cap cells also reduces
      C-cadherin distribution on the plasma membrane without affecting its overall
      protein level, suggesting that Wnt5a may play an evolutionarily conserved role in
      controlling the cell surface level of cadherin to modulate cell cohesion during
      tissue morphogenesis. Collectively, our data indicate that restricted expression 
      of Wnt5a in the caudal SpM is essential for normal OFT morphogenesis, and uncover
      a novel function of spatially regulated cell cohesion by Wnt5a in driving the
      deployment of SHF cells from the SpM into the OFT.

AB  - Skeletal patterning in the sea urchin embryo requires coordinated signaling
      between the pattern-dictating ectoderm and the skeletogenic primary mesenchyme
      cells (PMCs); recent studies have begun to uncover the molecular basis for this
      process. Using an unbiased RNA-Seq-based screen, we have previously identified
      the TGF-ss superfamily ligand, LvBMP5-8, as a skeletal patterning gene in
      Lytechinus variegatus embryos. This result is surprising, since both BMP5-8 and
      BMP2/4 ligands have been implicated in sea urchin dorsal-ventral (DV) and
      left-right (LR) axis specification. Here, we demonstrate that zygotic LvBMP5-8 is
      required for normal skeletal patterning on the left side, as well as for normal
      PMC positioning during gastrulation. Zygotic LvBMP5-8 is required for expression 
      of the left-side marker soxE, suggesting that LvBMP5-8 is required for left-side 
      specification. Interestingly, we also find that LvBMP5-8 knockdown suppresses
      serotonergic neurogenesis on the left side. While LvBMP5-8 overexpression is
      sufficient to dorsalize embryos, we find that zygotic LvBMP5-8 is not required
      for normal DV specification or development. In addition, ectopic LvBMP5-8 does
      not dorsalize LvBMP2/4 morphant embryos, indicating that, in the absence of
      BMP2/4, BMP5-8 is insufficient to specify dorsal. Taken together, our data
      demonstrate that zygotic LvBMP5-8 signaling is essential for left-side
      specification, and for normal left-side skeletal and neural patterning, but not
      for DV specification. Thus, while both BMP2/4 and BMP5-8 regulate LR axis
      specification, BMP2/4 but not zygotic BMP5-8 regulates DV axis specification in
      sea urchin embryos.

      contraction inhibition.

AB  - Development of the ocular lens commences with the formation of the lens placode, 
      an epithelial structure that thickens and subsequently bends inward in a process 
      called invagination. Invagination is observed during the development of many
      embryonic structures, but the spectrum of morphogenetic events driving this
      process are, in most cases, not fully understood. A characteristic commonly found
      in embryonic tissues undergoing epithelial reorganization is planar polarity, a
      property where cells are geometrically and/or molecularly orientated in a
      specific direction along the plane of an epithelium. Planar polarity is known to 
      drive the morphogenesis of several epithelial structures, however its role during
      invagination events is less clear. We have found that at the onset of
      invagination, cells of the lens placode become geometrically planar polarized
      such that they are orientated toward a central point in the lens placode. Further
      investigation revealed that this is due to contraction of radially orientated
      junctions and the elongation of those circumferentially orientated. Radial
      junctions have an elevated localization of actomyosin and their contraction is
      dependent on the F-actin and Rho-kinase binding protein, Shroom3. Elongation of
      circumferential junctions is dependent upon Cdc42, a Rho-GTPase known to regulate
      polarity via the Par-complex. We determined that Cdc42 and members of the
      Par-complex inhibit Shroom3-induced contractility and promote anisotropic placode
      cell geometry through inhibition of junctional contraction. We postulate that
      invagination of the lens placode requires careful orchestration of these opposing
      processes which are mediated by the planar polarization of junctional proteins.

AB  - The miR-200 microRNA family plays important tumor suppressive roles. The sole
      Drosophila miR-200 ortholog, miR-8 plays conserved roles in Wingless, Notch and
      Insulin signaling - pathways linked to tumorigenesis, yet homozygous null animals
      are viable and often appear morphologically normal. We observed that wing tissues
      mosaic for miR-8 levels by genetic loss or gain of function exhibited patterns of
      cell death consistent with a role for miR-8 in modulating cell survival in vivo. 
      Here we show that miR-8 levels impact several actin cytoskeletal regulators that 
      can affect cell survival and epithelial organization. We show that loss of miR-8 
      can confer resistance to apoptosis independent of an epithelial to mesenchymal
      transition while the persistence of cells expressing high levels of miR-8 in the 
      wing epithelium leads to increased JNK signaling, aberrant expression of
      extracellular matrix remodeling proteins and disruption of proper wing epithelial
      organization. Altogether our results suggest that very low as well as very high
      levels of miR-8 can contribute to hallmarks associated with cancer, suggesting
      approaches to increase miR-200 microRNAs in cancer treatment should be moderate.

AB  - Belle (Bel), the Drosophila homolog of the yeast DEAD-box RNA helicase DED1 and
      human DDX3, has been shown to be required for oogenesis and female fertility.
      Here we report a novel role of Bel in regulating the expression of transgenes.
      Abrogation of Bel by mutations or RNAi induces silencing of a variety of
      P-element-derived transgenes. This silencing effect depends on downregulation of 
      their RNA levels. Our genetic studies have revealed that the RNA helicase
      Spindle-E (Spn-E), a nuage RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in regulating
      RNA processing and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis in germline cells, is 
      required for loss-of-bel-induced transgene silencing. Conversely, Bel abrogation 
      alleviates the nuage-protein mislocalization phenotype in spn-E mutants,
      suggesting a competitive relationship between these two RNA helicases.
      Additionally, disruption of the chromatin remodeling factor Mod(mdg4) or the
      microRNA biogenesis enzyme Dicer-1 (Dcr-1) also alleviates the
      transgene-silencing phenotypes in bel mutants, suggesting the involvement of
      chromatin remodeling and microRNA biogenesis in loss-of-bel-induced transgene
      silencing. Finally we show that genetic inhibition of Bel function leads to de
      novo generation of piRNAs from the transgene region inserted in the genome,
      suggesting a potential piRNA-dependent mechanism that may mediate transgene
      silencing as Bel function is inhibited.

AB  - Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are crucial links in developmental gene regulatory
      networks, but in many cases, it can be difficult to discern whether similar CREs 
      are functionally equivalent. We found that despite similar conservation and
      binding capability to upstream activators, different GATA cis-regulatory motifs
      within the promoter of the C. elegans endoderm regulator elt-2 play distinctive
      roles in activating and modulating gene expression throughout development. We
      fused wild-type and mutant versions of the elt-2 promoter to a gfp reporter and
      inserted these constructs as single copies into the C. elegans genome. We then
      counted early embryonic gfp transcripts using single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH)
      and quantified gut GFP fluorescence. We determined that a single primary dominant
      GATA motif located 527bp upstream of the elt-2 start codon was necessary for both
      embryonic activation and later maintenance of transcription, while nearby
      secondary GATA motifs played largely subtle roles in modulating postembryonic
      levels of elt-2. Mutation of the primary activating site increased low-level
      spatiotemporally ectopic stochastic transcription, indicating that this site acts
      repressively in non-endoderm cells. Our results reveal that CREs with similar
      GATA factor binding affinities in close proximity can play very divergent
      context-dependent roles in regulating the expression of a developmentally
      critical gene in vivo.

AB  - T antigen (Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr), a core 1 mucin-type O-glycan
      structure, is synthesized by Drosophila core 1 beta1,3-galactosyltrasferase 1
      (dC1GalT1) and is expressed in various tissues. We previously reported that
      dC1GalT1 synthesizes T antigen expressed in hemocytes, lymph glands, and the
      central nervous system (CNS) and that dC1GalT1 mutant larvae display decreased
      numbers of circulating hemocytes and excessive differentiation of hematopoietic
      stem cells in lymph glands. dC1GalT1 mutant larvae have also been shown to have
      morphological defects in the CNS. However, the functions of T antigen in other
      tissues remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that glycans contributed 
      to the localization of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) boutons. In dC1GalT1 mutant
      larvae, NMJs were ectopically formed in the cleft between muscles 6 and 7 and
      connected with these two muscles. dC1GalT1 synthesized T antigen, which was
      expressed at NMJs. In addition, we determined the function of mucin-type
      O-glycans in muscle cells. In dC1GalT1 mutant muscles, myofibers and basement
      membranes were disorganized. Moreover, ultrastructural defects in NMJs and
      accumulation of large endosome-like structures within both NMJ boutons and muscle
      cells were observed in dC1GalT1 mutants. Taken together, these results
      demonstrated that mucin-type O-glycans synthesized by dC1GalT1 were involved in
      the localization of NMJ boutons, synaptogenesis of NMJs, establishment of muscle 
      cell architecture, and endocytosis.

AB  - Foxg1 expression is highly restricted to the telencephalon and other head
      structures in the early embryo. This expression pattern has been exploited to
      generate conditional knockout mice, based on a widely used Foxg1-Cre knock-in
      line (Foxg1(tm1(cre)Skm)), in which the Foxg1 coding region was replaced by the
      Cre gene. The utility of this line, however, is severely hampered for two
      reasons: (1) Foxg1-Cre mice display ectopic and unpredictable Cre activity, and
      (2) Foxg1 haploinsufficiency can produce neurodevelopmental phenotypes. To
      overcome these issues, we have generated a new Foxg1-IRES-Cre knock-in mouse
      line, in which an IRES-Cre cassette was inserted in the 3'UTR of Foxg1 locus,
      thus preserving the endogenous Foxg1 coding region and un-translated gene
      regulatory sequences in the 3'UTR, including recently discovered microRNA target 
      sites. We further demonstrate that the new Foxg1-IRES-Cre line displays
      consistent Cre activity patterns that recapitulated the endogenous Foxg1
      expression at embryonic and postnatal stages without causing defects in cortical 
      development. We conclude that the new Foxg1-IRES-Cre mouse line is a unique and
      advanced tool for studying genes involved in the development of the telencephalon
      and other Foxg1-expressing regions starting from early embryonic stages.

AB  - The atrioventricular canal (AVC) connects the atrial and ventricular chambers of 
      the heart and its formation is critical for the development of the cardiac
      valves, chamber septation and formation of the cardiac conduction system.
      Consequently, problems in AVC formation can lead to congenital defects ranging
      from cardiac arrhythmia to incomplete cardiac septation. While our knowledge
      about early heart tube formation is relatively comprehensive, much remains to be 
      investigated about the genes that regulate AVC formation. Here we identify a new 
      role for the basic helix-loop-helix factor Id4 in zebrafish AVC valve development
      and function. id4 is first expressed in the AVC endocardium and later becomes
      more highly expressed in the atrial chamber. TALEN induced inactivation of id4
      causes retrograde blood flow at the AV canal under heat induced stress
      conditions, indicating defects in AV valve function. At the molecular level, we
      found that id4 inactivation causes misexpression of several genes important for
      AVC and AV valve formation including bmp4 and spp1. We further show that id4
      appears to control the number of endocardial cells that contribute to the AV
      valves by regulating Wnt signaling in the developing AVC endocardium.

AB  - Landmark epigenetic events underlie early embryonic development, yet how
      epigenetic modifiers are regulated to achieve rapid epigenome re-patterning is
      not known. Uhrf1 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) are known to largely mediate
      maintenance DNA methylation and Uhrf1 is also required for both Dnmt1
      localization and stability. Here, we investigate how these two key epigenetic
      modifiers regulate early zebrafish development and characterize the developmental
      consequences of disrupting their homeostatic relationship. Unlike Uhrf1
      knockdown, which causes developmental arrest and death prior to gastrulation,
      overexpression of human UHRF1 (WT-UHRF1) caused asymmetric epiboly, inefficient
      gastrulation and multi-systemic defects. UHRF1 phosphorylation was previously
      demonstrated as essential for zebrafish embryogenesis, and we found that
      penetrance of the asymmetric epiboly phenotype was significantly increased in
      embryos injected with mRNA encoding non-phosphorylatable UHRF1 (UHRF1(S661A)).
      Surprisingly, both WT-UHRF1 and UHRF1(S661A) overexpression caused DNA
      hypomethylation. However, since other approaches that caused an equivalent degree
      of DNA hypomethylation did not cause the asymmetric epiboly phenotype, we
      conclude that bulk DNA methylation is not the primary mechanism. Instead,
      UHRF1(S661A) overexpression resulted in accumulation of Dnmt1 protein and the
      overexpression of both WT and a catalytically inactive Dnmt1 phenocopied the
      assymetric epiboly phenotype. Dnmt1 knockdown suppressed the phenotype caused by 
      UHRF1(S661A) overexpression, and Uhrf1 knockdown suppressed the effect of Dnmt1
      overexpression. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between these two
      proteins is the mechanism underlying the gastrulation defects. This indicates
      that Dnmt1 stability requires UHRF1 phosphorylation and that crosstalk between
      the proteins is essential for the function of these two important epigenetic
      regulators during gastrulation.

AB  - The cranial neural crest (CNC) is a highly motile and multipotent embryonic cell 
      population, which migrates directionally on defined routes throughout the embryo,
      contributing to facial structures including cartilage, bone and ganglia.
      Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is known to play a crucial role in the
      directional migration of CNC cells. However, migrating CNC co-express different
      cadherin subtypes, and their individual roles have yet to be fully explored. In
      previous studies, the expression of individual cadherin subtypes has been
      analysed using different methods with varying sensitivities, preventing the
      direct comparison of expression levels. Here, we provide the first comprehensive 
      and comparative analysis of the expression of six cadherin superfamily members
      during different phases of CNC cell migration in Xenopus. By applying a
      quantitative RT-qPCR approach, we can determine the copy number and abundance of 
      each expressed cadherin through different phases of CNC migration. Using this
      approach, we show for the first time expression of E-cadherin and XB/C-cadherin
      in CNC cells, adding them as two new members of cadherins co-expressed during CNC
      migration. Cadherin co-expression during CNC migration in Xenopus, in particular 
      the constant expression of E-cadherin, contradicts the classical
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model postulating a switch in cadherin
      expression. Loss-of-function experiments further show that E-cadherin is required
      for proper CNC cell migration in vivo and also for cell protrusion formation in
      vitro. Knockdown of E-cadherin is not rescued by co-injection of other classical 
      cadherins, pointing to a specific function of E-cadherin in mediating CNC cell
      migration. Finally, through reconstitution experiments with different E-cadherin 
      deletion mutants in E-cadherin morphant embryos, we demonstrate that the
      extracellular domain, but not the cytoplasmic domain, of E-cadherin is sufficient
      to rescue CNC cell migration in vivo.

AB  - Gadiforms such as Atlantic haddock comprise some of the world's most economically
      important fisheries. Understanding the early life history of these fish is a
      prerequisite for predicting effects of a changing environment and increased human
      activities. Robust assessment of the effects of environmental impacts on the
      embryos of non-model vertebrates is hampered by a lack of molecular resources and
      detailed knowledge regarding the regulation of genes and pathways in early
      development. Here we used mRNA sequencing to link transcriptional changes to
      developmental processes in haddock, specifically, pattern formation and
      organogenesis. Temporal expression of key developmental genes was tightly
      anchored to either the appearance of visible structures or cellular processes
      characterised in model organisms. These findings demonstrate the high potential
      of developmental transcriptomics as an analytical tool for improved understanding
      of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to abnormal development in any
      vertebrate.

      oviduct.

AB  - Recent evidence demonstrated that most fertilizing mouse sperm undergo acrosomal 
      exocytosis (AE) before binding to the zona pellucida of the eggs. However, the
      sites where fertilizing sperm could initiate AE and what stimuli trigger it
      remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine physiological
      sites of AE by using double transgenic mouse sperm, which carried EGFP in the
      acrosome and DsRed2 fluorescence in mitochondria. Using live imaging of sperm
      during in vitro fertilization of cumulus-oocyte complexes, it was observed that
      most sperm did not undergo AE. Thus, the occurrence of AE within the female
      reproductive tract was evaluated in the physiological context where this process 
      occurs. Most sperm in the lower segments of the oviduct were acrosome-intact;
      however, a significant number of sperm that reached the upper isthmus had
      undergone AE. In the ampulla, only 5% of the sperm were acrosome-intact. These
      results support our previous observations that most of mouse sperm do not
      initiate AE close to or on the ZP, and further demonstrate that a significant
      proportion of sperm initiate AE in the upper segments of the oviductal isthmus.

AB  - Most bilaterians exhibit a left-right asymmetric distribution of their internal
      organs. The sea urchin larva is notable in this regard since most adult
      structures are generated from left sided embryonic structures. The gene
      regulatory network governing this larval asymmetry is still a work in progress
      but involves several conserved signaling pathways including Nodal, and BMP. Here 
      we provide a comprehensive analysis of Hedgehog signaling and it's contribution
      to left-right asymmetry. We report that Hh signaling plays a conserved role to
      regulate late asymmetric expression of Nodal and that this regulation occurs
      after Nodal breaks left-right symmetry in the mesoderm. Thus, while Hh functions 
      to maintain late Nodal expression, the molecular asymmetry of the future coelomic
      pouches is locked in. Furthermore we report that cilia play a role only insofar
      as to transduce Hh signaling and do not have an independent effect on the
      asymmetry of the mesoderm. From this, we are able to construct a more complete
      regulatory network governing the establishment of left-right asymmetry in the sea
      urchin.

AB  - Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels by remodeling and growth of
      pre-existing vessels, is a highly orchestrated process that requires a tight
      balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors and the integration of
      their corresponding signaling networks. The family of Rho GTPases, including
      RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, play a central role in many cell biological processes that
      involve cytoskeletal changes and cell movement. Specifically for Rac1, we have
      shown that excision of Rac1 using a Tie2-Cre animal line results in embryonic
      lethality in midgestation (embryonic day (E) 9.5), with multiple vascular
      defects. However, Tie2-Cre can be also expressed during vasculogenesis, prior to 
      angiogenesis, and is active in some hematopoietic precursors that can affect
      vessel formation. To circumvent these limitations, we have now conditionally
      deleted Rac1 in a temporally controlled and endothelial-restricted fashion using 
      Cdh5(PAC)-iCreERT2 transgenic mice. In this highly controlled experimental in
      vivo system, we now show that Rac1 is required for embryonic vascular integrity
      and angiogenesis, and for the formation of superficial and deep vascular networks
      in the post-natal developing retina, the latter involving a novel specific
      function for Rac1 in vertical blood vessel sprouting. Aligned with these
      findings, we show that RAC1 is spatially involved in endothelial cell migration, 
      invasion, and radial sprouting activities in 3D collagen matrix in vitro models. 
      Hence, Rac1 and its downstream molecules may represent potential anti-angiogeneic
      therapeutic targets for the treatment of many human diseases that involve
      aberrant neovascularization and blood vessel overgrowth.

AB  - The E2F family of transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved regulators
      of the cell cycle that can be divided into two groups based on their ability to
      either activate or repress transcription. In Drosophila, there is only one
      "activator" E2F, dE2F1, which provides all of the pro-proliferative activity of
      E2F during development. Interestingly, the de2f1 gene can be transcribed from
      multiple promoters resulting in six alternate transcripts. In this study, we
      sought to investigate the biological significance of the alternate
      transcriptional start sites. We focused on the de2f1 promoter region where tissue
      and cell-type specific enhancer activities were observed at the larval stage.
      While a genomic deletion of this region, de2f1(DeltaRA), decreased the overall
      expression level of dE2F1, flies developed normally with no obvious proliferation
      defects. However, a detailed analysis of the de2f1(DeltaRA) mutant eye imaginal
      discs revealed that dE2F1 is needed for proper cell cycle exit. We discovered
      that dE2F1 expression during G1 arrest prior to the differentiation process of
      the developing eye is important for maintaining cell cycle arrest at a later
      stage of the eye development. Overall, our study suggests that specific alternate
      transcripts of "activator" E2F, dE2F1, may have a dual function on cell cycle
      progression and cannot simply be viewed as a pro-proliferative transcription
      factor.

AB  - We identify a mutation (D262N) in the erythroid-affiliated transcriptional
      repressor GFI1B, in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with antecedent
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The GFI1B-D262N mutant functionally antagonizes
      the transcriptional activity of wild-type GFI1B. GFI1B-D262N promoted
      myelomonocytic versus erythroid output from primary human hematopoietic
      precursors and enhanced cell survival of both normal and MDS derived precursors. 
      Re-analysis of AML transcriptome data identifies a distinct group of patients in 
      whom expression of wild-type GFI1B and SPI1 (PU.1) have an inverse pattern. In
      delineating this GFI1B-SPI1 relationship we show that (i) SPI1 is a direct target
      of GFI1B, (ii) expression of GFI1B-D262N produces elevated expression of SPI1,
      and (iii) SPI1-knockdown restores balanced lineage output from
      GFI1B-D262N-expressing precursors. These results table the SPI1-GFI1B
      transcriptional network as an important regulatory axis in AML as well as in the 
      development of erythroid versus myelomonocytic cell fate.

TI  - A role for tuned levels of nucleosome remodeler subunit ACF1 during Drosophila
      oogenesis.

AB  - The Chromatin Accessibility Complex (CHRAC) consists of the ATPase ISWI, the
      large ACF1 subunit and a pair of small histone-like proteins, CHRAC-14/16. CHRAC 
      is a prototypical nucleosome sliding factor that mobilizes nucleosomes to improve
      the regularity and integrity of the chromatin fiber. This may facilitate the
      formation of repressive chromatin. Expression of the signature subunit ACF1 is
      restricted during embryonic development, but remains high in primordial germ
      cells. Therefore, we explored roles for ACF1 during Drosophila oogenesis. ACF1 is
      expressed in somatic and germline cells, with notable enrichment in germline stem
      cells and oocytes. The asymmetrical localization of ACF1 to these cells depends
      on the transport of the Acf1 mRNA by the Bicaudal-D/Egalitarian complex. Loss of 
      ACF1 function in the novel Acf1(7) allele leads to defective egg chambers and
      their elimination through apoptosis. In addition, we find a variety of unusual
      16-cell cyst packaging phenotypes in the previously known Acf1(1) allele, with a 
      striking prevalence of egg chambers with two functional oocytes at opposite
      poles. Surprisingly, we found that the Acf1(1) deletion--despite disruption of
      the Acf1 reading frame--expresses low levels of a PHD-bromodomain module from the
      C-terminus of ACF1 that becomes enriched in oocytes. Expression of this module
      from the Acf1 genomic locus leads to packaging defects in the absence of
      functional ACF1, suggesting competitive interactions with unknown target
      molecules. Remarkably, a two-fold overexpression of CHRAC (ACF1 and CHRAC-16)
      leads to increased apoptosis and packaging defects. Evidently, finely tuned CHRAC
      levels are required for proper oogenesis.

AB  - Adult stem cells or residential progenitor cells are critical to maintain the
      structure and function of adult tissues (homeostasis) throughout the lifetime of 
      an individual. Mis-regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation
      often leads to diseases including cancer, however, how wildtype adult stem cells 
      and cancer cells respond to cellular damages remains unclear. We find that in the
      adult Drosophila midgut, intestinal stem cells (ISCs), unlike tumor intestinal
      cells, are resistant to various cellular damages. Tumor intestinal cells, unlike 
      wildtype ISCs, are easily eliminated by apoptosis. Further, their proliferation
      is inhibited upon autophagy induction, and autophagy-mediated tumor inhibition is
      independent of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, inhibition of
      tumorigenesis by autophagy is likely through the sequestration and degradation of
      mitochondria, as compromising mitochondria activity in these tumor models mimics 
      the induction of autophagy and increasing the production of mitochondria
      alleviates the tumor-suppression capacity of autophagy. Together, these data
      demonstrate that wildtype adult stem cells and tumor cells show dramatic
      differences in sensitivity to cellular damages, thus providing potential
      therapeutic implications targeting tumorigenesis.

AB  - Kidney development requires the differentiation and organization of discrete
      nephron epithelial lineages, yet the genetic and molecular pathways involved in
      these events remain poorly understood. The embryonic zebrafish kidney, or
      pronephros, provides a simple and useful model to study nephrogenesis. The
      pronephros is primarily comprised of two types of epithelial cells: transportive 
      and multiciliated cells (MCCs). Transportive cells occupy distinct tubule
      segments and are characterized by the expression of various solute transporters, 
      while MCCs function in fluid propulsion and are dispersed in a "salt-and-pepper" 
      fashion within the tubule. Epithelial cell identity is reliant on interplay
      between the Notch signaling pathway and retinoic acid (RA) signaling, where RA
      promotes MCC fate by inhibiting Notch activity in renal progenitors, while Notch 
      acts downstream to trigger transportive cell formation and block adoption of an
      MCC identity. Previous research has shown that the transcription factor ets
      variant 5a (etv5a), and its closely related ETS family members, are required for 
      ciliogenesis in other zebrafish tissues. Here, we mapped etv5a expression to
      renal progenitors that occupy domains where MCCs later emerge. Thus, we
      hypothesized that etv5a is required for normal development of MCCs in the
      nephron. etv5a loss of function caused a decline of MCC number as indicated by
      the reduced frequency of cells that expressed the MCC-specific markers outer
      dense fiber of sperm tails 3b (odf3b) and centrin 4 (cetn4), where rescue
      experiments partially restored MCC incidence. Interestingly, deficiency of ets
      variant 4 (etv4), a related gene that is broadly expressed in the posterior
      mesoderm during somitogenesis stages, also led to reduced MCC numbers, which were
      further reduced by dual etv5a/4 deficiency, suggesting that both of these ETS
      factors are essential for MCC formation and that they also might have redundant
      activities. In epistatic studies, exogenous RA treatment expanded the etv5a
      domain within the renal progenitor field and RA inhibition blocked etv5a in this 
      populace, indicating that etv5a acts downstream of RA. Additionally, treatment
      with exogenous RA partially rescued the reduced MCC phenotype after loss of
      etv5a. Further, abrogation of Notch with the small molecule inhibitor DAPT
      increased the renal progenitor etv5a expression domain as well as MCC density in 
      etv5a deficient embryos, suggesting Notch acts upstream to inhibit etv5a. In
      contrast, etv4 levels in renal progenitors were unaffected by changes in RA or
      Notch signaling levels, suggesting a possible non-cell autonomous role during
      pronephros formation. Taken together, these findings have revealed new insights
      about the genetic mechanisms of epithelial cell development during nephrogenesis.

AB  - Protein kinases regulate a multitude of processes by reversible phosphorylation
      of target molecules. Induction of cell proliferation and differentiation are
      fundamental to development and rely on tightly controlled kinase activities.
      Vaccinia-Related Kinases (VRKs) have emerged as a multifunctional family of
      kinases with essential functions conserved, from nematodes and fruit flies, to
      humans. VRK substrates include chromatin and transcription factors, whereas
      deregulation of VRKs is implicated in sterility, cancer and neurological defects.
      In contrast to previous observations, we describe here that Caenorhabditis
      elegans VRK-1 is expressed in all cell types, including proliferating and
      post-mitotic cells. Despite the ubiquitous expression pattern, we find that vrk-1
      mutants are particularly impaired in uterine development. Our data show that
      VRK-1 is required for uterine cell proliferation and differentiation. Moreover,
      the anchor cell, a specialized uterine cell, fails to fuse with neighboring cells
      to form the utse syncytium in vrk-1 mutants, thus providing further insight on
      the role of VRKs in organogenesis.

AB  - Cranial placodes are thickenings in the ectoderm that give rise to sensory organs
      and peripheral ganglia of the vertebrate head. At gastrula and neurula stages,
      placodal precursors are intermingled in the neural plate border with future
      neural and neural crest cells. Here, we show that the epigenetic modifier, DNA
      methyl transferase (DNMT) 3A, expressed in the neural plate border region,
      influences development of the otic placode which will contribute to the ear.
      DNMT3A is expressed in the presumptive otic region at gastrula through neurula
      stages and later in the otic placode itself. Whereas neural plate border and
      non-neural ectoderm markers Erni, Dlx5, Msx1 and Six1 are unaltered, DNMT3A loss 
      of function leads to early reduction in the expression of the key otic placode
      specifier genes Pax2 and Gbx2 and later otic markers Sox10 and Soho1. Reduction
      of Gbx2 was first observed at HH7, well before loss of other otic markers. Later,
      this translates to significant reduction in the size of the otic vesicle. Based
      on these results, we propose that DNMT3A is important for enabling the activation
      of Gbx2 expression, necessary for normal development of the inner ear.

AB  - During vertebrate embryogenesis the interdigital mesenchyme is removed by
      programmed cell death (PCD), except in species with webbed limbs. Although bone
      morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have long been known to be players in this process,
      it is unclear if they play a direct role in the interdigital mesenchyme or if
      they only act indirectly, by affecting fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. 
      A series of genetic studies have shown that BMPs act indirectly by regulating the
      withdrawal of FGF activity from the apical ectodermal ridge (AER); this FGF
      activity acts as a cell survival factor for the underlying mesenchyme. Other
      studies using exogenous factors to inhibit BMP activity in explanted mouse limbs 
      suggest that BMPs do not act directly in the mesenchyme. To address the question 
      of whether BMPs act directly, we used an interdigit-specific Cre line to
      inactivate several genes that encode components of the BMP signaling pathway,
      without perturbing the normal downregulation of AER-FGF activity. Of three Bmps
      expressed in the interdigital mesenchyme, Bmp7 is necessary for PCD, but Bmp2 and
      Bmp4 both have redundant roles, with Bmp2 being the more prominent player.
      Removing BMP signals to the interdigit by deleting the receptor gene, Bmpr1a,
      causes a loss of PCD and syndactyly, thereby unequivocally proving that BMPs are 
      direct triggers of PCD in this tissue. We present a model in which two events
      must occur for normal interdigital PCD: the presence of a BMP death trigger and
      the absence of an FGF survival activity. We demonstrate that neither event is
      required for formation of the interdigital vasculature, which is necessary for
      PCD. However, both events converge on the production of reactive oxygen species
      that activate PCD.

AB  - Understanding eukaryotic transcriptional regulation and its role in development
      and pattern formation is one of the big challenges in biology today. Most
      attempts at tackling this problem either focus on the molecular details of
      transcription factor binding, or aim at genome-wide prediction of expression
      patterns from sequence through bioinformatics and mathematical modelling. Here we
      bridge the gap between these two complementary approaches by providing an
      integrative model of cis-regulatory elements governing the expression of the gap 
      gene giant (gt) in the blastoderm embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. We use a
      reverse-engineering method, where mathematical models are fit to quantitative
      spatio-temporal reporter gene expression data to infer the regulatory mechanisms 
      underlying gt expression in its anterior and posterior domains. These models are 
      validated through prediction of gene expression in mutant backgrounds. A detailed
      analysis of our data and models reveals that gt is regulated by domain-specific
      CREs at early stages, while a late element drives expression in both the anterior
      and the posterior domains. Initial gt expression depends exclusively on inputs
      from maternal factors. Later, gap gene cross-repression and gt auto-activation
      become increasingly important. We show that auto-regulation creates a positive
      feedback, which mediates the transition from early to late stages of regulation. 
      We confirm the existence and role of gt auto-activation through targeted
      mutagenesis of Gt transcription factor binding sites. In summary, our analysis
      provides a comprehensive picture of spatio-temporal gene regulation by different 
      interacting enhancer elements for an important developmental regulator.

TI  - Identifying domains of EFHC1 involved in ciliary localization, ciliogenesis, and 
      the regulation of Wnt signaling.

AB  - EFHC1 encodes a ciliary protein that has been linked to Juvenile Myoclonic
      Epilepsy. In ectodermal explants, derived from Xenopus laevis embryos, the
      morpholino-mediated down-regulation of EFHC1b inhibited multiciliated cell
      formation. In those ciliated cells that did form, axoneme but not basal body
      formation was inhibited. EFHC1b morphant embryos displayed defects in central
      nervous system (CNS) and neural crest patterning that were rescued by a
      EFHC1b-GFP chimera. EFHC1b-GFP localized to ciliary axonemes in epidermal,
      gastrocoele roof plate, and neural tube cells. In X. laevis there is a link
      between Wnt signaling and multiciliated cell formation. While down-regulation of 
      EFHC1b led to a ~2-fold increase in the activity of the
      beta-catenin/Wnt-responsive TOPFLASH reporter, EFHC1b-GFP did not inhibit
      beta-catenin activation of TOPFLASH. Wnt8a RNA levels were increased in EFHC1b
      morphant ectodermal explants and intact embryos, analyzed prior to the on-set of 
      ciliogenesis. Rescue of the EFHC1b MO's ciliary axonemal phenotypes required the 
      entire protein; in contrast, the EFHC1b morpholino's Wnt8a, CNS, and neural crest
      phenotypes were rescued by a truncated form of EFHC1b. The EFHC1b morpholino's
      Wnt8a phenotype was also rescued by the injection of RNAs encoding secreted Wnt
      inhibitors, suggesting that these phenotypes are due to effects on Wnt signaling,
      rather than the loss of cilia, an observation of potential relevance to
      understanding EFHC1's role in human neural development.

AB  - Significant advances have been made over the past 25 years in our understanding
      of the most common adult solid tumors such as breast, colon, lung and prostate
      cancer. Much less is known about childhood solid tumors because they are rare and
      because they originate in developing organs during fetal development, childhood
      and adolescence. It can be very difficult to study the cellular origins of
      pediatric solid tumors in developing organs characterized by rapid proliferative 
      expansion, growth factor signaling, developmental angiogenesis, programmed cell
      death, tissue reorganization and cell migration. Not only has the etiology of
      pediatric cancer remained elusive because of their developmental origins, but it 
      also makes it more difficult to treat. Molecular targeted therapeutics that alter
      developmental pathway signaling may have devastating effects on normal organ
      development. Therefore, basic research focused on the mechanisms of development
      provides an essential foundation for pediatric solid tumor translational
      research. In this article, we describe new resources available for the
      developmental biology and oncology research communities. In a companion paper, we
      present the detailed characterization of an orthotopic xenograft of a pediatric
      solid tumor derived from sympathoadrenal lineage during development.

AB  - The inner ear contains six distinct sensory organs that each maintains some
      ability to regenerate hair cells into adulthood. In the postnatal cochlea, there 
      appears to be a relationship between the developmental maturity of a region and
      its ability to regenerate as postnatal regeneration largely occurs in the apical 
      turn, which is the last region to differentiate and mature during development. In
      the mature cristae there are also regional differences in regenerative ability,
      which led us to hypothesize that there may be a general relationship between the 
      relative maturity of a region and the regenerative competence of that region in
      all of the inner ear sensory organs. By analyzing adult mouse cristae labeled
      embryonically with BrdU, we found that hair cell birth starts in the central
      region and progresses to the periphery with age. Since the peripheral region of
      the adult cristae also maintains active Notch signaling and some regenerative
      competence, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the last
      regions to develop retain some of their regenerative ability into adulthood.
      Further, by analyzing embryonic day 14.5 inner ears we provide evidence for a
      wave of hair cell birth along the longitudinal axis of the cristae from the
      central regions to the outer edges. Together with the data from the adult inner
      ears labeled with BrdU as embryos, these results suggest that hair cell
      differentiation closely follows cell cycle exit in the cristae, unlike in the
      cochlea where they are uncoupled.

AB  - Phospholipase D (PLD) is involved in the regulation of receptor-associated
      signaling, cell movement, cell adhesion and endocytosis. However, its
      physiological role in vertebrate development remains poorly understood. In this
      study, we show that PLD1 is required for the convergent extension (CE) movements 
      during Xenopus gastrulation by activating Wnt/PCP signaling. Xenopus PLD1 protein
      is specifically enriched in the dorsal region of Xenopus gastrula embryo and loss
      or gain-of-function of PLD1 induce defects in gastrulation and CE movements.
      These defective phenotypes are due to impaired regulation of Wnt/PCP signaling
      pathway. Biochemical and imaging analysis using Xenopus tissues reveal that PLD1 
      is required for Fz7 receptor endocytosis upon Wnt11 stimulation. Moreover, we
      show that Fz7 endocytosis depends on dynamin and regulation of GAP activity of
      dynamin by PLD1 via its PX domain is crucial for this process. Taken together,
      our results suggest that PLD1 acts as a new positive mediator of Wnt/PCP
      signaling by promoting Wnt11-induced Fz7 endocytosis for precise regulation of
      Xenopus CE movements.

AB  - HMGA proteins are small nuclear proteins that bind DNA by conserved AT-hook
      motifs, modify chromatin architecture and assist in gene expression. Two HMGAs
      (HMGA1 and HMGA2), encoded by distinct genes, exist in mammals and are highly
      expressed during embryogenesis or reactivated in tumour progression. We here
      addressed the in vivo role of Xenopus hmga2 in the neural crest cells (NCCs). We 
      show that hmga2 is required for normal NCC specification and development. hmga2
      knockdown leads to severe disruption of major skeletal derivatives of anterior
      NCCs. We show that, within the NCC genetic network, hmga2 acts downstream of
      msx1, and is required for msx1, pax3 and snail2 activities, thus participating at
      different levels of the network. Because of hmga2 early effects in NCC
      specification, the subsequent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
      migration of NCCs towards the branchial pouches are also compromised. Strictly
      paralleling results on embryos, interfering with Hmga2 in a breast cancer cell
      model for EMT leads to molecular effects largely consistent with those observed
      on NCCs. These data indicate that Hmga2 is recruited in key molecular events that
      are shared by both NCCs and tumour cells.

AB  - The establishment of the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM) is the 
      first cell lineage segregation to occur in mouse preimplantation development.
      These two cell lineages arise in a position-dependent manner at the blastocyst
      stage: the outer cells form TE, which will generate the future placenta, while
      the inner cells give rise to the ICM, from which the epiblast (EPI) and primitive
      endoderm (PrE) arise. Previous studies have shown that a portion of cells
      relocate from the outside position to the inside during this preimplantation
      stage, but few studies have investigated the correlation between cell relocation 
      and the expression of key transcription factors critical for cell
      differentiation. To monitor cell movement and the status of the TE-specification 
      pathway in living embryos, we established Cdx2-GFP reporter mice allowing us to
      visualize the expression of Caudal-type transcriptional factor (Cdx2), a key
      regulator of the initiation of TE differentiation. Observation of Cdx2-GFP
      preimplantation embryos by live cell imaging revealed that all cells localized in
      an initial outer position initiated the expression of Cdx2. Subsequently, cells
      that changed their position from an outer to an inner position downregulated Cdx2
      expression and contributed to the ICM. Finally we showed that internalized cells 
      likely contribute to both the EPI and PrE. Our datas indicate that cells
      expressing even high levels of Cdx2 can internalize, deactivate an activated
      TE-specification molecular pathway and integrate into the pluripotent cell
      population.

AB  - Growing evidence indicates that chromatin remodeler mutations underlie the
      pathogenesis of human neurocristopathies or disorders that affect neural crest
      cells (NCCs). However, causal relationships among chromatin remodeler subunit
      mutations and NCC defects remain poorly understood. Here we show that homozygous 
      loss of ARID1A-containing, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes (BAF-A) in NCCs
      results in embryonic lethality in mice, with mutant embryos succumbing to heart
      defects. Strikingly, monoallelic loss of ARID1A in NCCs led to craniofacial
      defects in adult mice, including shortened snouts and low set ears, and these
      defects were more pronounced following homozygous loss of ARID1A, with the
      ventral cranial bones being greatly reduced in size. Early NCC specification and 
      expression of the BRG1 NCC target gene, PLEXINA2, occurred normally in the
      absence of ARID1A. Nonetheless, mutant embryos displayed incomplete conotruncal
      septation of the cardiac outflow tract and defects in the posterior pharyngeal
      arteries, culminating in persistent truncus arteriosus and agenesis of the ductus
      arteriosus. Consistent with this, migrating cardiac NCCs underwent apoptosis
      within the circumpharyngeal ridge. Our data support the notion that multiple,
      distinct chromatin remodeling complexes govern genetically separable events in
      NCC development and highlight a potential pathogenic role for NCCs in the human
      BAF complex disorder, Coffin-Siris Syndrome.

AB  - Neurogenesis is regulated by the dynamic and coordinated activity of several
      extracellular signalling pathways, but the basis for crosstalk between these
      pathways remains poorly understood. Here we investigated regulatory interactions 
      between two pathways that are each required for neural progenitor cell
      maintenance in the postnatal retina; Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch signalling. Both
      pathways are activated in progenitor cells in the postnatal retina based on the
      co-expression of fluorescent pathway reporter transgenes at the single cell
      level. Disrupting Notch signalling, genetically or pharmacologically, induces a
      rapid downregulation of all three Gli proteins and inhibits Hh-induced
      proliferation. Ectopic Notch activation, while not sufficient to promote Hh
      signalling or proliferation, increases Gli2 protein. We show that Notch
      regulation of Gli2 in Muller glia renders these cells competent to proliferate in
      response to Hh. These data suggest that Notch signalling converges on Gli2 to
      prime postnatal retinal progenitor cells and Muller glia to proliferate in
      response to Hh.

AB  - This work describes unknown aspects of chordotonal organ (ChO) morphogenesis
      revealed in post-embryonic stages through the use of new fluorescently labeled
      markers. We show that towards the end of embryogenesis a hitherto unnoticed phase
      of cell migration commences in which the cap cells of the ventral ChOs elongate
      and migrate towards their prospective attachment sites. This migration and
      consequent cell attachment generates a continuous zigzag line of proprioceptors, 
      stretching from the ventral midline to a dorsolateral position in each abdominal 
      segment. Our observation that the cap cell of the ventral-most ChO attaches to a 
      large tendon cell near the midline provides the first evidence for a direct
      physical connection between the contractile and proprioceptive systems in
      Drosophila. Our analysis has also provided an answer to a longstanding enigma
      that is what anchors the neurons of the ligamentless ventral ChOs on their axonal
      side. We identified a new type of ChO attachment cell, which binds to the
      scolopale cells of these organs, thus behaving like a ligament cell, but on the
      other hand exhibits all the typical features of a ChO attachment cell and is
      critical for the correct anchoring of these organs.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is a critical regulator of skeletal
      development. Fgf9 and Fgf18 are the only FGF ligands with identified functions in
      embryonic bone growth. Mice lacking Fgf9 or Fgf18 have distinct skeletal
      phenotypes; however, the extent of overlapping or redundant functions for these
      ligands and the stage-specific contributions of FGF signaling to chondrogenesis
      and osteogenesis are not known. To identify separate versus shared roles for FGF9
      and FGF18, we generated a combined series of Fgf9 and Fgf18 null alleles.
      Analysis of embryos lacking alleles of Fgf9 and Fgf18 shows that both encoded
      ligands function redundantly to control all stages of skeletogenesis; however,
      they have variable potencies along the proximodistal limb axis, suggesting
      gradients of activity during formation of the appendicular skeleton. Congenital
      absence of both Fgf9 and Fgf18 results in a striking osteochondrodysplasia and
      revealed functions for FGF signaling in early proximal limb chondrogenesis.
      Additional defects were also noted in craniofacial bones, vertebrae, and ribs.
      Loss of alleles of Fgf9 and Fgf18 also affect the expression of genes encoding
      other key intrinsic skeletal regulators, including IHH, PTHLH (PTHrP), and RUNX2,
      revealing potential direct, indirect, and compensatory mechanisms to coordinate
      chondrogenesis and osteogenesis.

AB  - The anterior eye is comprised of an avascular cornea surrounded by a dense
      periocular vascular network and therefore serves as an excellent model for
      angiogenesis. Although signaling through PlexinD1 underlies various vascular
      patterning events during embryonic development, its role during the formation of 
      the periocular vascular network is yet to be determined. Our recent study showed 
      that PlexinD1 mRNA is expressed by periocular angioblasts and blood vessels
      during ocular vasculogenesis in patterns that suggest its involvement with Sema3 
      ligands that are concurrently expressed in the anterior eye. In this study, we
      used in vivo knockdown experiments to determine the role of PlexinD1 during
      vascular patterning in the anterior eye of the developing avian embryos.
      Knockdown of PlexinD1 in the anterior eye caused mispatterning of the vascular
      network in the presumptive iris, which was accompanied by lose of vascular
      integrity and profuse hemorrhaging in the anterior chamber. We also observed
      ectopic vascularization of the cornea in PlexinD1 knockdown eyes, which coincided
      with the formation of the limbal vasculature in controls. Finally we show that
      Sema3E and Sema3C transcripts are expressed in ocular tissue that is devoid of
      vasculature. These results indicate that PlexinD1 plays a critical role during
      vascular patterning in the iris and limbus, and is essential for the
      establishment of corneal avascularity during development. We conclude that
      PlexinD1 is involved in vascular response to antiangiogenic Sema3 signaling that 
      guides the formation of the iris and limbal blood vessels by inhibiting VEGF
      signaling.

TI  - Vegfa signaling promotes zebrafish intestinal vasculature development through
      endothelial cell migration from the posterior cardinal vein.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying organ vascularization are not well understood. The
      zebrafish intestinal vasculature forms early, is easily imaged using transgenic
      lines and in-situ hybridization, and develops in a stereotypical pattern thus
      making it an excellent model for investigating mechanisms of organ specific
      vascularization. Here, we demonstrate that the sub-intestinal vein (SIV) and
      supra-intestinal artery (SIA) form by a novel mechanism from angioblasts that
      migrate out of the posterior cardinal vein and coalesce to form the intestinal
      vasculature in an anterior to posterior wave with the SIA forming after the SIV. 
      We show that vascular endothelial growth factor aa (vegfaa) is expressed in the
      endoderm at the site where intestinal vessels form and therefore likely provides 
      a guidance signal. Vegfa/Vegfr2 signaling is required for early intestinal
      vasculature development with mutation in vegfaa or loss of Vegfr2 homologs
      causing nearly complete inhibition of the formation of the intestinal
      vasculature. Vegfc and Vegfr3 function, however, are dispensable for intestinal
      vascularization. Interestingly, ubiquitous overexpression of Vegfc resulted in an
      overgrowth of the SIV, suggesting that Vegfc is sufficient to induce SIV
      development. These results argue that Vegfa signaling directs endothelial cells
      to migrate out of existing vasculature and coalesce to form the intestinal
      vessels. It is likely that a similar mechanism is utilized during vascularization
      of other organs.

      dominantly inherited sacral agenesis. Studies in model organisms revealed
      conserved mnx gene requirements in neuronal and pancreatic development while Mnx 
      activities that could explain the caudal mesoderm specific agenesis phenotype
      remain elusive. Here we use the zebrafish pronephros as a simple yet genetically 
      conserved model for kidney formation to uncover a novel role of Mnx factors in
      nephron morphogenesis. Pronephros formation can formally be divided in four
      stages, the specification of nephric mesoderm from the intermediate mesoderm
      (IM), growth and epithelialisation, segmentation and formation of the glomerular 
      capillary tuft. Two of the three mnx genes in zebrafish are dynamically
      transcribed in caudal IM in a time window that proceeds segmentation. We show
      that expression of one mnx gene, mnx2b, is restricted to the pronephric lineage
      and that mnx2b knock-down causes proximal pronephric tubule dilation and impaired
      pronephric excretion. Using expression profiling of embryos transgenic for
      conditional activation and repression of Mnx regulated genes, we further
      identified irx1b as a direct target of Mnx factors. Consistent with a repression 
      of irx1b by Mnx factors, the transcripts of irx1b and mnx genes are found in
      mutual exclusive regions in the IM, and blocking of Mnx functions results in a
      caudal expansion of the IM-specific irx1b expression. Finally, we find that
      knock-down of irx1b is sufficient to rescue proximal pronephric tubule dilation
      and impaired nephron function in mnx-morpholino injected embryos. Our data
      revealed a first caudal mesoderm specific requirement of Mnx factors in a
      non-human system and they demonstrate that Mnx-dependent restriction of
      IM-specific irx1b activation is required for the morphogenesis and function of
      the zebrafish pronephros.

AB  - Extensive research into Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis has improved our
      understanding of insect developmental mechanisms. However, Drosophila development
      is thought to be highly divergent from that of the ancestral insect and arthropod
      in many respects. We therefore need alternative models for arthopod development
      that are likely to be more representative of basally-branching clades. The
      cricket Gryllus bimaculatus is such a model, and currently has the most
      sophisticated functional genetic toolkit of any hemimetabolous insect. The
      existing cricket embryonic staging system is fragmentary, and it is based on
      morphological landmarks that are not easily visible on a live, undissected egg.
      To address this problem, here we present a complementary set of "egg stages" that
      serve as a guide for identifying the developmental progress of a cricket embryo
      from fertilization to hatching, based solely on the external appearance of the
      egg. These stages were characterized using a combination of brightfield timelapse
      microscopy, timed brightfield micrographs, confocal microscopy, and measurements 
      of egg dimensions. These egg stages are particularly useful in experiments that
      involve egg injection (including RNA interference, targeted genome modification, 
      and transgenesis), as injection can alter the speed of development, even in
      control treatments. We also use 3D reconstructions of fixed embryo preparations
      to provide a comprehensive description of the morphogenesis and anatomy of the
      cricket embryo during embryonic rudiment assembly, germ band formation,
      elongation, segmentation, and appendage formation. Finally, we aggregate and
      schematize a variety of published developmental gene expression patterns. This
      work will facilitate further studies on G. bimaculatus development, and serve as 
      a useful point of reference for other studies of wild type and experimentally
      manipulated insect development in fields from evo-devo to disease vector and pest
      management.

AB  - The sub-division of the posterior-most territory of the neural plate results in
      the formation of two distinct neural structures, the hindbrain and the spinal
      cord. Although many of the molecular signals regulating the development of these 
      individual structures have been elucidated, the mechanisms involved in
      delineating the boundary between the hindbrain and spinal cord remain elusive.
      Two molecules, retinoic acid (RA) and the Cdx4 transcription factor have been
      previously implicated as important regulators of hindbrain and spinal cord
      development, respectively. Here, we provide evidence that suggests multiple
      regulatory interactions occur between RA signaling and the Cdx4 transcription
      factor to establish the anterior-posterior (AP) position of the transition
      between the hindbrain and spinal cord. Using chemical inhibitors to alter RA
      concentrations and morpholinos to knock-down Cdx4 function in zebrafish, we show 
      that Cdx4 acts to prevent RA degradation in the presumptive spinal cord domain by
      suppressing expression of the RA degradation enzyme, Cyp26a1. In the hindbrain,
      RA signaling modulates its own concentration by activating the expression of
      cyp26a1 and inhibiting the expansion of cdx4. Therefore, interactions between
      Cyp26a1 and Cdx4 modulate RA levels along the AP axis to segregate the posterior 
      neural plate into the hindbrain and spinal cord territories.

AB  - Fragile-X syndrome is the most commonly inherited cause of autism and mental
      disabilities. The Fmr1 (Fragile-X Mental Retardation 1) gene is essential in
      humans and Drosophila for the maintenance of neural stem cells, and Fmr1 loss
      results in neurological and reproductive developmental defects in humans and
      flies. FMRP (Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein) is a nucleo-cytoplasmic
      shuttling protein, involved in mRNA silencing and translational repression. Both 
      Zfrp8 and Fmr1 have essential functions in the Drosophila ovary. In this study,
      we identified FMRP, Nufip (Nuclear Fragile-X Mental Retardation
      Protein-interacting Protein) and Tral (Trailer Hitch) as components of a Zfrp8
      protein complex. We show that Zfrp8 is required in the nucleus, and controls
      localization of FMRP in the cytoplasm. In addition, we demonstrate that Zfrp8
      genetically interacts with Fmr1 and tral in an antagonistic manner. Zfrp8 and
      FMRP both control heterochromatin packaging, also in opposite ways. We propose
      that Zfrp8 functions as a chaperone, controlling protein complexes involved in
      RNA processing in the nucleus.

AB  - Epithelia are essential barrier tissues that must be appropriately maintained for
      their correct function. To achieve this a plethora of protein interactions
      regulate epithelial cell number, structure and adhesion, and differentiation.
      Here we show that Cindr (the Drosophila Cin85 and Cd2ap ortholog) is required to 
      maintain epithelial integrity. Reducing Cindr triggered cell delamination and
      movement. Most delaminating cells died. These behaviors were consistent with JNK 
      activation previously associated with loss of epithelial integrity in response to
      ectopic oncogene activity. We confirmed a novel interaction between Cindr and
      Drosophila JNK (dJNK), which when perturbed caused inappropriate JNK signaling.
      Genetically reducing JNK signaling activity suppressed the effects of reducing
      Cindr. Furthermore, ectopic JNK signaling phenocopied loss of Cindr and was
      partially rescued by concomitant cindr over-expression. Thus, correct Cindr-dJNK 
      stoichiometry is essential to maintain epithelial integrity and disturbing this
      balance may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease states, including cancer.

AB  - Sensory perception of light is mediated by specialized Photoreceptor neurons
      (PRs) in the eye. During development all PRs are genetically determined to
      express a specific Rhodopsin (Rh) gene and genes mediating a functional
      phototransduction pathway. While the genetic and molecular mechanisms of PR
      development is well described in the adult compound eye, it remains unclear how
      the expression of Rhodopsins and the phototransduction cascade is regulated in
      other visual organs in Drosophila, such as the larval eye and adult ocelli. Using
      transcriptome analysis of larval PR-subtypes and ocellar PRs we identify and
      study new regulators required during PR differentiation or necessary for the
      expression of specific signaling molecules of the functional phototransduction
      pathway. We found that the transcription factor Kruppel (Kr) is enriched in the
      larval eye and controls PR differentiation by promoting Rh5 and Rh6 expression.
      We also identified Camta, Lola, Dve and Hazy as key genes acting during ocellar
      PR differentiation. Further we show that these transcriptional regulators control
      gene expression of the phototransduction cascade in both larval eye and adult
      ocelli. Our results show that PR cell type-specific transcriptome profiling is a 
      powerful tool to identify key transcriptional regulators involved during several 
      aspects of PR development and differentiation. Our findings greatly contribute to
      the understanding of how combinatorial action of key transcriptional regulators
      control PR development and the regulation of a functional phototransduction
      pathway in both larval eye and adult ocelli.

AB  - Lens epithelial cells express many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that
      stimulate PI3K-AKT and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK intracellular signaling pathways. These
      pathways ultimately activate the phosphorylation of key cellular transcription
      factors and other proteins that control proliferation, survival, metabolism, and 
      differentiation in virtually all cells. Among RTKs in the lens, only stimulation 
      of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) elicits a lens epithelial cell to
      fiber cell differentiation response in mammals. Moreover, although the lens
      expresses three different Fgfr genes, the isolated removal of Fgfr2 at the lens
      placode stage inhibits both lens cell survival and fiber cell differentiation.
      Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), commonly known as a tumor suppressor,
      inhibits ERK and AKT activation and initiates both apoptotic pathways, and cell
      cycle arrest. Here, we show that the combined deletion of Fgfr2 and Pten rescues 
      the cell death phenotype associated with Fgfr2 loss alone. Additionally, Pten
      removal increased AKT and ERK activation, above the levels of controls, in the
      presence or absence of Fgfr2. However, isolated deletion of Pten failed to
      stimulate ectopic fiber cell differentiation, and the combined deletion of Pten
      and Fgfr2 failed to restore differentiation-specific Aquaporin0 and DnaseIIbeta
      expression in the lens fiber cells.

      development in mice.

AB  - Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) was identified as a receptor specific for Nogo-B. Our
      previous work has shown that Nogo-B and its receptor (NgBR) are essential for
      chemotaxis and morphogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro and intersomitic
      vessel formation via Akt pathway in zebrafish. Here, we further demonstrated the 
      roles of NgBR in regulating vasculature development in mouse embryo and primitive
      blood vessel formation in embryoid body culture systems, respectively. Our
      results showed that NgBR homozygous knockout mice are embryonically lethal at
      E7.5 or earlier, and Tie2Cre-mediated endothelial cell-specific NgBR knockout
      (NgBR ecKO) mice die at E11.5 and have severe blood vessel assembly defects in
      embryo. In addition, mutant embryos exhibit dilation of cerebral blood vessel,
      resulting in thin-walled endothelial caverns. The similar vascular defects also
      were detected in Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 NgBR inducible ecKO mice. Murine NgBR
      gene-targeting embryonic stem cells (ESC) were generated by homologous
      recombination approaches. Homozygous knockout of NgBR in ESC results in cell
      apoptosis. Heterozygous knockout of NgBR does not affect ESC cell survival, but
      reduces the formation and branching of primitive blood vessels in embryoid body
      culture systems. Mechanistically, NgBR knockdown not only decreases both Nogo-B
      and VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration by abolishing Akt phosphorylation,
      but also decreases the expression of CCM1 and CCM2 proteins. Furthermore, we
      performed immunofluorescence (IF) staining of NgBR in human cerebral cavernous
      malformation patient tissue sections. The quantitative analysis results showed
      that NgBR expression levels in CD31 positive endothelial cells is significantly
      decreased in patient tissue sections. These results suggest that NgBR may be one 
      of important genes coordinating the cerebral vasculature development.

AB  - Gata4 and Gata6 are closely related transcription factors that are essential for 
      the development of a number of embryonic tissues. While they have nearly
      identical DNA-binding domains and similar patterns of expression, Gata4 and Gata6
      null embryos have strikingly different embryonic lethal phenotypes. To determine 
      whether the lack of redundancy is due to differences in protein function or Gata4
      and Gata6 expression domains, we generated mice that contained the Gata6 cDNA in 
      place of the Gata4 genomic locus. Gata4(Gata6/Gata6) embryos survived through
      embryonic day (E)12.5 and successfully underwent ventral folding morphogenesis,
      demonstrating that Gata6 is able to replace Gata4 function in extraembryonic
      tissues. Surprisingly, Gata6 is unable to replace Gata4 function in the septum
      transversum mesenchyme or the epicardium, leading to liver agenesis and lethal
      heart defects in Gata4(Gata6/Gata6) embryos. These studies suggest that Gata4 has
      evolved distinct functions in the development of these tissues that cannot be
      performed by Gata6, even when it is provided in the identical expression domain. 
      Our work has important implications for the respective mechanisms of Gata
      function during development, as well as the functional evolution of these
      essential transcription factors.

AB  - Maternal expression of the translational regulator 4EHP (eIF4E-Homologous
      Protein) has an established role in generating protein gradients essential for
      specifying the Drosophila embryonic pattern. We generated a null mutation of
      4EHP, which revealed for the first time that it is essential for viability and
      for completion of development. In fact, 4EHP null larvae, and larvae ubiquitously
      expressing RNAi targeting 4EHP, are developmentally delayed, fail to grow and
      eventually die. In addition, we found that expressing RNAi that targets 4EHP
      specifically in the prothoracic gland disrupted ecdysone biosynthesis, causing a 
      block of the transition from the larval to pupal stages. This phenotype can be
      rescued by dietary administration of ecdysone. Consistent with this, 4EHP is
      highly expressed in the prothoracic gland and it is required for wild type
      expression levels of steroidogenic enzymes. Taken together, these results uncover
      a novel essential function for 4EHP in regulating ecdysone biosynthesis.

      Drosophila adult midgut.

AB  - Adult intestinal tissues, exposed to the external environment, play important
      roles including barrier and nutrient-absorption functions. These functions are
      ensured by adequately controlled rapid-cell metabolism. GATA transcription
      factors play essential roles in the development and maintenance of adult
      intestinal tissues both in vertebrates and invertebrates. We investigated the
      roles of GATAe, the Drosophila intestinal GATA factor, in adult midgut
      homeostasis with its first-generated knock-out mutant as well as cell
      type-specific RNAi and overexpression experiments. Our results indicate that
      GATAe is essential for proliferation and maintenance of intestinal stem cells
      (ISCs). Also, GATAe is involved in the differentiation of enterocyte (EC) and
      enteroendocrine (ee) cells in both Notch (N)-dependent and -independent manner.
      The results also indicate that GATAe has pivotal roles in maintaining normal
      epithelial homeostasis of the Drosophila adult midgut through interaction of N
      signaling. Since recent reports showed that mammalian GATA-6 regulates normal and
      cancer stem cells in the adult intestinal tract, our data also provide
      information on the evolutionally conserved roles of GATA factors in stem-cell
      regulation.

AB  - The spatially opposed expression of Antidorsalizing morphogenetic protein (Admp) 
      and BMP signals controls dorsoventral (DV) polarity across Bilateria and hence
      represents an ancient regulatory circuit. Here, we show that in addition to the
      conserved admp1 that constitutes the ancient circuit, a second admp gene (admp2) 
      is present in Ambulacraria (Echinodermata+Hemichordata) and two marine worms
      belonging to Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha. The phylogenetic distribution
      implies that the two admp genes were duplicated in the Bilaterian common ancestor
      and admp2 was subsequently lost in chordates and protostomes. We show that the
      ambulacrarian admp1 and admp2 are under opposite transcriptional control by BMP
      signals and knockdown of Admps in sea urchins impaired their DV polarity.
      Over-expression of either Admps reinforced BMP signaling but resulted in
      different phenotypes in the sea urchin embryo. Our study provides an excellent
      example of signaling circuit rewiring and protein functional changes after gene
      duplications.

AB  - Reciprocal repression of inner cell mass specific factor OCT4 and trophectoderm
      specific factor CDX2 promotes mouse first lineage segregation. Studies in mouse
      embryonic stem (ES) cells revealed that they bind to each other's regulatory
      regions to reciprocally suppress transcription, additionally they form protein
      complex for mutual antagonism. However, so far the molecular interaction of Oct4 
      and Cdx2 in other mammal's early embryo is not yet investigated. Here,
      over-expression of Cdx2 in early porcine embryo showed CDX2 represses Oct4
      through neither the transcriptional repression nor forming repressive complex,
      but promoting OCT4 nuclear export and proteasomal degradation. The results showed
      novel molecular regulation of CDX2 on Oct4, and provided important clues for
      clarifying the mechanism of interaction between CDX2 and Oct4 in embryo of
      mammals other than mouse.

AB  - Proper muscle function constitutes a precondition for good heath and an active
      lifestyle during an individual's lifespan and any deviations from normal skeletal
      muscle development and its functions may lead to numerous health conditions
      including e.g. myopathies and increased mortality. It is thus not surprising that
      there is an increasing need for understanding skeletal muscle developmental
      processes and the associated molecular pathways, especially as such information
      could find further uses in therapy. The understanding of complex skeletal muscle 
      developmental networks was broadened with the discovery of microRNA (miRNA)
      molecules. MicroRNAs are evolutionary conserved small non-coding RNAs capable of 
      negatively regulating gene expression on a post-transcriptional level by means of
      miRNA-mRNA interaction. Several miRNAs expressed exclusively in muscle have been 
      labeled myomiRs. MyomiRs represent an integral part of skeletal muscle
      development, i.e. playing a significant role during skeletal muscle
      proliferation, differentiation and regeneration. The purpose of this review is to
      provide a summary of current knowledge regarding the involvement of myomiRs in
      the individual phases of myogenesis and other aspects of skeletal muscle biology,
      along with an up-to-date list of myomiR target genes and their functions in
      skeletal muscle and miRNA-related therapeutic approaches and future prospects.

AB  - Urodele amphibians have remarkable organ regeneration ability. They can
      regenerate not only limbs but also a tail throughout their life. It has been
      demonstrated that the regeneration of some organs are governed by the presence of
      neural tissues. For instance, limb regeneration cannot be induced without nerves.
      Thus, identifying the nerve factors has been the primary focus in amphibian organ
      regeneration research. Recently, substitute molecules for nerves in limb
      regeneration, Bmp and Fgfs, were identified. Cooperative inputs of Bmp and Fgfs
      can induce limb regeneration in the absence of nerves. In the present study, we
      investigated whether similar or same regeneration mechanisms control another
      neural tissue governed organ regeneration, i.e., tail regeneration, in Ambystoma 
      mexicanum. Neural tissues in a tail, which is the spinal cord, could transform
      wound healing responses into organ regeneration responses, similar to nerves in
      limb regeneration. Furthermore, the identified regeneration inducer
      Fgf2+Fgf8+Bmp7 showed similar inductive effects. However, further analysis
      revealed that the blastema cells induced by Fgf2+Fgf8+Bmp7 could participate in
      the regeneration of several tissues, but could not organize a patterned tail.
      Regeneration inductive ability of Fgf2+Fgf8+Bmp7 was confirmed in another
      urodele, Pleurodeles waltl. These results suggest that the organ regeneration
      ability in urodele amphibians is controlled by a common mechanism.

AB  - All 302 neurons in the C. elegans hermaphrodite arise through asymmetric division
      of neuroblasts. During embryogenesis, the C. elegans ham-1 gene is required for
      several asymmetric neuroblast divisions in lineages that generate both neural and
      apoptotic cells. By antibody staining, endogenous HAM-1 is found exclusively at
      the cell cortex in many cells during embryogenesis and is asymmetrically
      localized in dividing cells. Here we show that in transgenic embryos expressing a
      functional GFP::HAM-1 fusion protein, GFP expression is also detected in the
      nucleus, in addition to the cell cortex. Consistent with the nuclear localization
      is the presence of a putative DNA binding winged-helix domain within the
      N-terminus of HAM-1. Through a deletion analysis we determined that the
      C-terminus of the protein is required for nuclear localization and we identified 
      two nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). A subcellular fractionation experiment
      from wild type embryos, followed by Western blotting, revealed that endogenous
      HAM-1 is primarily found in the nucleus. Our analysis also showed that the
      N-terminus is necessary for cortical localization. While ham-1 function is
      essential for asymmetric division in the lineage that generates the PLM
      mechanosensory neuron, we showed that cortical localization may not required.
      Thus, our results suggest that there is a nuclear function for HAM-1 in
      regulating asymmetric neuroblast division and that the requirement for cortical
      localization may be lineage dependent.

AB  - The stereotypic cleavage pattern shared by spiralian embryos provides unique
      opportunities to compare mechanisms of cell fate specification of homologous
      blastomeres, and can give insights into how changes in fate may have influenced
      the evolution of novel structures and morphological diversity. The potential of
      cells to undergo regulation and the timing of cell fate specification were
      investigated during early development in the polychaete annelid, Capitella
      teleta. Targeted laser deletions of the first quartet micromeres were performed, 
      with a focus on the eye-forming cells 1a and 1c. Most of the larvae resulting
      from deletion of the 1a or 1c micromeres lack both the pigment cell and sensory
      cell of the eye as predicted by the C. teleta fate map. In a minority of cases,
      however, both left and right larval eye spots develop, suggesting that other
      blastomeres within the embryo regulate for loss of these cells. Deletion of the
      1a and 1c derivatives, 1a(1) or 1c(1), also largely result in larvae with one
      pigment spot, although there are larvae with two eye spots, suggesting that the
      ability to regulate for loss of an eye-generating cell persists for an additional
      cell cycle. Cell deletion in conjunction with intracellular labeling indicates
      that all four quadrants retain the ability to generate eyes, including those that
      normally do not. Deletion of all four first quartet micromeres provides evidence 
      that only the first quartet micromeres have eye-forming potential. Additionally, 
      in contrast to the right side of the head where larval and adult eye sensory
      cells are derived from the same cell (1c), on the left side, the larval and adult
      eye sensory cells are generated by different embryonic lineages. We hypothesize
      that cell-cell interactions and cell position are important for regulative
      ability in Capitella. To our knowledge, this is one of the first detailed
      deletion studies of the first quartet micromeres and the first convincing example
      of regulation in polychaetes, which are often thought to be non-regulative in
      nature.

AB  - One of the well established aspects of the development of the central nervous
      system (CNS) is that neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis. However, the mechanism
      underlying this temporal switch between the two distinct lineages is poorly
      understood. It is thought that let-7, a heterochronic miRNA, may help neural stem
      cells (NSCs) choose between the neuronal and glial lineages. Here, we have tested
      the premise in the retina, a simple and accessible CNS model, where
      neurogliogenic decision takes place postnatally during late histogenesis. A
      positive correlation was observed between the temporal induction of let-7
      expression and differentiation of late born neurons and Muller glia (MG), the
      sole glia generated by retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Examination of let-7's
      involvement in late histogenesis by the perturbation of function approaches
      revealed that let-7 facilitated differentiation of both neurons and MG, without
      preference to a particular lineage. We demonstrate that let-7's positive
      influence on neuronal and MG differentiation is likely achieved by inhibiting the
      expression of Hmga2, the DNA architecture protein involved in the self-renewal of
      neural progenitors. Thus, our observations suggest that let-7 promotes
      differentiation, regardless of the neuronal or glial lineage, shifting the
      balance from RPCs' maintenance to their differentiation in the developing retina.

      methyltransferase SMYD1.

AB  - The SMYD (SET and MYND domain) family of lysine methyltransferases harbor a
      unique structure in which the methyltransferase (SET) domain is intervened by a
      zinc finger protein-protein interaction MYND domain. SMYD proteins methylate both
      histone and non-histone substrates and participate in diverse biological
      processes including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, proliferation and
      apoptosis. Smyd1 is unique among the five family members in that it is
      specifically expressed in striated muscles. Smyd1 is critical for development of 
      the right ventricle in mice. In zebrafish, Smyd1 is necessary for
      sarcomerogenesis in fast-twitch muscles. Smyd1 is expressed in the skeletal
      muscle lineage throughout myogenesis and in mature myofibers, shuttling from
      nucleus to cytosol during myoblast differentiation. Because of this expression
      pattern, we hypothesized that Smyd1 plays multiple roles at different stages of
      myogenesis. To determine the role of Smyd1 in mammalian myogenesis, we
      conditionally eliminated Smyd1 from the skeletal muscle lineage at the myoblast
      stage using Myf5(cre). Deletion of Smyd1 impaired myoblast differentiation,
      resulted in fewer myofibers and decreased expression of muscle-specific genes.
      Muscular defects were temporally restricted to the second wave of myogenesis.
      Thus, in addition to the previously described functions for Smyd1 in heart

AB  - Nedd4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has an essential role in craniofacial
      development. However, how and when Nedd4 controls skull formation is ill defined.
      Here we have used a collection of complementary genetic mouse models to dissect
      the cell-autonomous roles of Nedd4 in the formation of neural crest cell derived 
      cranial bone. Removal of Nedd4 specifically from neural crest cells leads to
      profound craniofacial defects with marked reduction of cranial bone that was
      preceded by hypoplasia of bone forming osteoblasts. Removal of Nedd4 after
      differentiation of neural crest cells into progenitors of chondrocytes and
      osteoblasts also led to profound deficiency of craniofacial bone in the absence
      of cartilage defects. Notably, these skull malformations were conserved when
      Nedd4 was specifically removed from the osteoblast lineage after specification of
      osteoblast precursors from mesenchymal skeletal progenitors. We further show that
      absence of Nedd4 in pre-osteoblasts results in decreased cell proliferation and
      altered osteogenic differentiation. Taken together our data demonstrate a novel
      cell-autonomous role for Nedd4 in promoting expansion of the osteoblast
      progenitor pool to control craniofacial development. Nedd4 mutant mice therefore 
      represent a unique mouse model of craniofacial anomalies that provide an ideal
      resource to explore the cell-intrinsic mechanisms of neural crest cells in
      craniofacial morphogenesis.

AB  - Morphological innovation is a fundamental process in evolution, yet its molecular
      basis is still elusive. Acquisition of elytra, highly modified beetle forewings, 
      is an important innovation that has driven the successful radiation of beetles.
      Our RNAi screening for candidate genes has identified abrupt (ab) as a potential 
      key player in elytron evolution. In this study, we performed a series of RNA
      interference (RNAi) experiments in both Tribolium and Drosophila to understand
      the contributions of ab to the evolution of beetle elytra. We found that (i) ab
      is essential for proper wing vein patterning both in Tribolium and Drosophila,
      (ii) ab has gained a novel function in determining the unique elytron shape in
      the beetle lineage, (iii) unlike Hippo and Insulin, other shape determining
      pathways, the shape determining function of ab is specific to the elytron and not
      required in the hindwing, (iv) ab has a previously undescribed role in the Notch 
      signal-associated wing formation processes, which appears to be conserved between
      beetles and flies. These data suggest that ab has gained a new function during
      elytron evolution in beetles without compromising the conserved wing-related
      functions. Gaining a new function without losing evolutionarily conserved
      functions may be a key theme in the evolution of morphologically novel
      structures.

AB  - Pax6 is known as a neurogenic factor in the development of the central nervous
      system and regulates proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells and promotes
      neuronal differentiation. In addition to neurogenesis, Pax6 is also involved in
      the specification and maturation of glial cells. Here, we show that Eyeless (Ey),
      Drosophila homolog of Pax6, regulates the production of glial cells in the brain.
      In the developing fly visual center, the production of neurons and glial cells
      are controlled by the temporal transcription factors that are sequentially
      expressed in neuroblasts (NBs). Among them, NBs of the last temporal window
      produce astrocyte-like glial cells. Ey is strongly expressed in the middle aged
      NBs, whose temporal window is earlier compared with glia producing older NBs.
      Weak Ey expression is also detected in the glia producing NBs. Our results
      suggest that Ey expression in the middle aged NBs indirectly control gliogenesis 
      from the oldest NBs by regulating other temporal transcription factors.
      Additionally, weak Ey expression in the NBs of last temporal window may directly 
      control gliogenesis. Ey is also expressed in neurons produced from the NBs of
      Ey-positive temporal window. Interestingly, neuron-specific overexpression of Ey 
      causes significant increase in glial cells suggesting that neuronal expression of
      Ey may also contribute to gliogenesis. Thus, Pax6-dependent regulation of
      astrocyte-like glial development is conserved throughout the animal kingdom.

AB  - Deficient nephrogenesis is the major factor contributing to renal hypoplasia
      defined as abnormally small kidneys. Nephron induction during kidney development 
      is driven by reciprocal interactions between progenitor cells of the cap
      mesenchyme (CM) and the ureteric bud (UB). The prorenin receptor (PRR) is a
      receptor for renin and prorenin, and an accessory subunit of the vacuolar proton 
      pump H(+)-ATPase. Global loss of PRR is lethal in mice and PRR mutations are
      associated with a high blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and X-linked 
      mental retardation in humans. To circumvent lethality of the ubiquitous PRR
      mutation in mice and to determine the potential role of the PRR in nephrogenesis,
      we generated a mouse model with a conditional deletion of the PRR in Six2(+)
      nephron progenitors and their epithelial derivatives (Six2(PRR-/-)). Targeted
      ablation of PRR in Six2(+) nephron progenitors caused a marked decrease in the
      number of developing nephrons, small cystic kidneys and podocyte foot process
      effacement at birth, and early postnatal death. Reduced congenital nephron
      endowment resulted from premature depletion of nephron progenitor cell population
      due to impaired progenitor cell proliferation and loss of normal molecular
      inductive response to canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling within the metanephric
      mesenchyme. At 2 months of age, heterozygous Six2(PRR+/-) mice exhibited focal
      glomerulosclerosis, decreased kidney function and massive proteinuria.
      Collectively, these findings demonstrate a cell-autonomous requirement for the
      PRR within nephron progenitors for progenitor maintenance, progression of
      nephrogenesis, normal kidney development and function.

      tissues such as the attachment bone, which is the supporting element of teeth.
      Histological analyses have revealed the character of tooth replacement, however, 
      the cellular mechanism of how skeletal tissues are modified during tooth
      replacement is largely unknown. Here, we showed the important role of osteoblasts
      for controlling osteoclasts to modify the attachment bone during tooth
      replacement in medaka pharyngeal teeth, coupled with an osterix-DsRed/TRAP-GFP
      transgenic line to visualize osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In the turnover of the 
      row of attachment bones, these bones were resorbed at the posterior side where
      most developed functional teeth were located, and generated at the anterior side 
      where teeth were newly erupted, which caused continuous tooth replacement. In the
      cellular analysis, osteoclasts and osteoblasts were located at attachment bones
      separately, since mature osteoclasts were localized at the resorbing side and
      osteoblasts gathered at the generating side. To demonstrate the role of
      osteoclasts in tooth replacement, we established medaka made deficient in c-fms-a
      by TALEN. c-fms-a deficient medaka showed hyperplasia of attachment bones along
      with reduced bone resorption accompanied by a low number of TRAP-positive
      osteoclasts, indicating an important role of osteoclasts in the turnover of
      attachment bones. Furthermore, nitroreductase-mediated osteoblast-specific
      ablation induced disappearance of osteoclasts, indicating that osteoblasts were
      essential for maintenance of osteoclasts for the proper turnover. Taken together,
      our results suggested that the medaka attachment bone provides the model to
      understand the cellular mechanism for tooth replacement, and that osteoblasts act
      in the coordination of bone morphology by supporting osteoclasts.

AB  - Neural crest cells comprise a multipotent, migratory cell population that
      generates a diverse array of cell and tissue types, during vertebrate
      development. Enteric Nervous System controls the function of the gastrointestinal
      tract and is mainly derived from the vagal and sacral neural crest cells.
      Deregulation on self-renewal and differentiation of the enteric neural crest
      cells is evident in enteric nervous system disorders, such as Hirschsprung
      disease, characterized by the absence of ganglia in a variable length of the
      distal bowel. Here we show that Geminin is essential for Enteric Nervous System
      generation as mice that lacked Geminin expression specifically in neural crest
      cells revealed decreased generation of vagal neural crest cells, and enteric
      neural crest cells (ENCCs). Geminin-deficient ENCCs showed increased apoptosis
      and decreased cell proliferation during the early stages of gut colonization.
      Furthermore, decreased number of committed ENCCs in vivo and the decreased
      self-renewal capacity of enteric progenitor cells in vitro, resulted in almost
      total aganglionosis resembling a severe case of Hirschsprung disease. Our results
      suggest that Geminin is an important regulator of self-renewal and survival of
      enteric nervous system progenitor cells.

AB  - As one of the key nutrient sensors, insulin signaling plays an important role in 
      integrating environmental energy cues with organism growth. In adult organisms,
      relative insufficiency of insulin signaling induces compensatory expansion of
      insulin-secreting pancreatic beta (beta) cells. However, little is known about
      how insulin signaling feedback might influence neogenesis of beta cells during
      embryonic development. Using genetic approaches and a unique cell transplantation
      system in developing zebrafish, we have uncovered a novel role for insulin
      signaling in the negative regulation of pancreatic progenitor cell
      differentiation. Blocking insulin signaling in the pancreatic progenitors
      hastened the expression of the essential beta cell genes insulin and pdx1, and
      promoted beta cell fate at the expense of alpha cell fate. In addition, loss of
      insulin signaling promoted beta cell regeneration and destabilization of alpha
      cell character. These data indicate that insulin signaling constitutes a tunable 
      mechanism for beta cell compensatory plasticity during early development.
      Moreover, using a novel blastomere-to-larva transplantation strategy, we found
      that loss of insulin signaling in endoderm-committed blastomeres drove their
      differentiation into beta cells. Furthermore, the extent of this differentiation 
      was dependent on the function of the beta cell mass in the host. Altogether, our 
      results indicate that modulation of insulin signaling will be crucial for the
      development of beta cell restoration therapies for diabetics; further
      clarification of the mechanisms of insulin signaling in beta cell progenitors
      will reveal therapeutic targets for both in vivo and in vitro beta cell
      generation.

AB  - Mutations in the microtubule cytoskeleton are linked to cognitive and locomotor
      defects during development, and neurodegeneration in adults. How these mutations 
      impact microtubules, and how this alters function at the level of neurons is an
      important area of investigation. Using a forward genetic screen in mice, we
      identified a missense mutation in Tuba1a alpha-tubulin that disrupts cortical and
      motor neuron development. Homozygous mutant mice exhibit cortical dysgenesis
      reminiscent of human tubulinopathies. Motor neurons fail to innervate target
      muscles in the limbs and show synapse defects at proximal targets. To directly
      examine effects on tubulin function, we created analogous mutations in the
      alpha-tubulin isotypes in budding yeast. These mutations sensitize yeast cells to
      microtubule stresses including depolymerizing drugs and low temperatures.
      Furthermore, we find that mutant alpha-tubulin is depleted from the cell lysate
      and from microtubules, thereby altering ratios of alpha-tubulin isotypes.
      Tubulin-binding cofactors suppress the effects of the mutation, indicating an
      important role for these cofactors in regulating the quality of the alpha-tubulin
      pool. Together, our results give new insights into the functions of Tuba1a,
      mechanisms for regulating tubulin proteostasis, and how compromising these may
      lead to neural defects.

AB  - MicroRNAs have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression. Originally
      shown to regulate developmental timing, microRNAs have since been implicated in a
      wide range of cellular functions including cell identity, migration and
      signaling. miRNA-430, the earliest expressed microRNA during zebrafish
      embryogenesis, is required to undergo morphogenesis and has previously been shown
      to regulate maternal mRNA clearance, Nodal signaling, and germ cell migration.
      The functions of miR-430 in brain morphogenesis, however, remain unclear. Herein 
      we find that miR-430 instructs oriented cell divisions in the neural rod required
      for neural midline formation. Loss of miR-430 function results in mitotic spindle
      misorientation in the neural rod, failed neuroepithelial integration after cell
      division, and ectopic cell accumulation in the dorsal neural tube. We propose
      that miR-430, independently of canonical apicobasal and planar cell polarity
      (PCP) pathways, coordinates the stereotypical cell divisions that instruct neural
      tube morphogenesis.

AB  - Alveologenesis is the final step of lung maturation, which subdivides the
      alveolar region of the lung into smaller units called alveoli. Each of the
      nascent dividers serves as a new gas-exchange surface, and collectively they
      drastically increase the surface area for breathing. Disruption of alveologenesis
      results in simplification of alveoli, as is seen in premature infants diagnosed
      with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a prevalent lung disease that is often
      associated with lifelong breathing deficiencies. To date, a majority of studies
      of alveologenesis rely on two-dimensional (2D) analysis of tissue sections. Given
      that an overarching theme of alveologenesis is thinning and extension of the
      epithelium and mesenchyme to facilitate gas exchange, often only a small portion 
      of a cell or a cellular structure is represented in a single 2D plane. Here, we
      use a three-dimensional (3D) approach to examine the structural architecture and 
      cellular composition of myofibroblasts, alveolar type 2 cells, elastin and lipid 
      droplets in normal as well as BPD-like mouse lung. We found that 2D finger-like
      septal crests, commonly used to depict growing alveolar septae, are often
      artifacts of sectioning through fully established alveolar walls. Instead, a more
      accurate representation of growing septae are 3D ridges that are lined by
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and alpha smooth muscle
      actin (alpha-SMA)-expressing myofibroblasts, as well as the elastin fibers that
      they produce. Accordingly in 3D, both alpha-SMA and elastin were each found in
      connected networks underlying the 3D septal ridges rather than as isolated dots
      at the tip of 2D septal crests. Analysis through representative stages of
      alveologenesis revealed unappreciated dynamic changes in these patterns.
      PDGFRA-expressing cells are only alpha-SMA-positive during the first phase of
      alveologenesis, but not in the second phase, suggesting that the two phases of
      septae formation may be driven by distinct mechanisms. Thin elastin fibers are
      already present in the alveolar region prior to alveologenesis, suggesting that
      during alveologenesis, there is not only new elastin deposition, but also
      extensive remodeling to transform thin and uniformly distributed fibers into
      thick cables that rim the nascent septae. Analysis of several genetic as well as 
      hyperoxia-induced models of BPD revealed that the myofibroblast organization is
      perturbed in all, regardless of whether the origin of defect is epithelial,
      mesenchymal, endothelial or environmental. Finally, analysis of relative position
      of PDGFRA-positive cells and alveolar type 2 cells reveal that during
      alveologenesis, these two cell types are not always adjacent to one another. This
      result suggests that the niche and progenitor relationship afforded by their
      close juxtaposition in the adult lung may be a later acquired property. These
      insights revealed by 3D reconstruction of the septae set the foundation for
      future investigations of the mechanisms driving normal alveologenesis, as well as
      causes of alveolar simplification in BPD.

AB  - Sea urchin embryos are a useful model system for investigating early
      developmental processes and the underlying gene regulatory networks. Most
      functional studies using sea urchin embryos rely on antisense morpholino
      oligonucleotides to knockdown gene functions. However, major concerns related to 
      this technique include off-target effects, variations in morpholino efficiency,
      and potential morpholino toxicity; furthermore, such problems are difficult to
      discern. Recent advances in genome editing technologies have introduced the
      prospect of not only generating sequence-specific knockouts, but also providing
      genome-engineering applications. Two genome editing tools, zinc-finger nuclease
      (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have been
      utilized in sea urchin embryos, but the resulting efficiencies are far from
      satisfactory. The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeat)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) system serves as an easy and
      efficient method with which to edit the genomes of several established and
      emerging model organisms in the field of developmental biology. Here, we apply
      the CRISPR/Cas9 system to the sea urchin embryo. We designed six guide RNAs
      (gRNAs) against the well-studied nodal gene and discovered that five of the gRNAs
      induced the expected phenotype in 60-80% of the injected embryos. In addition, we
      developed a simple method for isolating genomic DNA from individual embryos,
      enabling phenotype to be precisely linked to genotype, and revealed that the
      mutation rates were 67-100% among the sequenced clones. Of the two potential
      off-target sites we examined, no off-target effects were observed. The detailed
      procedures described herein promise to accelerate the usage of CRISPR/Cas9 system
      for genome editing in sea urchin embryos.

TI  - Analyses of fugu hoxa2 genes provide evidence for subfunctionalization of neural 
      crest cell and rhombomere cis-regulatory modules during vertebrate evolution.

AB  - Hoxa2 gene is a primary player in regulation of craniofacial programs of head
      development in vertebrates. Here we investigate the evolution of a Hoxa2 neural
      crest enhancer identified originally in mouse by comparing and contrasting the
      fugu hoxa2a and hoxa2b genes with their orthologous teleost and mammalian
      sequences. Using sequence analyses in combination with transgenic regulatory
      assays in zebrafish and mouse embryos we demonstrate subfunctionalization of
      regulatory activity for expression in hindbrain segments and neural crest cells
      between these two fugu co-orthologs. hoxa2a regulatory sequences have retained
      the ability to mediate expression in neural crest cells while those of hoxa2b
      include cis-elements that direct expression in rhombomeres. Functional dissection
      of the neural crest regulatory potential of the fugu hoxa2a and hoxa2b genes
      identify the previously unknown cis-element NC5, which is implicated in
      generating the differential activity of the enhancers from these genes. The NC5
      region plays a similar role in the ability of this enhancer to mediate reporter
      expression in mice, suggesting it is a conserved component involved in control of
      neural crest expression of Hoxa2 in vertebrate craniofacial development.

AB  - Frontonasal dysplasia (FND) can have severe presentations that are medically and 
      socially debilitating. Several genes are implicated in FND conditions, including 
      Aristaless-Like Homeobox 1 (ALX1), which is associated with FND3. Breeds of cats 
      are selected and bred for extremes in craniofacial morphologies. In particular, a
      lineage of Burmese cats with severe brachycephyla is extremely popular and is
      termed Contemporary Burmese. Genetic studies demonstrated that the brachycephyla 
      of the Contemporary Burmese is a simple co-dominant trait, however, the
      homozygous cats have a severe craniofacial defect that is incompatible with life.
      The craniofacial defect of the Burmese was genetically analyzed over a 20 year
      period, using various genetic analysis techniques. Family-based linkage analysis 
      localized the trait to cat chromosome B4. Genome-wide association studies and
      other genetic analyses of SNP data refined a critical region. Sequence analysis
      identified a 12bp in frame deletion in ALX1, c.496delCTCTCAGGACTG, which is 100% 
      concordant with the craniofacial defect and not found in cats not related to the 
      Contemporary Burmese.

AB  - Primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are cleaved by the nuclear RNase III Drosha to
      produce hairpin-shaped precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). In humans, this process is 
      known to be facilitated by the DEAD-box helicases p68 (DDX5) and p72 (DDX17). In 
      this study, we performed a candidate-based RNAi screen in C. elegans to identify 
      DEAD/H-box proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis. In a let-7(mg279) sensitized
      genetic background, knockdown of a homolog of yeast splicing factor Prp28p,
      DDX-23, or a homolog of human helicases p68 and p72, DDX-17, enhanced let-7
      loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that these helicases play a role in let-7
      processing and/or function. In both ddx-23(RNAi) and ddx-17(RNAi), levels of
      mature let-7 were decreased while pri-let-7 was found to accumulate, indicating
      that the helicases likely act at the level of pri-let-7 processing. DDX-23 and
      DDX-17 were also required for the biogenesis of other known heterochronic miRNAs,
      including lin-4 and the let-7 family members miR-48, miR-84 and miR-241. Their
      function was not confined to the heterochronic pathway, however, since they were 
      both necessary for down-regulation of cog-1 by the spatial patterning miRNA,
      lsy-6. Here, we present a novel function for C. elegans DDX-23 in pri-miRNA
      processing, and also suggest a conserved role for DDX-17 in this process.

AB  - From July 19-24, 2015, 169 clinicians and basic scientists gathered in the
      vertiginous heights of Snowmass, Colorado (2502 m) for the fourth FASEB summer
      research conference on the 'Biology of Cilia and Flagella'. Organizers Maureen
      Barr (Rutgers University), Iain Drummond (Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard 
      Medical School), and Jagesh Shah (Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical
      School) assembled a program filled with new data and forward-thinking ideas
      documenting the ongoing growth of the field. Sixty oral presentations and 77
      posters covered novel aspects of cilia structure, ciliogenesis, cilia motility,
      cilia-mediated signaling, and cilia-related disease. In this report, we summarize
      the meeting, highlight exciting developments and discuss open questions.

TI  - Posterior-anterior gradient of zebrafish hes6 expression in the presomitic
      mesoderm is established by the combinatorial functions of the downstream enhancer
      and 3'UTR.

AB  - In vertebrates, the periodic formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm
      (PSM) is driven by the molecular oscillator known as the segmentation clock. The 
      hairy-related gene, hes6/her13.2, functions as a hub by dimerizing with other
      oscillators of the segmentation clock in zebrafish embryos. Although hes6
      exhibits a posterior-anterior expression gradient in the posterior PSM with a
      peak at the tailbud, the detailed mechanisms underlying this unique expression
      pattern have not yet been clarified. By establishing several transgenic lines, we
      found that the transcriptional regulatory region downstream of hes6 in
      combination with the hes6 3'UTR recapitulates the endogenous gradient of hes6
      mRNA expression. This downstream region, which we termed the PT enhancer,
      possessed several putative binding sites for the T-box and Ets transcription
      factors that were required for the regulatory activity. Indeed, the T-box
      transcription factor (Tbx16) and Ets transcription factor (Pea3) bound
      specifically to the putative binding sites and regulated the enhancer activity in
      zebrafish embryos. In addition, the 3'UTR of hes6 is required for recapitulation 
      of the endogenous mRNA expression. Furthermore, the PT enhancer with the 3'UTR of
      hes6 responded to the inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis and fibroblast growth
      factor signaling in a manner similar to endogenous hes6. The results showed that 
      transcriptional regulation by the T-box and Ets transcription factors, combined
      with the mRNA stability given by the 3'UTR, is responsible for the unique
      expression gradient of hes6 mRNA in the posterior PSM of zebrafish embryos.

AB  - Hirschsprung Disease (HSCR) is a potentially deadly birth defect characterized by
      the absence of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in distal bowel. Although HSCR
      has clear genetic causes, no HSCR-associated mutation is 100% penetrant,
      suggesting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions determine HSCR occurrence.
      To test the hypothesis that certain medicines might alter HSCR risk we treated
      zebrafish with medications commonly used during early human pregnancy and
      discovered that ibuprofen caused HSCR-like absence of enteric neurons in distal
      bowel. Using fetal CF-1 mouse gut slice cultures, we found that ibuprofen treated
      enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDC) had reduced migration, fewer
      lamellipodia and lower levels of active RAC1/CDC42. Additionally, inhibiting
      ROCK, a RHOA effector and known RAC1 antagonist, reversed ibuprofen effects on
      migrating mouse ENCDC in culture. Ibuprofen also inhibited colonization of Ret+/-
      mouse bowel by ENCDC in vivo and dramatically reduced bowel colonization by chick
      ENCDC in culture. Interestingly, ibuprofen did not affect ENCDC migration until
      after at least three hours of exposure. Furthermore, mice deficient in Ptgs1 (COX
      1) and Ptgs2 (COX 2) had normal bowel colonization by ENCDC and normal ENCDC
      migration in vitro suggesting COX-independent effects. Consistent with selective 
      and strain specific effects on ENCDC, ibuprofen did not affect migration of gut
      mesenchymal cells, NIH3T3, or WT C57BL/6 ENCDC, and did not affect dorsal root
      ganglion cell precursor migration in zebrafish. Thus, ibuprofen inhibits ENCDC
      migration in vitro and bowel colonization by ENCDC in vivo in zebrafish, mouse
      and chick, but there are cell type and strain specific responses. These data
      raise concern that ibuprofen may increase Hirschsprung disease risk in some
      genetically susceptible children.

AB  - RASSF7 protein localises to the centrosome and plays a key role in mitosis. Its
      expression is also increased in a range of tumour types. However, little is known
      about the molecular basis of RASSF7's function and it is not clear if it acts as 
      an oncogene in the cancers where its levels are elevated. Here, we carry out the 
      first analysis of the domains of rassf7, focusing on which of them are
      responsible for its localisation to the centrosome. Constructs were generated to 
      allow the expression of a series of truncated versions of rassf7 and the level of
      centrosomal localisation shown by each protein quantified. This analysis was
      carried out in Xenopus embryos which are a tractable system where rassf7
      localisation can easily be studied. Our data shows that the coiled-coil domain of
      rassf7 is required and sufficient to direct its centrosomal localisation. The RA 
      domain did not appear to have a role in mediating localisation. Surprisingly,
      removal of the extreme C-terminus of the protein caused rassf7 to accumulate at
      the centrosome and drive centrosome defects, including accumulation of the
      centrosomal protein gamma-tubulin and an amplification of the number of
      gamma-tubulin foci. These effects required the centrosomal localisation mediated 
      by the coiled-coil domain. Later in development cells expressing this truncated
      rassf7 protein underwent cell death. Finally, analysis of a database of tumour
      sequences identified a mutation in RASSF7 which would cause a similar C-terminal 
      truncation of the protein. Based on our data this truncated protein might drive
      centrosomal defects and we propose the hypothesis that truncated RASSF7 could act
      as an oncogene in a small subset of tumours where it is mutated in this way.

AB  - Pediatric dysphagia-feeding and swallowing difficulties that begin at birth, last
      throughout childhood, and continue into maturity--is one of the most common,
      least understood complications in children with developmental disorders. We argue
      that a major cause of pediatric dysphagia is altered hindbrain patterning during 
      pre-natal development. Such changes can compromise craniofacial structures
      including oropharyngeal muscles and skeletal elements as well as motor and
      sensory circuits necessary for normal feeding and swallowing. Animal models of
      developmental disorders that include pediatric dysphagia in their phenotypic
      spectrum can provide mechanistic insight into pathogenesis of feeding and
      swallowing difficulties. A fairly common human genetic developmental disorder,
      DiGeorge/22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) includes a substantial incidence of 
      pediatric dysphagia in its phenotypic spectrum. Infant mice carrying a parallel
      deletion to 22q11DS patients have feeding and swallowing difficulties that
      approximate those seen in pediatric dysphagia. Altered hindbrain patterning,
      craniofacial malformations, and changes in cranial nerve growth prefigure these
      difficulties. Thus, in addition to craniofacial and pharyngeal anomalies that
      arise independently of altered neural development, pediatric dysphagia may result
      from disrupted hindbrain patterning and its impact on peripheral and central
      neural circuit development critical for feeding and swallowing. The mechanisms
      that disrupt hindbrain patterning and circuitry may provide a foundation to
      develop novel therapeutic approaches for improved clinical management of
      pediatric dysphagia.

AB  - In humans, genetic diseases affecting skin integrity (genodermatoses) are
      generally caused by mutations in a small number of genes that encode structural
      components of the dermal-epidermal junctions. In this article, we first show that
      inactivation of both exosc9, which encodes a component of the RNA exosome, and
      ptbp1, which encodes an RNA-binding protein abundant in Xenopus embryonic skin,
      impairs embryonic Xenopus skin development, with the appearance of dorsal
      blisters along the anterior part of the fin. However, histological and electron
      microscopy analyses revealed that the two phenotypes are distinct. Exosc9
      morphants are characterized by an increase in the apical surface of the goblet
      cells, loss of adhesion between the sensorial and peridermal layers, and a
      decrease in the number of ciliated cells within the blisters. Ptbp1 morphants are
      characterized by an altered goblet cell morphology. Gene expression profiling by 
      deep RNA sequencing showed that the expression of epidermal and
      genodermatosis-related genes is also differentially affected in the two
      morphants, indicating that alterations in post-transcriptional regulations can
      lead to skin developmental defects through different routes. Therefore, the
      developing larval epidermis of Xenopus will prove to be a useful model for
      dissecting the post-transcriptional regulatory network involved in skin
      development and stability with significant implications for human diseases.

AB  - The tail ascidian larval peripheral nervous system is made up of epidermal
      sensory neurons distributed more or less regularly in ventral and dorsal
      midlines. Their formation occurs in two-steps: the ventral and dorsal midlines
      are induced as neurogenic territories by Fgf9/16/20 and Admp respectively. The
      Delta2/Notch interaction then controls the number of neurons that form. The
      genetic machinery acting between the inductive processes taking place before
      gastrulation and neuron specification at tailbud stages are largely unknown. The 
      analysis of seven transcription factors expressed in the forming midlines
      revealed an unexpected complexity and dynamic of gene expression. Their
      systematic overexpression confirmed that these genes do not interact following a 
      linear cascade of activation. However, the integration of our data revealed the
      distinct key roles of the two upstream factors Msxb and Nkx-C that are the
      earliest expressed genes and the only ones able to induce neurogenic midline and 
      ESN formation. Our data suggest that Msxb would be the primary midline gene
      integrating inputs from the ventral and dorsal inducers and launching a
      pan-midline transcriptional program. Nkx-C would be involved in tail tip
      specification, in maintenance of the pan-midline network and in a posterior to
      anterior wave controlling differentiation.

AB  - The importance of nerve-derived signalling for correct regeneration has been the 
      topic of research for more than a hundred years, but we are just beginning to
      identify the underlying molecular pathways of this process. Within the current
      review, we attempt to provide an extensive overview of the neural influences
      during early and late phases of both vertebrate and invertebrate regeneration. In
      general, denervation impairs limb regeneration, but the presence of nerves is not
      essential for the regeneration of aneurogenic extremities. This observation led
      to the "neurotrophic factor(s) hypothesis", which states that certain trophic
      factors produced by the nerves are necessary for proper regeneration. Possible
      neuron-derived factors which regulate regeneration as well as the
      denervation-affected processes are discussed.

TI  - The brain expressed x-linked gene 1 (Bex1) regulates myoblast fusion.
PG  - 16-25
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.11.007 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle development (myogenesis) is a complex but precisely orchestrated 
      process involving spatiotemporal regulation of the proliferation, differentiation
      and fusion of myogenic progenitor cells (myoblasts). Here we identify brain
      expressed x-linked gene 1 (Bex1) as a transient, developmentally regulated gene
      involved in myoblast fusion. Bex1 expression is undetectable in adult muscles or 
      in quiescent muscle stem cells (satellite cells). During embryonic myogenesis,
      however, Bex1 is robustly expressed by myogenin(+) differentiating myoblasts, but
      not by Pax7(+) proliferating myoblasts. Interestingly, Bex1 is initially
      localized in the cytoplasm and then translocates into the nucleus. During adult
      muscle regeneration, Bex1 is highly expressed in newly regenerated myofibers and 
      the expression is rapidly downregulated during maturation. Consistently, in
      cultured myoblasts, Bex1 is not expressed at the proliferation stage but
      transiently expressed upon induction of myogenic differentiation, following a
      similar cytoplasm to nucleus translocation pattern as seen in vivo. Using gain-
      and loss-of-function studies, we found that overexpression of Bex1 promotes the
      fusion of primary myoblasts without affecting myogenic differentiation and
      myogenin expression. Conversely, Bex1 knockout myoblasts exhibit obvious fusion
      defects, even though they express normal levels of myogenin and differentiate
      normally. These results elucidate a novel role of Bex1 in myogenesis through
      regulating myoblast fusion.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells are formed during embryonic development, and serve as
      the foundation of the definitive blood program for life. Notch signaling has been
      well established as an essential direct contributor to HSC specification.
      However, several recent studies have indicated that the contribution of Notch
      signaling is complex. HSC specification requires multiple Notch signaling inputs,
      some received directly by hematopoietic precursors, and others that occur
      indirectly within neighboring somites. Of note, proinflammatory signals provided 
      by primitive myeloid cells are needed for HSC specification via upregulation of
      the Notch pathway in hemogenic endothelium. In addition to multiple requirements 
      for Notch activation, recent studies indicate that Notch signaling must
      subsequently be repressed to permit HSC emergence. Finally, Notch must then be
      reactivated to maintain HSC fate. In this review, we discuss the growing
      understanding of the dynamic contributions of Notch signaling to the
      establishment of hematopoiesis during development.

AB  - Many organisms accumulate a pool of germline stem cells during development that
      is maintained in later life. The dynamics of establishment, expansion and
      homeostatic maintenance of this pool are subject to both developmental and
      physiological influences including the availability of a suitable niche
      microenvironment, nutritional status, and age. Here, we investigated the dynamics
      of germline proliferation during stages of expansion and homeostasis, using the
      C. elegans germ line as a model. The vast majority of germ cells in the
      proliferative zone are in interphase stages of mitosis (G1, S, G2) rather than in
      the active mitotic (M) phase. We examined mitotic index and DNA content,
      comparing different life stages, mutants, and physiological conditions. We found 
      that germ cells in larval stages cycle faster than in adult stages, but that this
      difference could not be attributed to sexual fate of the germ cells. We also
      found that larval germ cells exhibit a lower average DNA content compared to
      adult germ cells. We extended our analysis to consider the effects of distance
      from the niche and further found that the spatial pattern of DNA content differs 
      between larval and adult stages in the wild type and among mutants in pathways
      that interfere with cell cycle progression, cell fate, or both. Finally, we
      characterized expansion of the proliferative pool of germ cells during adulthood,
      using a regeneration paradigm (ARD recovery) in which animals are starved and
      re-fed. We compared adult stage regeneration and larval stage expansion, and
      found that the adult germ line is capable of rapid accumulation but does not
      sustain a larval-level mitotic index nor does it recapitulate the larval pattern 
      of DNA content. The regenerated germ line does not reach the number of
      proliferative zone nuclei seen in the continuously fed adult. Taken together, our
      results suggest that cell cycle dynamics are under multiple influences including 
      distance from the niche, age and/or maturation of the germ line, nutrition and,
      possibly, latitude for physical expansion.

      emerging model system that is amenable to experimental manipulations and
      evolutionary comparisons among the arthropods. Our analyses indicate that the
      Parhyale genome contains a single copy of each canonical Hox gene with the
      exception of fushi tarazu, and preliminary mapping suggests that at least some of
      these genes are clustered together in the genome. With few exceptions, Parhyale
      Hox genes exhibit both temporal and spatial colinearity, and expression
      boundaries correlate with morphological differences between segments and their
      associated appendages. This work represents the most comprehensive analysis of
      Hox gene expression in a crustacean to date, and provides a foundation for
      functional studies aimed at elucidating the role of Hox genes in arthropod
      development and evolution.

AB  - The inner ear develops from the otic placode, one of the cranial placodes that
      arise from a region of ectoderm adjacent to the anterior neural plate called the 
      pre-placodal domain. We have identified a Forkhead family transcription factor,
      Foxi3, that is expressed in the pre-placodal domain and down-regulated when the
      otic placode is induced. We now show that Foxi3 mutant mice do not form otic
      placodes as evidenced by expression changes in early molecular markers and the
      lack of thickened placodal ectoderm, an otic cup or otocyst. Some preplacodal
      genes downstream of Foxi3-Gata3, Six1 and Eya1-are not expressed in the ectoderm 
      of Foxi3 mutant mice, and the ectoderm exhibits signs of increased apoptosis. We 
      also show that Fgf signals from the hindbrain and cranial mesoderm, which are
      necessary for otic placode induction, are received by pre-placodal ectoderm in
      Foxi3 mutants, but do not initiate otic induction. Finally, we show that the
      epibranchial placodes that develop in close proximity to the otic placode and the
      mandibular division of the trigeminal ganglion are missing in Foxi3 mutants. Our 
      data suggest that Foxi3 is necessary to prime pre-placodal ectoderm for the
      correct interpretation of inductive signals for the otic and epibranchial
      placodes.

TI  - Identification of microRNAs and microRNA targets in Xenopus gastrulae: The role
      of miR-26 in the regulation of Smad1.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play diverse roles in the regulation of
      vertebrate development. To investigate miRNA-target mRNA relationships in
      embryonic development, we have carried out small-RNA sequencing to identify
      miRNAs expressed in the early gastrula of Xenopus laevis. We identify a total of 
      180 miRNAs, and we have identified the locations of the miRNA precursor sequences
      in the X. laevis genome. Of these miRNAs, 141 represent miRs previously
      identified in Xenopus tropicalis. Alignment to human miRNAs led to the
      identification of 39 miRNAs that have not previously been described for Xenopus. 
      We have also used a biochemical approach to isolate mRNAs that are associated
      with the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) in early gastrulae and thus
      candidate targets of miRNA-dependent regulation. Interrogation of this
      RISC-associated mRNA pool by RT-PCR indicates that a number of genes essential
      for early patterning and specification may be under regulation by miRNAs. Smad1
      transcripts are associated with the RISC; target prediction algorithms identify a
      single miRNA-binding site for miR-26, which is common to the 3'UTRs of Smad1a and
      Smad1b. Disruption of the interaction between miR-26 and the Smad1 3'UTR via a
      Target Protector Morpholino Oligonucleotide (TPMO) leads to a 2-fold increase in 
      Smad1 protein accumulation, moderate increases in the expression of BMP4/Smad1
      target genes, and a reduction in organizer gene expression, as well as a
      partially ventralized phenotype in approximately 25% of embryos. Overexpression
      of miR-26 resulted in moderately decreased expression of Smad1-dependent genes
      and an expansion of the region expressing the Organizer gene not1. Our findings
      indicate that interactions between miR-26 and the Smad1 3'UTR modulate Smad1
      function in the establishment of axial patterning; they also establish a
      foundation for the functional analysis of miRNAs and their regulatory
      interactions during gastrulation.

AB  - Mutations that impair the proliferation of enteric neural crest-derived cells
      (ENCDC) cause Hirschsprung disease, a potentially lethal birth defect where the
      enteric nervous system (ENS) is absent from distal bowel. Inosine 5'
      monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity is essential for de novo GMP
      synthesis, and chemical inhibition of IMPDH induces Hirschsprung disease-like
      pathology in mouse models by reducing ENCDC proliferation. Two IMPDH isoforms are
      ubiquitously expressed in the embryo, but only IMPDH2 is required for life. To
      further understand the role of IMPDH2 in ENS and neural crest development, we
      characterized a conditional Impdh2 mutant mouse. Deletion of Impdh2 in the early 
      neural crest using the Wnt1-Cre transgene produced defects in multiple neural
      crest derivatives including highly penetrant intestinal aganglionosis, agenesis
      of the craniofacial skeleton, and cardiac outflow tract and great vessel
      malformations. Analysis using a Rosa26 reporter mouse suggested that some or all 
      of the remaining ENS in Impdh2 conditional-knockout animals was derived from
      cells that escaped Wnt1-Cre mediated DNA recombination. These data suggest that
      IMPDH2 mediated guanine nucleotide synthesis is essential for normal development 
      of the ENS and other neural crest derivatives.

AB  - Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons modulate various motor and cognitive
      functions, and their dysfunction or degeneration has been implicated in several
      psychiatric diseases. Both Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt signaling pathways have
      been shown to be essential for normal development of mDA neurons. Primary cilia
      are critical for the development of a number of structures in the brain by
      serving as a hub for essential developmental signaling cascades, but their role
      in the generation of mDA neurons has not been examined. We analyzed mutant mouse 
      lines deficient in the intraflagellar transport protein IFT88, which is critical 
      for primary cilia function. Conditional inactivation of Ift88 in the midbrain
      after E9.0 results in progressive loss of primary cilia, a decreased size of the 
      mDA progenitor domain, and a reduction in mDA neurons. We identified Shh
      signaling as the primary cause of these defects, since conditional inactivation
      of the Shh signaling pathway after E9.0, through genetic ablation of Gli2 and
      Gli3 in the midbrain, results in a phenotype basically identical to the one seen 
      in Ift88 conditional mutants. Moreover, the expansion of the mDA progenitor
      domain observed when Shh signaling is constitutively activated does not occur in 
      absence of Ift88. In contrast, clusters of Shh-responding progenitors are
      maintained in the ventral midbrain of the hypomorphic Ift88 mouse mutant,
      cobblestone. Despite the residual Shh signaling, the integrity of the mDA
      progenitor domain is severely disturbed, and consequently very few mDA neurons
      are generated in cobblestone mutants. Our results identify for the first time a
      crucial role of primary cilia in the induction of mDA progenitors, define a
      narrow time window in which Shh-mediated signaling is dependent upon normal
      primary cilia function for this purpose, and suggest that later Wnt
      signaling-dependent events act independently of primary cilia.

AB  - Lymph is returned to the blood circulation exclusively via four lymphovenous
      valves (LVVs). Despite their vital importance, the architecture and development
      of LVVs is poorly understood. We analyzed the formation of LVVs at the molecular 
      and ultrastructural levels during mouse embryogenesis and identified three
      critical steps. First, LVV-forming endothelial cells (LVV-ECs) differentiate from
      PROX1(+) progenitors and delaminate from the luminal side of the veins. Second,
      LVV-ECs aggregate, align perpendicular to the direction of lymph flow and
      establish lympho-venous connections. Finally, LVVs mature with the recruitment of
      mural cells. LVV morphogenesis is disrupted in four different mouse models of
      primary lymphedema and the severity of LVV defects correlate with that of
      lymphedema. In summary, we have provided the first and the most comprehensive
      analysis of LVV development. Furthermore, our work suggests that aberrant LVVs
      contribute to lymphedema.

AB  - Most metazoans are able to grow beyond a few hundred cells and to support
      differentiated tissues because they elaborate multicellular, epithelial tubes
      that are indispensable for nutrient and gas exchange. To identify and
      characterize the cellular behaviors and molecular mechanisms required for the
      morphogenesis of epithelial tubes (i.e., tubulogenesis), we have turned to the D.
      melanogaster ovary. Here, epithelia surrounding the developing egg chambers first
      pattern, then form and extend a set of simple, paired, epithelial tubes, the
      dorsal appendage (DA) tubes, and they create these structures in the absence of
      cell division or cell death. This genetically tractable system lets us assess the
      relative contributions that coordinated changes in cell shape, adhesion,
      orientation, and migration make to basic epithelial tubulogenesis. We find that
      Dynamin, a conserved regulator of endocytosis and the cytoskeleton, serves a key 
      role in DA tubulogenesis. We demonstrate that Dynamin is required for distinct
      aspects of DA tubulogenesis: DA-tube closure, DA-tube-cell intercalation, and
      biased apical-luminal cell expansion. We provide evidence that Dynamin promotes
      these processes by facilitating endocytosis of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion
      complexes, and we find that precise levels and sub-cellular distribution of
      E-Cadherin and specific Integrin subunits impact DA tubulogenesis. Thus, our
      studies identify novel morphogenetic roles (i.e., tube closure and biased apical 
      expansion), and expand upon established roles (i.e., cell intercalation and
      adhesion remodeling), for Dynamin in tubulogenesis.

TI  - ACAM, a novel member of the neural IgCAM family, mediates anterior neural tube
      closure in a primitive chordate.

AB  - The neural IgCAM family of cell adhesion molecules, which includes NCAM and
      related molecules, has evolved via gene duplication and alternative splicing to
      allow for a wide range of isoforms with distinct functions and homophilic binding
      properties. A search for neural IgCAMs in ascidians (Ciona intestinalis, Ciona
      savignyi, and Phallusia mammillata) has identified a novel set of truncated
      family members that, unlike the known members, lack fibronectin III domains and
      consist of only repeated Ig domains. Within the tunicates this form appears to be
      unique to the ascidians, and it was designated ACAM, for Ascidian Cell Adhesion
      Molecule. In C. intestinalis ACAM is expressed in the developing neural plate and
      neural tube, with strongest expression in the anterior sensory vesicle precursor.
      Unlike the two other conventional neural IgCAMs in C. intestinalis, which are
      expressed maternally and throughout the morula and blastula stages, ACAM
      expression initiates at the gastrula stage. Moreover, C. intestinalis ACAM is a
      target of the homeodomain transcription factor OTX, which plays an essential role
      in the development of the anterior central nervous system. Morpholino (MO)
      knockdown shows that ACAM is required for neural tube closure. In MO-injected
      embryos neural tube closure was normal caudally, but the anterior neuropore
      remained open. A similar phenotype was seen with overexpression of a secreted
      version of ACAM. The presence of ACAM in ascidians highlights the diversity of
      this gene family in morphogenesis and neurodevelopment.

AB  - In the mammary gland, PTEN loss in luminal and basal epithelial cells results in 
      differentiation defects and enhanced proliferation, leading to the formation of
      tumors with basal epithelial characteristics. In breast cancer, PTEN loss is
      associated with a hormone receptor-negative, basal-like subtype that is thought
      to originate in a luminal epithelial cell. Here, we show that luminal-specific
      PTEN loss results in distinct effects on epithelial homeostasis and mammary tumor
      formation. Luminal PTEN loss increased proliferation of hormone receptor-negative
      cells, thereby decreasing the percentage of hormone receptor-positive cells.
      Moreover, luminal PTEN loss led to misoriented cell divisions and mislocalization
      of cells to the intraluminal space of mammary ducts. Despite their elevated
      levels of activated AKT, Pten-null intraluminal cells showed increased levels of 
      apoptosis. One year after Pten deletion, the ducts had cleared and no palpable
      mammary tumors were detected. These data establish PTEN as a critical regulator
      of luminal epithelial homeostasis and integrity in the adult mammary gland, and
      further show that luminal PTEN loss alone is not sufficient to promote the
      progression of mammary tumorigenesis.

AB  - Specification of the ciliated band (CB) of echinoid embryos executes three
      spatial functions essential for postgastrular organization. These are
      establishment of a band about 5 cells wide which delimits and bounds other
      embryonic territories; definition of a neurogenic domain within this band; and
      generation within it of arrays of ciliary cells that bear the special long cilia 
      from which the structure derives its name. In Strongylocentrotus purpuratus the
      spatial coordinates of the future ciliated band are initially and exactly
      determined by the disposition of a ring of cells that transcriptionally activate 
      the onecut homeodomain regulatory gene, beginning in blastula stage, long before 
      the appearance of the CB per se. Thus the cis-regulatory apparatus that governs
      onecut expression in the blastula directly reveals the genomic sequence code by
      which these aspects of the spatial organization of the embryo are initially
      determined. We screened the entire onecut locus and its flanking region for
      transcriptionally active cis-regulatory elements, and by means of BAC
      recombineered deletions identified three separated and required cis-regulatory
      modules that execute different functions. The operating logic of the crucial
      spatial control module accounting for the spectacularly precise and beautiful
      early onecut expression domain depends on spatial repression. Previously
      predicted oral ectoderm and aboral ectoderm repressors were identified by
      cis-regulatory mutation as the products of goosecoid and irxa genes respectively,
      while the pan-ectodermal activator SoxB1 supplies a transcriptional driver
      function.

TI  - Dephosphorylation of juxtamembrane serines and threonines of the NPR2 guanylyl
      cyclase is required for rapid resumption of oocyte meiosis in response to
      luteinizing hormone.

AB  - The meiotic cell cycle of mammalian oocytes starts during embryogenesis and then 
      pauses until luteinizing hormone (LH) acts on the granulosa cells of the follicle
      surrounding the oocyte to restart the cell cycle. An essential event in this
      process is a decrease in cyclic GMP in the granulosa cells, and part of the cGMP 
      decrease results from dephosphorylation and inactivation of the natriuretic
      peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) guanylyl cyclase, also known as guanylyl cyclase B.
      However, it is unknown whether NPR2 dephosphorylation is essential for LH-induced
      meiotic resumption. Here, we prevented NPR2 dephosphorylation by generating a
      mouse line in which the seven regulatory serines and threonines of NPR2 were
      changed to the phosphomimetic amino acid glutamate (Npr2-7E). Npr2-7E/7E
      follicles failed to show a decrease in enzyme activity in response to LH, and the
      cGMP decrease was attenuated; correspondingly, LH-induced meiotic resumption was 
      delayed. Meiotic resumption in response to EGF receptor activation was likewise
      delayed, indicating that NPR2 dephosphorylation is a component of the pathway by 
      which EGF receptor activation mediates LH signaling. We also found that most of
      the NPR2 protein in the follicle was present in the mural granulosa cells. These 
      findings indicate that NPR2 dephosphorylation in the mural granulosa cells is
      essential for the normal progression of meiosis in response to LH and EGF
      receptor activation. In addition, these studies provide the first demonstration
      that a change in phosphorylation of a transmembrane guanylyl cyclase regulates a 
      physiological process, a mechanism that may also control other developmental
      events.

AB  - Heart outflow tract septation in mouse embryos carrying mutations in retinoic
      acid receptor genes fails with complete penetrance. In this mutant background,
      ectopic TGFbeta signaling in the distal outflow tract is responsible for
      septation failure, but it was uncertain what tissue was responsive to ectopic
      TGFbeta and why this response interfered with septation. By combining RAR gene
      mutation with tissue-specific Cre drivers and a conditional type II TGFbeta
      receptor (Tgfbr2) allele, we determined that ectopic activation of TGFbeta
      signaling in the endocardium is responsible for septation defects. Ectopic
      TGFbeta signaling results in ectopic mesenchymal transformation of the
      endocardium and thereby in improperly constituted distal OFT cushions. Our
      analysis highlights the interactions between myocardium, endocardium, and neural 
      crest cells in outflow tract morphogenesis, and demonstrates the requirement for 
      proper TGFbeta signaling in outflow tract cushion organization and septation.

AB  - In mammals, hair follicles cover most of the body surface and exhibit precise and
      stereotyped orientations relative to the body axes. Follicle orientation is
      controlled by the planar cell polarity (PCP; or, more generally, tissue polarity)
      system, as determined by the follicle mis-orientation phenotypes observed in mice
      with PCP gene mutations. The present study uses conditional knockout alleles of
      the PCP genes Frizzled6 (Fz6), Vangl1, and Vangl2, together with a series of Cre 
      drivers to interrogate the spatio-temporal domains of PCP gene action in the
      developing mouse epidermis required for follicle orientation. Fz6 is required
      starting between embryonic day (E)11.5 and E12.5. Eliminating Fz6 in either the
      anterior or the posterior halves of the embryo or in either the feet or the torso
      leads to follicle mis-orientation phenotypes that are limited to the territories 
      associated with Fz6 loss, implying either that PCP signaling is required for
      communicating polarity information on a local but not a global scale, or that
      there are multiple independent sources of global polarity information.
      Eliminating Fz6 in most hair follicle cells or in the inter-follicular epidermis 
      at E15.5 suggests that PCP signaling in developing follicles is not required to
      maintain their orientation. The asymmetric arrangement of Merkel cells around the
      base of each guard hair follicle dependents on Fz6 expression in the epidermis
      but not in differentiating Merkel cells. These experiments constrain current
      models of PCP signaling and the flow of polarity information in mammalian skin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders are caused by expanded CAG
      (Glutamine) repeats in neurons in the brain. The expanded repeats are also
      expressed in the non-neuronal cells, however, their contribution to disease
      pathogenesis is not very well studied. In the present study, we have expressed a 
      stretch of 127 Glutamine repeats in Malpighian tubules (MTs) of Drosophila
      melanogaster as these tissues do not undergo ecdysone induced histolysis during
      larval to pupal transition at metamorphosis. RESULTS: Progressive degeneration,
      which is the hallmark of neurodegeneration is also observed in MTs. The mutant
      protein forms inclusion bodies in the nucleus resulting in expansion of the
      nucleus and affect chromatin organization which appear loose and open, eventually
      resulting in DNA fragmentation and blebbing. A virtual absence of tubule lumen
      was observed followed by functional abnormalities. As development progressed,
      severe abnormalities affecting pupal epithelial morphogenesis processes were
      observed resulting in complete lethality. Distribution of heterogeneous RNA
      binding protein (hnRNP), HRB87F, Wnt/wingless and JNK signaling and expression of
      Relish was also found to be affected. Expression of resistance genes following
      polyQ expression was up regulated. CONCLUSION: The present study gives an insight
      into the effects of polyQ aggregates in non-neuronal tissues.

AB  - Thyroid development and formation vary among species, but in most species the
      thyroid morphogenesis consists of five stages: specification, budding, descent,
      bilobation and folliculogenesis. The detailed mechanisms of these stages have not
      been fully clarified. During early development, the cranial neural crest (CNC)
      contributes to the thyroid gland. The removal of the postotic CNC (corresponding 
      to rhombomeres 6, 7 and 8, also known as the cardiac neural crest) results in
      abnormalities of the cardiovascular system, thymus, parathyroid glands, and
      thyroid gland. To investigate the influence of the CNC on thyroid bilobation
      process, we divided the CNC into two regions, the postotic CNC and the preotic
      CNC (from the mesencephalon to rhombomere 5) regions and examined. We found that 
      preotic CNC-ablated embryos had a unilateral thyroid lobe, and confirmed the
      presence of a single lobe or the absence of lobes in postotic CNC-ablated chick
      embryos. The thyroid anlage in each region-ablated embryos was of a normal size
      at the descent stage, but at a later stage, the thyroid in preotic CNC-ablated
      embryos was of a normal size, conflicting with a previous report in which the
      thyroid was reduced in size in the postotic CNC-ablated embryos. The postotic CNC
      cells differentiated into connective tissues of the thyroid in quail-to-chick
      chimeras. In contrast, the preotic CNC cells did not differentiate into
      connective tissues of the thyroid. We found that preotic CNC cells encompassed
      the thyroid anlage from the specification stage to the descent stage. Finally, we
      found that endothelin-1 and endothelin type A receptor-knockout mice and bosentan
      (endothelin receptor antagonist)-treated chick embryos showed bilobation
      anomalies that included single-lobe formation. Therefore, not only the postotic
      CNC, but also the preotic CNC plays an important role in thyroid morphogenesis.

AB  - The developmental process through which the cloaca transforms from one hollow
      structure to two separated urinary and digestive outlets remains controversial
      and speculative. Here, we use high-resolution episcopic microscopy to examine a
      comprehensive series of normal and mutant mouse cloaca in which the detailed
      3-dimensional (3-D) morphological features are illuminated throughout the
      development. We provide evidence that the dorsal peri-cloacal mesenchyme (dPCM)
      remains stationary while other surrounding tissues grow towards it. This causes
      dramatic changes of spatial relationship among caudal structures and
      morphological transformation of the cloaca. The 3-D characterizations of Dkk1
      mutants reveal a hyperplastic defect of dPCM, which leads to a significant
      anterior shift of the caudal boundary of the cloaca, premature occlusion of the
      cloaca and, imperforate anus phenotype. Conversely, Shh knockout causes a severe 
      hypoplastic defect of cloaca mesenchyme including dPCM and persistent cloaca.
      Collectively, these findings suggest that formation of the dPCM is critical for
      cloacal morphogenesis and furthermore, growth and movement of the mesenchymal
      tissues towards the dPCM lead to the cloaca occlusion and separation of the
      urinary and digestive outlets.

AB  - Mutations in endoglin, a TGFbeta/BMP coreceptor, are causal for hereditary
      hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Endoglin-null (Eng-/-) mouse embryos die at
      embryonic day (E)10.5-11.5 due to defects in angiogenesis. In part, this is due
      to an absence of vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation and vessel
      investment. Prior studies from our lab and others have shown the importance of
      endoglin expression in embryonic development in both endothelial cells and neural
      crest stem cells. These studies support the hypothesis that endoglin may play
      cell-autonomous roles in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell precursors. 
      However, the requirement for endoglin in vascular cell precursors remains poorly 
      defined. Our objective was to specifically delete endoglin in neural crest- and
      somite-derived Pax3-positive vascular precursors to understand the impact on
      somite progenitor cell contribution to embryonic vascular development. Pax3Cre
      mice were crossed with Eng+/- mice to obtain compound mutant Pax3(Cre/+);Eng+/-
      mice. These mice were then crossed with homozygous endoglin LoxP-mutated
      (Eng(LoxP/LoxP)) mice to conditionally delete the endoglin gene in specific
      lineages that contribute to endothelial and smooth muscle constituents of
      developing embryonic vessels. Pax3(Cre/+);Eng(LoxP/)(-) mice showed a variety of 
      vascular defects at E10.5, and none of these mice survived past E12.5. Embryos
      analyzed at E10.5 showed malformations suggestive of misdirection of the
      intersomitic vessels. The dorsal aorta showed significant dilation with
      associated vascular smooth muscle cells exhibiting disorganization and enhanced
      expression of smooth muscle differentiation proteins, including smooth muscle
      actin. These results demonstrate a requirement for endoglin in descendants of
      Pax3-expressing vascular cell precursors, and thus provides new insight into the 
      cellular basis underlying adult vascular diseases such as HHT.

AB  - During development, the evolutionarily conserved Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen provides
      instructional cues that influence cell fate, cell affinity and tissue
      morphogenesis. To do so, the Hh signaling cascade must coordinate its activity
      with other morphogenetic signals. This can occur through engagement of or
      response to effectors that do not typically function as core Hh pathway
      components. Given the ability of small G proteins of the Ras family to impact
      cell survival, differentiation, growth and adhesion, we wanted to determine
      whether Hh and Ras signaling might intersect during development. We performed
      genetic modifier tests in Drosophila to examine the ability of select Ras family 
      members to influence Hh signal output, and identified Rap1 as a positive
      modulator of Hh pathway activity. Our results suggest that Rap1 is activated to
      its GTP-bound form in response to Hh ligand, and that the GTPase exchange factor 
      C3G likely contributes to this activation. The Rap1 effector Canoe (Cno) also
      impacts Hh signal output, suggesting that a C3G-Rap1-Cno axis intersects the Hh
      pathway during tissue morphogenesis.

AB  - Transcription factors affect spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression often
      regulating multiple aspects of tissue morphogenesis, including cell-type
      specification, cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarity, cell shape, cell
      arrangement and cell migration. In this work, we describe a distinct role for
      Ribbon (Rib) in controlling cell shape/volume increases during elongation of the 
      Drosophila salivary gland (SG). Notably, the morphogenetic changes in rib mutants
      occurred without effects on general SG cell attributes such as specification,
      proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, the changes in cell shape/volume in rib
      mutants occurred without compromising epithelial-specific morphological
      attributes such as apicobasal polarity and junctional integrity. To identify the 
      genes regulated by Rib, we performed ChIP-seq analysis in embryos driving
      expression of GFP-tagged Rib specifically in the SGs. To learn if the Rib binding
      sites identified in the ChIP-seq analysis were linked to changes in gene
      expression, we performed microarray analysis comparing RNA samples from
      age-matched wild-type and rib null embryos. From the superposed ChIP-seq and
      microarray gene expression data, we identified 60 genomic sites bound by Rib
      likely to regulate SG-specific gene expression. We confirmed several of the
      identified Rib targets by qRT-pCR and/or in situ hybridization. Our results
      indicate that Rib regulates cell growth and tissue shape in the Drosophila
      salivary gland via a diverse array of targets through both transcriptional
      activation and repression. Furthermore, our results suggest that autoregulation
      of rib expression may be a key component of the SG morphogenetic gene network.

AB  - Despite considerable interest in angiogenesis, organ-specific angiogenesis
      remains less well characterized. The vessels that absorb nutrients from the yolk 
      and later provide blood supply to the developing digestive system are primarily
      venous in origin. In zebrafish, these are the vessels of the Sub-intestinal
      venous plexus (SIVP) and they represent a new candidate model to gain an insight 
      into the mechanisms of venous angiogenesis. Unlike other vessel beds in
      zebrafish, the SIVP is not stereotypically patterned and lacks obvious sources of
      patterning information. However, by examining the area of vessel coverage, number
      of compartments, proliferation and migration speed we have identified common
      developmental steps in SIVP formation. We applied our analysis of SIVP
      development to obd mutants that have a mutation in the guidance receptor
      PlexinD1. obd mutants show dysregulation of nearly all parameters of SIVP
      formation. We show that the SIVP responds to a unique combination of pathways
      that control both arterial and venous growth in other systems. Blocking Shh,
      Notch and Pdgf signaling has no effect on SIVP growth. However Vegf promotes
      sprouting of the predominantly venous plexus and Bmp promotes outgrowth of the
      structure. We propose that the SIVP is a unique model to understand novel
      mechanisms utilized in organ-specific angiogenesis.

      to regulate placental demands for maternal resources.

AB  - Imprinted genes, which are expressed from a single parental allele in response to
      epigenetic marks first established in the germline, function in a myriad of
      processes to regulate mammalian development. Recent work suggests that imprinted 
      genes may regulate the signalling function of the placenta by modulating the size
      of the endocrine compartment. Here we provide in vivo evidence that this
      hypothesis is well founded. Elevated expression of the imprinted Pleckstrin
      homology-like domain, family a, member 2 (Phlda2) gene drives a reduction of the 
      spongiotrophoblast endocrine compartment, diminished placental glycogen and
      asymmetric foetal growth restriction. Using both loss-of-function and
      gain-in-expression mouse models, here we further show that Phlda2 exclusively
      modulates the spongiotrophoblast compartment of the placenta without
      significantly altering the composition of the trophoblast giant cell endocrine
      lineages that share a common progenitor with this lineage. Additionally, we show 
      that Phlda2 loss-of-function placentae contain nearly three times more placental 
      glycogen than non-transgenic placentae. Remarkably, relative to a fully wild type
      scenario, wild type placentae also accumulate excessive glycogen. While
      loss-of-function of Phlda2 increased both placental weight and placental
      glycogen, the weight of both mutant and non-transgenic fetuses was lower than
      that found in a fully wild type scenario indicating that excessive glycogen
      accumulation comes at the cost of foetal growth. This work firstly highlights a
      novel signalling function for the spongiotrophoblast in stimulating the global
      accumulation of placental glycogen. Furthermore, this work suggests that Phlda2
      manipulates the placenta's demands for maternal resources, a process that must be
      tightly regulated by epigenetic marks to ensure optimal foetal growth.
