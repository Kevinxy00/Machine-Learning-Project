TI  - Centromere transcription allows CENP-A to transit from chromatin association to
      stable incorporation.

AB  - Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation and are specified
      epigenetically by the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A. In flies and
      humans, replenishment of the centromeric mark is uncoupled from DNA replication
      and requires the removal of H3 "placeholder" nucleosomes. Although transcription 
      at centromeres has been previously linked to the loading of new CENP-A, the
      underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used
      Drosophila melanogaster tissue culture cells to show that centromeric presence of
      actively transcribing RNA polymerase II temporally coincides with de novo
      deposition of dCENP-A. Using a newly developed dCENP-A loading system that is
      independent of acute transcription, we found that short inhibition of
      transcription impaired dCENP-A incorporation into chromatin. Interestingly,
      initial targeting of dCENP-A to centromeres was unaffected, revealing two
      stability states of newly loaded dCENP-A: a salt-sensitive association with the
      centromere and a salt-resistant chromatin-incorporated form. This suggests that
      transcription-mediated chromatin remodeling is required for the transition of
      dCENP-A to fully incorporated nucleosomes at the centromere.

TI  - The cell biology of systemic insulin function.
LID - jcb.201802095 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201802095 [doi]
AB  - Insulin is the paramount anabolic hormone, promoting carbon energy deposition in 
      the body. Its synthesis, quality control, delivery, and action are exquisitely
      regulated by highly orchestrated intracellular mechanisms in different organs or 
      "stations" of its bodily journey. In this Beyond the Cell review, we focus on
      these five stages of the journey of insulin through the body and the captivating 
      cell biology that underlies the interaction of insulin with each organ. We first 
      analyze insulin's biosynthesis in and export from the beta-cells of the pancreas.
      Next, we focus on its first pass and partial clearance in the liver with its
      temporality and periodicity linked to secretion. Continuing the journey, we
      briefly describe insulin's action on the blood vasculature and its still-debated 
      mechanisms of exit from the capillary beds. Once in the parenchymal interstitium 
      of muscle and adipose tissue, insulin promotes glucose uptake into myofibers and 
      adipocytes, and we elaborate on the intricate signaling and vesicle traffic
      mechanisms that underlie this fundamental function. Finally, we touch upon the
      renal degradation of insulin to end its action. Cellular discernment of insulin's
      availability and action should prove critical to understanding its pivotal
      physiological functions and how their failure leads to diabetes.

TI  - Autophagy regulates testosterone synthesis by facilitating cholesterol uptake in 
      Leydig cells.
LID - jcb.201710078 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201710078 [doi]
AB  - Testosterone is indispensable for sexual development and maintaining male
      characteristics, and deficiency of this hormone results in primary or late-onset 
      hypogonadism (LOH). Testosterone is primarily produced in Leydig cells, where
      autophagy has been reported to be extremely active. However, the functional role 
      of autophagy in testosterone synthesis remains unknown. In this study, we show
      that steroidogenic cell-specific disruption of autophagy influenced the sexual
      behavior of aging male mice because of a reduction in serum testosterone, which
      is similar to the symptoms of LOH. The decline in testosterone was caused mainly 
      by a defect in cholesterol uptake in autophagy-deficient Leydig cells. Further
      studies revealed that once autophagic flux was disrupted, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger
      regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) accumulated in Leydig cells, resulting in the
      down-regulation of scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) and eventually
      leading to insufficient cholesterol supply. Collectively, these results reveal
      that autophagy promotes cholesterol uptake into Leydig cells by eliminating
      NHERF2, suggesting that dysfunction of autophagy might be causal in the loss of
      testosterone production in some patients.

TI  - PKA-RII subunit phosphorylation precedes activation by cAMP and regulates
      activity termination.
LID - jcb.201708053 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708053 [doi]
AB  - Type II isoforms of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein
      kinase A (PKA-II) contain a phosphorylatable epitope within the inhibitory domain
      of RII subunits (pRII) with still unclear function. In vitro, RII phosphorylation
      occurs in the absence of cAMP, whereas staining of cells with pRII-specific
      antibodies revealed a cAMP-dependent pattern. In sensory neurons, we found that
      increased pRII immunoreactivity reflects increased accessibility of the already
      phosphorylated RII epitope during cAMP-induced opening of the tetrameric RII2:C2 
      holoenzyme. Accordingly, induction of pRII by cAMP was sensitive to novel
      inhibitors of dissociation, whereas blocking catalytic activity was ineffective. 
      Also in vitro, cAMP increased the binding of pRII antibodies to RII2:C2
      holoenzymes. Identification of an antibody specific for the glycine-rich loop of 
      catalytic subunits facing the pRII-epitope confirmed activity-dependent binding
      with similar kinetics, proving that the reassociation is rapid and precisely
      controlled. Mechanistic modeling further supported that RII phosphorylation
      precedes cAMP binding and controls the inactivation by modulating the
      reassociation involving the coordinated action of phosphodiesterases and
      phosphatases.

AB  - Integrin activation regulates adhesion, extracellular matrix assembly, and cell
      migration, thereby playing an indispensable role in development and in many
      pathological processes. A proline mutation in the central integrin beta3
      transmembrane domain (TMD) creates a flexible kink that uncouples the topology of
      the inner half of the TMD from the outer half. In this study, using leukocyte
      integrin alpha4beta7, which enables development of gut-associated lymphoid tissue
      (GALT), we examined the biological effect of such a proline mutation and report
      that it impairs agonist-induced talin-mediated activation of integrin
      alpha4beta7, thereby inhibiting rolling lymphocyte arrest, a key step in
      transmigration. Furthermore, the alpha4beta7(L721P) mutation blocks lymphocyte
      homing to and development of the GALT. These studies show that impairing the
      ability of an integrin beta TMD to transmit talin-induced TMD topology inhibits
      agonist-induced physiological integrin activation and biological function in
      development.

TI  - VASP regulates leukocyte infiltration, polarization, and vascular repair after
      ischemia.
PG  - 1503-1519
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702048 [doi]
AB  - In ischemic vascular diseases, leukocyte recruitment and polarization are crucial
      for revascularization and tissue repair. We investigated the role of
      vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) in vascular repair. After hindlimb
      ischemia induction, blood flow recovery, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and
      leukocyte infiltration into ischemic muscles in VASP(-/-) mice were accelerated. 
      VASP deficiency also elevated the polarization of the macrophages through
      increased signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling,
      which augmented the release of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors to
      promote leukocyte recruitment and vascular repair. Importantly, VASP deletion in 
      bone marrow-derived cells was sufficient to mimic the increased blood flow
      recovery of global VASP(-/-) mice. In chemotaxis experiments, VASP(-/-)
      neutrophils/monocytes were significantly more responsive to M1-related chemokines
      than wild-type controls. Mechanistically, VASP formed complexes with the
      chemokine receptor CCR2 and beta-arrestin-2, and CCR2 receptor internalization
      was significantly reduced in VASP(-/-) leukocytes. Our data indicate that VASP is
      a major regulator of leukocyte recruitment and polarization in postischemic
      revascularization and support a novel role of VASP in chemokine receptor
      trafficking.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201707143 [doi]
AB  - In mammalian pancreatic beta cells, the IRE1alpha-XBP1 pathway is constitutively 
      and highly activated under physiological conditions. To elucidate the precise
      role of this pathway, we constructed beta cell-specific Ire1alpha conditional
      knockout (CKO) mice and established insulinoma cell lines in which Ire1alpha was 
      deleted using the Cre-loxP system. Ire1alpha CKO mice showed the typical diabetic
      phenotype including impaired glycemic control and defects in insulin biosynthesis
      postnatally at 4-20 weeks. Ire1alpha deletion in pancreatic beta cells in mice
      and insulinoma cells resulted in decreased insulin secretion, decreased insulin
      and proinsulin contents in cells, and decreased oxidative folding of proinsulin
      along with decreased expression of five protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs): PDI,
      PDIR, P5, ERp44, and ERp46. Reconstitution of the IRE1alpha-XBP1 pathway restored
      the proinsulin and insulin contents, insulin secretion, and expression of the
      five PDIs, indicating that IRE1alpha functions as a key regulator of the
      induction of catalysts for the oxidative folding of proinsulin in pancreatic beta
      cells.

TI  - A homeostatic clock sets daughter centriole size in flies.
PG  - 1233-1248
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201801014 [doi]
AB  - Centrioles are highly structured organelles whose size is remarkably consistent
      within any given cell type. New centrioles are born when Polo-like kinase 4
      (Plk4) recruits Ana2/STIL and Sas-6 to the side of an existing "mother"
      centriole. These two proteins then assemble into a cartwheel, which grows
      outwards to form the structural core of a new daughter. Here, we show that in
      early Drosophila melanogaster embryos, daughter centrioles grow at a linear rate 
      during early S-phase and abruptly stop growing when they reach their correct size
      in mid- to late S-phase. Unexpectedly, the cartwheel grows from its proximal end,
      and Plk4 determines both the rate and period of centriole growth: the more active
      the centriolar Plk4, the faster centrioles grow, but the faster centriolar Plk4
      is inactivated and growth ceases. Thus, Plk4 functions as a homeostatic clock,
      establishing an inverse relationship between growth rate and period to ensure
      that daughter centrioles grow to the correct size.

TI  - An ordered pattern of Ana2 phosphorylation by Plk4 is required for centriole
      assembly.
PG  - 1217-1231
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605106 [doi]
AB  - Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) initiates an early step in centriole assembly by
      phosphorylating Ana2/STIL, a structural component of the procentriole. Here, we
      show that Plk4 binding to the central coiled-coil (CC) of Ana2 is a conserved
      event involving Polo-box 3 and a previously unidentified putative CC located
      adjacent to the kinase domain. Ana2 is then phosphorylated along its length.
      Previous studies showed that Plk4 phosphorylates the C-terminal STil/ANa2 (STAN) 
      domain of Ana2/STIL, triggering binding and recruitment of the cartwheel protein 
      Sas6 to the procentriole assembly site. However, the physiological relevance of
      N-terminal phosphorylation was unknown. We found that Plk4 first phosphorylates
      the extreme N terminus of Ana2, which is critical for subsequent STAN domain
      modification. Phosphorylation of the central region then breaks the Plk4-Ana2
      interaction. This phosphorylation pattern is important for centriole assembly and
      integrity because replacement of endogenous Ana2 with phospho-Ana2 mutants
      disrupts distinct steps in Ana2 function and inhibits centriole duplication.

TI  - Kindlin-2 regulates mesenchymal stem cell differentiation through control of
      YAP1/TAZ.
PG  - 1431-1451
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612177 [doi]
AB  - Precise control of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation is critical for
      tissue development and regeneration. We show here that kindlin-2 is a key
      determinant of MSC fate decision. Depletion of kindlin-2 in MSCs is sufficient to
      induce adipogenesis and inhibit osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo.
      Mechanistically, kindlin-2 regulates MSC differentiation through controlling
      YAP1/TAZ at both the transcript and protein levels. Kindlin-2 physically
      associates with myosin light-chain kinase in response to mechanical cues of cell 
      microenvironment and intracellular signaling events and promotes myosin
      light-chain phosphorylation. Loss of kindlin-2 inhibits RhoA activation and
      reduces myosin light-chain phosphorylation, stress fiber formation, and focal
      adhesion assembly, resulting in increased Ser127 phosphorylation, nuclear
      exclusion, and ubiquitin ligase atrophin-1 interacting protein 4-mediated
      degradation of YAP1/TAZ. Our findings reveal a novel kindlin-2 signaling axis
      that senses the mechanical cues of cell microenvironment and controls MSC fate
      decision, and they suggest a new strategy to regulate MSC differentiation, tissue
      repair, and regeneration.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709121 [doi]
AB  - DNA replication reactions are central to diverse cellular processes including
      development, cancer etiology, drug treatment, and resistance. Many proteins and
      pathways exist to ensure DNA replication fidelity and protection of stalled or
      damaged replication forks. Consistently, mutations in proteins involved in DNA
      replication are implicated in diverse diseases that include defects during
      embryonic development and immunity, accelerated aging, increased inflammation,
      blood disease, and cancer. Thus, tools for efficient quantitative analysis of
      protein interactions at active and stalled replication forks are key for advanced
      and accurate biological understanding. Here we describe a sensitive
      single-cell-level assay system for the quantitative analysis of protein
      interactions with nascent DNA. Specifically, we achieve robust in situ analysis
      of protein interactions at DNA replication forks (SIRF) using proximity ligation 
      coupled with 5'-ethylene-2'-deoxyuridine click chemistry suitable for
      multiparameter analysis in heterogeneous cell populations. We provide validation 
      data for sensitivity, accuracy, proximity, and quantitation. Using SIRF, we
      obtained new insight on the regulation of pathway choice by 53BP1 at transiently 
      stalled replication forks.

PG  - 1249-1268
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611150 [doi]
AB  - Schwann cells respond to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) halting
      proliferation and expressing myelin proteins. Here we show that cAMP signaling
      induces the nuclear shuttling of the class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC)-4 in
      these cells, where it binds to the promoter and blocks the expression of c-Jun, a
      negative regulator of myelination. To do it, HDAC4 does not interfere with the
      transcriptional activity of MEF2. Instead, by interacting with NCoR1, it recruits
      HDAC3 and deacetylates histone 3 in the promoter of c-Jun, blocking gene
      expression. Importantly, this is enough to up-regulate Krox20 and start Schwann
      cell differentiation program-inducing myelin gene expression. Using conditional
      knockout mice, we also show that HDAC4 together with HDAC5 redundantly contribute
      to activate the myelin transcriptional program and the development of myelin
      sheath in vivo. We propose a model in which cAMP signaling shuttles class IIa
      HDACs into the nucleus of Schwann cells to regulate the initial steps of
      myelination in the peripheral nervous system.

AB  - Stress granules (SGs) are cytosolic, nonmembranous RNA-protein complexes. In
      vitro experiments suggested that they are formed by liquid-liquid phase
      separation; however, their properties in mammalian cells remain unclear. We
      analyzed the distribution and dynamics of two paradigmatic RNA-binding proteins
      (RBPs), Ras GTPase-activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein (G3BP1) and
      insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 1 (IMP1), with single-molecule
      resolution in living neuronal cells. Both RBPs exhibited different exchange
      kinetics between SGs. Within SGs, single-molecule localization microscopy
      revealed distributed hotspots of immobilized G3BP1 and IMP1 that reflect the
      presence of relatively immobile nanometer-sized nanocores. We demonstrate
      alternating binding in nanocores and anomalous diffusion in the liquid phase with
      similar characteristics for both RBPs. Reduction of low-complexity regions in
      G3BP1 resulted in less detectable mobile molecules in the liquid phase without
      change in binding in nanocores. The data provide direct support for liquid
      droplet behavior of SGs in living cells and reveal transient binding of RBPs in
      nanocores. Our study uncovers a surprising disconnect between SG partitioning and
      internal diffusion and interactions of RBPs.

AB  - In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, pheromone signaling engages a
      signaling pathway composed of a G protein-coupled receptor, Ras, and a
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that triggers sexual
      differentiation and gamete fusion. Cell-cell fusion requires local cell wall
      digestion, which relies on an initially dynamic actin fusion focus that becomes
      stabilized upon local enrichment of the signaling cascade on the structure. We
      constructed a live-reporter of active Ras1 (Ras1-guanosine triphosphate [GTP])
      that shows Ras activity at polarity sites peaking on the fusion structure before 
      fusion. Remarkably, constitutive Ras1 activation promoted fusion focus
      stabilization and fusion attempts irrespective of cell pairing, leading to cell
      lysis. Ras1 activity was restricted by the guanosine triphosphatase-activating
      protein Gap1, which was itself recruited to sites of Ras1-GTP and was essential
      to block untimely fusion attempts. We propose that negative feedback control of
      Ras activity restrains the MAPK signal and couples fusion with cell-cell
      engagement.

      macrophages.
PG  - 1411-1429
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201707027 [doi]
AB  - Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family 1 (SLAMF1) is an Ig-like
      receptor and a costimulatory molecule that initiates signal transduction networks
      in a variety of immune cells. In this study, we report that SLAMF1 is required
      for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated induction of interferon beta (IFNbeta)
      and for killing of Gram-negative bacteria by human macrophages. We found that
      SLAMF1 controls trafficking of the Toll receptor-associated molecule (TRAM) from 
      the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to Escherichia coli phagosomes. In
      resting macrophages, SLAMF1 is localized to ERC, but upon addition of E. coli, it
      is trafficked together with TRAM from ERC to E. coli phagosomes in a
      Rab11-dependent manner. We found that endogenous SLAMF1 protein interacted with
      TRAM and defined key interaction domains as amino acids 68 to 95 of TRAM as well 
      as 15 C-terminal amino acids of SLAMF1. Interestingly, the SLAMF1-TRAM
      interaction was observed for human but not mouse proteins. Overall, our
      observations suggest that SLAMF1 is a new target for modulation of TLR4-TRAM-TRIF
      inflammatory signaling in human cells.

AB  - Fluorescent labeling of endogenous proteins for live-cell imaging without
      exogenous expression of tagged proteins or genetic manipulations has not been
      routinely possible. We describe a simple versatile antibody-based imaging
      approach (VANIMA) for the precise localization and tracking of endogenous nuclear
      factors. Our protocol can be implemented in every laboratory allowing the
      efficient and nonharmful delivery of organic dye-conjugated antibodies, or
      antibody fragments, into different metazoan cell types. Live-cell imaging permits
      following the labeled probes bound to their endogenous targets. By using
      conventional and super-resolution imaging we show dynamic changes in the
      distribution of several nuclear transcription factors (i.e., RNA polymerase II or
      TAF10), and specific phosphorylated histones (gammaH2AX), upon distinct
      biological stimuli at the nanometer scale. Hence, considering the large panel of 
      available antibodies and the simplicity of their implementation, VANIMA can be
      used to uncover novel biological information based on the dynamic behavior of
      transcription factors or posttranslational modifications in the nucleus of single
      live cells.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706095 [doi]
AB  - The BRCA2 interactor, centrobin, is a centrosomal protein that has been
      implicated in centriole duplication and microtubule stability. We used genome
      editing to ablate CNTROB in hTERT-RPE1 cells and observed an increased frequency 
      of monocentriolar and acentriolar cells. Using a novel monoclonal antibody, we
      found that centrobin primarily localizes to daughter centrioles but also
      associates with mother centrioles upon serum starvation. Strikingly, centrobin
      loss abrogated primary ciliation upon serum starvation. Ultrastructural analysis 
      of centrobin nulls revealed defective axonemal extension after mother centriole
      docking. Ciliogenesis required a C-terminal portion of centrobin that interacts
      with CP110 and tubulin. We also depleted centrobin in zebrafish embryos to
      explore its roles in an entire organism. Centrobin-depleted embryos showed
      microcephaly, with curved and shorter bodies, along with marked defects in
      laterality control, morphological features that indicate ciliary dysfunction. Our
      data identify new roles for centrobin as a positive regulator of vertebrate
      ciliogenesis.

TI  - Pgam5 released from damaged mitochondria induces mitochondrial biogenesis via Wnt
      signaling.
PG  - 1383-1394
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708191 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial abundance is dynamically regulated and was previously shown to be
      increased by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Pgam5 is a mitochondrial phosphatase
      which is cleaved by the rhomboid protease presenilin-associated rhomboid-like
      protein (PARL) and released from membranes after mitochondrial stress. In this
      study, we show that Pgam5 interacts with the Wnt pathway component axin in the
      cytosol, blocks axin-mediated beta-catenin degradation, and increases
      beta-catenin levels and beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Pgam5 stabilized
      beta-catenin by inducing its dephosphorylation in an axin-dependent manner.
      Mitochondrial stress triggered by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone
      (CCCP) treatment led to cytosolic release of endogenous Pgam5 and subsequent
      dephosphorylation of beta-catenin, which was strongly diminished in Pgam5 and
      PARL knockout cells. Similarly, hypoxic stress generated cytosolic Pgam5 and led 
      to stabilization of beta-catenin, which was abolished by Pgam5 knockout. Cells
      stably expressing cytosolic Pgam5 exhibit elevated beta-catenin levels and
      increased mitochondrial numbers. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which
      damaged mitochondria might induce replenishment of the mitochondrial pool by
      cell-intrinsic activation of Wnt signaling via the Pgam5-beta-catenin axis.

PG  - 1485-1502
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703145 [doi]
AB  - Developing tissues change shape and tumors initiate spreading through collective 
      cell motility. Conserved mechanisms by which tissues initiate motility into their
      surroundings are not known. We investigated cytoskeletal regulators during
      collective invasion by mouse tumor organoids and epithelial Madin-Darby canine
      kidney (MDCK) acini undergoing branching morphogenesis in collagen. Use of the
      broad-spectrum formin inhibitor SMIFH2 prevented the formation of migrating cell 
      fronts in both cell types. Focusing on the role of the formin Dia1 in branching
      morphogenesis, we found that its depletion in MDCK cells does not alter planar
      cell motility either within the acinus or in two-dimensional scattering assays.
      However, Dia1 was required to stabilize protrusions extending into the collagen
      matrix. Live imaging of actin, myosin, and collagen in control acini revealed
      adhesions that deformed individual collagen fibrils and generated large traction 
      forces, whereas Dia1-depleted acini exhibited unstable adhesions with minimal
      collagen deformation and lower force generation. This work identifies Dia1 as an 
      essential regulator of tissue shape changes through its role in stabilizing focal
      adhesions.

TI  - Src-mediated phosphorylation converts FHL1 from tumor suppressor to tumor
      promoter.
PG  - 1335-1351
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708064 [doi]
AB  - FHL1 has been recognized for a long time as a tumor suppressor protein that
      associates with both the actin cytoskeleton and the transcriptional machinery. We
      present in this study a paradigm that phosphorylated FHL1 functions as an
      oncogenic protein by promoting tumor cell proliferation. The cytosolic tyrosine
      kinase Src interacts with and phosphorylates FHL1 at Y149 and Y272, which
      switches FHL1 from a tumor suppressor to a cell growth accelerator.
      Phosphorylated FHL1 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to the
      transcription factor BCLAF1 and promotes tumor cell growth. Importantly, the
      phosphorylation of FHL1 is increased in tissues from lung adenocarcinoma patients
      despite the down-regulation of total FHL1 expression. Kindlin-2 was found to
      interact with FHL1 and recruit FHL1 to focal adhesions. Kindlin-2 competes with
      Src for binding to FHL1 and suppresses Src-mediated FHL1 phosphorylation.
      Collectively, we demonstrate that FHL1 can either suppress or promote tumor cell 
      growth depending on the status of the sites for phosphorylation by Src.

      system myelination.
PG  - 1353-1368
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706010 [doi]
AB  - Myelination calls for a remarkable surge in cell metabolism to facilitate lipid
      and membrane production. Endogenous fatty acid (FA) synthesis represents a
      potentially critical process in myelinating glia. Using genetically modified
      mice, we show that Schwann cell (SC) intrinsic activity of the enzyme essential
      for de novo FA synthesis, fatty acid synthase (FASN), is crucial for precise
      lipid composition of peripheral nerves and fundamental for the correct onset of
      myelination and proper myelin growth. Upon FASN depletion in SCs, epineurial
      adipocytes undergo lipolysis, suggestive of a compensatory role. Mechanistically,
      we found that a lack of FASN in SCs leads to an impairment of the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma-regulated transcriptional program.
      In agreement, defects in myelination of FASN-deficient SCs could be ameliorated
      by treatment with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone ex vivo and in vivo. Our
      results reveal that FASN-driven de novo FA synthesis in SCs is mandatory for
      myelination and identify lipogenic activation of the PPARgamma transcriptional
      network as a putative downstream functional mediator.

PG  - 1369-1382
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708044 [doi]
AB  - The biogenesis of mitochondria depends on the import of hundreds of preproteins. 
      N-terminal matrix-targeting signals (MTSs) direct preproteins to the surface
      receptors Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70. In this study, we show that many preproteins
      contain additional internal MTS-like signals (iMTS-Ls) in their mature region
      that share the characteristic properties of presequences. These features allow
      the in silico prediction of iMTS-Ls. Using Atp1 as model substrate, we show that 
      iMTS-Ls mediate the binding to Tom70 and have the potential to target the protein
      to mitochondria if they are presented at its N terminus. The import of
      preproteins with high iMTS-L content is significantly impaired in the absence of 
      Tom70, whereas preproteins with low iMTS-L scores are less dependent on Tom70. We
      propose a stepping stone model according to which the Tom70-mediated interaction 
      with internal binding sites improves the import competence of preproteins and
      increases the efficiency of their translocation into the mitochondrial matrix.

AB  - The assembly of sequence-specific enhancer-binding transcription factors (TFs) at
      cis-regulatory elements in the genome has long been regarded as the fundamental
      mechanism driving cell type-specific gene expression. However, despite extensive 
      biochemical, genetic, and genomic studies in the past three decades, our
      understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying enhancer-mediated gene
      regulation remains incomplete. Recent advances in imaging technologies now enable
      direct visualization of TF-driven regulatory events and transcriptional
      activities at the single-cell, single-molecule level. The ability to observe the 
      remarkably dynamic behavior of individual TFs in live cells at high
      spatiotemporal resolution has begun to provide novel mechanistic insights and
      promises new advances in deciphering causal-functional relationships of TF
      targeting, genome organization, and gene activation. In this review, we review
      current transcription imaging techniques and summarize converging results from
      various lines of research that may instigate a revision of models to describe key
      features of eukaryotic gene regulation.

      dendritic cells.
PG  - 1395-1410

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) produce major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) in
      large amounts to function as professional antigen presenting cells.
      Paradoxically, DCs also ubiquitinate and degrade MHCII in a constitutive manner. 
      Mice deficient in the MHCII-ubiquitinating enzyme membrane-anchored RING-CH1, or 
      the ubiquitin-acceptor lysine of MHCII, exhibit a substantial reduction in the
      number of regulatory T (Treg) cells, but the underlying mechanism was unclear.
      Here we report that ubiquitin-dependent MHCII turnover is critical to maintain
      homeostasis of lipid rafts and the tetraspanin web in DCs. Lack of MHCII
      ubiquitination results in the accumulation of excessive quantities of MHCII in
      the plasma membrane, and the resulting disruption to lipid rafts and the
      tetraspanin web leads to significant impairment in the ability of DCs to engage
      and activate thymocytes for Treg cell differentiation. Thus, ubiquitin-dependent 
      MHCII turnover represents a novel quality-control mechanism by which DCs maintain
      homeostasis of membrane domains that support DC's Treg cell-selecting function.

TI  - A prion-like domain in Hsp42 drives chaperone-facilitated aggregation of
      misfolded proteins.
PG  - 1269-1285
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708116 [doi]
AB  - Chaperones with aggregase activity promote and organize the aggregation of
      misfolded proteins and their deposition at specific intracellular sites. This
      activity represents a novel cytoprotective strategy of protein quality control
      systems; however, little is known about its mechanism. In yeast, the small heat
      shock protein Hsp42 orchestrates the stress-induced sequestration of misfolded
      proteins into cytosolic aggregates (CytoQ). In this study, we show that Hsp42
      harbors a prion-like domain (PrLD) and a canonical intrinsically disordered
      domain (IDD) that act coordinately to promote and control protein aggregation.
      Hsp42 PrLD is essential for CytoQ formation and is bifunctional, mediating
      self-association as well as binding to misfolded proteins. Hsp42 IDD confines
      chaperone and aggregase activity and affects CytoQ numbers and stability in vivo.
      Hsp42 PrLD and IDD are both crucial for cellular fitness during heat stress,
      demonstrating the need for sequestering misfolded proteins in a regulated manner.

AB  - Kinesin-4 motors play important roles in cell division, microtubule organization,
      and signaling. Understanding how motors perform their functions requires an
      understanding of their mechanochemical and motility properties. We demonstrate
      that KIF27 can influence microtubule dynamics, suggesting a conserved function in
      microtubule organization across the kinesin-4 family. However, kinesin-4 motors
      display dramatically different motility characteristics: KIF4 and KIF21 motors
      are fast and processive, KIF7 and its Drosophila melanogaster homologue Costal2
      (Cos2) are immotile, and KIF27 is slow and processive. Neither KIF7 nor KIF27 can
      cooperate for fast processive transport when working in teams. The mechanistic
      basis of immotile KIF7 behavior arises from an inability to release adenosine
      diphosphate in response to microtubule binding, whereas slow processive KIF27
      behavior arises from a slow adenosine triphosphatase rate and a high affinity for
      both adenosine triphosphate and microtubules. We suggest that evolutionarily
      selected sequence differences enable immotile KIF7 and Cos2 motors to function
      not as transporters but as microtubule-based tethers of signaling complexes.

AB  - Many biological events, such as the propagation of nerve impulses, the
      synchronized cell cycles of early embryogenesis, and collective cell migration,
      must be coordinated with remarkable speed across very large distances. Such rapid
      coordination cannot be achieved by simple diffusion of molecules alone and
      requires specialized mechanisms. Although active transport can provide a directed
      and efficient way to travel across subcellular structures, it cannot account for 
      the most rapid examples of coordination found in biology. Rather, these appear to
      be driven by mechanisms involving traveling waves of chemical activities that are
      able to propagate information rapidly across biological or physical systems.
      Indeed, recent advances in our ability to probe the dynamics of signaling
      pathways are revealing many examples of coordination of cellular and
      developmental processes through traveling chemical waves. Here, we will review
      the theoretical principles underlying such waves; highlight recent literature on 
      their role in different contexts, ranging from chemotaxis to development; and
      discuss open questions and future perspectives on the study of chemical waves as 
      an essential feature of cell and tissue physiology.

TI  - The microRNA-200 family coordinately regulates cell adhesion and proliferation in
      hair morphogenesis.

AB  - The microRNA (miRNA)-200 (miR-200) family is highly expressed in epithelial cells
      and frequently lost in metastatic cancer. Despite intensive studies into their
      roles in cancer, their targets and functions in normal epithelial tissues remain 
      unclear. Importantly, it remains unclear how the two subfamilies of the
      five-miRNA family, distinguished by a single nucleotide within the seed region,
      regulate their targets. By directly ligating miRNAs to their targeted mRNA
      regions, we identify numerous miR-200 targets involved in the regulation of focal
      adhesion, actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and Hippo/Yap signaling. The two
      subfamilies bind to largely distinct target sites, but many genes are
      coordinately regulated by both subfamilies. Using inducible and knockout mouse
      models, we show that the miR-200 family regulates cell adhesion and orientation
      in the hair germ, contributing to precise cell fate specification and hair
      morphogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that combinatorial targeting of many
      genes is critical for miRNA function and provide new insights into miR-200's
      functions.

TI  - Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells reside in an unlicensed G1 phase.
LID - jcb.201708023 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708023 [doi]
AB  - During late mitosis and the early G1 phase, the origins of replication are
      licensed by binding to double hexamers of MCM2-7. In this study, we investigated 
      how licensing and proliferative commitment are coupled in the epithelium of the
      small intestine. We developed a method for identifying cells in intact tissue
      containing DNA-bound MCM2-7. Interphase cells above the transit-amplifying
      compartment had no DNA-bound MCM2-7, but still expressed the MCM2-7 protein,
      suggesting that licensing is inhibited immediately upon differentiation.
      Strikingly, we found most proliferative Lgr5(+) stem cells are in an unlicensed
      state. This suggests that the elongated cell-cycle of intestinal stem cells is
      caused by an increased G1 length, characterized by dormant periods with
      unlicensed origins. Significantly, the unlicensed state is lost in Apc-mutant
      epithelium, which lacks a functional restriction point, causing licensing
      immediately upon G1 entry. We propose that the unlicensed G1 phase of intestinal 
      stem cells creates a temporal window when proliferative fate decisions can be
      made.

TI  - ESCRT-III is required for scissioning new peroxisomes from the endoplasmic
      reticulum.
LID - jcb.201706044 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706044 [doi]
AB  - Dynamic control of peroxisome proliferation is integral to the peroxisome's many 
      functions. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a source of preperoxisomal
      vesicles (PPVs) that mature into peroxisomes during de novo peroxisome biogenesis
      and support growth and division of existing peroxisomes. However, the mechanism
      of PPV formation and release from the ER remains poorly understood. In this
      study, we show that endosomal sorting complexes required for transport
      (ESCRT)-III are required to release PPVs budding from the ER into the cytosol.
      Absence of ESCRT-III proteins impedes de novo peroxisome formation and results in
      an aberrant peroxisome population in vivo. Using a cell-free PPV budding assay,
      we show that ESCRT-III proteins Vps20 and Snf7 are necessary to release PPVs from
      the ER. ESCRT-III is therefore a positive effector of membrane scission for
      vesicles budding both away from and toward the cytosol. These findings have
      important implications for the evolutionary timing of emergence of peroxisomes
      and the rest of the internal membrane architecture of the eukaryotic cell.

TI  - Myosin 1b promotes axon formation by regulating actin wave propagation and growth
      cone dynamics.
LID - jcb.201703205 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703205 [doi]
AB  - Single-headed myosin 1 has been identified in neurons, but its function in these 
      cells is still unclear. We demonstrate that depletion of myosin 1b (Myo1b),
      inhibition of its motor activity, or its binding to phosphoinositides impairs the
      formation of the axon, whereas overexpression of Myo1b increases the number of
      axon-like structures. Myo1b is associated with growth cones and actin waves, two 
      major contributors to neuronal symmetry breaking. We show that Myo1b controls the
      dynamics of the growth cones and the anterograde propagation of the actin waves. 
      By coupling the membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, Myo1b regulates the size of
      the actin network as well as the stability and size of filopodia in the growth
      cones. Our data provide the first evidence that a myosin 1 plays a major role in 
      neuronal symmetry breaking and argue for a mechanical control of the actin
      cytoskeleton both in actin waves and in the growth cones by this myosin.

TI  - TRRAP is a central regulator of human multiciliated cell formation.
LID - jcb.201706106 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706106 [doi]
AB  - The multiciliated cell (MCC) is an evolutionarily conserved cell type, which in
      vertebrates functions to promote directional fluid flow across epithelial
      tissues. In the conducting airway, MCCs are generated by basal stem/progenitor
      cells and act in concert with secretory cells to perform mucociliary clearance to
      expel pathogens from the lung. Studies in multiple systems, including Xenopus
      laevis epidermis, murine trachea, and zebrafish kidney, have uncovered a
      transcriptional network that regulates multiple steps of multiciliogenesis,
      ultimately leading to an MCC with hundreds of motile cilia extended from their
      apical surface, which beat in a coordinated fashion. Here, we used a pool-based
      short hairpin RNA screening approach and identified TRRAP, an essential component
      of multiple histone acetyltransferase complexes, as a central regulator of MCC
      formation. Using a combination of immunofluorescence, signaling pathway
      modulation, and genomic approaches, we show that (a) TRRAP acts downstream of the
      Notch2-mediated basal progenitor cell fate decision and upstream of Multicilin to
      control MCC differentiation; and (b) TRRAP binds to the promoters and regulates
      the expression of a network of genes involved in MCC differentiation and
      function, including several genes associated with human ciliopathies.

AB  - Chromosome organization in higher eukaryotes controls gene expression, DNA
      replication, and DNA repair. Genome mapping has revealed the functional units of 
      chromatin at the submegabase scale as self-interacting regions called
      topologically associating domains (TADs) and showed they correspond to
      replication domains (RDs). A quantitative structural and dynamic description of
      RD behavior in the nucleus is, however, missing because visualization of dynamic 
      subdiffraction-sized RDs remains challenging. Using fluorescence labeling of RDs 
      combined with correlative live and super-resolution microscopy in situ, we
      determined biophysical parameters to characterize the internal organization,
      spacing, and mechanical coupling of RDs. We found that RDs are typically 150 nm
      in size and contain four co-replicating regions spaced 60 nm apart. Spatially
      neighboring RDs are spaced 300 nm apart and connected by highly flexible linker
      regions that couple their motion only <550 nm. Our pipeline allows a robust
      quantitative characterization of chromosome structure in situ and provides
      important biophysical parameters to understand general principles of chromatin
      organization.

AB  - Mitotic spindle disassembly after chromosome separation is as important as
      spindle assembly, yet the molecular mechanisms for spindle disassembly are
      unclear. In this study, we investigated how the chromosomal passenger complex
      (CPC), which contains the Aurora B kinase Ipl1, swiftly concentrates at the
      spindle midzone in late anaphase, and we researched the role of this dramatic
      relocalization during spindle disassembly. We showed that the kinesins Kip1 and
      Kip3 are essential for CPC relocalization. In cells lacking Kip1 and Kip3,
      spindle disassembly is severely delayed until after contraction of the
      cytokinetic ring. Purified Kip1 and Kip3 interact directly with the CPC and
      recruit it to microtubules in vitro, and single-molecule experiments showed that 
      the CPC diffuses dynamically on microtubules but that diffusion stops when the
      CPC encounters a Kip1 molecule. We propose that Kip1 and Kip3 trap the CPC at the
      spindle midzone in late anaphase to ensure timely spindle disassembly.

TI  - SAC-1 ensures epithelial endocytic recycling by restricting ARF-6 activity.
LID - jcb.201711065 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201711065 [doi]
AB  - Arf6/ARF-6 is a crucial regulator of the endosomal phosphatidylinositol
      4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) pool in endocytic recycling. To further characterize
      ARF-6 regulation, we performed an ARF-6 interactor screen in Caenorhabditis
      elegans and identified SAC-1, the homologue of the phosphoinositide phosphatase
      Sac1p in yeast, as a novel ARF-6 partner. In the absence of ARF-6, basolateral
      endosomes show a loss of SAC-1 staining in epithelial cells. Steady-state cargo
      distribution assays revealed that loss of SAC-1 specifically affected apical
      secretory delivery and basolateral recycling. PI(4,5)P2 levels and the endosomal 
      labeling of the ARF-6 effector UNC-16 were significantly elevated in sac-1
      mutants, suggesting that SAC-1 functions as a negative regulator of ARF-6.
      Further analyses revealed an interaction between SAC-1 and the ARF-6-GEF BRIS-1. 
      This interaction outcompeted ARF-6(guanosine diphosphate [GDP]) for binding to
      BRIS-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Consequently, loss of SAC-1 promotes 
      the intracellular overlap between ARF-6 and BRIS-1. BRIS-1 knockdown resulted in 
      a significant reduction in PI(4,5)P2 levels in SAC-1-depleted cells.
      Interestingly, the action of SAC-1 in sequestering BRIS-1 is independent of
      SAC-1's catalytic activity. Our results suggest that the interaction of SAC-1
      with ARF-6 curbs ARF-6 activity by limiting the access of ARF-6(GDP) to its
      guanine nucleotide exchange factor, BRIS-1.

AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) sensor STIM1 forms oligomers and
      translocates to ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions to activate store-operated
      Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) after ER Ca(2+) depletion. STIM1 also interacts with EB1 and 
      dynamically tracks microtubule (MT) plus ends. Nevertheless, the role of
      STIM1-EB1 interaction in regulating SOCE remains unresolved. Using live-cell
      imaging combined with a synthetic construct approach, we found that EB1 binding
      constitutes a trapping mechanism restricting STIM1 targeting to ER-PM junctions. 
      We further showed that STIM1 oligomers retain EB1 binding ability in ER
      Ca(2+)-depleted cells. By trapping STIM1 molecules at dynamic contacts between
      the ER and MT plus ends, EB1 binding delayed STIM1 translocation to ER-PM
      junctions during ER Ca(2+) depletion and prevented excess SOCE and ER Ca(2+)
      overload. Our study suggests that STIM1-EB1 interaction shapes the kinetics and
      amplitude of local SOCE in cellular regions with growing MTs and contributes to
      spatiotemporal regulation of Ca(2+) signaling crucial for cellular functions and 
      homeostasis.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulator 1 (Romo1) is a nuclear-encoded
      mitochondrial inner membrane protein known to regulate mitochondrial ROS
      production and to act as an essential redox sensor in mitochondrial dynamics.
      Although its physiological roles have been studied for a decade, the biophysical 
      mechanisms that explain these activities of Romo1 are unclear. In this study, we 
      report that Romo1 is a unique mitochondrial ion channel that differs from
      currently identified eukaryotic ion channels. Romo1 is a highly conserved protein
      with structural features of class II viroporins, which are virus-encoded
      nonselective cation channels. Indeed, Romo1 forms a nonselective cation channel
      with its amphipathic helical transmembrane domain necessary for pore-forming
      activity. Notably, channel activity was specifically inhibited by Fe(2+) ions, an
      essential transition metal ion in ROS metabolism. Using structural
      bioinformatics, we designed an experimental data-guided structural model of Romo1
      with a rational hexameric structure. We propose that Romo1 establishes a new
      category of viroporin-like nonselective cation channel in eukaryotes.

AB  - Translocation of full-length or fragments of receptors to the nucleus has been
      reported for several tyrosine kinase receptors. In this paper, we show that a
      fraction of full-length cell surface platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
      receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) accumulates in the nucleus at the chromatin and the
      nuclear matrix after ligand stimulation. Nuclear translocation of PDGFRbeta was
      dependent on PDGF-BB-induced receptor dimerization, clathrin-mediated
      endocytosis, beta-importin, and intact Golgi, occurring in both normal and cancer
      cells. In the nucleus, PDGFRbeta formed ligand-inducible complexes with the
      tyrosine kinase Fer and its substrate, TATA element-modifying factor 1 (TMF-1).
      PDGF-BB stimulation decreased TMF-1 binding to the transcriptional regulator
      Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg-1) and released Brg-1 from the SWI-SNF chromatin
      remodeling complex. Moreover, knockdown of TMF-1 by small interfering RNA
      decreased nuclear translocation of PDGFRbeta and caused significant up-regulation
      of the Brg-1/p53-regulated cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A (encoding p21) without
      affecting PDGFRbeta-inducible immediate-early genes. In conclusion, nuclear
      interactions of PDGFRbeta control proliferation by chromatin remodeling and
      regulation of p21 levels.

AB  - During neural circuit assembly, extrinsic signals are integrated into changes in 
      growth cone (GC) cytoskeleton underlying axon guidance decisions. Microtubules
      (MTs) were shown to play an instructive role in GC steering. However, the
      numerous actors required for MT remodeling during axon navigation and their
      precise mode of action are far from being deciphered. Using loss- and
      gain-of-function analyses during zebrafish development, we identify in this study
      the meiotic clade adenosine triphosphatase Fidgetin-like 1 (Fignl1) as a key
      GC-enriched MT-interacting protein in motor circuit wiring and larval locomotion.
      We show that Fignl1 controls GC morphology and behavior at intermediate targets
      by regulating MT plus end dynamics and growth directionality. We further reveal
      that alternative translation of Fignl1 transcript is a sophisticated mechanism
      modulating MT dynamics: a full-length isoform regulates MT plus end-tracking
      protein binding at plus ends, whereas shorter isoforms promote their
      depolymerization beneath the cell cortex. Our study thus pinpoints Fignl1 as a
      multifaceted key player in MT remodeling underlying motor circuit connectivity.

AB  - Proteasome inhibitors are used as research tools and to treat multiple myeloma,
      and proteasome activity is diminished in several neurodegenerative diseases. We
      therefore studied how cells compensate for proteasome inhibition. In 4 h,
      proteasome inhibitor treatment caused dramatic and selective induction of
      GABARAPL1 (but not other autophagy genes) and p62, which binds ubiquitinated
      proteins and GABARAPL1 on autophagosomes. Knockdown of p62 or GABARAPL1 reduced
      cell survival upon proteasome inhibition. p62 induction requires the
      transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 1 (Nrf1), which
      simultaneously induces proteasome genes. After 20-h exposure to proteasome
      inhibitors, cells activated autophagy and expression of most autophagy genes by
      an Nrf1-independent mechanism. Although p62 facilitates the association of
      ubiquitinated proteins with autophagosomes, its knockdown in neuroblastoma cells 
      blocked the buildup of ubiquitin conjugates in perinuclear aggresomes and of
      sumoylated proteins in nuclear inclusions but did not reduce the degradation of
      ubiquitinated proteins. Thus, upon proteasome inhibition, cells rapidly induce
      p62 expression, which enhances survival primarily by sequestering ubiquitinated
      proteins in inclusions.

TI  - Autophagy balances mtDNA synthesis and degradation by DNA polymerase POLG during 
      starvation.
LID - jcb.201801168 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201801168 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria contain tens to thousands of copies of their own genome
      (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]), creating genetic redundancy capable of buffering
      mutations in mitochondrial genes essential for cellular function. However, the
      mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number have been elusive. Here we found that DNA
      synthesis and degradation by mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLG) dynamically controlled
      mtDNA copy number in starving yeast cells dependent on metabolic homeostasis
      provided by autophagy. Specifically, the continuous mtDNA synthesis by POLG in
      starving wild-type cells was inhibited by nucleotide insufficiency and elevated
      mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species in the presence of autophagy
      dysfunction. Moreover, after prolonged starvation, 3'-5' exonuclease-dependent
      mtDNA degradation by POLG adjusted the initially increasing mtDNA copy number in 
      wild-type cells, but caused quantitative mtDNA instability and irreversible
      respiratory dysfunction in autophagy-deficient cells as a result of nucleotide
      limitations. In summary, our study reveals that mitochondria rely on the
      homeostatic functions of autophagy to balance synthetic and degradative modes of 
      POLG, which control copy number dynamics and stability of the mitochondrial
      genome.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709171 [doi]
AB  - Cell size control requires mechanisms that link cell growth with Cdk1 activity.
      In fission yeast, the protein kinase Cdr2 forms cortical nodes that include the
      Cdk1 inhibitor Wee1 along with the Wee1-inhibitory kinase Cdr1. We investigated
      how nodes inhibit Wee1 during cell growth. Biochemical fractionation revealed
      that Cdr2 nodes were megadalton structures enriched for activated Cdr2, which
      increases in level during interphase growth. In live-cell total internal
      reflection fluorescence microscopy videos, Cdr2 and Cdr1 remained constant at
      nodes over time, but Wee1 localized to nodes in short bursts. Recruitment of Wee1
      to nodes required Cdr2 kinase activity and the noncatalytic N terminus of Wee1.
      Bursts of Wee1 localization to nodes increased 20-fold as cells doubled in size
      throughout G2. Size-dependent signaling was caused in part by the Cdr2 inhibitor 
      Pom1, which suppressed Wee1 node bursts in small cells. Thus, increasing Cdr2
      activity during cell growth promotes Wee1 localization to nodes, where inhibitory
      phosphorylation of Wee1 by Cdr1 and Cdr2 kinases promotes mitotic entry.

      distribution.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709123 [doi]
AB  - Cholesterol, which is endocytosed to the late endosome (LE)/lysosome, is
      delivered to other organelles through vesicular and nonvesicular transport
      mechanisms. In this study, we discuss a novel mechanism of cholesterol transport 
      from recycling endosomes (REs) to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through
      RELCH/KIAA1468, which is newly identified in this study as a Rab11-GTP- and
      OSBP-binding protein. After treating cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol to induce
      OSBP relocation from the cytoplasm to the TGN, REs accumulated around the TGN
      area, but this accumulation was diminished in RELCH- or OSBP-depleted cells.
      Cholesterol content in the TGN was decreased in Rab11-, RELCH-, and OSBP-depleted
      cells and increased in the LE/lysosome. According to in vitro reconstitution
      experiments, RELCH tethers Rab11-bound RE-like and OSBP-bound TGN-like liposomes 
      and promotes OSBP-dependent cholesterol transfer from RE-like to TGN-like
      liposomes. These data suggest that RELCH promotes nonvesicular cholesterol
      transport from REs to the TGN through membrane tethering.

TI  - CLAMP/Spef1 regulates planar cell polarity signaling and asymmetric microtubule
      accumulation in the Xenopus ciliated epithelia.
LID - jcb.201706058 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706058 [doi]
AB  - Most epithelial cells polarize along the axis of the tissue, a feature known as
      planar cell polarity (PCP). The initiation of PCP requires cell-cell signaling
      via the noncanonical Wnt/PCP pathway. Additionally, changes in the cytoskeleton
      both facilitate and reflect this polarity. We have identified CLAMP/Spef1 as a
      novel regulator of PCP signaling. In addition to decorating microtubules (MTs)
      and the ciliary rootlet, a pool of CLAMP localizes at the apical cell cortex.
      Depletion of CLAMP leads to the loss of PCP protein asymmetry, defects in cilia
      polarity, and defects in the angle of cell division. Additionally, depletion of
      CLAMP leads to a loss of the atypical cadherin-like molecule Celrs2, suggesting
      that CLAMP facilitates the stabilization of junctional interactions responsible
      for proper PCP protein localization. Depletion of CLAMP also affects the
      polarized organization of MTs. We hypothesize that CLAMP facilitates the
      establishment of cell polarity and promotes the asymmetric accumulation of MTs
      downstream of the establishment of proper PCP.

TI  - Phosphorylation of IRE1 at S729 regulates RIDD in B cells and antibody production
      after immunization.
LID - jcb.201709137 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709137 [doi]
AB  - To relieve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, IRE1 splices XBP1 messenger RNA
      (mRNA) or engages regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of other mRNAs. Upon XBP1
      deficiency, IRE1 switches to perform RIDD. We examined IRE1 in XBP1-deficient B
      cells and discovered that IRE1 undergoes phosphorylation at S729. We generated an
      anti-phospho-S729 antibody to investigate such phosphorylation. Compared with
      pharmacological ER stress inducers or Toll-like receptor ligands, the bacterial
      subtilase cytotoxin has an unusual capability in causing rapid and strong
      phosphorylation at S729 and triggering B cells to express spliced XBP1. To assess
      the function of S729 in IRE1, we generated S729A knock-in mice and found S729 is 
      critically important for lipopolysaccharide-stimulated plasmablasts to respond to
      additional ER stress and for antibody production in response to immunization. We 
      further crossed mice carrying an S729A mutation or DeltaIRE1 (missing the kinase 
      domain) with B cell-specific XBP1-deficient mice to trigger RIDD and discovered a
      critical role for S729 in regulating RIDD in B cells.

TI  - Membrane protein recycling from the vacuole/lysosome membrane.
LID - jcb.201709162 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709162 [doi]
AB  - The lysosome (or vacuole in yeast) is the central organelle responsible for
      cellular degradation and nutrient storage. Lysosomes receive cargo from the
      secretory, endocytic, and autophagy pathways. Many of these proteins and lipids
      are delivered to the lysosome membrane, and some are degraded in the lysosome
      lumen, whereas others appear to be recycled through unknown pathways. In this
      study, we identify the transmembrane autophagy protein Atg27 as a physiological
      cargo recycled from the vacuole. We reveal that Atg27 is delivered to the vacuole
      membrane and then recycled using a two-step recycling process. First, Atg27 is
      recycled from the vacuole to the endosome via the Snx4 complex and then from the 
      endosome to the Golgi via the retromer complex. During the process of
      vacuole-to-endosome retrograde trafficking, Snx4 complexes assemble on the
      vacuolar surface and recognize specific residues in the cytoplasmic tail of
      Atg27. This novel pathway maintains the normal composition and function of the
      vacuole membrane.

      cell-cell adhesion.
LID - jcb.201708103 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708103 [doi]
AB  - Adherens junctions (AJs) are mechanosensitive cadherin-based intercellular
      adhesions that interact with the actin cytoskeleton and carry most of the
      mechanical load at cell-cell junctions. Both Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin
      polymerization generating pushing force and nonmuscle myosin II (NMII)-dependent 
      contraction producing pulling force are necessary for AJ morphogenesis. Which
      actin system directly interacts with AJs is unknown. Using platinum replica
      electron microscopy of endothelial cells, we show that vascular endothelial
      (VE)-cadherin colocalizes with Arp2/3 complex-positive actin networks at
      different AJ types and is positioned at the interface between two oppositely
      oriented branched networks from adjacent cells. In contrast, actin-NMII bundles
      are located more distally from the VE-cadherin-rich zone. After Arp2/3 complex
      inhibition, linear AJs split, leaving gaps between cells with detergent-insoluble
      VE-cadherin transiently associated with the gap edges. After NMII inhibition,
      VE-cadherin is lost from gap edges. We propose that the actin cytoskeleton at AJs
      acts as a dynamic push-pull system, wherein pushing forces maintain extracellular
      VE-cadherin transinteraction and pulling forces stabilize intracellular adhesion 
      complexes.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706024 [doi]
AB  - The paralogous Brr6 and Brl1 are conserved integral membrane proteins of the
      nuclear envelope (NE) with an unclear role in nuclear pore complex (NPC)
      biogenesis. Here, we analyzed double-degron mutants of Brr6/Brl1 to understand
      this function. Depletion of Brr6 and Brl1 caused defects in NPC biogenesis,
      whereas the already assembled NPCs remained unaffected. This NPC biogenesis
      defect was not accompanied by a change in lipid composition. However, Brl1
      interacted with Ndc1 and Nup188 by immunoprecipitation, and with transmembrane
      and outer and inner ring NPC components by split yellow fluorescent protein
      analysis, indicating a direct role in NPC biogenesis. Consistently, we found that
      Brr6 and Brl1 associated with a subpopulation of NPCs and emerging NPC assembly
      sites. Moreover, BRL1 overexpression affected NE morphology without a change in
      lipid composition and completely suppressed the nuclear pore biogenesis defect of
      nup116Delta and gle2Delta cells. We propose that Brr6 and Brl1 transiently
      associate with NPC assembly sites where they promote NPC biogenesis.

TI  - Mechanism of Stx17 recruitment to autophagosomes via IRGM and mammalian Atg8
      proteins.
PG  - 997-1013
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708039 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic process with metabolic, immune, and general
      homeostatic functions in mammalian cells. Mammalian autophagosomes fuse with
      lysosomes in a SNARE-driven process that includes syntaxin 17 (Stx17). How Stx17 
      translocates to autophagosomes is unknown. In this study, we show that the
      mechanism of Stx17 recruitment to autophagosomes in human cells entails the small
      guanosine triphosphatase IRGM. Stx17 directly interacts with IRGM, and efficient 
      Stx17 recruitment to autophagosomes requires IRGM. Both IRGM and Stx17 directly
      interact with mammalian Atg8 proteins, thus being guided to autophagosomes. We
      also show that Stx17 is significant in defense against infectious agents and that
      Stx17-IRGM interaction is targeted by an HIV virulence factor Nef.

TI  - An ancient Sec10-formin fusion provides insights into actin-mediated regulation
      of exocytosis.
PG  - 945-957
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705084 [doi]
AB  - Exocytosis, facilitated by the exocyst, is fundamentally important for remodeling
      cell walls and membranes. Here, we analyzed For1F, a novel gene that encodes a
      fusion of an exocyst subunit (Sec10) and an actin nucleation factor (formin). We 
      showed that the fusion occurred early in moss evolution and has been retained for
      more than 170 million years. In Physcomitrella patens, For1F is essential, and
      the expressed protein is a fusion of Sec10 and formin. Reduction of For1F or
      actin filaments inhibits exocytosis, and For1F dynamically associates with Sec6, 
      another exocyst subunit, in an actin-dependent manner. Complementation
      experiments demonstrate that constitutive expression of either half of the gene
      or the paralogous Sec10b rescues loss of For1F, suggesting that fusion of the two
      domains is not essential, consistent with findings in yeast, where formin and the
      exocyst are linked noncovalently. Although not essential, the fusion may have had
      selective advantages and provides a unique opportunity to probe actin regulation 
      of exocytosis.

TI  - Rab18 promotes lipid droplet (LD) growth by tethering the ER to LDs through SNARE
      and NRZ interactions.
PG  - 975-995
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704184 [doi]
AB  - Lipid incorporation from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to lipid droplet (LD) is
      important in controlling LD growth and intracellular lipid homeostasis. However, 
      the molecular link mediating ER and LD cross talk remains elusive. Here, we
      identified Rab18 as an important Rab guanosine triphosphatase in controlling LD
      growth and maturation. Rab18 deficiency resulted in a drastically reduced number 
      of mature LDs and decreased lipid storage, and was accompanied by increased ER
      stress. Rab3GAP1/2, the GEF of Rab18, promoted LD growth by activating and
      targeting Rab18 to LDs. LD-associated Rab18 bound specifically to the
      ER-associated NAG-RINT1-ZW10 (NRZ) tethering complex and their associated SNAREs 
      (Syntaxin18, Use1, BNIP1), resulting in the recruitment of ER to LD and the
      formation of direct ER-LD contact. Cells with defects in the NRZ/SNARE complex
      function showed reduced LD growth and lipid storage. Overall, our data reveal
      that the Rab18-NRZ-SNARE complex is critical protein machinery for tethering
      ER-LD and establishing ER-LD contact to promote LD growth.

TI  - The ESCRT protein Chmp4c regulates mitotic spindle checkpoint signaling.
PG  - 861-876
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709005 [doi]
AB  - The mitotic spindle checkpoint delays anaphase onset in the presence of
      unattached kinetochores, and efficient checkpoint signaling requires kinetochore 
      localization of the Rod-ZW10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex. In the present study, we show 
      that human Chmp4c, a protein involved in membrane remodeling, localizes to
      kinetochores in prometaphase but is reduced in chromosomes aligned at the
      metaphase plate. Chmp4c promotes stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments and
      is required for proper mitotic progression, faithful chromosome alignment, and
      segregation. Depletion of Chmp4c diminishes localization of RZZ and Mad1-Mad2
      checkpoint proteins to prometaphase kinetochores and impairs mitotic arrest when 
      microtubules are depolymerized by nocodazole. Furthermore, Chmp4c binds to ZW10
      through a small C-terminal region, and constitutive Chmp4c kinetochore targeting 
      causes a ZW10-dependent checkpoint metaphase arrest. In addition, Chmp4c spindle 
      functions do not require endosomal sorting complex required for
      transport-dependent membrane remodeling. These results show that Chmp4c regulates
      the mitotic spindle checkpoint by promoting localization of the RZZ complex to
      unattached kinetochores.

      ubiquitination of RhoB.
PG  - 1015-1032
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606055 [doi]
AB  - RhoGTPases control endothelial cell (EC) migration, adhesion, and barrier
      formation. Whereas the relevance of RhoA for endothelial barrier function is
      widely accepted, the role of the RhoA homologue RhoB is poorly defined. RhoB and 
      RhoA are 85% identical, but RhoB's subcellular localization and half-life are
      uniquely different. Here, we studied the role of ubiquitination for the function 
      and stability of RhoB in primary human ECs. We show that the K63
      polyubiquitination at lysine 162 and 181 of RhoB targets the protein to
      lysosomes. Moreover, we identified the RING E3 ligase complex
      Cullin-3-Rbx1-KCTD10 as key modulator of endothelial barrier integrity via its
      regulation of the ubiquitination, localization, and activity of RhoB. In
      conclusion, our data show that ubiquitination controls the subcellular
      localization and lysosomal degradation of RhoB and thereby regulates the
      stability of the endothelial barrier through control of RhoB-mediated EC
      contraction.

      morphogenesis.
PG  - 1079-1095
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610098 [doi]
AB  - In epithelia, cells adhere to each other in a dynamic fashion, allowing the cells
      to change their shape and move along each other during morphogenesis. The
      regulation of adhesion occurs at the belt-shaped adherens junction, the zonula
      adherens (ZA). Formation of the ZA depends on components of the Par-atypical PKC 
      (Par-aPKC) complex of polarity regulators. We have identified the Lin11, Isl-1,
      Mec-3 (LIM) protein Smallish (Smash), the orthologue of vertebrate LMO7, as a
      binding partner of Bazooka/Par-3 (Baz), a core component of the Par-aPKC complex.
      Smash also binds to Canoe/Afadin and the tyrosine kinase Src42A and localizes to 
      the ZA in a planar polarized fashion. Animals lacking Smash show loss of planar
      cell polarity (PCP) in the embryonic epidermis and reduced cell bond tension,
      leading to severe defects during embryonic morphogenesis of epithelial tissues
      and organs. Overexpression of Smash causes apical constriction of epithelial
      cells. We propose that Smash is a key regulator of morphogenesis coordinating PCP
      and actomyosin contractility at the ZA.

PG  - 1113-1128
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709064 [doi]
AB  - Neurite elongation and branching in developing neurons requires plasmalemma
      expansion, hypothesized to occur primarily via exocytosis. We posited that
      exocytosis in developing neurons and nonneuronal cells would exhibit distinct
      spatiotemporal organization. We exploited total internal reflection fluorescence 
      microscopy to image vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-pHluorin-mediated 
      exocytosis in mouse embryonic cortical neurons and interphase melanoma cells, and
      developed computer-vision software and statistical tools to uncover
      spatiotemporal aspects of exocytosis. Vesicle fusion behavior differed between
      vesicle types, cell types, developmental stages, and extracellular environments. 
      Experiment-based mathematical calculations indicated that VAMP2-mediated vesicle 
      fusion supplied excess material for the plasma membrane expansion that occurred
      early in neuronal morphogenesis, which was balanced by clathrin-mediated
      endocytosis. Spatial statistics uncovered distinct spatiotemporal regulation of
      exocytosis in the soma and neurites of developing neurons that was modulated by
      developmental stage, exposure to the guidance cue netrin-1, and the
      brain-enriched ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif 9. In melanoma cells, exocytosis
      occurred less frequently, with distinct spatial clustering patterns.

      polarity, and mechanotransduction.
PG  - 895-914
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706097 [doi]
AB  - The nucleus has long been postulated to play a critical physical role during cell
      polarization and migration, but that role has not been defined or rigorously
      tested. Here, we enucleated cells to test the physical necessity of the nucleus
      during cell polarization and directed migration. Using enucleated mammalian cells
      (cytoplasts), we found that polarity establishment and cell migration in one
      dimension (1D) and two dimensions (2D) occur without the nucleus. Cytoplasts
      directionally migrate toward soluble (chemotaxis) and surface-bound (haptotaxis) 
      extracellular cues and migrate collectively in scratch-wound assays. Consistent
      with previous studies, migration in 3D environments was dependent on the nucleus.
      In part, this likely reflects the decreased force exerted by cytoplasts on
      mechanically compliant substrates. This response is mimicked both in cells with
      nucleocytoskeletal defects and upon inhibition of actomyosin-based contractility.
      Together, our observations reveal that the nucleus is dispensable for
      polarization and migration in 1D and 2D but critical for proper cell mechanical
      responses.

AB  - Exosomes are small endosome-derived extracellular vesicles implicated in
      cell-cell communication and are secreted by living cells when multivesicular
      bodies (MVBs) fuse with the plasma membrane (PM). Current techniques to study
      exosome physiology are based on isolation procedures after secretion, precluding 
      direct and dynamic insight into the mechanics of exosome biogenesis and the
      regulation of their release. In this study, we propose real-time visualization of
      MVB-PM fusion to overcome these limitations. We designed tetraspanin-based
      pH-sensitive optical reporters that detect MVB-PM fusion using live total
      internal reflection fluorescence and dynamic correlative light-electron
      microscopy. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that MVB-PM fusion frequency is
      reduced by depleting the target membrane SNAREs SNAP23 and syntaxin-4 but also
      can be induced in single cells by stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor
      (H1HR). Interestingly, activation of H1R1 in HeLa cells increases Ser110
      phosphorylation of SNAP23, promoting MVB-PM fusion and the release of
      CD63-enriched exosomes. Using this single-cell resolution approach, we highlight 
      the modulatory dynamics of MVB exocytosis that will help to increase our
      understanding of exosome physiology and identify druggable targets in
      exosome-associated pathologies.

      microtubule arrays.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708130 [doi]
AB  - The cortical microtubule arrays of higher plants are organized without
      centrosomes and feature treadmilling polymers that are dynamic at both ends. The 
      control of polymer end stability is fundamental for the assembly and organization
      of cytoskeletal arrays, yet relatively little is understood about how microtubule
      minus ends are controlled in acentrosomal microtubule arrays, and no factors have
      been identified that act at the treadmilling minus ends in higher plants. Here,
      we identify Arabidopsis thaliana SPIRAL2 (SPR2) as a protein that tracks minus
      ends and protects them against subunit loss. SPR2 function is required to
      facilitate the rapid reorientation of plant cortical arrays as stimulated by
      light perception, a process that is driven by microtubule severing to create a
      new population of microtubules. Quantitative live-cell imaging and computer
      simulations reveal that minus protection by SPR2 acts by an unexpected mechanism 
      to promote the lifetime of potential SPR2 severing sites, increasing the
      likelihood of severing and thus the rapid amplification of the new microtubule
      array.

      junctional tension.
PG  - 1033-1045
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705104 [doi]
AB  - Growth of epithelial tissues is regulated by a plethora of components, including 
      signaling and scaffolding proteins, but also by junctional tension, mediated by
      the actomyosin cytoskeleton. However, how these players are spatially organized
      and functionally coordinated is not well understood. Here, we identify the
      Drosophila melanogaster scaffolding protein Big bang as a novel regulator of
      growth in epithelial cells of the wing disc by ensuring proper junctional
      tension. Loss of big bang results in the reduction of the regulatory light chain 
      of nonmuscle myosin, Spaghetti squash. This is associated with an increased
      apical cell surface, decreased junctional tension, and smaller wings. Strikingly,
      these phenotypic traits of big bang mutant discs can be rescued by expressing
      constitutively active Spaghetti squash. Big bang colocalizes with Spaghetti
      squash in the apical cytocortex and is found in the same protein complex. These
      results suggest that in epithelial cells of developing wings, the scaffolding
      protein Big bang controls apical cytocortex organization, which is important for 
      regulating cell shape and tissue growth.

AB  - During development, cell numbers are tightly regulated, ensuring that tissues and
      organs reach their correct size and shape. Recent evidence has highlighted the
      intricate connections between the cytoskeleton and the regulation of the key
      growth control Hippo pathway. Looking for apical scaffolds regulating tissue
      growth, we describe that Drosophila melanogaster big bang (Bbg), a poorly
      characterized multi-PDZ scaffold, controls epithelial tissue growth without
      affecting epithelial polarity and architecture. bbg-mutant tissues are smaller,
      with fewer cells that are less apically constricted than normal. We show that Bbg
      binds to and colocalizes tightly with the beta-heavy-Spectrin/Kst subunit at the 
      apical cortex and promotes Yki activity, F-actin enrichment, and the
      phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain Spaghetti squash. We
      propose a model in which the spectrin cytoskeleton recruits Bbg to the cortex,
      where Bbg promotes actomyosin contractility to regulate epithelial tissue growth.

PG  - 849-859
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708072 [doi]
AB  - Anaphase in epithelia typically does not ensue until after spindles have achieved
      a characteristic position and orientation, but how or even if cells link spindle 
      position to anaphase onset is unknown. Here, we show that myosin-10 (Myo10), a
      motor protein involved in epithelial spindle dynamics, binds to Wee1, a conserved
      regulator of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Wee1 inhibition accelerates
      progression through metaphase and disrupts normal spindle dynamics, whereas
      perturbing Myo10 function delays anaphase onset in a Wee1-dependent manner.
      Moreover, Myo10 perturbation increases Wee1-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation
      on Cdk1, which, unexpectedly, concentrates at cell-cell junctions. Based on these
      and other results, we propose a model in which the Myo10-Wee1 interaction
      coordinates attainment of spindle position and orientation with anaphase onset.

AB  - The role of formins in microtubules is not well understood. In this study, we
      have investigated the mechanism by which INF2, a formin mutated in degenerative
      renal and neurological hereditary disorders, controls microtubule acetylation. We
      found that silencing of INF2 in epithelial RPE-1 cells produced a dramatic drop
      in tubulin acetylation, increased the G-actin/F-actin ratio, and impaired
      myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)/serum response factor
      (SRF)-dependent transcription, which is known to be repressed by increased levels
      of G-actin. The effect on tubulin acetylation was caused by the almost complete
      absence of alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (alpha-TAT1) messenger RNA (mRNA).
      Activation of the MRTF-SRF transcriptional complex restored alpha-TAT1 mRNA
      levels and tubulin acetylation. Several functional MRTF-SRF-responsive elements
      were consistently identified in the alpha-TAT1 gene. The effect of INF2 silencing
      on microtubule acetylation was also observed in epithelial ECV304 cells, but not 
      in Jurkat T cells. Therefore, the actin-MRTF-SRF circuit controls alpha-TAT1
      transcription. INF2 regulates the circuit, and hence microtubule acetylation, in 
      cell types where it has a prominent role in actin polymerization.

      cortex during cytokinesis.
PG  - 837-848
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706021 [doi]
AB  - During cytokinesis, a signal from the central spindle that forms between the
      separating anaphase chromosomes promotes the accumulation of contractile ring
      components at the cell equator, while a signal from the centrosomal microtubule
      asters inhibits accumulation of contractile ring components at the cell poles.
      However, the molecular identity of the inhibitory signal has remained unknown. To
      identify molecular components of the aster-based inhibitory signal, we developed 
      a means to monitor the removal of contractile ring proteins from the polar cortex
      after anaphase onset. Using this assay, we show that polar clearing is an active 
      process that requires activation of Aurora A kinase by TPXL-1. TPXL-1
      concentrates on astral microtubules coincident with polar clearing in anaphase,
      and its ability to recruit Aurora A and activate its kinase activity are
      essential for clearing. In summary, our data identify Aurora A kinase as an
      aster-based inhibitory signal that restricts contractile ring components to the
      cell equator during cytokinesis.

PG  - 1063-1077
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706013 [doi]
AB  - In epithelia, E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail is under cytoskeleton-generated tension
      via a link that contains beta-catenin. A cotranscription factor, beta-catenin, is
      also active in morphogenetic processes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
      transition. beta-Catenin signaling appears mechanically inducible and was
      proposed to follow phosphorylation-induced beta-catenin release from E-cadherin. 
      Evidence for this mechanism is lacking, and whether E-cadherin tension is
      involved is unknown. To test this, we combined quantitative fluorescence
      microscopies with genetic and pharmacological perturbations of
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-induced cells in culture. We showed that
      beta-catenin nuclear activity follows a substantial release from the membrane
      specific to migrating cells and requires multicellular deconfinement and Src
      activity. Selective nuclear translocation occurs downstream of focal adhesion
      kinase activation, which targets E-cadherin tension relaxation through actomyosin
      remodeling. In contrast, phosphorylations of the cadherin/catenin complex are not
      substantially required. These data demonstrate that E-cadherin acts as a sensor
      of intracellular mechanics in a crosstalk with cell-substrate adhesions that
      target beta-catenin signaling.

AB  - Mechanisms that sense and regulate epithelial morphogenesis, integrity, and
      homeostasis are incompletely understood. Protease-activated receptor 2 (Par2),
      the Par2-activating membrane-tethered protease matriptase, and its inhibitor,
      hepatocyte activator inhibitor 1 (Hai1), are coexpressed in most epithelia and
      may make up a local signaling system that regulates epithelial behavior. We
      explored the role of Par2b in matriptase-dependent skin abnormalities in
      Hai1a-deficient zebrafish embryos. We show an unexpected role for Par2b in
      regulation of epithelial apical cell extrusion, roles in regulating proliferation
      that were opposite in distinct but adjacent epithelial monolayers, and roles in
      regulating cell-cell junctions, mobility, survival, and expression of genes
      involved in tissue remodeling and inflammation. The epidermal growth factor
      receptor Erbb2 and matrix metalloproteinases, the latter induced by Par2b, may
      contribute to some matriptase- and Par2b-dependent phenotypes and be permissive
      for others. Our results suggest that local protease-activated receptor signaling 
      can coordinate cell behaviors known to contribute to epithelial morphogenesis and
      homeostasis.

PG  - 823-835
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704093 [doi]
AB  - The centriole is a multifunctional structure that organizes centrosomes and cilia
      and is important for cell signaling, cell cycle progression, polarity, and
      motility. Defects in centriole number and structure are associated with human
      diseases including cancer and ciliopathies. Discovery of the centriole dates back
      to the 19th century. However, recent advances in genetic and biochemical tools,
      development of high-resolution microscopy, and identification of centriole
      components have accelerated our understanding of its assembly, function,
      evolution, and its role in human disease. The centriole is an evolutionarily
      conserved structure built from highly conserved proteins and is present in all
      branches of the eukaryotic tree of life. However, centriole number, size, and
      organization varies among different organisms and even cell types within a single
      organism, reflecting its cell type-specialized functions. In this review, we
      provide an overview of our current understanding of centriole biogenesis and how 
      variations around the same theme generate alternatives for centriole formation
      and function.

PG  - 959-974
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704119 [doi]
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial encounter structure (ERMES)
      physically links the membranes of the ER and mitochondria in yeast. Although the 
      ER and mitochondria cooperate to synthesize glycerophospholipids, whether ERMES
      directly facilitates the lipid exchange between the two organelles remains
      controversial. Here, we compared the x-ray structures of an ERMES subunit Mdm12
      from Kluyveromyces lactis with that of Mdm12 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
      found that both Mdm12 proteins possess a hydrophobic pocket for phospholipid
      binding. However in vitro lipid transfer assays showed that Mdm12 alone or an
      Mmm1 (another ERMES subunit) fusion protein exhibited only a weak lipid transfer 
      activity between liposomes. In contrast, Mdm12 in a complex with Mmm1 mediated
      efficient lipid transfer between liposomes. Mutations in Mmm1 or Mdm12 impaired
      the lipid transfer activities of the Mdm12-Mmm1 complex and furthermore caused
      defective phosphatidylserine transport from the ER to mitochondrial membranes via
      ERMES in vitro. Therefore, the Mmm1-Mdm12 complex functions as a minimal unit

AB  - Polyclonal anti-immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) secondary antibodies are essential
      tools for many molecular biology techniques and diagnostic tests. Their
      animal-based production is, however, a major ethical problem. Here, we introduce 
      a sustainable alternative, namely nanobodies against all mouse IgG subclasses and
      rabbit IgG. They can be produced at large scale in Escherichia coli and could
      thus make secondary antibody production in animals obsolete. Their recombinant
      nature allows fusion with affinity tags or reporter enzymes as well as efficient 
      maleimide chemistry for fluorophore coupling. We demonstrate their superior
      performance in Western blotting, in both peroxidase- and fluorophore-linked form.
      Their site-specific labeling with multiple fluorophores creates bright imaging
      reagents for confocal and superresolution microscopy with much smaller label
      displacement than traditional secondary antibodies. They also enable simpler and 
      faster immunostaining protocols, and allow multitarget localization with primary 
      IgGs from the same species and of the same class.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706157 [doi]
AB  - The identification of conserved autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) that mediate
      bulk degradation of cytosolic material laid the foundation for breakthroughs
      linking autophagy to a litany of physiological processes and disease conditions. 
      Recent discoveries are revealing that these same ATGs orchestrate processes that 
      are related to, and yet clearly distinct from, classic autophagy.
      Autophagy-related functions include secretion, trafficking of phagocytosed
      material, replication and egress of viral particles, and regulation of
      inflammatory and immune signaling cascades. Here, we define common processes
      dependent on ATGs, and discuss the challenges in mechanistically separating
      autophagy from these related pathways. Elucidating the molecular events that
      distinguish how individual ATGs function promises to improve our understanding of
      the origin of diseases ranging from autoimmunity to cancer.

AB  - Blood flow shapes vascular networks by orchestrating endothelial cell behavior
      and function. How endothelial cells read and interpret flow-derived signals is
      poorly understood. Here, we show that endothelial cells in the developing mouse
      retina form and use luminal primary cilia to stabilize vessel connections
      selectively in parts of the remodeling vascular plexus experiencing low and
      intermediate shear stress. Inducible genetic deletion of the essential cilia
      component intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) in endothelial cells caused
      premature and random vessel regression without affecting proliferation, cell
      cycle progression, or apoptosis. IFT88 mutant cells lacking primary cilia
      displayed reduced polarization against blood flow, selectively at low and
      intermediate flow levels, and have a stronger migratory behavior. Molecularly, we
      identify that primary cilia endow endothelial cells with strongly enhanced
      sensitivity to bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9), selectively under low flow. We 
      propose that BMP9 signaling cooperates with the primary cilia at low flow to keep
      immature vessels open before high shear stress-mediated remodeling.

AB  - The Parkinson's disease factors PINK1 and parkin are strongly implicated in
      stress-induced mitophagy in vitro, but little is known about their impact on
      basal mitophagy in vivo. We generated transgenic Drosophila melanogaster
      expressing fluorescent mitophagy reporters to evaluate the impact of Pink1/parkin
      mutations on basal mitophagy under physiological conditions. We find that
      mitophagy is readily detectable and abundant in many tissues, including
      Parkinson's disease-relevant dopaminergic neurons. However, we did not detect
      mitolysosomes in flight muscle. Surprisingly, in Pink1 or parkin null flies, we
      did not observe any substantial impact on basal mitophagy. Because these flies
      exhibit locomotor defects and dopaminergic neuron loss, our findings raise
      questions about current assumptions of the pathogenic mechanism associated with
      the PINK1/parkin pathway. Our findings provide evidence that Pink1 and parkin are
      not essential for bulk basal mitophagy in Drosophila They also emphasize that
      mechanisms underpinning basal mitophagy remain largely obscure.

LID - jcb.201711006 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201711006 [doi]
AB  - Secretion of adhesive glycoproteins to the lumen of Drosophila melanogaster
      larval salivary glands is performed by contraction of an actomyosin network
      assembled around large secretory vesicles, after their fusion to the apical
      membranes. We have identified a cycle of actin coat nucleation and disassembly
      that is independent of myosin. Recruitment of active Rho1 to the fused vesicle
      triggers activation of the formin Diaphanous and actin nucleation. This leads to 
      actin-dependent localization of a RhoGAP protein that locally shuts off Rho1,
      promoting disassembly of the actin coat. When contraction of vesicles is blocked,
      the strict temporal order of the recruited elements generates repeated
      oscillations of actin coat formation and disassembly. Interestingly, different
      blocks to actin coat disassembly arrested vesicle contraction, indicating that
      actin turnover is an integral part of the actomyosin contraction cycle. The
      capacity of F-actin to trigger a negative feedback on its own production may be
      widely used to coordinate a succession of morphogenetic events or maintain
      homeostasis.

TI  - LITE microscopy: Tilted light-sheet excitation of model organisms offers high
      resolution and low photobleaching.

AB  - Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach for studying subcellular dynamics 
      at high spatiotemporal resolution; however, conventional fluorescence microscopy 
      techniques are light-intensive and introduce unnecessary photodamage. Light-sheet
      fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) mitigates these problems by selectively
      illuminating the focal plane of the detection objective by using orthogonal
      excitation. Orthogonal excitation requires geometries that physically limit the
      detection objective numerical aperture (NA), thereby limiting both
      light-gathering efficiency (brightness) and native spatial resolution. We present
      a novel live-cell LSFM method, lateral interference tilted excitation (LITE), in 
      which a tilted light sheet illuminates the detection objective focal plane
      without a sterically limiting illumination scheme. LITE is thus compatible with
      any detection objective, including oil immersion, without an upper NA limit. LITE
      combines the low photodamage of LSFM with high resolution, high brightness, and
      coverslip-based objectives. We demonstrate the utility of LITE for imaging
      animal, fungal, and plant model organisms over many hours at high spatiotemporal 
      resolution.

      transition zone.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709041 [doi]
AB  - A diffusion barrier at the transition zone enables the compartmentalization of
      signaling molecules by cilia. The BBSome and the small guanosine triphosphatase
      Arl6, which triggers BBSome coat polymerization, are required for the exit of
      activated signaling receptors from cilia, but how diffusion barriers are crossed 
      when membrane proteins exit cilia remains to be determined. In this study, we
      found that activation of the ciliary G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
      Smoothened and SSTR3 drove the Arl6-dependent assembly of large, highly
      processive, and cargo-laden retrograde BBSome trains. Single-molecule imaging
      revealed that the assembly of BBSome trains enables the lateral transport of
      ciliary GPCRs across the transition zone. However, the removal of activated GPCRs
      from cilia was inefficient because a second periciliary diffusion barrier was
      infrequently crossed. We conclude that exit from cilia is a two-step process in
      which BBSome/Arl6 trains first move activated GPCRs through the transition zone
      before a periciliary barrier can be crossed.

AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is a critically important
      regulatory lipid of the plasma membrane (PM); however, little is known about how 
      cells regulate PM PI(4,5)P2 levels. Here, we show that the phosphatidylinositol
      4-phosphate (PI4P)/phosphatidylserine (PS) transfer activity of the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER)-resident ORP5 and ORP8 is regulated by both PM PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 
      Dynamic control of ORP5/8 recruitment to the PM occurs through interactions with 
      the N-terminal Pleckstrin homology domains and adjacent basic residues of ORP5/8 
      with both PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. Although ORP5 activity requires normal levels of
      these inositides, ORP8 is called on only when PI(4,5)P2 levels are increased.
      Regulation of the ORP5/8 attachment to the PM by both phosphoinositides provides 
      a powerful means to determine the relative flux of PI4P toward the ER for PS
      transport and Sac1-mediated dephosphorylation and PIP 5-kinase-mediated
      conversion to PI(4,5)P2 Using this rheostat, cells can maintain PI(4,5)P2 levels 
      by adjusting the availability of PI4P in the PM.

LID - jcb.201701039 [pii]

AB  - Cancer has been characterized as a genetic disease, associated with mutations
      that cause pathological alterations of the cell cycle, adhesion, or invasive
      motility. Recently, the importance of the anomalous mechanical properties of
      tumor tissues, which activate tumorigenic biochemical pathways, has become
      apparent. This mechanical induction in tumors appears to consist of the
      destabilization of adult tissue homeostasis as a result of the reactivation of
      embryonic developmental mechanosensitive pathways in response to pathological
      mechanical strains. These strains occur in many forms, for example,
      hypervascularization in late tumors leads to high static hydrodynamic pressure
      that can promote malignant progression through hypoxia or anomalous interstitial 
      liquid and blood flow. The high stiffness of tumors directly induces the
      mechanical activation of biochemical pathways enhancing the cell cycle,
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cell motility. Furthermore, increases in
      solid-stress pressure associated with cell hyperproliferation activate
      tumorigenic pathways in the healthy epithelial cells compressed by the
      neighboring tumor. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the translation of a
      mechanical signal into a tumor inducing biochemical signal are based on
      mechanically induced protein conformational changes that activate classical
      tumorigenic signaling pathways. Understanding these mechanisms will be important 
      for the development of innovative treatments to target such mechanical anomalies 
      in cancer.

AB  - Insulin receptor (IR) signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of
      metabolism and growth in multicellular organisms. IRs are unique among receptor
      tyrosine kinases in that they exist exclusively as covalent (alphabeta)2
      homodimers at the cell surface. Transmembrane signaling by the IR can therefore
      not be based on ligand-induced dimerization as such but must involve structural
      changes within the existing receptor dimer. In this study, using glycosylated
      full-length human IR reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs, we show by
      single-particle electron microscopy that insulin binding to the dimeric receptor 
      converts its ectodomain from an inverted U-shaped conformation to a T-shaped
      conformation. This structural rearrangement of the ectodomain propagates to the
      transmembrane domains, which are well separated in the inactive conformation but 
      come close together upon insulin binding, facilitating autophosphorylation of the
      cytoplasmic kinase domains.

AB  - Ben Barres, professor of neurobiology at Stanford University and member of the
      JCB editorial board for over 15 years, passed away on December 27, 2017, after a 
      lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer. Ben left an indelible mark on the
      scientific community as a scientist, an advocate for equality, and an
      unbelievably supportive mentor. As a scientist his creative approaches led him to
      remarkable discoveries about the importance of glial cells in the brain, and his 
      passion elevated these cells from the "other cells in the brain" to a significant
      place in the consciousness of neurobiology. As an advocate, he fought for equal
      treatment irrespective of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or
      ethnicity, and was an inspiring supporter of junior scientists. As a mentor, he
      provided a creative and vibrant atmosphere for his trainees to pursue research
      and the never-ending support for them to flourish as independent scientists. As
      his former trainees, we would like to give our thoughts on Ben, and the deep
      impressions that he left on everyone he interacted with.

TI  - The polarity protein Angiomotin p130 controls dendritic spine maturation.
PG  - 715-730
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705184 [doi]
AB  - The actin cytoskeleton is essential for the structural changes in dendritic
      spines that lead to the formation of new synapses. Although the molecular
      mechanisms underlying spine formation are well characterized, the events that
      drive spine maturation during development are largely unknown. In this study, we 
      demonstrate that Angiomotin (AMOT-130) is necessary for spine stabilization.
      AMOT-130 is enriched in mature dendritic spines and functions to stabilize the
      actin cytoskeleton by coupling F-actin to postsynaptic protein scaffolds. These
      functions of AMOT are transiently restricted during postnatal development by
      phosphorylation imposed by the kinase Lats1. Our study proposes that AMOT-130 is 
      essential for normal spine morphogenesis and identifies Lats1 as an upstream
      regulator in this process. Moreover, our findings may link AMOT-130 loss and the 
      related spine defects to neurological disorders.

PG  - 495-505
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708068 [doi]
AB  - Proper inheritance of functional organelles is vital to cell survival. In the
      budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
      surveillance (ERSU) pathway ensures that daughter cells inherit a functional ER. 
      Here, we show that the ERSU pathway is activated by phytosphingosine (PHS), an
      early biosynthetic sphingolipid. Multiple lines of evidence support this: (1)
      Reducing PHS levels with myriocin diminishes the ability of cells to induce ERSU 
      phenotypes. (2) Aureobasidin A treatment, which blocks conversion of early
      intermediates to downstream complex sphingolipids, induces ERSU. (3)
      orm1Deltaorm2Delta cells, which up-regulate PHS, show an ERSU response even in
      the absence of ER stress. (4) Lipid analyses confirm that PHS levels are indeed
      elevated in ER-stressed cells. (5) Lastly, the addition of exogenous PHS is
      sufficient to induce all ERSU phenotypes. We propose that ER stress elevates PHS,
      which in turn activates the ERSU pathway to ensure future daughter-cell
      viability.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201707082 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian cells replicate their chromosomes via a temporal replication program.
      The ASAR6 and ASAR15 genes were identified as loci that when disrupted result in 
      delayed replication and condensation of entire human chromosomes. ASAR6 and
      ASAR15 are monoallelically expressed long noncoding RNAs that remain associated
      with the chromosome from which they are transcribed. The chromosome-wide effects 
      of ASAR6 map to the antisense strand of an L1 retrotransposon within ASAR6 RNA,
      deletion or inversion of which delayed replication of human chromosome 6.
      Furthermore, ectopic integration of ASAR6 or ASAR15 transgenes into mouse
      chromosomes resulted in delayed replication and condensation, an increase in
      H3K27me3, coating of the mouse chromosome with ASAR RNA, and a loss of mouse
      Cot-1 RNA expression in cis. Targeting the antisense strand of the L1 within
      ectopically expressed ASAR6 RNA restored normal replication timing. Our results
      provide direct evidence that L1 antisense RNA plays a functional role in
      chromosome-wide replication timing of mammalian chromosomes.

AB  - Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill target cells by the regulated release of
      cytotoxic substances from granules at the immunological synapse. To kill multiple
      target cells, CTLs use endocytosis of membrane components of cytotoxic granules. 
      We studied the potential calcium dependence of endocytosis in mouse CTLs on
      Flower, which mediates the calcium dependence of synaptic vesicle endocytosis in 
      Drosophila melanogaster Flower is predominantly localized on intracellular
      vesicles that move to the synapse on target cell contact. Endocytosis is entirely
      blocked at an early stage in Flower-deficient CTLs and is rescued to wild-type
      level by reintroducing Flower or by raising extracellular calcium. A Flower
      mutant lacking binding sites for the endocytic adaptor AP-2 proteins fails to
      rescue endocytosis, indicating that Flower interacts with proteins of the
      endocytic machinery to mediate granule endocytosis. Thus, our data identify
      Flower as a key protein mediating granule endocytosis.

TI  - PARP1-dependent eviction of the linker histone H1 mediates immediate early gene
      expression during neuronal activation.
PG  - 473-481
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703141 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal stimulation leads to immediate early gene (IEG) expression through
      calcium-dependent mechanisms. In recent years, considerable attention has been
      devoted to the transcriptional responses after neuronal stimulation, but
      relatively little is known about the changes in chromatin dynamics that follow
      neuronal activation. Here, we use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,
      biochemical fractionations, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that
      KCl-induced depolarization in primary cultured cortical neurons causes a rapid
      release of the linker histone H1 from chromatin, concomitant with IEG expression.
      H1 release is repressed by PARP inhibition, PARP1 deletion, a non-PARylatable H1,
      as well as phosphorylation inhibitions and a nonphosphorylatable H1, leading to
      hindered IEG expression. Further, H1 is replaced by PARP1 on IEG promoters after 
      neuronal stimulation, and PARP inhibition blocks this reciprocal binding
      response. Our results demonstrate the relationship between neuronal excitation
      and chromatin plasticity by identifying the roles of polyadenosine diphosphate
      ribosylation and phosphorylation of H1 in regulating H1 chromatin eviction and
      IEG expression in stimulated neurons.

TI  - The two TRAPP complexes of metazoans have distinct roles and act on different Rab
      GTPases.
PG  - 601-617
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705068 [doi]
AB  - Originally identified in yeast, transport protein particle (TRAPP) complexes are 
      Rab GTPase exchange factors that share a core set of subunits. TRAPPs were
      initially found to act on Ypt1, the yeast orthologue of Rab1, but recent studies 
      have found that yeast TRAPPII can also activate the Rab11 orthologues Ypt31/32.
      Mammals have two TRAPP complexes, but their role is less clear, and they contain 
      subunits that are not found in the yeast complexes but are essential for cell
      growth. To investigate TRAPP function in metazoans, we show that Drosophila
      melanogaster have two TRAPP complexes similar to those in mammals and that both
      activate Rab1, whereas one, TRAPPII, also activates Rab11. TRAPPII is not
      essential but becomes so in the absence of the gene parcas that encodes the
      Drosophila orthologue of the SH3BP5 family of Rab11 guanine nucleotide exchange
      factors (GEFs). Thus, in metazoans, Rab1 activation requires TRAPP subunits not
      found in yeast, and Rab11 activation is shared by TRAPPII and an unrelated GEF
      that is metazoan specific.

PG  - 685-700
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705130 [doi]
AB  - Satellite cells (SCs) are adult muscle stem cells that are mobilized when muscle 
      homeostasis is perturbed. Here, we show that serum response factor (Srf) is
      needed for optimal SC-mediated hypertrophic growth. We identified Srf as a master
      regulator of SC fusion required in both fusion partners, whereas it was
      dispensable for SC proliferation and differentiation. We show that SC-specific
      Srf deletion leads to impaired actin cytoskeleton and report the existence of
      finger-like actin-based protrusions at fusion sites in vertebrates that were
      notoriously absent in fusion-defective myoblasts lacking Srf. Restoration of a
      polymerized actin network by overexpression of an alpha-actin isoform in Srf
      mutant SCs rescued their fusion with a control cell in vitro and in vivo and
      reestablished overload-induced muscle growth. These findings demonstrate the
      importance of Srf in controlling the organization of actin cytoskeleton and
      actin-based protrusions for myoblast fusion in mammals and its requirement to
      achieve efficient hypertrophic myofiber growth.

TI  - A Numb-Mdm2 fuzzy complex reveals an isoform-specific involvement of Numb in
      breast cancer.
PG  - 745-762
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709092 [doi]
AB  - Numb functions as an oncosuppressor by inhibiting Notch signaling and stabilizing
      p53. This latter effect depends on the interaction of Numb with Mdm2, the E3
      ligase that ubiquitinates p53 and commits it to degradation. In breast cancer
      (BC), loss of Numb results in a reduction of p53-mediated responses including
      sensitivity to genotoxic drugs and maintenance of homeostasis in the stem cell
      compartment. In this study, we show that the Numb-Mdm2 interaction represents a
      fuzzy complex mediated by a short Numb sequence encompassing its alternatively
      spliced exon 3 (Ex3), which is necessary and sufficient to inhibit Mdm2 and
      prevent p53 degradation. Alterations in the Numb splicing pattern are critical in
      BC as shown by increased chemoresistance of tumors displaying reduced levels of
      Ex3-containing isoforms, an effect that could be mechanistically linked to
      diminished p53 levels. A reduced level of Ex3-less Numb isoforms independently
      predicts poor outcome in BCs harboring wild-type p53. Thus, we have uncovered an 
      important mechanism of chemoresistance and progression in p53-competent BCs.

AB  - We developed a novel optogenetic tool, SxIP-improved light-inducible dimer
      (iLID), to facilitate the reversible recruitment of factors to microtubule (MT)
      plus ends in an end-binding protein-dependent manner using blue light. We show
      that SxIP-iLID can track MT plus ends and recruit tgRFP-SspB upon blue light
      activation. We used this system to investigate the effects of cross-linking MT
      plus ends and F-actin in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells to gain insight into
      spectraplakin function and mechanism. We show that SxIP-iLID can be used to
      temporally recruit an F-actin binding domain to MT plus ends and cross-link the
      MT and F-actin networks. Cross-linking decreases MT growth velocities and
      generates a peripheral MT exclusion zone. SxIP-iLID facilitates the general
      recruitment of specific factors to MT plus ends with temporal control enabling
      researchers to systematically regulate MT plus end dynamics and probe MT plus end
      function in many biological processes.

      GPI-anchor processing.
PG  - 585-599
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706135 [doi]
AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring of proteins is a conserved
      posttranslational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Soon after GPI 
      is attached, an acyl chain on the GPI inositol is removed by post-GPI attachment 
      to proteins 1 (PGAP1), a GPI-inositol deacylase. This is crucial for switching
      GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) from protein folding to transport states. We
      performed haploid genetic screens to identify factors regulating GPI-inositol
      deacylation, identifying seven genes. In particular, calnexin cycle impairment
      caused inefficient GPI-inositol deacylation. Calnexin was specifically associated
      with GPI-APs, dependent on N-glycan and GPI moieties, and assisted efficient
      GPI-inositol deacylation by PGAP1. Under chronic ER stress caused by misfolded
      GPI-APs, inositol-acylated GPI-APs were exposed on the cell surface. These
      results indicated that N-glycans participate in quality control and temporal ER
      retention of GPI-APs, ensuring their correct folding and GPI processing before
      exiting from the ER. Once the system is disrupted by ER stress, unprocessed
      GPI-APs become exposed on the cell surface.

PG  - 447-457
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612069 [doi]
AB  - Cell migration is dependent on the dynamic formation and disassembly of actin
      filament-based structures, including lamellipodia, filopodia, invadopodia, and
      membrane blebs, as well as on cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesions. 
      These processes all involve Rho family small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases),
      which are regulated by the opposing actions of guanine nucleotide exchange
      factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Rho GTPase activity needs
      to be precisely tuned at distinct cellular locations to enable cells to move in
      response to different environments and stimuli. In this review, we focus on the
      ability of RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs to form complexes with diverse binding partners,
      and describe how this influences their ability to control localized GTPase
      activity in the context of migration and invasion.

      factor XPA to DNA damage sites.
PG  - 527-540
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704028 [doi]
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation triggers the recruitment of DNA repair factors to
      the lesion sites and the deposition of histone marks as part of the DNA damage
      response. The major DNA repair pathway removing DNA lesions caused by exposure to
      UV light is nucleotide excision repair (NER). We have previously demonstrated
      that the endoribonuclease DICER facilitates chromatin decondensation during
      lesion recognition in the global-genomic branch of NER. Here, we report that
      DICER mediates the recruitment of the methyltransferase MMSET to the DNA damage
      site. We show that MMSET is required for efficient NER and that it catalyzes the 
      dimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me2). H4K20me2 at DNA damage sites
      facilitates the recruitment of the NER factor XPA. Our work thus provides
      evidence for an H4K20me2-dependent mechanism of XPA recruitment during lesion
      recognition in the global-genomic branch of NER.

TI  - SUV420H2 is an epigenetic regulator of epithelial/mesenchymal states in
      pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 763-777
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705031 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is implicated in metastasis, where carcinoma
      cells lose sessile epithelial traits and acquire mesenchymal migratory potential.
      The mesenchymal state is also associated with cancer stem cells and resistance to
      chemotherapy. It might therefore be therapeutically beneficial to promote
      epithelial identity in cancer. Because large-scale cell identity shifts are often
      orchestrated on an epigenetic level, we screened for candidate epigenetic factors
      and identified the histone methyltransferase SUV420H2 (KMT5C) as favoring the
      mesenchymal identity in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Through its repressive mark
      H4K20me3, SUV420H2 silences several key drivers of the epithelial state. Its
      knockdown elicited mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition on a molecular and
      functional level, and cells displayed decreased stemness and increased drug
      sensitivity. An analysis of human pancreatic cancer biopsies was concordant with 
      these findings, because high levels of SUV420H2 correlated with a loss of
      epithelial characteristics in progressively invasive cancer. Together, these data
      indicate that SUV420H2 is an upstream epigenetic regulator of
      epithelial/mesenchymal state control.

AB  - Microtubule-dependent long-distance movement of peroxisomes occurs in mammalian
      cells. However, its molecular mechanisms remain undefined. In this study, we
      identified three distinct splicing variants of human mitochondrial Rho GTPase-1
      (Miro1), each containing amino acid sequence insertions 1 (named Miro1-var2), 2
      (Miro1-var3), and both 1 and 2 (Miro1-var4), respectively, at upstream of the
      transmembrane domain. Miro1-var4 and Miro1-var2 are localized to peroxisomes in a
      manner dependent on the insertion 1 that is recognized by the cytosolic receptor 
      Pex19p. Exogenous expression of Miro1-var4 induces accumulation of peroxisomes at
      the cell periphery and augments long-range movement of peroxisomes along
      microtubules. Depletion of all Miro1 variants by knocking down MIRO1 suppresses
      the long-distance movement of peroxisomes. Such abrogated movement is restored by
      reexpression of peroxisomal Miro1 variants. Collectively, our findings identify
      for the first time peroxisome-localized Miro1 variants as adapter proteins that
      link peroxisomes to the microtubule-dependent transport complexes including TRAK2
      in the intracellular translocation of peroxisomes in mammalian cells.

AB  - Spindle orientation determines the axis of division and is crucial for cell fate,
      tissue morphogenesis, and the development of an organism. In animal cells,
      spindle orientation is regulated by the conserved Galphai-LGN-NuMA complex, which
      targets the force generator dynein-dynactin to the cortex. In this study, we show
      that p37/UBXN2B, a cofactor of the p97 AAA ATPase, regulates spindle orientation 
      in mammalian cells by limiting the levels of cortical NuMA. p37 controls cortical
      NuMA levels via the phosphatase PP1 and its regulatory subunit Repo-Man, but it
      acts independently of Galphai, the kinase Aurora A, and the phosphatase PP2A. Our
      data show that in anaphase, when the spindle elongates, PP1/Repo-Man promotes the
      accumulation of NuMA at the cortex. In metaphase, p37 negatively regulates this
      function of PP1, resulting in lower cortical NuMA levels and correct spindle
      orientation.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201707161 [doi]
AB  - Chromosomes that have undergone crossing over in meiotic prophase must maintain
      sister chromatid cohesion somewhere along their length between the first and
      second meiotic divisions. Although many eukaryotes use the centromere as a site
      to maintain cohesion, the holocentric organism Caenorhabditis elegans instead
      creates two chromosome domains of unequal length termed the short arm and long
      arm, which become the first and second site of cohesion loss at meiosis I and II.
      The mechanisms that confer distinct functions to the short and long arm domains
      remain poorly understood. Here, we show that phosphorylation of the synaptonemal 
      complex protein SYP-1 is required to create these domains. Once crossover sites
      are designated, phosphorylated SYP-1 and PLK-2 become cooperatively confined to
      short arms and guide phosphorylated histone H3 and the chromosomal passenger
      complex to the site of meiosis I cohesion loss. Our results show that PLK-2 and
      phosphorylated SYP-1 ensure creation of the short arm subdomain, promoting
      disjunction of chromosomes in meiosis I.

AB  - An appreciation of the functional properties of the cytoplasmic fatty acid
      binding protein 4 (FABP4) has advanced with the recent demonstration that an
      extracellular form secreted by adipocytes regulates a wide range of physiological
      functions. Little, however, is known about the mechanisms that mediate the
      unconventional secretion of FABP4. Here, we demonstrate that FABP4 secretion is
      mediated by a membrane-bounded compartment, independent of the conventional
      endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretory pathway. We show that FABP4 secretion is
      also independent of GRASP proteins, autophagy, and multivesicular bodies but
      involves enclosure within endosomes and secretory lysosomes. We highlight the
      physiological significance of this pathway with the demonstration that an
      increase in plasma levels of FABP4 is inhibited by chloroquine treatment of mice.
      These findings chart the pathway of FABP4 secretion and provide a potential
      therapeutic means to control metabolic disorders associated with its dysregulated
      secretion.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611194 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial fusion occurs in many eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and
      fungi. It is essential for cellular homeostasis, and yet the underlying
      mechanisms remain elusive. Comparative analyses and phylogenetic reconstructions 
      revealed that fungal Fzo1 and animal Mitofusin proteins are highly diverged from 
      one another and lack strong sequence similarity. Bioinformatic analysis showed
      that fungal Fzo1 proteins exhibit two predicted transmembrane domains, whereas
      metazoan Mitofusins contain only a single transmembrane domain. This prediction
      contradicts the current models, suggesting that both animal and fungal proteins
      share one topology. This newly predicted topology of Mfn1 and Mfn2 was
      demonstrated biochemically, confirming that the C-terminal, redox-sensitive
      cysteine residues reside within the intermembrane space (IMS). Functional
      experiments established that redox-mediated disulfide modifications within the
      IMS domain are key modulators of reversible Mfn oligomerization that drives
      fusion. Together, these results lead to a revised understanding of Mfns as
      single-spanning outer membrane proteins with an Nout-Cin orientation, providing
      functional insight into the IMS contribution to redox-regulated fusion events.

      mechanosensory organs.
PG  - 571-583
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706101 [doi]
AB  - Although there is abundant evidence that individual microRNA (miRNA) loci repress
      large cohorts of targets, large-scale knockout studies suggest that most miRNAs
      are phenotypically dispensable. Here, we identify a rare case of developmental
      cell specification that is highly dependent on miRNA control of an individual
      target. We observe that binary cell fate choice in the Drosophila melanogaster
      peripheral sensory organ lineage is controlled by the non-neuronally expressed
      mir-279/996 cluster, with a majority of notum sensory organs exhibiting
      transformation of sheath cells into ectopic neurons. The mir-279/996 defect
      phenocopies Notch loss of function during the sheath-neuron cell fate decision,
      suggesting the miRNAs facilitate Notch signaling. Consistent with this,
      mir-279/996 knockouts are strongly enhanced by Notch heterozygosity, and
      activated nuclear Notch is impaired in the miRNA mutant. Although Hairless (H) is
      the canonical nuclear Notch pathway inhibitor, and H heterozygotes exhibit
      bristle cell fate phenotypes reflecting gain-of-Notch signaling, H/+ does not
      rescue mir-279/996 mutants. Instead, we identify Insensible (Insb), another
      neural nuclear Notch pathway inhibitor, as a critical direct miR-279/996 target. 
      Insb is posttranscriptionally restricted to neurons by these miRNAs, and its
      heterozygosity strongly suppresses ectopic peripheral nervous system neurons in
      mir-279/996 mutants. Thus, proper assembly of multicellular mechanosensory organs
      requires a double-negative circuit involving miRNA-mediated suppression of a
      Notch repressor to assign non-neuronal cell fate.

AB  - Proliferation and activation of microglia in the brain, concentrated around
      amyloid plaques, is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human
      genetics data point to a key role for microglia in the pathogenesis of AD. The
      majority of risk genes for AD are highly expressed (and many are selectively
      expressed) by microglia in the brain. There is mounting evidence that microglia
      protect against the incidence of AD, as impaired microglial activities and
      altered microglial responses to beta-amyloid are associated with increased AD
      risk. On the other hand, there is also abundant evidence that activated microglia
      can be harmful to neurons. Microglia can mediate synapse loss by engulfment of
      synapses, likely via a complement-dependent mechanism; they can also exacerbate
      tau pathology and secrete inflammatory factors that can injure neurons directly
      or via activation of neurotoxic astrocytes. Gene expression profiles indicate
      multiple states of microglial activation in neurodegenerative disease settings,
      which might explain the disparate roles of microglia in the development and
      progression of AD pathology.

      antimicrobial response.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704186 [doi]
AB  - Skin and mucosal epithelia deploy antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to eliminate
      harmful microbes. We reported that the intermediate filament keratin 6a (K6a) is 
      constitutively processed into antimicrobial fragments in corneal epithelial
      cells. In this study, we show that K6a network remodeling is a host defense
      response that directly up-regulates production of keratin-derived AMPs (KAMPs) by
      the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Bacterial ligands trigger K6a
      phosphorylation at S19, S22, S37, and S60, leading to network disassembly.
      Mutagenic analysis of K6a confirmed that the site-specific phosphorylation
      augmented its solubility. K6a in the cytosol is ubiquitinated by cullin-RING E3
      ligases for subsequent proteasomal processing. Without an appreciable increase in
      K6a gene expression and proteasome activity, a higher level of cytosolic K6a
      results in enhanced KAMP production. Although proteasome-mediated proteolysis is 
      known to produce antigenic peptides in adaptive immunity, our findings
      demonstrate its new role in producing AMPs for innate immune defense.
      Manipulating K6a phosphorylation or UPS activity may provide opportunities to
      harness the innate immunity of epithelia against infection.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705160 [doi]
AB  - Actin pseudopods induced by SCAR/WAVE drive normal migration and chemotaxis in
      eukaryotic cells. Cells can also migrate using blebs, in which the edge is driven
      forward by hydrostatic pressure instead of actin. In Dictyostelium discoideum,
      loss of SCAR is compensated by WASP moving to the leading edge to generate
      morphologically normal pseudopods. Here we use an inducible double knockout to
      show that cells lacking both SCAR and WASP are unable to grow, make pseudopods
      or, unexpectedly, migrate using blebs. Remarkably, amounts and dynamics of actin 
      polymerization are normal. Pseudopods are replaced in double SCAR/WASP mutants by
      aberrant filopods, induced by the formin dDia2. Further disruption of the gene
      for dDia2 restores cells' ability to initiate blebs and thus migrate, though
      pseudopods are still lost. Triple knockout cells still contain near-normal
      F-actin levels. This work shows that SCAR, WASP, and dDia2 compete for actin.
      Loss of SCAR and WASP causes excessive dDia2 activity, maintaining F-actin levels
      but blocking pseudopod and bleb formation and migration.

TI  - Humanin is an endogenous activator of chaperone-mediated autophagy.
PG  - 635-647
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606095 [doi]
AB  - Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) serves as quality control during stress
      conditions through selective degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes.
      Humanin (HN) is a mitochondria-associated peptide that offers cytoprotective,
      cardioprotective, and neuroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro. In this
      study, we demonstrate that HN directly activates CMA by increasing substrate
      binding and translocation into lysosomes. The potent HN analogue HNG protects
      from stressor-induced cell death in fibroblasts, cardiomyoblasts, neuronal cells,
      and primary cardiomyocytes. The protective effects are lost in CMA-deficient
      cells, suggesting that they are mediated through the activation of CMA. We
      identified that a fraction of endogenous HN is present at the cytosolic side of
      the lysosomal membrane, where it interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and
      stabilizes binding of this chaperone to CMA substrates as they bind to the
      membrane. Inhibition of HSP90 blocks the effect of HNG on substrate translocation
      and abolishes the cytoprotective effects. Our study provides a novel mechanism by
      which HN exerts its cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects.

PG  - 517-526
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706027 [doi]
AB  - The insulin signaling pathway plays key roles in systemic growth. TBC1D7 has
      recently been identified as the third subunit of the tuberous sclerosis complex
      (TSC), a negative regulator of cell growth. Here, we used Drosophila as a model
      system to dissect the physiological function of TBC1D7 in vivo. In mutants
      lacking TBC1D7, cell and organ growth were promoted, and TBC1D7 limited cell
      growth in a cell-nonautonomous and TSC-independent manner. TBC1D7 is specifically
      expressed in insulin-producing cells in the fly brain and regulated biosynthesis 
      and release of insulin-like peptide 2, leading to systemic growth. Furthermore,
      animals carrying the dTBC1D7 mutation were hypoglycemic, short-lived, and
      sensitive to oxidative stress. Our findings provide new insights into the
      physiological function of TBC1D7 in the systemic control of growth, as well as
      insights into human disorders caused by TBC1D7 mutation.

TI  - Opportunities for organoids as new models of aging.
PG  - 39-50
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709054 [doi]
AB  - The biology of aging is challenging to study, particularly in humans. As a
      result, model organisms are used to approximate the physiological context of
      aging in humans. However, the best model organisms remain expensive and
      time-consuming to use. More importantly, they may not reflect directly on the
      process of aging in people. Human cell culture provides an alternative, but many 
      functional signs of aging occur at the level of tissues rather than cells and are
      therefore not readily apparent in traditional cell culture models. Organoids have
      the potential to effectively balance between the strengths and weaknesses of
      traditional models of aging. They have sufficient complexity to capture relevant 
      signs of aging at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, while presenting an
      experimentally tractable alternative to animal studies. Organoid systems have
      been developed to model many human tissues and diseases. Here we provide a
      perspective on the potential for organoids to serve as models for aging and
      describe how current organoid techniques could be applied to aging research.

TI  - IFT20 modulates ciliary PDGFRalpha signaling by regulating the stability of Cbl
      E3 ubiquitin ligases.
PG  - 151-161
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611050 [doi]
AB  - Primary cilia have pivotal roles as organizers of many different signaling
      pathways, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha)
      signaling, which, when aberrantly regulated, is associated with developmental
      disorders, tumorigenesis, and cancer. PDGFRalpha is up-regulated during
      ciliogenesis, and ciliary localization of the receptor is required for its
      appropriate ligand-mediated activation by PDGF-AA. However, the mechanisms
      regulating sorting of PDGFRalpha and feedback inhibition of PDGFRalpha signaling 
      at the cilium are unknown. Here, we provide evidence that intraflagellar
      transport protein 20 (IFT20) interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b 
      and is required for Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and internalization of PDGFRalpha
      for feedback inhibition of receptor signaling. In wild-type cells treated with
      PDGF-AA, c-Cbl becomes enriched in the cilium, and the receptor is subsequently
      ubiquitinated and internalized. In contrast, in IFT20-depleted cells, PDGFRalpha 
      localizes aberrantly to the plasma membrane and is overactivated after ligand
      stimulation because of destabilization and degradation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b.

TI  - Cobl-like promotes actin filament formation and dendritic branching using only a 
      single WH2 domain.
PG  - 211-230
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704071 [doi]
AB  - Local actin filament formation powers the development of the signal-receiving
      arbor of neurons that underlies neuronal network formation. Yet, little is known 
      about the molecules that drive these processes and may functionally connect them 
      to the transient calcium pulses observed in restricted areas in the forming
      dendritic arbor. Here we demonstrate that Cordon-Bleu (Cobl)-like, an
      uncharacterized protein suggested to represent a very distantly related,
      evolutionary ancestor of the actin nucleator Cobl, despite having only a single
      G-actin-binding Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein Homology 2 (WH2) domain,
      massively promoted the formation of F-actin-rich membrane ruffles of COS-7 cells 
      and of dendritic branches of neurons. Cobl-like hereby integrates WH2 domain
      functions with those of the F-actin-binding protein Abp1. Cobl-like-mediated
      dendritic branching is dependent on Abp1 as well as on Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)
      signaling and CaM association. Calcium signaling leads to a promotion of complex 
      formation with Cobl-like's cofactor Abp1. Thus, Ca(2+)/CaM control of actin
      dynamics seems to be a much more broadly used principle in cell biology than
      previously thought.

      response remain unknown. We find that LPS triggers p38alpha mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 in microglial cells. This
      phosphorylation inhibited ULK1 kinase activity, preventing it from binding to the
      downstream effector ATG13, and reduced autophagy in microglia. Consistently,
      p38alpha MAPK activity is required for LPS-induced morphological changes and the 
      production of IL-1beta by primary microglia in vitro and in the brain, which
      correlates with the p38alpha MAPK-dependent inhibition of autophagy. Furthermore,
      inhibition of ULK1 alone was sufficient to promote an inflammatory response in
      the absence of any overt inflammatory stimulation. Thus, our study reveals a
      molecular mechanism that enables the initial TLR4-triggered signaling pathway to 
      inhibit autophagy and optimize inflammatory responses, providing new
      understanding into the mechanistic basis of the neuroinflammatory process.

AB  - Storage and consumption of neutral lipids in lipid droplets (LDs) are essential
      for energy homeostasis and tightly coupled to cellular metabolism. However, how
      metabolic cues are integrated in the life cycle of LDs is unclear. In this study,
      we characterize the function of Ldo16 and Ldo45, two splicing isoforms of the
      same protein in budding yeast. We show that Ldo proteins interact with the seipin
      complex, which regulates contacts between LDs and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
      Moreover, we show that the levels of Ldo16 and Ldo45 depend on the growth stage
      of cells and that deregulation of their relative abundance alters LD morphology, 
      protein localization, and triglyceride content. Finally, we show that absence of 
      Ldo proteins results in defects in LD morphology and consumption by lipophagy.
      Our findings support a model in which Ldo proteins modulate the activity of the
      seipin complex, thereby affecting LD properties. Moreover, we identify ER-LD
      contacts as regulatory targets coupling energy storage to cellular metabolism.

AB  - Functional heterogeneity within the lipid droplet (LD) pool of a single cell has 
      been observed, yet the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we report on
      identification of a specialized LD subpopulation characterized by a unique
      proteome and a defined geographical location at the nucleus-vacuole junction
      contact site. In search for factors determining identity of these LDs, we
      screened approximately 6,000 yeast mutants for loss of targeting of the
      subpopulation marker Pdr16 and identified Ldo45 (LD organization protein of 45
      kD) as a crucial targeting determinant. Ldo45 is the product of a splicing event 
      connecting two adjacent genes (YMR147W and YMR148W/OSW5/LDO16). We show that Ldo 
      proteins cooperate with the LD biogenesis component seipin and establish LD
      identity by defining positioning and surface-protein composition. Our studies
      suggest a mechanism to establish functional differentiation of organelles,
      opening the door to better understanding of metabolic decisions in cells.

TI  - Aurora A kinase phosphorylates Hec1 to regulate metaphase kinetochore-microtubule
      dynamics.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201707160 [doi]
AB  - Precise regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments is essential for
      successful chromosome segregation. Central to this regulation is Aurora B kinase,
      which phosphorylates kinetochore substrates to promote microtubule turnover. A
      critical target of Aurora B is the N-terminal "tail" domain of Hec1, which is a
      component of the NDC80 complex, a force-transducing link between kinetochores and
      microtubules. Although Aurora B is regarded as the "master regulator" of
      kinetochore-microtubule attachment, other mitotic kinases likely contribute to
      Hec1 phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate that Aurora A kinase
      regulates kinetochore-microtubule dynamics of metaphase chromosomes, and we
      identify Hec1 S69, a previously uncharacterized phosphorylation target site in
      the Hec1 tail, as a critical Aurora A substrate for this regulation.
      Additionally, we demonstrate that Aurora A kinase associates with inner
      centromere protein (INCENP) during mitosis and that INCENP is competent to drive 
      accumulation of the kinase to the centromere region of mitotic chromosomes. These
      findings reveal that both Aurora A and B contribute to kinetochore-microtubule
      attachment dynamics, and they uncover an unexpected role for Aurora A in late
      mitosis.

AB  - Extrusion of apoptotic cells from epithelial tissues requires orchestrated
      morphological rearrangements of the apoptotic cell and its neighbors. However,
      the connections between the apoptotic cascade and events leading to extrusion are
      not fully understood. Here, we characterize an apoptotic extrusion apical actin
      ring (EAAR) that is assembled within the apoptotic cell and drives epithelial
      extrusion. Caspase-mediated cleavage of myotonic dystrophy kinase-related
      CDC42-binding kinase-alpha (MRCKalpha) triggers a signaling pathway that leads to
      the assembly of EAAR that pulls actin bundles, resulting in the compaction and
      removal of the cell body. We provide a detailed portrait of the EAAR including
      F-actin flow, the contribution of myosin contraction, and actin polymerization at
      bundles' terminals when the product of MRCKalpha cleavage is expressed. These
      results add to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the process of
      epithelial extrusion by establishing a causal relationship between the triggering
      events of apoptosis, the activation of MRCKalpha, and its subsequent effects on
      the dynamics of actomyosin cytoskeleton rearrangement.

      uptake, inner membrane constriction, and division.

AB  - Mitochondrial division requires division of both the inner and outer
      mitochondrial membranes (IMM and OMM, respectively). Interaction with endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) promotes OMM division by recruitment of the dynamin Drp1, but
      effects on IMM division are not well characterized. We previously showed that
      actin polymerization through ER-bound inverted formin 2 (INF2) stimulates Drp1
      recruitment in mammalian cells. Here, we show that INF2-mediated actin
      polymerization stimulates a second mitochondrial response independent of Drp1: a 
      rise in mitochondrial matrix calcium through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.
      ER stores supply the increased mitochondrial calcium, and the role of actin is to
      increase ER-mitochondria contact. Myosin IIA is also required for this
      mitochondrial calcium increase. Elevated mitochondrial calcium in turn activates 
      IMM constriction in a Drp1-independent manner. IMM constriction requires electron
      transport chain activity. IMM division precedes OMM division. These results
      demonstrate that actin polymerization independently stimulates the dynamics of
      both membranes during mitochondrial division: IMM through increased matrix
      calcium, and OMM through Drp1 recruitment.

AB  - Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles playing essential metabolic and
      signaling functions. The mitochondrial proteome is under surveillance by two
      proteolysis systems: the ubiquitin-proteasome system degrades mitochondrial
      outer-membrane (MOM) proteins, and the AAA proteases maintain the proteostasis of
      intramitochondrial compartments. We previously identified a
      Doa1-Cdc48(-Ufd1-Npl4) complex that retrogradely translocates ubiquitinated MOM
      proteins to the cytoplasm for degradation. In this study, we report the
      unexpected identification of MOM proteins whose degradation requires the
      Yme1(-Mgr1-Mgr3)i-AAA protease complex in mitochondrial inner membrane. Through
      immunoprecipitation and in vivo site-specific photo-cross-linking experiments, we
      show that both Yme1 adapters Mgr1 and Mgr3 recognize the intermembrane space
      (IMS) domains of the MOM substrates and facilitate their recruitment to Yme1 for 
      proteolysis. We also provide evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of substrate
      can be dislocated into IMS by the ATPase activity of Yme1. Our findings indicate 
      a proteolysis pathway monitoring MOM proteins from the IMS side and suggest that 
      the MOM proteome is surveilled by mitochondrial and cytoplasmic quality control
      machineries in parallel.

      cancer cells.
PG  - 375-395
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702184 [doi]
AB  - The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 is highly expressed in invasive breast
      cancer, but the mechanism by which it potentiates tumor cell invasiveness is
      unclear at present. Using high-throughput protein array screening and
      bioinformatic analysis, we identified cortactin as a novel substrate and
      interactor of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2). Pyk2 colocalizes with
      cortactin to invadopodia of invasive breast cancer cells, where it mediates
      epidermal growth factor-induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation both directly 
      and indirectly via Src-mediated Abl-related gene (Arg) activation, leading to
      actin polymerization in invadopodia, extracellular matrix degradation, and tumor 
      cell invasion. Both Pyk2 and the closely related focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
      regulate tumor cell invasion, albeit via distinct mechanisms. Although Pyk2
      regulates tumor cell invasion by controlling invadopodium-mediated functions, FAK
      controls invasiveness of tumor cells by regulating focal adhesion-mediated
      motility. Collectively, our findings identify Pyk2 as a unique mediator of
      invadopodium formation and function and also provide a novel insight into the
      mechanisms by which Pyk2 mediates tumor cell invasion.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704102 [doi]
AB  - Centrosome amplification is a common feature of human tumors. To survive, cancer 
      cells cluster extra centrosomes during mitosis, avoiding the detrimental effects 
      of multipolar divisions. However, it is unclear whether clustering requires
      adaptation or is inherent to all cells. Here, we show that cells have varied
      abilities to cluster extra centrosomes. Epithelial cells are innately inefficient
      at clustering even in the presence of HSET/KIFC1, which is essential but not
      sufficient to promote clustering. The presence of E-cadherin decreases cortical
      contractility during mitosis through a signaling cascade leading to multipolar
      divisions, and its knockout promotes clustering and survival of cells with
      multiple centrosomes. Cortical contractility restricts centrosome movement at a
      minimal distance required for HSET/KIFC1 to exert its function, highlighting a
      biphasic model for centrosome clustering. In breast cancer cell lines, increased 
      levels of centrosome amplification are accompanied by efficient clustering and
      loss of E-cadherin, indicating that this is an important adaptation mechanism to 
      centrosome amplification in cancer.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709072 [doi]
AB  - Ensuring cellular protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, requires precise control 
      of protein synthesis, folding, conformational maintenance, and degradation. A
      complex and adaptive proteostasis network coordinates these processes with
      molecular chaperones of different classes and their regulators functioning as
      major players. This network serves to ensure that cells have the proteins they
      need while minimizing misfolding or aggregation events that are hallmarks of
      age-associated proteinopathies, including neurodegenerative disorders such as
      Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It is now clear that the capacity of cells 
      to maintain proteostasis undergoes a decline during aging, rendering the organism
      susceptible to these pathologies. Here we discuss the major proteostasis pathways
      in light of recent research suggesting that their age-dependent failure can both 
      contribute to and result from disease. We consider different strategies to
      modulate proteostasis capacity, which may help develop urgently needed therapies 
      for neurodegeneration and other age-dependent pathologies.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701169 [doi]
AB  - Why do integrins differ in basal activity, and how does affinity for soluble
      ligand correlate with cellular adhesiveness? We show that basal conformational
      equilibrium set points for integrin alpha4beta1 are cell type specific and differ
      from integrin alpha5beta1 when the two integrins are coexpressed on the same
      cell. Although alpha4beta1 is easier to activate, its high-affinity state binds
      vascular cell adhesion molecule and fibronectin 100- to 1,000-fold more weakly
      than alpha5beta1 binds fibronectin. Furthermore, the difference in affinity
      between the high- and low-affinity states is more compressed in alpha4beta1 (600-
      to 800-fold) than in alpha5beta1 (4,000- to 6,000-fold). alpha4beta1 basal
      conformational equilibria differ among three cell types, define affinity for
      soluble ligand and readiness for priming, and may reflect differences in
      interactions with intracellular adaptors but do not predict cellular adhesiveness
      for immobilized ligand. The measurements here provide a necessary framework for
      understanding integrin activation in intact cells, including activation of
      integrin adhesiveness by application of tensile force by the cytoskeleton, across
      ligand-integrin-adaptor complexes.

AB  - Genome duplication in eukaryotes created paralog pairs of ribosomal proteins
      (RPs) that show high sequence similarity/identity. However, individual paralogs
      can confer vastly different effects upon cellular processes, e.g., specific yeast
      paralogs regulate actin organization, bud site selection, and mRNA localization, 
      although how specificity is conferred is unknown. Changes in the RP composition
      of ribosomes might allow for specialized translation of different subsets of
      mRNAs, yet it is unclear whether specialized ribosomes exist and if paralog
      specificity controls translation. Using translatome analyses, we show that the
      translation of mitochondrial proteins is highly down-regulated in yeast lacking
      RP paralogs required for normal mitochondrial function (e.g., RPL1b). Although
      RPL1a and RPL1b encode identical proteins, Rpl1b-containing ribosomes confer more
      efficient translation of respiration-related proteins. Thus, ribosomes varying in
      RP composition may confer specialized functions, and RP paralog specificity
      defines a novel means of translational control.

AB  - Aging is the major risk factor for cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Although we are far from understanding the
      biological basis of aging, research suggests that targeting the aging process
      itself could ameliorate many age-related pathologies. Senescence is a cellular
      response characterized by a stable growth arrest and other phenotypic alterations
      that include a proinflammatory secretome. Senescence plays roles in normal
      development, maintains tissue homeostasis, and limits tumor progression. However,
      senescence has also been implicated as a major cause of age-related disease. In
      this regard, recent experimental evidence has shown that the genetic or
      pharmacological ablation of senescent cells extends life span and improves health
      span. Here, we review the cellular and molecular links between cellular
      senescence and aging and discuss the novel therapeutic avenues that this
      connection opens.

PG  - 283-298
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705214 [doi]
AB  - Rab GTPases serve as molecular switches to regulate eukaryotic membrane
      trafficking pathways. The transport protein particle (TRAPP) complexes activate
      Rab GTPases by catalyzing GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange. In mammalian cells, there 
      are two distinct TRAPP complexes, yet in budding yeast, four distinct TRAPP
      complexes have been reported. The apparent differences between the compositions
      of yeast and mammalian TRAPP complexes have prevented a clear understanding of
      the specific functions of TRAPP complexes in all cell types. In this study, we
      demonstrate that akin to mammalian cells, wild-type yeast possess only two TRAPP 
      complexes, TRAPPII and TRAPPIII. We find that TRAPPIII plays a major role in
      regulating Rab activation and trafficking at the Golgi in addition to its
      established role in autophagy. These disparate pathways share a common regulatory
      GTPase Ypt1 (Rab1) that is activated by TRAPPIII. Our findings lead to a simple
      yet comprehensive model for TRAPPIII function in both normal and starved
      eukaryotic cells.

TI  - Ubiquitination of the PI3-kinase VPS-34 promotes VPS-34 stability and phagosome
      maturation.
PG  - 347-360
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705116 [doi]
AB  - Apoptotic cells generated by programmed cell death are engulfed by phagocytes and
      enclosed within membrane-bound phagosomes. Maturation of apoptotic
      cell-containing phagosomes leads to formation of phagolysosomes where cell
      corpses are degraded. The class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)
      VPS-34 coordinates with PIKI-1, a class II PI3-kinase, to produce PtdIns3P on
      phagosomes, thus promoting phagosome closure and maturation. Here, we identified 
      UBC-13, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that functions in the same pathway
      with VPS-34 but in parallel to PIKI-1 to regulate PtdIns3P generation on
      phagosomes. Loss of ubc-13 affects early steps of phagosome maturation, causing
      accumulation of cell corpses. We found that UBC-13 functions with UEV-1, a
      noncatalytic E2 variant, and CHN-1, a U-box-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, to
      catalyze K63-linked poly-ubiquitination on VPS-34 both in vitro and in
      Caenorhabditis elegans Loss of ubc-13, uev-1, or chn-1 disrupts ubiquitin
      modification of VPS-34 and causes significantly reduced VPS-34 protein levels.
      Our data suggest that K63-linked ubiquitin modification serves as a general
      mechanism to modulate VPS-34 stability in multiple processes.

PG  - 329-346
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702179 [doi]
AB  - Phagocytosis of filamentous bacteria occurs through tubular phagocytic cups
      (tPCs) and takes many minutes to engulf these filaments into phagosomes.
      Contravening the canonical phagocytic pathway, tPCs mature by fusing with
      endosomes. Using this model, we observed the sequential recruitment of early and 
      late endolysosomal markers to the elongating tPCs. Surprisingly, the regulatory
      early endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) persists on
      tPCs as long as their luminal pH remains neutral. Interestingly, by manipulating 
      cellular pH, we determined that PtdIns(3)P behaves similarly in canonical
      phagosomes as well as endosomes. We found that this is the product of a pH-based 
      mechanism that induces the dissociation of the Vps34 class III
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase from these organelles as they acidify. The
      detachment of Vps34 stops the production of PtdIns(3)P, allowing for the turnover
      of this lipid by PIKfyve. Given that PtdIns(3)P-dependent signaling is important 
      for multiple cellular pathways, this mechanism for pH-dependent regulation of
      Vps34 could be at the center of many PtdIns(3)P-dependent cellular processes.

      endocytic recycling.
PG  - 299-314
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705136 [doi]
AB  - RAB-10/Rab10 is a master regulator of endocytic recycling in epithelial cells. To
      better understand the regulation of RAB-10 activity, we sought to identify
      RAB-10(GDP)-interacting proteins. One novel RAB-10(GDP)-binding partner that we
      identified, LET-413, is the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of Scrib/Erbin.
      Here, we focus on the mechanistic role of LET-413 in the regulation of RAB-10
      within the C. elegans intestine. We show that LET-413 is a RAB-5 effector and
      colocalizes with RAB-10 on endosomes, and the overlap of LET-413 with RAB-10 is
      RAB-5 dependent. Notably, LET-413 enhances the interaction of DENN-4 with
      RAB-10(GDP) and promotes DENN-4 guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity
      toward RAB-10. Loss of LET-413 leads to cytosolic dispersion of the RAB-10
      effectors TBC-2 and CNT-1. Finally, we demonstrate that the loss of RAB-10 or
      LET-413 results in abnormal overextensions of lateral membrane. Hence, our
      studies indicate that LET-413 is required for DENN-4-mediated RAB-10 activation, 
      and the LET-413-assisted RAB-5 to RAB-10 cascade contributes to the integrity of 
      C. elegans intestinal epithelia.

AB  - There is remarkable redundancy between the Cyclin-Cdk complexes that comprise the
      cell cycle machinery. None of the mammalian A-, D-, or E-type cyclins are
      required in development until implantation, and only Cdk1 is essential for early 
      cell divisions. Cyclin B1 is essential for development, but whether it is
      required for cell division is contentious. Here, we used a novel imaging approach
      to analyze Cyclin B1-null embryos from fertilization onward. We show that Cyclin 
      B1(-/-) embryos arrest in G2 phase after just two divisions. This is the earliest
      arrest of any Cyclin known and places Cyclin B1 with cdk1 as the essential
      regulators of the cell cycle. We reintroduced mutant proteins into this
      genetically null background to determine why Cyclin B1 is constantly exported
      from the nucleus. We found that Cyclin B1 must be exported from the nucleus for
      the cell to prevent premature entry to mitosis, and retaining Cyclin B1-Cdk1 at
      the plasma membrane precludes entry to mitosis.

TI  - Aurora A activation in mitosis promoted by BuGZ.
PG  - 107-116
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706103 [doi]
AB  - Protein phase separation or coacervation has emerged as a potential mechanism to 
      regulate biological functions. We have shown that coacervation of a mostly
      unstructured protein, BuGZ, promotes assembly of spindle and its matrix. BuGZ in 
      the spindle matrix binds and concentrates tubulin to promote microtubule (MT)
      assembly. It remains unclear, however, whether BuGZ could regulate additional
      proteins to promote spindle assembly. In this study, we report that BuGZ promotes
      Aurora A (AurA) activation in vitro. Depletion of BuGZ in cells reduces the
      amount of phosphorylated AurA on spindle MTs. BuGZ also enhances MCAK
      phosphorylation. The two zinc fingers in BuGZ directly bind to the kinase domain 
      of AurA, which allows AurA to incorporate into the coacervates formed by BuGZ in 
      vitro. Importantly, mutant BuGZ that disrupts the coacervation activity in vitro 
      fails to promote AurA phosphorylation in Xenopus laevis egg extracts. These
      results suggest that BuGZ coacervation promotes AurA activation in mitosis.

AB  - Nutrients are necessary for life, as they are a crucial requirement for
      biological processes including reproduction, somatic growth, and tissue
      maintenance. Therefore, signaling systems involved in detecting and interpreting 
      nutrient or energy levels-most notably, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 
      (IGF-1) signaling pathway, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and adenosine 
      monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-play important roles in regulating 
      physiological decisions to reproduce, grow, and age. In this review, we discuss
      the connections between reproductive senescence and somatic aging and give an
      overview of the involvement of nutrient-sensing pathways in controlling both
      reproductive function and lifespan. Although the molecular mechanisms that affect
      these processes can be influenced by distinct tissue-, temporal-, and
      pathway-specific signaling events, the progression of reproductive aging and
      somatic aging is systemically coordinated by integrated nutrient-sensing
      signaling pathways regulating somatic tissue maintenance in conjunction with
      reproductive capacity.

TI  - Stem cells: Aging and transcriptional fingerprints.
PG  - 79-92
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201708099 [doi]
AB  - Stem cells are imbued with unique qualities. They have the capacity to propagate 
      themselves through symmetric divisions and to divide asymmetrically to engender
      new cells that can progress to differentiate into tissue-specific, terminal cell 
      types. Armed with these qualities, stem cells in adult tissues are tasked with
      replacing decaying cells and regenerating tissue after injury to maintain optimal
      tissue function. With increasing age, stem cell functional abilities decline,
      resulting in reduced organ function and delays in tissue repair. Here, we review 
      the effect of aging in five well-studied adult murine stem cell populations and
      explore age-related declines in stem cell function and their consequences for
      stem cell self-renewal, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. Finally, we examine
      transcriptional changes that have been documented in aged stem cell populations
      and discuss new questions and future directions that this collection of data has 
      uncovered.

PG  - 361-374
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702145 [doi]
AB  - At the onset of metamorphosis, Drosophila salivary gland cells undergo a burst of
      glue granule secretion to attach the forming pupa to a solid surface. Here, we
      show that excess granules evading exocytosis are degraded via direct fusion with 
      lysosomes, a secretory granule-specific autophagic process known as crinophagy.
      We find that the tethering complex HOPS (homotypic fusion and protein sorting);
      the small GTPases Rab2, Rab7, and its effector, PLEKHM1; and a SNAP receptor
      complex consisting of Syntaxin 13, Snap29, and Vamp7 are all required for the
      fusion of secretory granules with lysosomes. Proper glue degradation within
      lysosomes also requires the Uvrag-containing Vps34 lipid kinase complex and the
      v-ATPase proton pump, whereas Atg genes involved in macroautophagy are
      dispensable for crinophagy. Our work establishes the molecular mechanism of
      developmentally programmed crinophagy in Drosophila and paves the way for
      analyzing this process in metazoans.

AB  - Despite the extensive description of numerous molecular changes associated with
      aging, insights into the driver mechanisms of this fundamental biological process
      are limited. Based on observations in the premature aging syndrome
      Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, we explore the possibility that protein regulation
      at the inner nuclear membrane and the nuclear lamina contributes to the aging
      process. In support, sequestration of nucleoplasmic proteins to the periphery
      impacts cell stemness, the response to cytotoxicity, proliferation, changes in
      chromatin state, and telomere stability. These observations point to the nuclear 
      periphery as a central regulator of the aging phenotype.

AB  - Primary cilia, which are essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis,
      are extensions of the mother centriole, but the mechanisms that remodel the
      centriole to promote cilia initiation are poorly understood. Here we show that
      mouse embryos that lack the small guanosine triphosphatase RSG1 die at embryonic 
      day 12.5, with developmental abnormalities characteristic of decreased
      cilia-dependent Hedgehog signaling. Rsg1 mutant embryos have fewer primary cilia 
      than wild-type embryos, but the cilia that form are of normal length and traffic 
      Hedgehog pathway proteins within the cilium correctly. Rsg1 mother centrioles
      recruit proteins required for cilia initiation and dock onto ciliary vesicles,
      but axonemal microtubules fail to elongate normally. RSG1 localizes to the mother
      centriole in a process that depends on tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2), the CPLANE
      complex protein Inturned (INTU), and its own GTPase activity. The data suggest a 
      specific role for RSG1 in the final maturation of the mother centriole and
      ciliary vesicle that allows extension of the ciliary axoneme.

PG  - 3917-3929
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201709172 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria participate in essential processes in the nervous system such as
      energy and intermediate metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis. Major
      neurodegenerative diseases are characterized pathologically by accumulation of
      misfolded proteins as a result of gene mutations or abnormal protein homeostasis.
      Misfolded proteins associate with mitochondria, forming oligomeric and fibrillary
      aggregates. As mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly of the oxidative
      phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), occurs in neurodegeneration, it is postulated
      that such defects are caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. However, 
      this hypothesis and the pathological role of proteinopathies in mitochondria
      remain elusive. In this study, we critically review the proposed mechanisms
      whereby exemplary misfolded proteins associate with mitochondria and their
      consequences on OXPHOS.

TI  - Receptor-mediated Drp1 oligomerization on endoplasmic reticulum.
PG  - 4123-4139
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610057 [doi]
AB  - Drp1 is a dynamin guanosine triphosphatase important for mitochondrial and
      peroxisomal division. Drp1 oligomerization and mitochondrial recruitment are
      regulated by multiple factors, including interaction with mitochondrial receptors
      such as Mff, MiD49, MiD51, and Fis. In addition, both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      and actin filaments play positive roles in mitochondrial division, but mechanisms
      for their roles are poorly defined. Here, we find that a population of Drp1
      oligomers is associated with ER in mammalian cells and is distinct from
      mitochondrial or peroxisomal Drp1 populations. Subpopulations of Mff and Fis1,
      which are tail-anchored proteins, also localize to ER. Drp1 oligomers assemble on
      ER, from which they can transfer to mitochondria. Suppression of Mff or
      inhibition of actin polymerization through the formin INF2 significantly reduces 
      all Drp1 oligomer populations (mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and ER bound) and
      mitochondrial division, whereas Mff targeting to ER has a stimulatory effect on
      division. Our results suggest that ER can function as a platform for Drp1
      oligomerization, and that ER-associated Drp1 contributes to mitochondrial
      division.

TI  - ROS and glutathionylation balance cytoskeletal dynamics in neutrophil
      extracellular trap formation.
PG  - 4073-4090
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611168 [doi]
AB  - The antimicrobial defense activity of neutrophils partly depends on their ability
      to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), but the underlying mechanism
      controlling NET formation remains unclear. We demonstrate that inhibiting
      cytoskeletal dynamics with pharmacological agents or by genetic manipulation
      prevents the degranulation of neutrophils and mitochondrial DNA release required 
      for NET formation. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-deficient neutrophils are
      unable to polymerize actin and exhibit a block in both degranulation and DNA
      release. Similarly, neutrophils with a genetic defect in NADPH oxidase fail to
      induce either actin and tubulin polymerization or NET formation on activation.
      Moreover, neutrophils deficient in glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), an enzyme required for 
      deglutathionylation of actin and tubulin, are unable to polymerize either
      cytoskeletal network and fail to degranulate or release DNA. Collectively,
      cytoskeletal dynamics are achieved as a balance between reactive oxygen
      species-regulated effects on polymerization and glutathionylation on the one hand
      and the Grx1-mediated deglutathionylation that is required for NET formation on
      the other.

TI  - cTAGE5 deletion in pancreatic beta cells impairs proinsulin trafficking and
      insulin biogenesis in mice.
PG  - 4153-4164
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705027 [doi]
AB  - Proinsulin is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in pancreatic beta
      cells and transported to the Golgi apparatus for proper processing and secretion 
      into plasma. Defects in insulin biogenesis may cause diabetes. However, the
      underlying mechanisms for proinsulin transport are still not fully understood. We
      show that beta cell-specific deletion of cTAGE5, also known as Mea6, leads to
      increased ER stress, reduced insulin biogenesis in the pancreas, and severe
      glucose intolerance in mice. We reveal that cTAGE5/MEA6 interacts with vesicle
      membrane soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor
      Sec22b. Sec22b and its interaction with cTAGE5/MEA6 are essential for proinsulin 
      processing. cTAGE5/MEA6 may coordinate with Sec22b to control the release of
      COPII vesicles from the ER, and thereby the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of
      proinsulin. Importantly, transgenic expression of human cTAGE5/MEA6 in beta cells
      can rescue not only the defect in islet structure, but also dysfunctional insulin
      biogenesis and glucose intolerance on cTAGE5/Mea6 conditional knockout
      background. Together our data provide more insight into the underlying mechanism 
      of the proinsulin trafficking pathway.

TI  - BAG3 directly stabilizes Hexokinase 2 mRNA and promotes aerobic glycolysis in
      pancreatic cancer cells.
PG  - 4091-4105
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701064 [doi]
AB  - Aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known historically as the Warburg effect, is one
      of the hallmarks of cancer cells. In this study, we characterized the role of
      BAG3 in aerobic glycolysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its
      molecular mechanisms. Our data show that aberrant expression of BAG3
      significantly contributes to the reprogramming of glucose metabolism in PDAC
      cells. Mechanistically, BAG3 increased Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression, the first
      key enzyme involved in glycolysis, at the posttranscriptional level. BAG3
      interacted with HK2 mRNA, and the degree of BAG3 expression altered recruitment
      of the RNA-binding proteins Roquin and IMP3 to the HK2 mRNA. BAG3 knockdown
      destabilized HK2 mRNA via promotion of Roquin recruitment, whereas BAG3
      overexpression stabilized HK2 mRNA via promotion of IMP3 recruitment.
      Collectively, our results show that BAG3 promotes reprogramming of glucose
      metabolism via interaction with HK2 mRNA in PDAC cells, suggesting that BAG3 may 
      be a potential target in the aerobic glycolysis pathway for developing novel
      anticancer agents.

      triphosphate (GTP) in untransformed and transformed cell lines and determine this
      phenomenon depends on the RTKs activating the AKT serine/threonine kinase. The
      increased RhoA-GTP results from AKT phosphorylating three serines (S298, S329,
      and S567) in the DLC1 tumor suppressor, a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) 
      associated with focal adhesions. Phosphorylation of the serines, located
      N-terminal to the DLC1 RhoGAP domain, induces strong binding of that N-terminal
      region to the RhoGAP domain, converting DLC1 from an open, active dimer to a
      closed, inactive monomer. That binding, which interferes with the interaction of 
      RhoA-GTP with the RhoGAP domain, reduces the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, the binding 
      of other DLC1 ligands, and the colocalization of DLC1 with focal adhesions and
      attenuates tumor suppressor activity. DLC1 is a critical AKT target in
      DLC1-positive cancer because AKT inhibition has potent antitumor activity in the 
      DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and in a DLC1-positive cancer cell line but
      not in an isogenic DLC1-negative cell line.

AB  - Axon loss and neurodegeneration constitute clinically debilitating sequelae in
      demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, but the underlying mechanisms 
      of secondary degeneration are not well understood. Myelinating glia play a
      fundamental role in promoting the maturation of the axon cytoskeleton, regulating
      axon trafficking parameters, and imposing architectural rearrangements such as
      the nodes of Ranvier and their associated molecular domains. In the setting of
      demyelination, these changes may be reversed or persist as maladaptive features, 
      leading to axon degeneration. In this review, we consider recent insights into
      axon-glial interactions during development and disease to propose that disruption
      of the cytoskeleton, nodal architecture, and other components of axon
      infrastructure is a potential mediator of pathophysiological damage after
      demyelination.

TI  - How to rewire the host cell: A home improvement guide for intracellular bacteria.
PG  - 3931-3948
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701095 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular bacterial pathogens have developed versatile strategies to generate
      niches inside the eukaryotic cells that allow them to survive and proliferate.
      Making a home inside the host offers many advantages; however, intracellular
      bacteria must also overcome many challenges, such as disarming innate immune
      signaling and accessing host nutrient supplies. Gaining entry into the cell and
      avoiding degradation is only the beginning of a successful intracellular
      lifestyle. To establish these replicative niches, intracellular pathogens secrete
      various virulence proteins, called effectors, to manipulate host cell signaling
      pathways and subvert host defense mechanisms. Many effectors mimic host enzymes, 
      whereas others perform entirely novel enzymatic functions. A large volume of work
      has been done to understand how intracellular bacteria manipulate membrane
      trafficking pathways. In this review, we focus on how intracellular bacterial
      pathogens target innate immune signaling, the unfolded protein response,
      autophagy, and cellular metabolism and exploit these pathways to their advantage.
      We also discuss how bacterial pathogens can alter host gene expression by
      directly modifying histones or hijacking the ubiquitination machinery to take
      control of several host signaling pathways.

PG  - 4313-4330
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704157 [doi]
AB  - Throughout life, stem cells in the ventricular-subventricular zone generate
      neuroblasts that migrate via the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory 
      bulb, where they differentiate into local interneurons. Although progress has
      been made toward identifying extracellular factors that guide the migration of
      these cells, little is known about the intracellular mechanisms that govern the
      dynamic reshaping of the neuroblasts' morphology required for their migration
      along the RMS. In this study, we identify DOCK7, a member of the DOCK180-family, 
      as a molecule essential for tangential neuroblast migration in the postnatal
      mouse forebrain. DOCK7 regulates the migration of these cells by controlling both
      leading process (LP) extension and somal translocation via distinct pathways. It 
      controls LP stability/growth via a Rac-dependent pathway, likely by modulating
      microtubule networks while also regulating F-actin remodeling at the cell rear to
      promote somal translocation via a previously unrecognized myosin
      phosphatase-RhoA-interacting protein-dependent pathway. The coordinated action of
      both pathways is required to ensure efficient neuroblast migration along the RMS.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701108 [doi]
AB  - Many intracellular pathogens subvert host membrane trafficking pathways to
      promote their replication. Toxoplasma multiplies in a membrane-bound
      parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that interacts with mammalian host organelles and
      intercepts Golgi Rab vesicles to acquire sphingolipids. The mechanisms of host
      vesicle internalization and processing within the PV remain undefined. We
      demonstrate that Toxoplasma sequesters a broad range of Rab vesicles into the PV.
      Correlative light and electron microscopy analysis of infected cells illustrates 
      that intravacuolar Rab1A vesicles are surrounded by the PV membrane, suggesting a
      phagocytic-like process for vesicle engulfment. Rab11A vesicles concentrate to an
      intravacuolar network (IVN), but this is reduced in Deltagra2 and
      Deltagra2Deltagra6 parasites, suggesting that tubules stabilized by the TgGRA2
      and TgGRA6 proteins secreted by the parasite within the PV contribute to host
      vesicle sequestration. Overexpression of a phospholipase TgLCAT, which is
      localized to the IVN, results in a decrease in the number of intravacuolar
      GFP-Rab11A vesicles, suggesting that TgLCAT controls lipolytic degradation of Rab
      vesicles for cargo release.

      cell-cell fusion.
PG  - 3971-3980
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703169 [doi]
AB  - Cell fusion is ubiquitous in eukaryotic fertilization and development. The highly
      conserved Rho-GTPase Cdc42p promotes yeast fusion through interaction with Fus2p,
      a pheromone-induced amphiphysin-like protein. We show that in prezygotes, Cdc42p 
      forms a novel Fus2p-dependent focus at the center of the zone of cell fusion
      (ZCF) and remains associated with remnant cell walls after initial fusion. At the
      ZCF and during fusion, Cdc42p and Fus2p colocalized. In contrast, in shmoos, both
      proteins were near the cortex but spatially separate. Cdc42p focus formation
      depends on ZCF membrane curvature: mutant analysis showed that Cdc42p
      localization is negatively affected by shmoo-like positive ZCF curvature,
      consistent with the flattening of the ZCF during fusion. BAR-domain proteins such
      as the fusion proteins Fus2p and Rvs161p are known to recognize membrane
      curvature. We find that mutations that disrupt binding of the Fus2p/Rvs161p
      heterodimer to membranes affect Cdc42p ZCF localization. We propose that Fus2p
      localizes Cdc42p to the flat ZCF to promote cell wall degradation.

TI  - Rac3 regulates breast cancer invasion and metastasis by controlling adhesion and 
      matrix degradation.
PG  - 4331-4349
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704048 [doi]
AB  - The initial step of metastasis is the local invasion of tumor cells into the
      surrounding tissue. Invadopodia are actin-based protrusions that mediate the
      matrix degradation necessary for invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. We
      demonstrate that Rac3 GTPase is critical for integrating the adhesion of
      invadopodia to the extracellular matrix (ECM) with their ability to degrade the
      ECM in breast tumor cells. We identify two pathways at invadopodia important for 
      integrin activation and delivery of matrix metalloproteinases: through the
      upstream recruiter CIB1 as well as the downstream effector GIT1. Rac3 activity,
      at and surrounding invadopodia, is controlled by Vav2 and betaPIX. These guanine 
      nucleotide exchange factors regulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rac3
      activity, impacting GIT1 localization. Moreover, the GTPase-activating function
      of GIT1 toward the vesicular trafficking regulator Arf6 GTPase is required for
      matrix degradation. Importantly, Rac3 regulates the ability of tumor cells to
      metastasize in vivo. The Rac3-dependent mechanisms we show in this study are
      critical for balancing proteolytic activity and adhesive activity to achieve a
      maximally invasive phenotype.

TI  - Type I interferon enhances necroptosis of Salmonella Typhimurium-infected
      macrophages by impairing antioxidative stress responses.
PG  - 4107-4121
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701107 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium exploits the host's type I interferon
      (IFN-I) response to induce receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase-mediated
      necroptosis in macrophages. However, the events that drive necroptosis execution 
      downstream of IFN-I and RIP signaling remain elusive. In this study, we
      demonstrate that S Typhimurium infection causes IFN-I-mediated up-regulation of
      the mitochondrial phosphatase Pgam5 through RIP3. Pgam5 subsequently interacts
      with Nrf2, which sequesters Nrf2 in the cytosol, thereby repressing the
      transcription of Nrf2-dependent antioxidative genes. The impaired ability to
      respond to S Typhimurium-induced oxidative stress results in reactive oxygen
      species-mediated mitochondrial damage, energy depletion, transient induction of
      autophagy, and autophagic degradation of p62. Reduced p62 levels impair
      interaction of p62 with Keap1, which further decreases Nrf2 function and
      antioxidative responses to S Typhimurium infection, eventually leading to cell
      death. Collectively, we identify impaired Nrf2-dependent redox homeostasis as an 
      important mechanism that promotes cell death downstream of IFN-I and RIP3
      signaling in S Typhimurium-infected macrophages.

PG  - 4053-4072
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703107 [doi]
AB  - Contractile actomyosin bundles, stress fibers, are crucial for adhesion,
      morphogenesis, and mechanosensing in nonmuscle cells. However, the mechanisms by 
      which nonmuscle myosin II (NM-II) is recruited to those structures and assembled 
      into functional bipolar filaments have remained elusive. We report that UNC-45a
      is a dynamic component of actin stress fibers and functions as a myosin chaperone
      in vivo. UNC-45a knockout cells display severe defects in stress fiber assembly
      and consequent abnormalities in cell morphogenesis, polarity, and migration.
      Experiments combining structured-illumination microscopy, gradient
      centrifugation, and proteasome inhibition approaches revealed that a large
      fraction of NM-II and myosin-1c molecules fail to fold in the absence of UNC-45a.
      The remaining properly folded NM-II molecules display defects in forming
      functional bipolar filaments. The C-terminal UNC-45/Cro1/She4p domain of UNC-45a 
      is critical for NM-II folding, whereas the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat
      domain contributes to the assembly of functional stress fibers. Thus, UNC-45a
      promotes generation of contractile actomyosin bundles through synchronized NM-II 
      folding and filament-assembly activities.

AB  - Rho GTPase-based signaling networks control cellular dynamics by coordinating
      protrusions and retractions in space and time. Here, we reveal a signaling
      network that generates pulses and propagating waves of cell contractions. These
      dynamic patterns emerge via self-organization from an activator-inhibitor
      network, in which the small GTPase Rho amplifies its activity by recruiting its
      activator, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1. Rho also inhibits
      itself by local recruitment of actomyosin and the associated RhoGAP Myo9b. This
      network structure enables spontaneous, self-limiting patterns of subcellular
      contractility that can explore mechanical cues in the extracellular environment. 
      Indeed, actomyosin pulse frequency in cells is altered by matrix elasticity,
      showing that coupling of contractility pulses to environmental deformations
      modulates network dynamics. Thus, our study reveals a mechanism that integrates
      intracellular biochemical and extracellular mechanical signals into subcellular
      activity patterns to control cellular contractility dynamics.

TI  - SUMOylation of human septins is critical for septin filament bundling and
      cytokinesis.
PG  - 4041-4052
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703096 [doi]
AB  - Septins are cytoskeletal proteins that assemble into nonpolar filaments. They are
      critical in diverse cellular functions, acting as scaffolds for protein
      recruitment and as diffusion barriers for subcellular compartmentalization. Human
      septins are encoded by 13 different genes and are classified into four groups
      based on sequence homology (SEPT2, SEPT3, SEPT6, and SEPT7 groups). In yeast,
      septins were among the first proteins reported to be modified by SUMOylation, a
      ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification. However, whether human septins
      could be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) and what roles this
      modification may have in septin function remains unknown. In this study, we first
      show that septins from all four human septin groups can be covalently modified by
      SUMOs. We show in particular that endogenous SEPT7 is constitutively SUMOylated
      during the cell cycle. We then map SUMOylation sites to the C-terminal domain of 
      septins belonging to the SEPT6 and SEPT7 groups and to the N-terminal domain of
      septins from the SEPT3 group. We finally demonstrate that expression of
      non-SUMOylatable septin variants from the SEPT6 and SEPT7 groups leads to
      aberrant septin bundle formation and defects in cytokinesis after furrow
      ingression. Altogether, our results demonstrate a pivotal role for SUMOylation in
      septin filament bundling and cell division.

      ICMT.
PG  - 4165-4182
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701053 [doi]
AB  - Isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) methylesterifies C-terminal
      prenylcysteine residues of CaaX proteins and some RAB GTPases. Deficiency of
      either ICMT or NOTCH1 accelerates pancreatic neoplasia in Pdx1-Cre;LSL-Kras(G12D)
      mice, suggesting that ICMT is required for NOTCH signaling. We used Drosophila
      melanogaster wing vein and scutellar bristle development to screen Rab proteins
      predicted to be substrates for ICMT (ste14 in flies). We identified Rab7 and Rab8
      as ICMT substrates that when silenced phenocopy ste14 deficiency. ICMT, RAB7, and
      RAB8 were all required for efficient NOTCH1 signaling in mammalian cells.
      Overexpression of RAB8 rescued NOTCH activation after ICMT knockdown both in U2OS
      cells expressing NOTCH1 and in fly wing vein development. ICMT deficiency induced
      mislocalization of GFP-RAB7 and GFP-RAB8 from endomembrane to cytosol, enhanced
      binding to RABGDI, and decreased GTP loading of RAB7 and RAB8. Deficiency of
      ICMT, RAB7, or RAB8 led to mislocalization and diminished processing of
      NOTCH1-GFP. Thus, NOTCH signaling requires ICMT in part because it requires
      methylated RAB7 and RAB8.

PG  - 3991-4005
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703168 [doi]
AB  - Sgs1, the orthologue of human Bloom's syndrome helicase BLM, is a yeast DNA
      helicase functioning in DNA replication and repair. We show that SGS1 loss
      increases R-loop accumulation and sensitizes cells to transcription-replication
      collisions. Yeast lacking SGS1 accumulate R-loops and gamma-H2A at sites of Sgs1 
      binding, replication pausing regions, and long genes. The mutation signature of
      sgs1Delta reveals copy number changes flanked by repetitive regions with high
      R-loop-forming potential. Analysis of BLM in Bloom's syndrome fibroblasts or by
      depletion of BLM from human cancer cells confirms a role for Sgs1/BLM in
      suppressing R-loop-associated genome instability across species. In support of a 
      potential direct effect, BLM is found physically proximal to DNA:RNA hybrids in
      human cells, and can efficiently unwind R-loops in vitro. Together, our data
      describe a conserved role for Sgs1/BLM in R-loop suppression and support an
      increasingly broad view of DNA repair and replication fork stabilizing proteins
      as modulators of R-loop-mediated genome instability.

TI  - PtdIns3P controls mTORC1 signaling through lysosomal positioning.
PG  - 4217-4233
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611073 [doi]
AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a protein kinase
      complex that localizes to lysosomes to up-regulate anabolic processes and
      down-regulate autophagy. Although mTORC1 is known to be activated by lysosome
      positioning and by amino acid-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol
      3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) by the lipid kinase VPS34/PIK3C3, the mechanisms have been
      elusive. Here we present results that connect these seemingly unrelated pathways 
      for mTORC1 activation. Amino acids stimulate recruitment of the PtdIns3P-binding 
      protein FYCO1 to lysosomes and promote contacts between FYCO1 lysosomes and
      endoplasmic reticulum that contain the PtdIns3P effector Protrudin. Upon
      overexpression of Protrudin and FYCO1, mTORC1-positive lysosomes translocate to
      the cell periphery, thereby facilitating mTORC1 activation. This requires the
      ability of Protrudin to bind PtdIns3P. Conversely, upon VPS34 inhibition, or
      depletion of Protrudin or FYCO1, mTORC1-positive lysosomes cluster perinuclearly,
      accompanied by reduced mTORC1 activity under nutrient-rich conditions.
      Consequently, the transcription factor EB enters the nucleus, and autophagy is
      up-regulated. We conclude that PtdIns3P-dependent lysosome translocation to the
      cell periphery promotes mTORC1 activation.

TI  - Fanconi anemia FANCD2 and FANCI proteins regulate the nuclear dynamics of
      splicing factors.
PG  - 4007-4026
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702136 [doi]
AB  - Proteins disabled in the cancer-prone disorder Fanconi anemia (FA) ensure the
      maintenance of chromosomal stability during DNA replication. FA proteins regulate
      replication dynamics, coordinate replication-coupled repair of interstrand DNA
      cross-links, and mitigate conflicts between replication and transcription. Here
      we show that FANCI and FANCD2 associate with splicing factor 3B1 (SF3B1), a key
      spliceosomal protein of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2 snRNP). FANCI 
      is in close proximity to SF3B1 in the nucleoplasm of interphase and mitotic
      cells. Furthermore, we find that DNA replication stress induces the release of
      SF3B1 from nuclear speckles in a manner that depends on FANCI and on the activity
      of the checkpoint kinase ATR. In chromatin, both FANCD2 and FANCI associate with 
      SF3B1, prevent accumulation of postcatalytic intron lariats, and contribute to
      the timely eviction of splicing factors. We propose that FANCD2 and FANCI
      contribute to the organization of functional domains in chromatin, ensuring the
      coordination of DNA replication and cotranscriptional processes.

      neogenesis.
PG  - 4299-4311
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704044 [doi]
AB  - The recent demonstration that pancreatic alpha cells can be continuously
      regenerated and converted into beta-like cells upon ectopic expression of Pax4
      opened new avenues of research in the endocrine cell differentiation and diabetes
      fields. To determine whether such plasticity was also shared by delta cells, we
      generated and characterized transgenic animals that express Pax4 specifically in 
      somatostatin-expressing cells. We demonstrate that the ectopic expression of Pax4
      in delta cells is sufficient to induce their conversion into functional beta-like
      cells. Importantly, this conversion induces compensatory mechanisms involving the
      reactivation of endocrine developmental processes that result in dramatic
      beta-like cell hyperplasia. Importantly, these beta-like cells are functional and
      can partly reverse the consequences of chemically induced diabetes.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) self-organize into apicobasally polarized
      cysts, reminiscent of the lumenal epiblast stage, providing a model to explore
      key morphogenic processes in early human embryos. Here, we show that apical
      polarization begins on the interior of single hPSCs through the dynamic formation
      of a highly organized perinuclear apicosome structure. The membrane surrounding
      the apicosome is enriched in apical markers and displays microvilli and a primary
      cilium; its lumenal space is rich in Ca(2+) Time-lapse imaging of isolated hPSCs 
      reveals that the apicosome forms de novo in interphase, retains its structure
      during mitosis, is asymmetrically inherited after mitosis, and relocates to the
      recently formed cytokinetic plane, where it establishes a fully polarized lumen. 
      In a multicellular aggregate of hPSCs, intracellular apicosomes from multiple
      cells are trafficked to generate a common lumenal cavity. Thus, the apicosome is 
      a unique preassembled apical structure that can be rapidly used in single or
      clustered hPSCs to initiate self-organized apical polarization and lumenogenesis.

AB  - Lysosomes play key roles in the cellular response to amino acid availability.
      Depletion of amino acids from the medium turns off a signaling pathway involving 
      the Ragulator complex and the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), causing
      release of the inactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
      serine/threonine kinase from the lysosomal membrane. Decreased phosphorylation of
      mTORC1 substrates inhibits protein synthesis while activating autophagy. Amino
      acid depletion also causes clustering of lysosomes in the juxtanuclear area of
      the cell, but the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly
      understood. Herein we show that Ragulator directly interacts with BLOC-1-related 
      complex (BORC), a multi-subunit complex previously found to promote lysosome
      dispersal through coupling to the small GTPase Arl8 and the kinesins KIF1B and
      KIF5B. Interaction with Ragulator exerts a negative regulatory effect on BORC
      that is independent of mTORC1 activity. Amino acid depletion strengthens this
      interaction, explaining the redistribution of lysosomes to the juxtanuclear area.
      These findings thus demonstrate that amino acid availability controls lysosome
      positioning through Ragulator-dependent, but mTORC1-independent, modulation of
      BORC.

AB  - Signaling from lysosomes controls cellular clearance and energy metabolism.
      Lysosomal malfunction has been implicated in several pathologies, including
      neurodegeneration, cancer, infection, immunodeficiency, and obesity.
      Interestingly, many functions are dependent on the organelle position. Lysosomal 
      motility requires the integration of extracellular and intracellular signals that
      converge on a competition between motor proteins that ultimately control
      lysosomal movement on microtubules. Here, we identify a novel upstream control
      mechanism of Arl8b-dependent lysosomal movement toward the periphery of the cell.
      We show that the C-terminal domain of lyspersin, a subunit of BLOC-1-related
      complex (BORC), is essential and sufficient for BORC-dependent recruitment of
      Arl8b to lysosomes. In addition, we establish lyspersin as the linker between
      BORC and late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and mitogen activated protein kinase
      and mechanistic target of rapamycin activator (LAMTOR) complexes and show that
      epidermal growth factor stimulation decreases LAMTOR/BORC association, thereby
      promoting BORC- and Arl8b-dependent lysosomal centrifugal transport.

AB  - Biosynthetic sorting of newly synthesized transmembrane cargos to endosomes and
      lysosomes is thought to occur at the TGN through recognition of sorting signals
      in the cytosolic tails of the cargos by adaptor proteins, leading to cargo
      packaging into coated vesicles destined for the endolysosomal system. Here we
      present evidence for a different mechanism in which two sets of endolysosomal
      proteins undergo early segregation to distinct domains of the Golgi complex by
      virtue of the proteins' luminal and transmembrane domains. Proteins in one Golgi 
      domain exit into predominantly vesicular carriers by interaction of sorting
      signals with adaptor proteins, but proteins in the other domain exit into
      predominantly tubular carriers shared with plasma membrane proteins,
      independently of signal-adaptor interactions. These findings demonstrate that
      sorting of endolysosomal proteins begins at an earlier stage and involves
      mechanisms that partly differ from those described by classical models.

AB  - The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents chromosome missegregation by
      coupling anaphase onset with correct chromosome attachment and tension to
      microtubules. It does this by generating a diffusible signal from free
      kinetochores into the cytoplasm, inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (APC).
      The volume in which this signal remains effective is unknown. This raises the
      possibility that cell volume may be the reason the SAC is weak, and chromosome
      segregation error-prone, in mammalian oocytes. Here, by a process of serial
      bisection, we analyzed the influence of oocyte volume on the ability of the SAC
      to inhibit bivalent segregation in meiosis I. We were able to generate oocytes
      with cytoplasmic volumes reduced by 86% and observed changes in APC activity
      consistent with increased SAC control. However, bivalent biorientation remained
      uncoupled from APC activity, leading to error-prone chromosome segregation. We
      conclude that volume is one factor contributing to SAC weakness in oocytes.
      However, additional factors likely uncouple chromosome biorientation with APC
      activity.

      genotoxic stress.
PG  - 4027-4040
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612018 [doi]
AB  - Upon genotoxic stress, dynamic relocalization events control DNA repair as well
      as alterations of the transcriptome and proteome, enabling stress recovery. How
      these events may influence one another is only partly known. Beginning with a
      cytological screen of genome stability proteins, we find that the splicing factor
      Hsh155 disassembles from its partners and localizes to both intranuclear and
      cytoplasmic protein quality control (PQC) aggregates under alkylation stress.
      Aggregate sequestration of Hsh155 occurs at nuclear and then cytoplasmic sites in
      a manner that is regulated by molecular chaperones and requires TORC1 activity
      signaling through the Sfp1 transcription factor. This dynamic behavior is
      associated with intron retention in ribosomal protein gene transcripts, a
      decrease in splicing efficiency, and more rapid recovery from stress.
      Collectively, our analyses suggest a model in which some proteins evicted from
      chromatin and undergoing transcriptional remodeling during stress are targeted to
      PQC sites to influence gene expression changes and facilitate stress recovery.

TI  - The alpha6beta4 integrin promotes resistance to ferroptosis.
PG  - 4287-4297
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701136 [doi]
AB  - Increases in lipid peroxidation can cause ferroptosis, a form of cell death
      triggered by inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which catalyzes the
      reduction of lipid peroxides and is a target of ferroptosis inducers, such as
      erastin. The alpha6beta4 integrin protects adherent epithelial and carcinoma
      cells from ferroptosis induced by erastin. In addition, extracellular matrix
      (ECM) detachment is a physiologic trigger of ferroptosis, which is evaded by
      alpha6beta4. The mechanism that enables alpha6beta4 to evade ferroptosis involves
      its ability to protect changes in membrane lipids that are proferroptotic.
      Specifically, alpha6beta4-mediated activation of Src and STAT3 suppresses
      expression of ACSL4, an enzyme that enriches membranes with long polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids and is required for ferroptosis. Adherent cells lacking alpha6beta4
      require an inducer, such as erastin, to undergo ferroptosis because they sustain 
      GPX4 expression, despite their increase in ACSL4. In contrast, ECM detachment of 
      cells lacking alpha6beta4 is sufficient to trigger ferroptosis because GPX4 is
      suppressed. This causal link between alpha6beta4 and ferroptosis has implications
      for cancer biology and therapy.

      spatial precision.
PG  - 4351-4365
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702188 [doi]
AB  - Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major route of receptor
      internalization at the plasma membrane. Analysis of constitutive CME is difficult
      because the initiation of endocytic events is unpredictable. When and where a
      clathrin-coated pit will form and what cargo it will contain are difficult to
      foresee. Here we describe a series of genetically encoded reporters that allow
      the initiation of CME on demand. A clathrin-binding protein fragment ("hook") is 
      inducibly attached to an "anchor" protein at the plasma membrane, which triggers 
      the formation of new clathrin-coated vesicles. Our design incorporates temporal
      and spatial control by the use of chemical and optogenetic methods for inducing
      hook-anchor attachment. Moreover, the cargo is defined. Because several steps in 
      vesicle creation are bypassed, we term it "hot-wiring." We use hot-wired
      endocytosis to describe the functional interactions between clathrin and AP2. Two
      distinct sites on the beta2 subunit, one on the hinge and the other on the
      appendage, are necessary and sufficient for functional clathrin engagement.

PG  - 3959-3969
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704145 [doi]
AB  - Like tissues, single cells are subjected to continual stresses and damage. As
      such, cells have a robust wound repair mechanism comprised of dynamic membrane
      resealing and cortical cytoskeletal remodeling. One group of proteins, the Rho
      family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), is critical for this actin
      and myosin cytoskeletal response in which they form distinct dynamic spatial and 
      temporal patterns/arrays surrounding the wound. A key mechanistic question, then,
      is how these GTPase arrays are formed. Here, we show that in the Drosophila
      melanogaster cell wound repair model Rho GTPase arrays form in response to
      prepatterning by Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), a family of
      proteins involved in the activation of small GTPases. Furthermore, we show that
      Annexin B9, a member of a class of proteins associated with the membrane
      resealing, is involved in an early, Rho family-independent, actin stabilization
      that is integral to the formation of one RhoGEF array. Thus, Annexin proteins may
      link membrane resealing to cytoskeletal remodeling processes in single cell wound
      repair.

TI  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote directional cancer cell migration by
      aligning fibronectin.
PG  - 3799-3816
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704053 [doi]
AB  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major components of the carcinoma
      microenvironment that promote tumor progression. However, the mechanisms by which
      CAFs regulate cancer cell migration are poorly understood. In this study, we show
      that fibronectin (Fn) assembled by CAFs mediates CAF-cancer cell association and 
      directional migration. Compared with normal fibroblasts, CAFs produce an Fn-rich 
      extracellular matrix with anisotropic fiber orientation, which guides the cancer 
      cells to migrate directionally. CAFs align the Fn matrix by increasing nonmuscle 
      myosin II- and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha-mediated
      contractility and traction forces, which are transduced to Fn through alpha5beta1
      integrin. We further show that prostate cancer cells use alphav integrin to
      migrate efficiently and directionally on CAF-derived matrices. We demonstrate
      that aligned Fn is a prominent feature of invasion sites in human prostatic and
      pancreatic carcinoma samples. Collectively, we present a new mechanism by which
      CAFs organize the Fn matrix and promote directional cancer cell migration.

TI  - Microtubule stabilization drives 3D centrosome migration to initiate primary
      ciliogenesis.
PG  - 3713-3728
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610039 [doi]
AB  - Primary cilia are sensory organelles located at the cell surface. Their assembly 
      is primed by centrosome migration to the apical surface, yet surprisingly little 
      is known about this initiating step. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving 
      centrosome migration, we exploited the reproducibility of cell architecture on
      adhesive micropatterns to investigate the cytoskeletal remodeling supporting it. 
      Microtubule network densification and bundling, with the transient formation of
      an array of cold-stable microtubules, and actin cytoskeleton asymmetrical
      contraction participate in concert to drive apical centrosome migration. The
      distal appendage protein Cep164 appears to be a key actor involved in the
      cytoskeleton remodeling and centrosome migration, whereas intraflagellar
      transport 88's role seems to be restricted to axoneme elongation. Together, our
      data elucidate the hitherto unexplored mechanism of centrosome migration and show
      that it is driven by the increase and clustering of mechanical forces to push the
      centrosome toward the cell apical pole.

TI  - The fission yeast nucleoporin Alm1 is required for proteasomal degradation of
      kinetochore components.
PG  - 3591-3608
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612194 [doi]
AB  - Kinetochores (KTs) are large multiprotein complexes that constitute the interface
      between centromeric chromatin and the mitotic spindle during chromosome
      segregation. In spite of their essential role, little is known about how
      centromeres and KTs are assembled and how their precise stoichiometry is
      regulated. In this study, we show that the nuclear pore basket component Alm1 is 
      required to maintain both the proteasome and its anchor, Cut8, at the nuclear
      envelope, which in turn regulates proteostasis of certain inner KT components.
      Consistently, alm1-deleted cells show increased levels of KT proteins, including 
      CENP-C(Cnp3), spindle assembly checkpoint activation, and chromosome segregation 
      defects. Our data demonstrate a novel function of the nucleoporin Alm1 in
      proteasome localization required for KT homeostasis.

TI  - TORC1 signaling exerts spatial control over microtubule dynamics by promoting
      nuclear export of Stu2.
PG  - 3471-3484
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606080 [doi]
AB  - The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a highly conserved multiprotein
      complex that functions in many cellular processes, including cell growth and cell
      cycle progression. In this study, we define a novel role for TORC1 as a critical 
      regulator of nuclear microtubule (MT) dynamics in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae This activity requires interactions between EB1 and CLIP-170 plus
      end-tracking protein (+TIP) family members with the TORC1 subunit Kog1/Raptor,
      which in turn allow the TORC1 proximal kinase Sch9/S6K1 to regulate the MT
      polymerase Stu2/XMAP215. Sch9-dependent phosphorylation of Stu2 adjacent to a
      nuclear export signal prevents nuclear accumulation of Stu2 before cells enter
      mitosis. Mutants impaired in +TIP-TORC1 interactions or Stu2 nuclear export show 
      increased nuclear but not cytoplasmic MT length and display nuclear fusion,
      spindle positioning, and elongation kinetics defects. Our results reveal key
      mechanisms by which TORC1 signaling controls Stu2 localization and thereby
      contributes to proper MT cytoskeletal organization in interphase and mitosis.

TI  - Plk4 and Aurora A cooperate in the initiation of acentriolar spindle assembly in 
      mammalian oocytes.
PG  - 3571-3590
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606077 [doi]
AB  - Establishing the bipolar spindle in mammalian oocytes after their prolonged
      arrest is crucial for meiotic fidelity and subsequent development. In contrast to
      somatic cells, the first meiotic spindle assembles in the absence of
      centriole-containing centrosomes. Ran-GTP can promote microtubule nucleation near
      chromatin, but additional unidentified factors are postulated for the activity of
      multiple acentriolar microtubule organizing centers in the oocyte. We now
      demonstrate that partially overlapping, nonredundant functions of Aurora A and
      Plk4 kinases contribute to initiate acentriolar meiosis I spindle formation. Loss
      of microtubule nucleation after simultaneous chemical inhibition of both kinases 
      can be significantly rescued by drug-resistant Aurora A alone. Drug-resistant
      Plk4 can enhance Aurora A-mediated rescue, and, accordingly, Plk4 can
      phosphorylate and potentiate the activity of Aurora A in vitro. Both kinases
      function distinctly from Ran, which amplifies microtubule growth. We conclude
      that Aurora A and Plk4 are rate-limiting factors contributing to microtubule
      growth as the acentriolar oocyte resumes meiosis.

TI  - Postsynaptic adhesion GPCR latrophilin-2 mediates target recognition in
      entorhinal-hippocampal synapse assembly.
PG  - 3831-3846
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703042 [doi]
AB  - Synapse assembly likely requires postsynaptic target recognition by incoming
      presynaptic afferents. Using newly generated conditional knock-in and knockout
      mice, we show in this study that latrophilin-2 (Lphn2), a cell-adhesion G
      protein-coupled receptor and presumptive alpha-latrotoxin receptor, controls the 
      numbers of a specific subset of synapses in CA1-region hippocampal neurons,
      suggesting that Lphn2 acts as a synaptic target-recognition molecule. In cultured
      hippocampal neurons, Lphn2 maintained synapse numbers via a postsynaptic instead 
      of a presynaptic mechanism, which was surprising given its presumptive role as an
      alpha-latrotoxin receptor. In CA1-region neurons in vivo, Lphn2 was specifically 
      targeted to dendritic spines in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, which form
      synapses with presynaptic entorhinal cortex afferents. In this study,
      postsynaptic deletion of Lphn2 selectively decreased spine numbers and impaired
      synaptic inputs from entorhinal but not Schaffer-collateral afferents.
      Behaviorally, loss of Lphn2 from the CA1 region increased spatial memory
      retention but decreased learning of sequential spatial memory tasks. Thus, Lphn2 
      appears to control synapse numbers in the entorhinal cortex/CA1 region circuit by
      acting as a domain-specific postsynaptic target-recognition molecule.

AB  - The integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) is a
      key T cell adhesion receptor that mediates stable interactions with
      antigen-presenting cell (APC), as well as chemokine-mediated migration. Using our
      newly generated CD11a-mYFP knock-in mice, we discovered that naive CD8(+) T cells
      reserve a significant intracellular pool of LFA-1 in the uropod during migration.
      Intracellular LFA-1 quickly translocated to the cell surface with antigenic
      stimulus. Importantly, the redistribution of intracellular LFA-1 at the contact
      with APC was maintained during cell division and led to an unequal inheritance of
      LFA-1 in divided T cells. The daughter CD8(+) T cells with disparate LFA-1
      expression showed different patterns of migration on ICAM-1, APC interactions,
      and tissue retention, as well as altered effector functions. In addition, we
      identified Rab27 as an important regulator of the intracellular LFA-1
      translocation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that an intracellular pool of
      LFA-1 in naive CD8(+) T cells plays a key role in T cell activation and
      differentiation.

TI  - Regulation of mitotic spindle assembly factor NuMA by Importin-beta.
PG  - 3453-3462
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705168 [doi]
AB  - Ran-guanosine triphosphatase orchestrates mitotic spindle assembly by modulation 
      of the interaction between Importin-alpha/-beta and spindle assembly factors
      (SAFs). The inhibition of SAFs performed by importins needs to be done without
      much sequestration from abundant nuclear localization signal (NLS) -containing
      proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms that determine NLS-binding
      selectivity and that inhibit activity of Importin-beta-regulated SAFs (e.g.,
      nuclear mitotic apparatus protein [NuMA]) remain undefined. Here, we present a
      crystal structure of the Importin-alpha-NuMA C terminus complex showing a novel
      binding pattern that accounts for selective NLS recognition. We demonstrate that,
      in the presence of Importin-alpha, Importin-beta inhibits the microtubule-binding
      function of NuMA. Further, we have identified a high-affinity microtubule-binding
      region that lies carboxyl-terminal to the NLS, which is sterically masked by
      Importin-beta on being bound by Importin-alpha. Our study provides mechanistic
      evidence of how Importin-alpha/-beta regulates the NuMA functioning required for 
      assembly of higher-order microtubule structures, further illuminating how
      Ran-governed transport factors regulate diverse SAFs and accommodate various cell
      demands.

AB  - The size of nearly all cells is modulated by nutrients. Thus, cells growing in
      poor nutrients can be nearly half the size of cells in rich nutrients. In budding
      yeast, cell size is thought to be controlled almost entirely by a mechanism that 
      delays cell cycle entry until sufficient growth has occurred in G1 phase. Here,
      we show that most growth of a new daughter cell occurs in mitosis. When the rate 
      of growth is slowed by poor nutrients, the duration of mitosis is increased,
      which suggests that cells compensate for slow growth in mitosis by increasing the
      duration of growth. The amount of growth required to complete mitosis is reduced 
      in poor nutrients, leading to a large reduction in cell size. Together, these
      observations suggest that mechanisms that control the extent of growth in mitosis
      play a major role in cell size control in budding yeast.

TI  - Structural plasticity of the living kinetochore.
PG  - 3551-3570
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703152 [doi]
AB  - The kinetochore is a large, evolutionarily conserved protein structure that
      connects chromosomes with microtubules. During chromosome segregation, outer
      kinetochore components track depolymerizing ends of microtubules to facilitate
      the separation of chromosomes into two cells. In budding yeast, each chromosome
      has a point centromere upon which a single kinetochore is built, which attaches
      to a single microtubule. This defined architecture facilitates quantitative
      examination of kinetochores during the cell cycle. Using three independent
      measures-calibrated imaging, FRAP, and photoconversion-we find that the Dam1
      submodule is unchanged during anaphase, whereas MIND and Ndc80 submodules add
      copies to form an "anaphase configuration" kinetochore. Microtubule
      depolymerization and kinesin-related motors contribute to copy addition.
      Mathematical simulations indicate that the addition of microtubule attachments
      could facilitate tracking during rapid microtubule depolymerization. We speculate
      that the minimal kinetochore configuration, which exists from G1 through
      metaphase, allows for correction of misattachments. Our study provides insight
      into dynamics and plasticity of the kinetochore structure during chromosome
      segregation in living cells.

PG  - 3695-3712
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703015 [doi]
AB  - Endosomal recycling of transmembrane proteins requires sequence-dependent
      recognition of motifs present within their intracellular cytosolic domains. In
      this study, we have reexamined the role of retromer in the sequence-dependent
      endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) transport of the cation-independent mannose
      6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Although the knockdown or knockout of retromer
      does not perturb CI-MPR transport, the targeting of the retromer-linked sorting
      nexin (SNX)-Bin, Amphiphysin, and Rvs (BAR) proteins leads to a pronounced defect
      in CI-MPR endosome-to-TGN transport. The retromer-linked SNX-BAR proteins
      comprise heterodimeric combinations of SNX1 or SNX2 with SNX5 or SNX6 and serve
      to regulate the biogenesis of tubular endosomal sorting profiles. We establish
      that SNX5 and SNX6 associate with the CI-MPR through recognition of a specific
      WLM endosome-to-TGN sorting motif. From validating the CI-MPR dependency of
      SNX1/2-SNX5/6 tubular profile formation, we provide a mechanism for coupling
      sequence-dependent cargo recognition with the biogenesis of tubular profiles
      required for endosome-to-TGN transport. Therefore, the data presented in this
      study reappraise retromer's role in CI-MPR transport.

TI  - Cargo-selective SNX-BAR proteins mediate retromer trimer independent retrograde
      transport.
PG  - 3677-3693
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702137 [doi]
AB  - The retromer complex, which recycles the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate
      receptor (CI-MPR) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), is thought to 
      consist of a cargo-selective VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 trimer and a membrane-deforming
      subunit of sorting nexin (SNX)-Bin, Amphyphysin, and Rvs (BAR; SNX-BAR) proteins.
      In this study, we demonstrate that heterodimers of the SNX-BAR proteins, SNX1,
      SNX2, SNX5, and SNX6, are the cargo-selective elements that mediate the
      retrograde transport of CI-MPR from endosomes to the TGN independently of the
      core retromer trimer. Using quantitative proteomics, we also identify the IGF1R, 
      among more potential cargo, as another SNX5 and SNX6 binding receptor that
      recycles through SNX-BAR heterodimers, but not via the retromer trimer, in a
      ligand- and activation-dependent manner. Overall, our data redefine the mechanics
      of retromer-based sorting and call into question whether retromer indeed
      functions as a complex of SNX-BAR proteins and the VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 trimer.

TI  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts lead tumor invasion through
      integrin-beta3-dependent fibronectin assembly.
PG  - 3509-3520
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702033 [doi]
AB  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cells of the tumor
      stroma. Their capacity to contract the matrix and induce invasion of cancer cells
      has been well documented. However, it is not clear whether CAFs remodel the
      matrix by other means, such as degradation, matrix deposition, or stiffening. We 
      now show that CAFs assemble fibronectin (FN) and trigger invasion mainly via
      integrin-alphavbeta3. In the absence of FN, contractility of the matrix by CAFs
      is preserved, but their ability to induce invasion is abrogated. When degradation
      is impaired, CAFs retain the capacity to induce invasion in an FN-dependent
      manner. The level of expression of integrins alphav and beta3 and the amount of
      assembled FN are directly proportional to the invasion induced by fibroblast
      populations. Our results highlight FN assembly and integrin-alphavbeta3
      expression as new hallmarks of CAFs that promote tumor invasion.

TI  - SecA mediates cotranslational targeting and translocation of an inner membrane
      protein.
PG  - 3639-3653
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704036 [doi]
AB  - Protein targeting to the bacterial plasma membrane was generally thought to occur
      via two major pathways: cotranslational targeting by signal recognition particle 
      (SRP) and posttranslational targeting by SecA and SecB. Recently, SecA was found 
      to also bind ribosomes near the nascent polypeptide exit tunnel, but the function
      of this SecA-ribosome contact remains unclear. In this study, we show that SecA
      cotranslationally recognizes the nascent chain of an inner membrane protein,
      RodZ, with high affinity and specificity. In vitro reconstitution and in vivo
      targeting assays show that SecA is necessary and sufficient to direct the
      targeting and translocation of RodZ to the bacterial plasma membrane in an
      obligatorily cotranslational mechanism. Sequence elements upstream and downstream
      of the RodZ transmembrane domain dictate nascent polypeptide selection by SecA
      instead of the SRP machinery. These findings identify a new route for the
      targeting of inner membrane proteins in bacteria and highlight the diversity of
      targeting pathways that enables an organism to accommodate diverse nascent
      proteins.

PG  - 3745-3765
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704061 [doi]
AB  - The conditional use of actin during clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian
      cells suggests that the cell controls whether and how actin is used. Using a
      combination of biochemical reconstitution and mammalian cell culture, we
      elucidate a mechanism by which the coincidence of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3)P in a
      curved vesicle triggers actin polymerization. At clathrin-coated pits, PI(3)P is 
      produced by the INPP4A hydrolysis of PI(3,4)P2, and this is necessary for
      actin-driven endocytosis. Both Cdc42guanosine triphosphate and SNX9 activate
      N-WASP-WIP- and Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation. Membrane curvature, PI(4,5)P2, 
      and PI(3)P signals are needed for SNX9 assembly via its PX-BAR domain, whereas
      signaling through Cdc42 is activated by PI(4,5)P2 alone. INPP4A activity is
      stimulated by high membrane curvature and synergizes with SNX9 BAR domain binding
      in a process we call curvature cascade amplification. We show that the
      SNX9-driven actin comets that arise on human disease-associated oculocerebrorenal
      syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) deficiencies are reduced by inhibiting PI(3)P production,
      suggesting PI(3)P kinase inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy in Lowe syndrome.

TI  - Identification of new channels by systematic analysis of the mitochondrial outer 
      membrane.
PG  - 3485-3495
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706043 [doi]
AB  - The mitochondrial outer membrane is essential for communication between
      mitochondria and the rest of the cell and facilitates the transport of
      metabolites, ions, and proteins. All mitochondrial outer membrane channels known 
      to date are beta-barrel membrane proteins, including the abundant
      voltage-dependent anion channel and the cation-preferring protein-conducting
      channels Tom40, Sam50, and Mdm10. We analyzed outer membrane fractions of yeast
      mitochondria and identified four new channel activities: two anion-preferring
      channels and two cation-preferring channels. We characterized the
      cation-preferring channels at the molecular level. The mitochondrial import
      component Mim1 forms a channel that is predicted to have an alpha-helical
      structure for protein import. The short-chain dehydrogenase-related protein Ayr1 
      forms an NADPH-regulated channel. We conclude that the mitochondrial outer
      membrane contains a considerably larger variety of channel-forming proteins than 
      assumed thus far. These findings challenge the traditional view of the outer
      membrane as an unspecific molecular sieve and indicate a higher degree of
      selectivity and regulation of metabolite fluxes at the mitochondrial boundary.

TI  - BLM helicase regulates DNA repair by counteracting RAD51 loading at DNA
      double-strand break sites.
PG  - 3521-3534
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703144 [doi]
AB  - The BLM gene product, BLM, is a RECQ helicase that is involved in DNA replication
      and repair of DNA double-strand breaks by the homologous recombination (HR)
      pathway. During HR, BLM has both pro- and anti-recombinogenic activities, either 
      of which may contribute to maintenance of genomic integrity. We find that in
      cells expressing a mutant version of BRCA1, an essential HR factor, ablation of
      BLM rescues genomic integrity and cell survival in the presence of DNA
      double-strand breaks. Improved genomic integrity in these cells is linked to a
      substantial increase in the stability of RAD51 at DNA double-strand break sites
      and in the overall efficiency of HR. Ablation of BLM also rescues RAD51 foci and 
      HR in cells lacking BRCA2 or XRCC2. These results indicate that the
      anti-recombinase activity of BLM is of general importance for normal retention of
      RAD51 at DNA break sites and regulation of HR.

TI  - Kindlin-2 recruits paxillin and Arp2/3 to promote membrane protrusions during
      initial cell spreading.
PG  - 3785-3798
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701176 [doi]
AB  - Cell spreading requires the coupling of actin-driven membrane protrusion and
      integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix. The integrin-activating
      adaptor protein kindlin-2 plays a central role for cell adhesion and membrane
      protrusion by directly binding and recruiting paxillin to nascent adhesions.
      Here, we report that kindlin-2 has a dual role during initial cell spreading: it 
      binds paxillin via the pleckstrin homology and F0 domains to activate Rac1, and
      it directly associates with the Arp2/3 complex to induce Rac1-mediated membrane
      protrusions. Consistently, abrogation of kindlin-2 binding to Arp2/3 impairs
      lamellipodia formation and cell spreading. Our findings identify kindlin-2 as a
      key protein that couples cell adhesion by activating integrins and the induction 
      of membrane protrusions by activating Rac1 and supplying Rac1 with the Arp2/3
      complex.

PG  - 3729-3744
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611061 [doi]
AB  - During morphogenesis, adherens junctions (AJs) remodel to allow changes in cell
      shape and position while preserving adhesion. Here, we examine the function of
      Rho guanosine triphosphatase CDC-42 in AJ formation and regulation during
      Caenorhabditis elegans embryo elongation, a process driven by asymmetric
      epidermal cell shape changes. cdc-42 mutant embryos arrest during elongation with
      epidermal ruptures. Unexpectedly, we find using time-lapse fluorescence imaging
      that cdc-42 is not required for epidermal cell polarization or junction assembly,
      but rather is needed for proper junctional actin regulation during elongation. We
      show that the RhoGAP PAC-1/ARHGAP21 inhibits CDC-42 activity at AJs, and loss of 
      PAC-1 or the interacting linker protein PICC-1/CCDC85A-C blocks elongation in
      embryos with compromised AJ function. pac-1 embryos exhibit dynamic accumulations
      of junctional F-actin and an increase in AJ protein levels. Our findings identify
      a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism for inhibiting junctional CDC-42 to
      control actin organization and AJ protein levels during epithelial morphogenesis.

AB  - Control of the dimensions of actin-rich processes like filopodia, lamellipodia,
      microvilli, and stereocilia requires the coordinated activity of many proteins.
      Each of these actin structures relies on heterodimeric capping protein (CAPZ),
      which blocks actin polymerization at barbed ends. Because dimension control of
      the inner ear's stereocilia is particularly precise, we studied the CAPZB subunit
      in hair cells. CAPZB, present at approximately 100 copies per stereocilium,
      concentrated at stereocilia tips as hair cell development progressed, similar to 
      the CAPZB-interacting protein TWF2. We deleted Capzb specifically in hair cells
      using Atoh1-Cre, which eliminated auditory and vestibular function. Capzb-null
      stereocilia initially developed normally but later shortened and disappeared;
      surprisingly, stereocilia width decreased concomitantly with length. CAPZB2
      expressed by in utero electroporation prevented normal elongation of vestibular
      stereocilia and irregularly widened them. Together, these results suggest that
      capping protein participates in stereocilia widening by preventing newly
      elongating actin filaments from depolymerizing.

AB  - A propensity for rewiring genetic and epigenetic regulatory networks, thus
      enabling sustained cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, and the ability 
      to evade the immune system, is vital to cancer cell propagation. An increased
      understanding of how this is achieved is critical for identifying or improving
      therapeutic interventions. In this study, using acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      human cell lines and a custom CRISPR/Cas9 screening platform, we identify the
      H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 as a novel, negative regulator of innate immunity. 
      SETDB1 is overexpressed in many cancers, and loss of this gene in AML cells
      triggers desilencing of retrotransposable elements that leads to the production
      of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). This is coincident with induction of a type I
      interferon response and apoptosis through the dsRNA-sensing pathway.
      Collectively, our findings establish a unique gene regulatory axis that cancer
      cells can exploit to circumvent the immune system.

AB  - Mitotic spindle alignment with the basal or substrate-contacting domain ensures
      that dividing epithelial cells remain in the plane of the monolayer. Spindle
      orientation with respect to the substratum is established in metaphase coincident
      with maximal cell rounding, which enables unobstructed spindle rotation.
      Misaligned metaphase spindles are believed to result in divisions in which one
      daughter loses contact with the basal lamina. Here we describe a rescue mechanism
      that drives substrate-parallel spindle alignment of quasi-diagonal metaphase
      spindles in anaphase. It requires a Rho- and E-cadherin adhesion-dependent,
      substrate-parallel contractile actin belt at the apex that governs anaphase cell 
      flattening. In contrast to monolayered Madin-Darby canine kidney cells,
      hepatocytic epithelial cells, which typically feature tilted metaphase spindles, 
      lack this anaphase flattening mechanism and as a consequence maintain their
      spindle tilt through cytokinesis. This results in out-of-monolayer divisions,
      which we propose contribute to the stratified organization of hepatocyte cords in
      vivo.

AB  - Axon degeneration is an early event and pathological in neurodegenerative
      conditions and nerve injuries. To discover agents that suppress neuronal death
      and axonal degeneration, we performed drug screens on primary rodent neurons and 
      identified the pan-kinase inhibitor foretinib, which potently rescued
      sympathetic, sensory, and motor wt and SOD1 mutant neurons from trophic factor
      withdrawal-induced degeneration. By using primary sympathetic neurons grown in
      mass cultures and Campenot chambers, we show that foretinib protected neurons by 
      suppressing both known degenerative pathways and a new pathway involving
      unliganded TrkA and transcriptional regulation of the proapoptotic BH3 family
      members BimEL, Harakiri,and Puma, culminating in preservation of mitochondria in 
      the degenerative setting. Foretinib delayed chemotherapy-induced and Wallerian
      axonal degeneration in culture by preventing axotomy-induced local energy deficit
      and preserving mitochondria, and peripheral Wallerian degeneration in vivo. These
      findings identify a new axon degeneration pathway and a potentially clinically
      useful therapeutic drug.

TI  - alpha-Catenin homodimers are recruited to phosphoinositide-activated membranes to
      promote adhesion.
PG  - 3767-3783

AB  - A unique feature of alpha-catenin localized outside the cadherin-catenin complex 
      is its capacity to form homodimers, but the subcellular localization and
      functions of this form of alpha-catenin remain incompletely understood. We
      identified a cadherin-free form of alpha-catenin that is recruited to the leading
      edge of migrating cells in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner.
      Surface plasmon resonance analysis shows that alpha-catenin homodimers, but not
      monomers, selectively bind phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-containing
      lipid vesicles with high affinity, where three basic residues, K488, K493, and
      R496, contribute to binding. Chemical-induced dimerization of alpha-catenin
      containing a synthetic dimerization domain promotes its accumulation within
      lamellipodia and elaboration of protrusions with extended filopodia, which are
      attenuated in the alpha-catenin(KKR<3A) mutant. Cells restored with a
      full-length, natively homodimerizing form of alpha-catenin(KKR<3A) display
      reduced membrane recruitment, altered epithelial sheet migrations, and weaker
      cell-cell adhesion compared with WT alpha-catenin. These findings show that
      alpha-catenin homodimers are recruited to phosphoinositide-activated membranes to
      promote adhesion and migration, suggesting that phosphoinositide binding may be a
      defining feature of alpha-catenin function outside the cadherin-catenin complex.

TI  - Karyopherins regulate nuclear pore complex barrier and transport function.
PG  - 3609-3624
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702092 [doi]
AB  - Nucleocytoplasmic transport is sustained by karyopherins (Kaps) and a Ran
      guanosine triphosphate (RanGTP) gradient that imports nuclear localization signal
      (NLS)-specific cargoes (NLS-cargoes) into the nucleus. However, how nuclear pore 
      complex (NPC) barrier selectivity, Kap traffic, and NLS-cargo release are
      systematically linked and simultaneously regulated remains incoherent. In this
      study, we show that Kapalpha facilitates Kapbeta1 turnover and occupancy at the
      NPC in a RanGTP-dependent manner that is directly coupled to NLS-cargo release
      and NPC barrier function. This is underpinned by the binding affinity of Kapbeta1
      to phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups), which is comparable with
      RanGTP.Kapbeta1, but stronger for Kapalpha.Kapbeta1. On this basis, RanGTP is
      ineffective at releasing standalone Kapbeta1 from NPCs. Depleting
      Kapalpha.Kapbeta1 by RanGTP further abrogates NPC barrier function, whereas
      adding back Kapbeta1 rescues it while Kapbeta1 turnover softens it. Therefore,
      the FG Nups are necessary but insufficient for NPC barrier function. We conclude 
      that Kaps constitute integral constituents of the NPC whose barrier, transport,
      and cargo release functionalities establish a continuum under a mechanism of
      Kap-centric control.

TI  - DC2 and KCP2 mediate the interaction between the oligosaccharyltransferase and
      the ER translocon.
PG  - 3625-3638
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702159 [doi]
AB  - In metazoan organisms, the STT3A isoform of the oligosaccharyltransferase is
      localized adjacent to the protein translocation channel to catalyze
      co-translational N-linked glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.
      The mechanism responsible for the interaction between the STT3A complex and the
      translocation channel has not been addressed. Using genetically modified human
      cells that are deficient in DC2 or KCP2 proteins, we show that loss of DC2 causes
      a defect in co-translational N-glycosylation of proteins that mimics an
      STT3A(-/-) phenotype. Biochemical analysis showed that DC2 and KCP2 are
      responsible for mediating the interaction between the protein translocation
      channel and the STT3A complex. Importantly, DC2- and KCP2-deficient STT3A
      complexes are stable and enzymatically active. Deletion mutagenesis revealed that
      a conserved motif in the C-terminal tail of DC2 is critical for assembly into the
      STT3A complex, whereas the lumenal loop and the N-terminal cytoplasmic segment
      are necessary for the functional interaction between the STT3A and Sec61
      complexes.

AB  - Mammalian genomes are folded into unique topological structures that undergo
      precise spatiotemporal restructuring during healthy development. Here, we
      highlight recent advances in our understanding of how the genome folds inside the
      3D nucleus and how these folding patterns are miswired during the onset and
      progression of mammalian disease states. We discuss potential mechanisms
      underlying the link among genome misfolding, genome dysregulation, and aberrant
      cellular phenotypes. We also discuss cases in which the endogenous 3D genome
      configurations in healthy cells might be particularly susceptible to mutation or 
      translocation. Together, these data support an emerging model in which genome
      folding and misfolding is critically linked to the onset and progression of a
      broad range of human diseases.

TI  - lncRNA Chronos is an aging-induced inhibitor of muscle hypertrophy.
PG  - 3497-3507
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612100 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle exhibits remarkable plasticity in its ability to modulate its
      mass in response to the physiologic changes associated with functional use,
      systemic disease, and aging. Although a gradual loss of muscle mass normally
      occurs with advancing age, its increasingly rapid progression results in
      sarcopenia in a subset of individuals. The identities of muscle-enriched, long
      noncoding RNAs that regulate this process are unknown. Here, we identify a long
      noncoding RNA, named Chronos, whose expression in muscle is positively regulated 
      with advancing age and negatively regulated during Akt1-mediated growth.
      Inhibition of Chronos induces myofiber hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo, in 
      part, through the epigenetic modulation of Bmp7 signaling.

TI  - Mitochondrial fission facilitates the selective mitophagy of protein aggregates.
PG  - 3231-3247
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612106 [doi]
AB  - Within the mitochondrial matrix, protein aggregation activates the mitochondrial 
      unfolded protein response and PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy to mitigate
      proteotoxicity. We explore how autophagy eliminates protein aggregates from
      within mitochondria and the role of mitochondrial fission in mitophagy. We show
      that PINK1 recruits Parkin onto mitochondrial subdomains after actinonin-induced 
      mitochondrial proteotoxicity and that PINK1 recruits Parkin proximal to focal
      misfolded aggregates of the mitochondrial-localized mutant ornithine
      transcarbamylase (DeltaOTC). Parkin colocalizes on polarized mitochondria
      harboring misfolded proteins in foci with ubiquitin, optineurin, and LC3.
      Although inhibiting Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission suppresses the
      segregation of mitochondrial subdomains containing DeltaOTC, it does not decrease
      the rate of DeltaOTC clearance. Instead, loss of Drp1 enhances the recruitment of
      Parkin to fused mitochondrial networks and the rate of mitophagy as well as
      decreases the selectivity for DeltaOTC during mitophagy. These results are
      consistent with a new model that, instead of promoting mitophagy, fission
      protects healthy mitochondrial domains from elimination by unchecked PINK1-Parkin
      activity.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704015 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (STx1 and STx2) undergo retrograde trafficking to reach the 
      cytosol. Early endosome-to-Golgi transport allows the toxins to evade degradation
      in lysosomes. Targeting this trafficking step has therapeutic promise, but the
      mechanism of trafficking for the more potent toxin STx2 is unclear. To identify
      host factors required for early endosome-to-Golgi trafficking of STx2, we
      performed a viability-based genome-wide siRNA screen in HeLa cells. 564, 535, and
      196 genes were found to be required for toxicity induced by STx1 only, STx2 only,
      and both toxins, respectively. We focused on validating endosome/Golgi-localized 
      hits specific for STx2 and found that depletion of UNC50 blocked early
      endosome-to-Golgi trafficking and induced lysosomal degradation of STx2. UNC50
      acted by recruiting GBF1, an ADP ribosylation factor-guanine nucleotide exchange 
      factor (ARF-GEF), to the Golgi. These results provide new information about STx2 
      trafficking mechanisms and may advance efforts to generate therapeutically viable
      toxin-trafficking inhibitors.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703201 [doi]
AB  - Bicaudal D2 (BICD2) joins dynein with dynactin into a ternary complex (termed
      DDB) capable of processive movement. Point mutations in the BICD2 gene have been 
      identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but how
      these mutations cause disease is unknown. To investigate this question, we have
      developed in vitro motility assays with purified DDB and BICD2's membrane vesicle
      partner, the GTPase Rab6a. Rab6a-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial
      liposomes, released BICD2 from an autoinhibited state and promoted robust
      dynein-dynactin transport. In these assays, BICD2 mutants showed an enhanced
      ability to form motile DDB complexes. Increased retrograde transport by BICD2
      mutants also was observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay. 
      When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, the hyperactive BICD2 mutants
      decreased neurite growth. Our results reveal that dominant mutations in BICD2
      hyperactivate DDB motility and suggest that an imbalance of minus versus plus
      end-directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular
      atrophy.

AB  - Interactions occurring at the nuclear envelope (NE)-chromatin interface influence
      both NE structure and chromatin organization. Insights into the functions of
      NE-chromatin interactions have come from the study of yeast subtelomeric
      chromatin and its association with the NE, including the identification of
      various proteins necessary for tethering subtelomeric chromatin to the NE and the
      silencing of resident genes. Here we show that four of these proteins-the
      silencing factor Sir4, NE-associated Esc1, the SUMO E3 ligase Siz2, and the
      nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein Nup170-physically and functionally interact
      with one another and a subset of NPC components (nucleoporins or Nups).
      Importantly, this group of Nups is largely restricted to members of the inner and
      outer NPC rings, but it lacks numerous others including cytoplasmically and
      nucleoplasmically positioned Nups. We propose that this Sir4-associated Nup
      complex is distinct from holo-NPCs and that it plays a role in subtelomeric
      chromatin organization and NE tethering.

TI  - Cadherin complexes recruit mRNAs and RISC to regulate epithelial cell signaling.
PG  - 3073-3085
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612125 [doi]
AB  - Cumulative evidence demonstrates that most RNAs exhibit specific subcellular
      distribution. However, the mechanisms regulating this phenomenon and its
      functional consequences are still under investigation. Here, we reveal that
      cadherin complexes at the apical zonula adherens (ZA) of epithelial adherens
      junctions recruit the core components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)
      Ago2, GW182, and PABPC1, as well as a set of 522 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and 28
      mature microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), via PLEKHA7. Top canonical pathways
      represented by these mRNAs include Wnt/beta-catenin, TGF-beta, and stem cell
      signaling. We specifically demonstrate the presence and silencing of MYC, JUN,
      and SOX2 mRNAs by miR-24 and miR-200c at the ZA. PLEKHA7 knockdown dissociates
      RISC from the ZA, decreases loading of the ZA-associated mRNAs and miRNAs to
      Ago2, and results in a corresponding increase of MYC, JUN, and SOX2 protein
      expression. The present work reveals a mechanism that directly links junction
      integrity to the silencing of a set of mRNAs that critically affect epithelial
      homeostasis.

      synaptotoxicity.
PG  - 3161-3178
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701045 [doi]
AB  - Oligomeric Amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta) plays a crucial synaptotoxic role in
      Alzheimer's disease, and hyperphosphorylated tau facilitates Abeta toxicity. The 
      link between Abeta and tau, however, remains controversial. In this study, we
      find that in hippocampal neurons, Abeta acutely induces tubulin posttranslational
      modifications (PTMs) and stabilizes dynamic microtubules (MTs) by reducing their 
      catastrophe frequency. Silencing or acute inhibition of the formin mDia1
      suppresses these activities and corrects the synaptotoxicity and deficits of
      axonal transport induced by Abeta. We explored the mechanism of rescue and found 
      that stabilization of dynamic MTs promotes tau-dependent loss of dendritic spines
      and tau hyperphosphorylation. Collectively, these results uncover a novel role
      for mDia1 in Abeta-mediated synaptotoxicity and demonstrate that inhibition of MT
      dynamics and accumulation of PTMs are driving factors for the induction of
      tau-mediated neuronal damage.

PG  - 3219-3229
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610055 [doi]
AB  - Membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria,
      mediated by the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) complex, are critical
      for mitochondrial homeostasis and cell growth. Defects in ERMES can, however, be 
      bypassed by point mutations in the endosomal protein Vps13 or by overexpression
      of the mitochondrial protein Mcp1. How this bypass operates remains unclear. Here
      we show that the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Mcp1 functions in the same 
      pathway as Vps13 by recruiting it to mitochondria and promoting its association
      to vacuole-mitochondria contacts. Our findings support a model in which Mcp1 and 
      Vps13 work as functional effectors of vacuole-mitochondria contact sites, while
      tethering is mediated by other factors, including Vps39. Tethered and
      functionally active vacuole-mitochondria interfaces then compensate for the loss 
      of ERMES-mediated ER-mitochondria contact sites.

TI  - 14-3-3 regulation of Ncd reveals a new mechanism for targeting proteins to the
      spindle in oocytes.
PG  - 3029-3039
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704120 [doi]
AB  - The meiotic spindle is formed without centrosomes in a large volume of oocytes.
      Local activation of crucial spindle proteins around chromosomes is important for 
      formation and maintenance of a bipolar spindle in oocytes. We found that
      phosphodocking 14-3-3 proteins stabilize spindle bipolarity in Drosophila
      melanogaster oocytes. A critical 14-3-3 target is the minus end-directed motor
      Ncd (human HSET; kinesin-14), which has well-documented roles in stabilizing a
      bipolar spindle in oocytes. Phospho docking by 14-3-3 inhibits the microtubule
      binding activity of the nonmotor Ncd tail. Further phosphorylation by Aurora B
      kinase can release Ncd from this inhibitory effect of 14-3-3. As Aurora B
      localizes to chromosomes and spindles, 14-3-3 facilitates specific association of
      Ncd with spindle microtubules by preventing Ncd from binding to nonspindle
      microtubules in oocytes. Therefore, 14-3-3 translates a spatial cue provided by
      Aurora B to target Ncd selectively to the spindle within the large volume of
      oocytes.

TI  - WDR91 is a Rab7 effector required for neuronal development.
PG  - 3307-3321
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705151 [doi]
AB  - Early-to-late endosome conversion, which is essential for delivery of endosomal
      cargoes to lysosomes, requires switching of early endosome-specific Rab5 and
      PtdIns3P to late endosome-specific Rab7 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 In this study, we
      identify the WD40-repeat protein WDR91 as a Rab7 effector that couples Rab
      switching with PtdIns3P down-regulation on endosomes. Loss of WDR91 greatly
      increases endosomal PtdIns3P levels, arresting endosomes at an intermediate stage
      and blocking endosomal-lysosomal trafficking. WDR91 is recruited to endosomes by 
      interacting with active guanosine triphosophate-Rab7 and inhibits Rab7-associated
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In mice, global Wdr91 knockout causes
      neonatal death, whereas brain-specific Wdr91 inactivation impairs brain
      development and causes postnatal death. Mouse neurons lacking Wdr91 accumulate
      giant intermediate endosomes and exhibit reduced neurite length and complexity.
      These phenotypes are rescued by WDR91 but not WDR91 mutants that cannot interact 
      with Rab7. Thus, WDR91 serves as a Rab7 effector that is essential for neuronal
      development by facilitating endosome conversion in the endosome-lysosome pathway.

PG  - 3323-3338
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701034 [doi]
AB  - Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is used to internalize a diverse range of
      cargo proteins from the cell surface, often in response to specific signals. In
      neurons, the rapid endocytosis of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in
      response to NMDA receptor (NMDAR) stimulation causes a reduction in synaptic
      strength and is the central mechanism for long-term depression, which underlies
      certain forms of learning. The mechanisms that link NMDAR activation to CME of
      AMPARs remain elusive. PICK1 is a BAR domain protein required for NMDAR-dependent
      reductions in surface GluA2; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are
      unclear. In this study, we show that PICK1 makes direct, NMDAR-dependent
      interactions with the core endocytic proteins AP2 and dynamin. PICK1-AP2
      interactions are required for clustering AMPARs at endocytic zones in dendrites
      in response to NMDAR stimulation and for consequent AMPAR internalization. We
      further show that PICK1 stimulates dynamin polymerization. We propose that PICK1 
      is a cargo-specific endocytic accessory protein required for efficient,
      activity-dependent AMPAR endocytosis.

PG  - 3263-3274

AB  - Microautophagy refers to a mode of autophagy in which the lysosomal or vacuolar
      membrane invaginates and directly engulfs target components. The molecular
      machinery of membrane dynamics driving microautophagy is still elusive. Using
      immunochemical monitoring of yeast vacuolar transmembrane proteins, Vph1 and
      Pho8, fused to fluorescent proteins, we obtained evidence showing an induction of
      microautophagy after a diauxic shift in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      Components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery were
      found to be required for this process, and the gateway protein of the machinery, 
      Vps27, was observed to change its localization onto the vacuolar membrane after a
      diauxic shift. We revealed the functional importance of Vps27's interaction with 
      clathrin in this microautophagy that also contributed to uptake of lipid droplets
      into the vacuole. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanism of
      microautophagy, which does not require the core Atg proteins.

AB  - The vascular endothelium is critical for induction of appropriate lineage
      differentiation in organogenesis. In this study, we report that dysfunctional
      pulmonary endothelium, resulting from the loss of matrix Gla protein (MGP),
      causes ectopic hepatic differentiation in the pulmonary epithelium. We
      demonstrate uncontrolled induction of the hepatic growth factor (HGF) caused by
      dysregulated cross talk between pulmonary endothelium and epithelium in Mgp-null 
      lungs. Elevated HGF induced hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a), which
      competed with NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1) for binding to forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) to
      drive hepatic differentiation in Mgp-null airway progenitor cells. Limiting
      endothelial HGF reduced Hnf4a, abolished interference of Hnf4a with Foxa2, and
      reduced hepatic differentiation in Mgp-null lungs. Together, our results suggest 
      that endothelial-epithelial interactions, maintained by MGP, are essential in
      pulmonary cell differentiation.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702006 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms by which neoplastic cells tolerate oncogene-induced DNA
      replication stress are poorly understood. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a
      major mediator of oncogenic DNA replication stress. In this study, we show that
      CDK2-inducing stimuli (including Cyclin E overexpression, oncogenic RAS, and WEE1
      inhibition) activate the DNA repair protein RAD18. CDK2-induced RAD18 activation 
      required initiation of DNA synthesis and was repressed by p53. RAD18 and its
      effector, DNA polymerase kappa (Polkappa), sustained ongoing DNA synthesis in
      cells harboring elevated CDK2 activity. RAD18-deficient cells aberrantly
      accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) after CDK2 activation. In RAD18-depleted 
      cells, the G2/M checkpoint was necessary to prevent mitotic entry with persistent
      ssDNA. Rad18(-/-) and Polkappa(-/-) cells were highly sensitive to the WEE1
      inhibitor MK-1775 (which simultaneously activates CDK2 and abrogates the G2/M
      checkpoint). Collectively, our results show that the RAD18-Polkappa signaling
      axis allows tolerance of CDK2-mediated oncogenic stress and may allow neoplastic 
      cells to breach tumorigenic barriers.

AB  - Interorganelle contacts facilitate communication between organelles and impact
      fundamental cellular functions. In this study, we examine the assembly of the
      MECA (mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum [ER]-cortex anchor), which tethers
      mitochondria to the ER and plasma membrane. We find that the assembly of Num1,
      the core component of MECA, requires mitochondria. Once assembled, Num1 clusters 
      persistently anchor mitochondria to the cell cortex. Num1 clusters also function 
      to anchor dynein to the plasma membrane, where dynein captures and walks along
      astral microtubules to help orient the mitotic spindle. We find that dynein is
      anchored by Num1 clusters that have been assembled by mitochondria. When
      mitochondrial inheritance is inhibited, Num1 clusters are not assembled in the
      bud, and defects in dynein-mediated spindle positioning are observed. The
      mitochondria-dependent assembly of a dual-function cortical anchor provides a
      mechanism to integrate the positioning and inheritance of the two essential
      organelles and expands the function of organelle contact sites.

TI  - GTSE1 regulates spindle microtubule dynamics to control Aurora B kinase and Kif4A
      chromokinesin on chromosome arms.
PG  - 3117-3132
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610012 [doi]
AB  - In mitosis, the dynamic assembly and disassembly of microtubules are critical for
      normal chromosome movement and segregation. Microtubule turnover varies among
      different mitotic spindle microtubules, dictated by their spatial distribution
      within the spindle. How turnover among the various classes of spindle
      microtubules is differentially regulated and the resulting significance of
      differential turnover for chromosome movement remains a mystery. As a new tactic,
      we used global microarray meta-analysis (GAMMA), a bioinformatic method, to
      identify novel regulators of mitosis, and in this study, we describe G2- and S
      phase-expressed protein 1 (GTSE1). GTSE1 is expressed exclusively in late G2 and 
      M phase. From nuclear envelope breakdown until anaphase onset, GTSE1 binds
      preferentially to the most stable mitotic spindle microtubules and promotes their
      turnover. Cells depleted of GTSE1 show defects in chromosome alignment at the
      metaphase plate and in spindle pole integrity. These defects are coupled with an 
      increase in the proportion of stable mitotic spindle microtubules. A consequence 
      of this reduced microtubule turnover is diminished recruitment and activity of
      Aurora B kinase on chromosome arms. This decrease in Aurora B results in
      diminished binding of the chromokinesin Kif4A to chromosome arms.

PG  - 3133-3143
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607111 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin A2 is a crucial mitotic Cdk regulatory partner that coordinates entry into
      mitosis and is then destroyed in prometaphase within minutes of nuclear envelope 
      breakdown. The role of cyclin A2 in female meiosis and its dynamics during the
      transition from meiosis I (MI) to meiosis II (MII) remain unclear. We found that 
      cyclin A2 decreases in prometaphase I but recovers after the first meiotic
      division and persists, uniquely for metaphase, in MII-arrested oocytes.
      Conditional deletion of cyclin A2 from mouse oocytes has no discernible effect on
      MI but leads to disrupted MII spindles and increased merotelic attachments. On
      stimulation of exit from MII, there is a dramatic increase in lagging chromosomes
      and an inhibition of cytokinesis. These defects are associated with an increase
      in microtubule stability in MII spindles, suggesting that cyclin A2 mediates the 
      fidelity of MII by maintaining microtubule dynamics during the rapid formation of
      the MII spindle.

PG  - 3179-3198
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701024 [doi]
AB  - End-binding proteins (EBs) are the core components of microtubule plus end
      tracking protein complexes, but it is currently unknown whether they are
      essential for mammalian microtubule organization. Here, by using
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout technology, we generated stable cell lines lacking 
      EB2 and EB3 and the C-terminal partner-binding half of EB1. These cell lines show
      only mild defects in cell division and microtubule polymerization. However, the
      length of CAMSAP2-decorated stretches at noncentrosomal microtubule minus ends in
      these cells is reduced, microtubules are detached from Golgi membranes, and the
      Golgi complex is more compact. Coorganization of microtubules and Golgi membranes
      depends on the EB1/EB3-myomegalin complex, which acts as membrane-microtubule
      tether and counteracts tight clustering of individual Golgi stacks. Disruption of
      EB1 and EB3 also perturbs cell migration, polarity, and the distribution of focal
      adhesions. EB1 and EB3 thus affect multiple interphase processes and have a major
      impact on microtubule minus end organization.

TI  - DAN (NBL1) promotes collective neural crest migration by restraining uncontrolled
      invasion.
PG  - 3339-3354
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612169 [doi]
AB  - Neural crest cells are both highly migratory and significant to vertebrate
      organogenesis. However, the signals that regulate neural crest cell migration
      remain unclear. In this study, we test the function of differential
      screening-selected gene aberrant in neuroblastoma (DAN), a bone morphogenetic
      protein (BMP) antagonist we detected by analysis of the chick cranial mesoderm.
      Our analysis shows that, before neural crest cell exit from the hindbrain, DAN is
      expressed in the mesoderm, and then it becomes absent along cell migratory
      pathways. Cranial neural crest and metastatic melanoma cells avoid DAN protein
      stripes in vitro. Addition of DAN reduces the speed of migrating cells in vivo
      and in vitro, respectively. In vivo loss of function of DAN results in enhanced
      neural crest cell migration by increasing speed and directionality. Computer
      model simulations support the hypothesis that DAN restrains cell migration by
      regulating cell speed. Collectively, our results identify DAN as a novel factor
      that inhibits uncontrolled neural crest and metastatic melanoma invasion and
      promotes collective migration in a manner consistent with the inhibition of BMP
      signaling.

PG  - 3007-3016
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612068 [doi]
AB  - Experiments on model systems have revealed that cytokinesis in cells with
      contractile rings (amoebas, fungi, and animals) depends on shared molecular
      mechanisms in spite of some differences that emerged during a billion years of
      divergent evolution. Understanding these fundamental mechanisms depends on
      identifying the participating proteins and characterizing the mechanisms that
      position the furrow, assemble the contractile ring, anchor the ring to the plasma
      membrane, trigger ring constriction, produce force to form a furrow, disassemble 
      the ring, expand the plasma membrane in the furrow, and separate the daughter
      cell membranes. This review reveals that fascinating questions remain about each 
      step.

TI  - Pet10p is a yeast perilipin that stabilizes lipid droplets and promotes their
      assembly.
PG  - 3199-3217
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610013 [doi]
AB  - Pet10p is a yeast lipid droplet protein of unknown function. We show that it
      binds specifically to and is stabilized by droplets containing triacylglycerol
      (TG). Droplets isolated from cells with a PET10 deletion strongly aggregate,
      appear fragile, and fuse in vivo when cells are cultured in oleic acid. Pet10p
      binds early to nascent droplets, and their rate of appearance is decreased in
      pet10Delta Moreover, Pet10p functionally interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum
      droplet assembly factors seipin and Fit2 to maintain proper droplet morphology.
      The activity of Dga1p, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and TG accumulation were
      both 30-35% lower in the absence of Pet10p. Pet10p contains a PAT domain, a
      defining property of perilipins, which was not previously known to exist in
      yeast. We propose that the core functions of Pet10p and other perilipins extend
      beyond protection from lipases and include the preservation of droplet integrity 
      as well as collaboration with seipin and Fit2 in droplet assembly and
      maintenance.

AB  - Many eukaryotic cells divide by assembling and constricting an actin- and
      myosin-based contractile ring (CR) that is physically linked to the plasma
      membrane (PM). In this study, we report that Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells
      lacking efr3, which encodes a conserved PM scaffold for the
      phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase Stt4, build CRs that can slide away from the cell
      middle during anaphase in a myosin V-dependent manner. The Efr3-dependent
      CR-anchoring mechanism is distinct from previously reported pathways dependent on
      the Fes/CIP4 homology Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs167 (F-BAR) protein Cdc15 and paxillin
      Pxl1. In efr3Delta, the concentrations of several membrane-binding proteins were 
      reduced in the CR and/or on the PM. Our results suggest that proper PM lipid
      composition is important to stabilize the central position of the CR and resist
      myosin V-based forces to promote the fidelity of cell division.

AB  - Lysosomes robustly accumulate within axonal swellings at Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      amyloid plaques. However, the underlying mechanisms and disease relevance of such
      lysosome accumulations are not well understood. Motivated by these problems, we
      identified JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) as an important regulator of axonal
      lysosome transport and maturation. JIP3 knockout mouse neuron primary cultures
      accumulate lysosomes within focal axonal swellings that resemble the dystrophic
      axons at amyloid plaques. These swellings contain high levels of amyloid
      precursor protein processing enzymes (BACE1 and presenilin 2) and are accompanied
      by elevated Abeta peptide levels. The in vivo importance of the JIP3-dependent
      regulation of axonal lysosomes was revealed by the worsening of the amyloid
      plaque pathology arising from JIP3 haploinsufficiency in a mouse model of AD.
      These results establish the critical role of JIP3-dependent axonal lysosome
      transport in regulating amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing and
      support a model wherein Abeta production is amplified by plaque-induced axonal
      lysosome transport defects.

TI  - MRTF transcription and Ezrin-dependent plasma membrane blebbing are required for 
      entotic invasion.
PG  - 3087-3095
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702010 [doi]
AB  - Entosis is a nonapoptotic form of cell death initiated by actomyosin-dependent
      homotypic cell-in-cell invasion that can be observed in malignant exudates during
      tumor progression. We previously demonstrated formin-mediated actin dynamics at
      the rear of the invading cell as well as nonapoptotic plasma membrane (PM)
      blebbing in this cellular motile process. Although the contractile actin cortex
      involved in bleb-driven motility is well characterized, a role for
      transcriptional regulation in this process has not been studied. Here, we explore
      the impact of the actin-controlled MRTF-SRF (myocardin-related transcription
      factor-serum response factor) pathway for sustained PM blebbing and entotic
      invasion. We find that cortical blebbing is tightly coupled to MRTF nuclear
      shuttling to promote the SRF transcriptional activity required for entosis.
      Furthermore, PM blebbing triggered SRF-mediated up-regulation of the
      metastasis-associated ERM protein Ezrin. Notably, Ezrin is sufficient and
      important to sustain bleb dynamics for cell-in-cell invasion when SRF is
      suppressed. Our results highlight the critical role of the actin-regulated MRTF
      transcriptional pathway for bleb-associated invasive motility, such as during
      entosis.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201706134 [doi]
AB  - During apoptosis, executioner caspase activity has been considered a point of no 
      return. However, recent studies show that cells can survive caspase activation
      following transient apoptotic stimuli, a process called anastasis. To identify a 
      molecular signature, we performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of
      untreated, apoptotic, and recovering HeLa cells. We found that anastasis is an
      active, two-stage program. During the early stage, cells transition from
      growth-arrested to growing. In the late stage, HeLa cells change from
      proliferating to migratory. Recovering cells also exhibited prolonged elevation
      of proangiogenic factors. Strikingly, some early-recovery mRNAs, including Snail,
      were elevated first during apoptosis, implying that dying cells poise to recover,
      even while under apoptotic stress. Snail was also required for recovery. This
      study reveals similarities in the anastasis genes, pathways, and cell behaviors
      to those activated in wound healing and identifies a repertoire of potential
      targets for therapeutic manipulation.

AB  - Endocytosed cell surface membrane proteins rely on recycling pathways for their
      return to the plasma membrane. Although endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling is 
      critical for many cellular processes, much of the required machinery is unknown. 
      We discovered that yeast has a recycling route from endosomes to the cell surface
      that functions efficiently after inactivation of the sec7-1 allele of Sec7, which
      controls transit through the Golgi. A genetic screen based on an engineered
      synthetic reporter that exclusively follows this pathway revealed that recycling 
      was subject to metabolic control through the Rag GTPases Gtr1 and Gtr2, which
      work downstream of the exchange factor Vam6. Gtr1 and Gtr2 control the recycling 
      pathway independently of TORC1 regulation through the Gtr1 interactor Ltv1. We
      further show that the early-endosome recycling route and its control though the
      Vam6>Gtr1/Gtr2>Ltv1 pathway plays a physiological role in regulating the
      abundance of amino acid transporters at the cell surface.

TI  - FiloQuant reveals increased filopodia density during breast cancer progression.
PG  - 3387-3403
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704045 [doi]
AB  - Defective filopodia formation is linked to pathologies such as cancer, wherein
      actively protruding filopodia, at the invasive front, accompany cancer cell
      dissemination. Despite wide biological significance, delineating filopodia
      function in complex systems remains challenging and is particularly hindered by
      lack of compatible methods to quantify filopodia properties. Here, we present
      FiloQuant, a freely available ImageJ plugin, to detect filopodia-like protrusions
      in both fixed- and live-cell microscopy data. We demonstrate that FiloQuant can
      extract quantifiable information, including protrusion dynamics, density, and
      length, from multiple cell types and in a range of microenvironments. In cellular
      models of breast ductal carcinoma in situ, we reveal a link between filopodia
      formation at the cell-matrix interface, in collectively invading cells and 3D
      tumor spheroids, and the in vitro invasive capacity of the carcinoma. Finally,
      using intravital microscopy, we observe that tumor spheroids display filopodia in
      vivo, supporting a potential role for these protrusions during tumorigenesis.

TI  - Filopodyan: An open-source pipeline for the analysis of filopodia.
PG  - 3405-3422
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705113 [doi]
AB  - Filopodia have important sensory and mechanical roles in motile cells. The
      recruitment of actin regulators, such as ENA/VASP proteins, to sites of
      protrusion underlies diverse molecular mechanisms of filopodia formation and
      extension. We developed Filopodyan (filopodia dynamics analysis) in Fiji and R to
      measure fluorescence in filopodia and at their tips and bases concurrently with
      their morphological and dynamic properties. Filopodyan supports high-throughput
      phenotype characterization as well as detailed interactive editing of filopodia
      reconstructions through an intuitive graphical user interface. Our highly
      customizable pipeline is widely applicable, capable of detecting filopodia in
      four different cell types in vitro and in vivo. We use Filopodyan to quantify the
      recruitment of ENA and VASP preceding filopodia formation in neuronal growth
      cones, and uncover a molecular heterogeneity whereby different filopodia display 
      markedly different responses to changes in the accumulation of ENA and VASP
      fluorescence in their tips over time.

      mitotic commitment.
PG  - 2795-2812
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702172 [doi]
AB  - The fission yeast scaffold molecule Sid4 anchors the septum initiation network to
      the spindle pole body (SPB, centrosome equivalent) to control mitotic exit
      events. A second SPB-associated scaffold, Cut12, promotes SPB-associated
      Cdk1-cyclin B to drive mitotic commitment. Signals emanating from each scaffold
      have been assumed to operate independently to promote two distinct outcomes. We
      now find that signals from Sid4 contribute to the Cut12 mitotic commitment
      switch. Specifically, phosphorylation of Sid4 by NIMA(Fin1) reduces Sid4 affinity
      for its SPB anchor, Ppc89, while also enhancing Sid4's affinity for casein kinase
      1delta (CK1delta). The resulting phosphorylation of Sid4 by the newly docked
      CK1delta recruits Chk2(Cds1) to Sid4. Chk2(Cds1) then expels the Cdk1-cyclin B
      antagonistic phosphatase Flp1/Clp1 from the SPB. Flp1/Clp1 departure can then
      support mitotic commitment when Cdk1-cyclin B activation at the SPB is
      compromised by reduction of Cut12 function. Such integration of signals emanating
      from neighboring scaffolds shows how centrosomes/SPBs can integrate inputs from
      multiple pathways to control cell fate.

      regulation of the anti-adipogenic MIR335 locus.
PG  - 2731-2743
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701043 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene-encoding nuclear LMNA cause laminopathies,
      which include partial lipodystrophies associated with metabolic syndromes. The
      lipodystrophy-associated LMNA p.R482W mutation is known to impair adipogenic
      differentiation, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. We show in this study
      that the lamin A p.R482W hot spot mutation prevents adipogenic gene expression by
      epigenetically deregulating long-range enhancers of the anti-adipogenic MIR335
      microRNA gene in human adipocyte progenitor cells. The R482W mutation results in 
      a loss of function of differentiation-dependent lamin A binding to the MIR335
      locus. This impairs H3K27 methylation and instead favors H3K27 acetylation on
      MIR335 enhancers. The lamin A mutation further promotes spatial clustering of
      MIR335 enhancer and promoter elements along with overexpression of the MIR355
      gene after adipogenic induction. Our results link a laminopathy-causing lamin A
      mutation to an unsuspected deregulation of chromatin states and spatial
      conformation of an miRNA locus critical for adipose progenitor cell fate.

PG  - 2813-2826
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610019 [doi]
AB  - Transport through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) during interphase is facilitated 
      by the nucleoporin Nup2 via its importin alpha- and Ran-binding domains. However,
      Aspergillus nidulans and vertebrate Nup2 also locate to chromatin during mitosis,
      suggestive of mitotic functions. In this study, we report that Nup2 is required
      for mitotic NPC inheritance in A. nidulans Interestingly, the role of Nup2 during
      mitotic NPC segregation is independent of its importin alpha- and Ran-binding
      domains but relies on a central targeting domain that is necessary for
      localization and viability. To test whether mitotic chromatin-associated Nup2
      might function to bridge NPCs with chromatin during segregation, we provided an
      artificial link between NPCs and chromatin via Nup133 and histone H1. Using this 
      approach, we bypassed the requirement of Nup2 for NPC segregation. This indicates
      that A. nidulans cells ensure accurate mitotic NPC segregation to daughter nuclei
      by linking mitotic DNA and NPC segregation via the mitotic specific chromatin
      association of Nup2.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602058 [doi]
AB  - Acidic clusters act as sorting signals for packaging cargo into clathrin-coated
      vesicles (CCVs), and also facilitate down-regulation of MHC-I by HIV-1 Nef. To
      find acidic cluster sorting machinery, we performed a gene-trap screen and
      identified the medium subunit (micro1) of the clathrin adaptor AP-1 as a top hit.
      In micro1 knockout cells, intracellular CCVs still form, but acidic cluster
      proteins are depleted, although several other CCV components were either
      unaffected or increased, indicating that cells can compensate for long-term loss 
      of AP-1. In vitro experiments showed that the basic patch on micro1 that
      interacts with the Nef acidic cluster also contributes to the binding of
      endogenous acidic cluster proteins. Surprisingly, micro1 mutant proteins lacking 
      the basic patch and/or the tyrosine-based motif binding pocket could rescue the
      micro1 knockout phenotype completely. In contrast, these mutants failed to rescue
      Nef-induced down-regulation of MHC class I, suggesting a possible mechanism for
      attacking the virus while sparing the host cell.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607038 [doi]
AB  - The position of the mitotic spindle is tightly controlled in animal cells as it
      determines the plane and orientation of cell division. Contacts between
      cytoplasmic dynein and astral microtubules (MTs) at the cell cortex generate
      pulling forces that position the spindle. An evolutionarily conserved
      Galpha-GPR-1/2(Pins/LGN)-LIN-5(Mud/NuMA) cortical complex interacts with dynein
      and is required for pulling force generation, but the dynamics of this process
      remain unclear. In this study, by fluorescently labeling endogenous proteins in
      Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, we show that dynein exists in two distinct
      cortical populations. One population directly depends on LIN-5, whereas the other
      is concentrated at MT plus ends and depends on end-binding (EB) proteins.
      Knockout mutants lacking all EBs are viable and fertile and display normal
      pulling forces and spindle positioning. However, EB protein-dependent dynein plus
      end tracking was found to contribute to force generation in embryos with a
      partially perturbed dynein function, indicating the existence of two mechanisms
      that together create a highly robust force-generating system.

PG  - 2715-2729
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701154 [doi]
AB  - Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) and myeloid ecotropic viral integration site
      (MEIS) proteins control cell fate decisions in many physiological and
      pathophysiological contexts, but how these proteins function mechanistically
      remains poorly defined. Focusing on the first hours of neuronal differentiation
      of adult subventricular zone-derived stem/progenitor cells, we describe a
      sequence of events by which PBX-MEIS facilitates chromatin accessibility of
      transcriptionally inactive genes: In undifferentiated cells, PBX1 is bound to the
      H1-compacted promoter/proximal enhancer of the neuron-specific gene doublecortin 
      (Dcx) Once differentiation is induced, MEIS associates with chromatin-bound PBX1,
      recruits PARP1/ARTD1, and initiates PARP1-mediated eviction of H1 from the
      chromatin fiber. These results for the first time link MEIS proteins to
      PARP-regulated chromatin dynamics and provide a mechanistic basis to explain the 
      profound cellular changes elicited by these proteins.

TI  - CENP-A and topoisomerase-II antagonistically affect chromosome length.
PG  - 2645-2655
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608084 [doi]
AB  - The size of mitotic chromosomes is coordinated with cell size in a manner
      dependent on nuclear trafficking. In this study, we conducted an RNA interference
      screen of the Caenorhabditis elegans nucleome in a strain carrying an
      exceptionally long chromosome and identified the centromere-specific histone H3
      variant CENP-A and the DNA decatenizing enzyme topoisomerase-II (topo-II) as
      candidate modulators of chromosome size. In the holocentric organism C. elegans, 
      CENP-A is positioned periodically along the entire length of chromosomes, and in 
      mitosis, these genomic regions come together linearly to form the base of
      kinetochores. We show that CENP-A protein levels decreased through development
      coinciding with chromosome-size scaling. Partial loss of CENP-A protein resulted 
      in shorter mitotic chromosomes, consistent with a role in setting chromosome
      length. Conversely, topo-II levels were unchanged through early development, and 
      partial topo-II depletion led to longer chromosomes. Topo-II localized to the
      perimeter of mitotic chromosomes, excluded from the centromere regions, and
      depletion of topo-II did not change CENP-A levels. We propose that self-assembly 
      of centromeric chromatin into an extended linear array promotes elongation of the
      chromosome, whereas topo-II promotes chromosome-length shortening.

TI  - The spread of prion-like proteins by lysosomes and tunneling nanotubes:
      Implications for neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 2633-2644
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701047 [doi]
AB  - Progression of pathology in neurodegenerative diseases is hypothesized to be a
      non-cell-autonomous process that may be mediated by the productive spreading of
      prion-like protein aggregates from a "donor cell" that is the source of misfolded
      aggregates to an "acceptor cell" in which misfolding is propagated by conversion 
      of the normal protein. Although the proteins involved in the various diseases are
      unrelated, common pathways appear to be used for their intercellular propagation 
      and spreading. Here, we summarize recent evidence of the molecular mechanisms
      relevant for the intercellular trafficking of protein aggregates involved in
      prion, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. We focus in
      particular on the common roles that lysosomes and tunneling nanotubes play in the
      formation and spreading of prion-like assemblies.

TI  - TRIM37, a novel E3 ligase for PEX5-mediated peroxisomal matrix protein import.
PG  - 2843-2858
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611170 [doi]
AB  - Most proteins destined for the peroxisomal matrix depend on the peroxisomal
      targeting signals (PTSs), which require the PTS receptor PEX5, whose deficiency
      causes fatal human peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs). TRIM37 gene mutations
      cause muscle-liver-brain-eye (mulibrey) nanism. We found that TRIM37 localizes in
      peroxisomal membranes and ubiquitylates PEX5 at K464 by interacting with its
      C-terminal 51 amino acids (CT51), which is required for PTS protein import. PEX5 
      mutations (K464A or DeltaCT51), or TRIM37 depletion or mutation, reduce PEX5
      abundance by promoting its proteasomal degradation, thereby impairing its
      functions in cargo binding and PTS protein import in human cells. TRIM37 or PEX5 
      depletion induces apoptosis and enhances sensitivity to oxidative stress,
      underscoring the cellular requirement for functional peroxisomes. Therefore,
      TRIM37-mediated ubiquitylation stabilizes PEX5 and promotes peroxisomal matrix
      protein import, suggesting that mulibrey nanism is a new PBD.

TI  - Microglia control the glycinergic but not the GABAergic synapses via
      prostaglandin E2 in the spinal cord.
PG  - 2979-2989
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607048 [doi]
AB  - Microglia control excitatory synapses, but their role in inhibitory
      neurotransmission has been less well characterized. Herein, we show that
      microglia control the strength of glycinergic but not GABAergic synapses via
      modulation of the diffusion dynamics and synaptic trapping of glycine (GlyR) but 
      not GABAA receptors. We further demonstrate that microglia regulate the
      activity-dependent plasticity of glycinergic synapses by tuning the GlyR
      diffusion trap. This microglia-synapse cross talk requires production of
      prostaglandin E2 by microglia, leading to the activation of neuronal EP2
      receptors and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. Thus, we
      now provide a link between microglial activation and synaptic dysfunctions, which
      are common early features of many brain diseases.

TI  - Outer nuclear membrane protein Kuduk modulates the LINC complex and nuclear
      envelope architecture.
PG  - 2827-2841
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606043 [doi]
AB  - Linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes spanning the nuclear
      envelope (NE) contribute to nucleocytoskeletal force transduction. A few NE
      proteins have been found to regulate the LINC complex. In this study, we identify
      one, Kuduk (Kud), which can reside at the outer nuclear membrane and is required 
      for the development of Drosophila melanogaster ovarian follicles and NE
      morphology of myonuclei. Kud associates with LINC complex components in an
      evolutionarily conserved manner. Loss of Kud increases the level but impairs
      functioning of the LINC complex. Overexpression of Kud suppresses NE targeting of
      cytoskeleton-free LINC complexes. Thus, Kud acts as a quality control mechanism
      for LINC-mediated nucleocytoskeletal connections. Genetic data indicate that Kud 
      also functions independently of the LINC complex. Overexpression of the human
      orthologue TMEM258 in Drosophila proved functional conservation. These findings
      expand our understanding of the regulation of LINC complexes and NE architecture.

AB  - Activated danger or pathogen sensors trigger assembly of the inflammasome adaptor
      ASC into specks, large signaling platforms considered hallmarks of inflammasome
      activation. Because a lack of in vivo tools has prevented the study of endogenous
      ASC dynamics, we generated a live ASC reporter through CRISPR/Cas9 tagging of the
      endogenous gene in zebrafish. We see strong ASC expression in the skin and other 
      epithelia that act as barriers to insult. A toxic stimulus triggered speck
      formation and rapid pyroptosis in keratinocytes in vivo. Macrophages engulfed and
      digested that speck-containing, pyroptotic debris. A three-dimensional,
      ultrastructural reconstruction, based on correlative light and electron
      microscopy of the in vivo assembled specks revealed a compact network of highly
      intercrossed filaments, whereas pyrin domain (PYD) or caspase activation and
      recruitment domain alone formed filamentous aggregates. The effector caspase is
      recruited through PYD, whose overexpression induced pyroptosis but only after
      substantial delay. Therefore, formation of a single, compact speck and rapid
      cell-death induction in vivo requires a full-length ASC.

TI  - Self-sorting of nonmuscle myosins IIA and IIB polarizes the cytoskeleton and
      modulates cell motility.
PG  - 2877-2889
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705167 [doi]
AB  - Nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) is uniquely responsible for cell contractility and
      thus defines multiple aspects of cell behavior. To generate contraction, NMII
      molecules polymerize into bipolar minifilaments. Different NMII paralogs are
      often coexpressed in cells and can copolymerize, suggesting that they may
      cooperate to facilitate cell motility. However, whether such cooperation exists
      and how it may work remain unknown. We show that copolymerization of NMIIA and
      NMIIB followed by their differential turnover leads to self-sorting of NMIIA and 
      NMIIB along the front-rear axis, thus producing a polarized actin-NMII
      cytoskeleton. Stress fibers newly formed near the leading edge are enriched in
      NMIIA, but over time, they become progressively enriched with NMIIB because of
      faster NMIIA turnover. In combination with retrograde flow, this process results 
      in posterior accumulation of more stable NMIIB-rich stress fibers, thus
      strengthening cell polarity. By copolymerizing with NMIIB, NMIIA accelerates the 
      intrinsically slow NMIIB dynamics, thus increasing cell motility and traction and
      enabling chemotaxis.

AB  - Genetic elements that replicate extrachromosomally are rare in mammals; however, 
      several human tumor viruses, including the papillomaviruses and the
      gammaherpesviruses, maintain their plasmid genomes by tethering them to cellular 
      chromosomes. We have uncovered an unprecedented mechanism of viral replication:
      Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) stably clusters its genomes across
      generations to maintain itself extrachromosomally. To identify and characterize
      this mechanism, we developed two complementary, independent approaches: live-cell
      imaging and a predictive computational model. The clustering of KSHV requires the
      viral protein, LANA1, to bind viral genomes to nucleosomes arrayed on both
      cellular and viral DNA. Clustering affects both viral partitioning and viral
      genome numbers of KSHV. The clustering of KSHV plasmids provides it with an
      effective evolutionary strategy to rapidly increase copy numbers of genomes per
      cell at the expense of the total numbers of cells infected.

AB  - Autosomal-recessive omodysplasia (OMOD1) is a genetic condition characterized by 
      short stature, shortened limbs, and facial dysmorphism. OMOD1 is caused by
      loss-of-function mutations of glypican 6 (GPC6). In this study, we show that
      GPC6-null embryos display most of the abnormalities found in OMOD1 patients and
      that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is significantly reduced in the long bones of these 
      embryos. The Hh-stimulatory activity of GPC6 was also observed in cultured cells,
      where this GPC increased the binding of Hh to Patched 1 (Ptc1). Consistent with
      this, GPC6 interacts with Hh through its core protein and with Ptc1 through its
      glycosaminoglycan chains. Hh signaling is triggered at the primary cilium. In the
      absence of Hh, we observed that GPC6 is localized outside of the cilium but moves
      into the cilium upon the addition of Hh. We conclude that GPC6 stimulates Hh
      signaling by binding to Hh and Ptc1 at the cilium and increasing the interaction 
      of the receptor and ligand.

PG  - 2959-2977
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611117 [doi]
AB  - Cell migration is dependent on adhesion dynamics and actin cytoskeleton
      remodeling at the leading edge. These events may be physically constrained by the
      plasma membrane. Here, we show that the mechanical signal produced by an increase
      in plasma membrane tension triggers the positioning of new rows of adhesions at
      the leading edge. During protrusion, as membrane tension increases, velocity
      slows, and the lamellipodium buckles upward in a myosin II-independent manner.
      The buckling occurs between the front of the lamellipodium, where nascent
      adhesions are positioned in rows, and the base of the lamellipodium, where a
      vinculin-dependent clutch couples actin to previously positioned adhesions. As
      membrane tension decreases, protrusion resumes and buckling disappears, until the
      next cycle. We propose that the mechanical signal of membrane tension exerts
      upstream control in mechanotransduction by periodically compressing and relaxing 
      the lamellipodium, leading to the positioning of adhesions at the leading edge of
      cells.

AB  - The migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from their place of origin to the
      embryonic gonad is an essential reproductive feature in many animal species. In
      Drosophila melanogaster, a single G protein-coupled receptor, Trapped in endoderm
      1 (Tre1), mediates germ cell polarization at the onset of active migration and
      directs subsequent migration of PGCs through the midgut primordium. How these
      different aspects of cell behavior are coordinated through a single receptor is
      not known. We demonstrate that two highly conserved domains, the E/N/DRY and
      NPxxY motifs, have overlapping and unique functions in Tre1. The Tre1-NRY domain 
      via G protein signaling is required for reading and responding to guidance and
      survival cues controlled by the lipid phosphate phosphatases Wunen and Wunen2. In
      contrast, the Tre1-NPIIY domain has a separate role in Rho1- and
      E-cadherin-mediated polarization at the initiation stage independent of G protein
      signaling. We propose that this bifurcation of the Tre1 G protein-coupled
      receptor signaling response via G protein-dependent and independent branches
      enables distinct spatiotemporal regulation of germ cell migration.

TI  - Tubulin glycylation controls primary cilia length.
PG  - 2701-2713
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612050 [doi]
AB  - As essential components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, microtubules fulfill a
      variety of functions that can be temporally and spatially controlled by tubulin
      posttranslational modifications. Tubulin glycylation has so far been mostly found
      on motile cilia and flagella, where it is involved in the stabilization of the
      axoneme. In contrast, barely anything is known about the role of glycylation in
      primary cilia because of limitations in detecting this modification in these
      organelles. We thus developed novel glycylation-specific antibodies with which we
      detected glycylation in many primary cilia. Glycylation accumulates in primary
      cilia in a length-dependent manner, and depletion or overexpression of
      glycylating enzymes modulates the length of primary cilia in cultured cells. This
      strongly suggests that glycylation is essential for the homeostasis of primary
      cilia, which has important implications for human disorders related to primary
      cilia dysfunctions, such as ciliopathies and certain types of cancer.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201705017 [doi]
AB  - Cell surface receptor uptake via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and
      subsequent intracellular sorting for degradation or recycling regulates the
      strength and specificity of downstream signaling. Signaling, in turn, modulates
      early endocytic trafficking. This reciprocal regulation of signaling and
      endocytosis provides opportunities for the establishment of feedback loops to
      enhance or suppress surface-derived signals. Recent studies suggest that
      dynamin-1, a presumed neuron-specific isoform of the large, membrane fission
      GTPase, can be activated in nonneuronal cells downstream of cancer-relevant
      signaling pathways and thereby function as a nexus between signaling and early
      endocytic trafficking. I speculate that sustained up-regulation and/or acute
      activation of dynamin-1 in cancer cells contributes to a program of "adaptive"
      CME that alters signaling to enhance cancer cell survival, migration, and
      proliferation.

PG  - 2859-2875

AB  - Cell motility depends on tight coordination between the microtubule (MT) and
      actin cytoskeletons, but the mechanisms underlying this MT-actin cross talk have 
      remained poorly understood. Here, we show that the tumor suppressor protein
      adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which is a known MT-associated protein,
      directly nucleates actin assembly to promote directed cell migration. By changing
      only two residues in APC, we generated a separation-of-function mutant, APC (m4),
      that abolishes actin nucleation activity without affecting MT interactions.
      Expression of full-length APC carrying the m4 mutation (APC (m4)) rescued
      cellular defects in MT organization, MT dynamics, and mitochondrial distribution 
      caused by depletion of endogenous APC but failed to restore cell migration.
      Wild-type APC and APC (m4) localized to focal adhesions (FAs), and APC (m4) was
      defective in promoting actin assembly at FAs to facilitate MT-induced FA
      turnover. These results provide the first direct evidence for APC-mediated actin 
      assembly in vivo and establish a role for APC in coordinating MTs and actin at
      FAs to direct cell migration.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701104 [doi]
AB  - Cytokinesis in many eukaryotes involves a tension-generating actomyosin-based
      contractile ring. Many components of actomyosin rings turn over during
      contraction, although the significance of this turnover has remained enigmatic.
      Here, using Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, we investigate the role of turnover of
      actin and myosin II in its contraction. Actomyosin ring components self-organize 
      into approximately 1-microm-spaced clusters instead of undergoing full-ring
      contraction in the absence of continuous actin polymerization. This effect is
      reversed when actin filaments are stabilized. We tested the idea that the
      function of turnover is to ensure actin filament homeostasis in a synthetic
      system, in which we abolished turnover by fixing rings in cell ghosts with
      formaldehyde. We found that these rings contracted fully upon exogenous addition 
      of a vertebrate myosin. We conclude that actin turnover is required to maintain
      actin filament homeostasis during ring contraction and that the requirement for
      turnover can be bypassed if homeostasis is achieved artificially.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612195 [doi]
AB  - Microtubules are polymers of alphabeta-tubulin heterodimers essential for all
      eukaryotes. Despite sequence conservation, there are significant structural
      differences between microtubules assembled in vitro from mammalian or budding
      yeast tubulin. Yeast MTs were not observed to undergo compaction at the
      interdimer interface as seen for mammalian microtubules upon GTP hydrolysis. Lack
      of compaction might reflect slower GTP hydrolysis or a different degree of
      allosteric coupling in the lattice. The microtubule plus end-tracking protein
      Bim1 binds yeast microtubules both between alphabeta-tubulin heterodimers, as
      seen for other organisms, and within tubulin dimers, but binds mammalian tubulin 
      only at interdimer contacts. At the concentrations used in cryo-electron
      microscopy, Bim1 causes the compaction of yeast microtubules and induces their
      rapid disassembly. Our studies demonstrate structural differences between yeast
      and mammalian microtubules that likely underlie their differing polymerization
      dynamics. These differences may reflect adaptations to the demands of different
      cell size or range of physiological growth temperatures.

TI  - Microtubule cross-linking activity of She1 ensures spindle stability for spindle 
      positioning.

AB  - Dynein mediates spindle positioning in budding yeast by pulling on astral
      microtubules (MTs) from the cell cortex. The MT-associated protein She1 regulates
      dynein activity along astral MTs and directs spindle movements toward the bud
      cell. In addition to localizing to astral MTs, She1 also targets to the spindle, 
      but its role on the spindle remains unknown. Using function-separating alleles,
      live-cell spindle assays, and in vitro biochemical analyses, we show that She1 is
      required for the maintenance of metaphase spindle stability. She1 binds and
      cross-links MTs via a C-terminal MT-binding site. She1 can also self-assemble
      into ring-shaped oligomers. In cells, She1 stabilizes interpolar MTs, preventing 
      spindle deformations during movement, and we show that this activity is regulated
      by Ipl1/Aurora B phosphorylation during cell cycle progression. Our data reveal
      how She1 ensures spindle integrity during spindle movement across the bud neck
      and suggest a potential link between regulation of spindle integrity and dynein
      pathway activity.

TI  - Dynamic changes in H1 subtype composition during epigenetic reprogramming.
LID - jcb.201611012 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611012 [doi]
AB  - In mammals, histone H1 consists of a family of related proteins, including five
      replication-dependent (H1.1-H1.5) and two replication-independent (H1.10 and
      H1.0) subtypes, all expressed in somatic cells. To systematically study the
      expression and function of H1 subtypes, we generated knockin mouse lines in which
      endogenous H1 subtypes are tagged. We focused on key developmental periods when
      epigenetic reprogramming occurs: early mouse embryos and primordial germ cell
      development. We found that dynamic changes in H1 subtype expression and
      localization are tightly linked with chromatin remodeling and might be crucial
      for transitions in chromatin structure during reprogramming. Although all somatic
      H1 subtypes are present in the blastocyst, each stage of preimplantation
      development is characterized by a different combination of H1 subtypes.
      Similarly, the relative abundance of somatic H1 subtypes can distinguish male and
      female chromatin upon sex differentiation in developing germ cells. Overall, our 
      data provide new insights into the chromatin changes underlying epigenetic
      reprogramming. We suggest that distinct H1 subtypes may mediate the extensive
      chromatin remodeling occurring during epigenetic reprogramming and that they may 
      be key players in the acquisition of cellular totipotency and the establishment
      of specific cellular states.

AB  - The nutrient starvation-specific unconventional secretion of Acb1 in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires ESCRT-I, -II, and -III and Grh1. In this study,
      we report that another signal sequence lacking cytoplasmic protein, superoxide
      dismutase 1 (SOD1), and its mutant form linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS), is also secreted by yeast upon nutrient starvation in a Grh1- and
      ESCRT-I-, -II-, and -III-dependent process. Our analyses reveal that a conserved 
      diacidic motif (Asp-Glu) in these proteins is necessary for their export.
      Importantly, secretion of wild-type human SOD1 and the ALS-linked mutant in human
      cells also require the diacidic residues. Altogether, these findings reveal
      information encoded within the cytoplasmic proteins required for their
      unconventional secretion and provide a means to unravel the significance of the
      cytoplasmic versus the secreted form of mutant SOD1 in the pathology of ALS. We
      also propose how cells, based on a signal-induced change in cytoplasmic
      physiology, select a small pool of a subset of cytoplasmic proteins for
      unconventional secretion.

PG  - 2565-2580
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604123 [doi]
AB  - Clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis is essential in eukaryotic cells. In
      this study, we demonstrate that Tda2 is a novel protein of the endocytic
      machinery necessary for normal internalization of native cargo in yeast. Tda2 has
      not been classified in any protein family. Unexpectedly, solving the crystal
      structure of Tda2 revealed it belongs to the dynein light chain family. However, 
      Tda2 works independently of the dynein motor complex and microtubules. Tda2 forms
      a tight complex with the polyproline motif-rich protein Aim21, which interacts
      physically with the SH3 domain of the Arp2/3 complex regulator Bbc1. The
      Tda2-Aim21 complex localizes to endocytic sites in a Bbc1- and filamentous
      actin-dependent manner. Importantly, the Tda2-Aim21 complex interacts directly
      with and facilitates the recruitment of actin-capping protein, revealing
      barbed-end filament capping at endocytic sites to be a regulated event. Thus, we 
      have uncovered a new layer of regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by a member of
      a conserved protein family that has not been previously associated with a
      function in endocytosis.

PG  - 2283-2293

AB  - A primary function of 5' regions in many secretory protein mRNAs is to encode an 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting sequence. In this study, we show how the
      regions coding for the ER-targeting sequences of the influenza glycoproteins NA
      and HA also function as translational regulatory elements that are controlled by 
      the viral RNA-binding protein (RBP) NS1. The translational increase depends on
      the nucleotide composition and 5' positioning of the ER-targeting sequence coding
      regions and is facilitated by the RNA-binding domain of NS1, which can associate 
      with ER membranes. Inserting the ER-targeting sequence coding region of NA into
      different 5' UTRs confirmed that NS1 can promote the translation of secretory
      protein mRNAs based on the nucleotides within this region rather than the
      resulting amino acids. By analyzing human protein mRNA sequences, we found
      evidence that this mechanism of using 5' coding regions and particular RBPs to
      achieve gene-specific regulation may extend to human-secreted proteins.

      perturbs neuronal migration.
PG  - 2443-2461
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607074 [doi]
AB  - Brain development involves extensive migration of neurons. Microtubules (MTs) are
      key cellular effectors of neuronal displacement that are assembled from
      alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimers. Mutation of the alpha-tubulin isotype TUBA1A is 
      associated with cortical malformations in humans. In this study, we provide
      detailed in vivo and in vitro analyses of Tuba1a mutants. In mice carrying a
      Tuba1a missense mutation (S140G), neurons accumulate, and glial cells are
      dispersed along the rostral migratory stream in postnatal and adult brains. Live 
      imaging of Tuba1a-mutant neurons revealed slowed migration and increased neuronal
      branching, which correlated with directionality alterations and perturbed
      nucleus-centrosome (N-C) coupling. Tuba1a mutation led to increased straightness 
      of newly polymerized MTs, and structural modeling data suggest a conformational
      change in the alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimer. We show that Tuba8, another
      alpha-tubulin isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has
      altered function compared with Tuba1a. Our work shows that Tuba1a plays an
      essential, noncompensated role in neuronal saltatory migration in vivo and
      highlights the importance of MT flexibility in N-C coupling and
      neuronal-branching regulation during neuronal migration.

PG  - 2515-2531
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604113 [doi]
AB  - Sensory systems use adaptation to measure changes in signaling inputs rather than
      absolute levels of signaling inputs. Adaptation enables eukaryotic cells to
      directionally migrate over a large dynamic range of chemoattractant. Because of
      complex feedback interactions and redundancy, it has been difficult to define the
      portion or portions of eukaryotic chemotactic signaling networks that generate
      adaptation and identify the regulators of this process. In this study, we use a
      combination of optogenetic intracellular inputs, CRISPR-based knockouts, and
      pharmacological perturbations to probe the basis of neutrophil adaptation. We
      find that persistent, optogenetically driven phosphatidylinositol
      (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) production results in only transient activation of
      Rac, a hallmark feature of adaptive circuits. We further identify the guanine
      nucleotide exchange factor P-Rex1 as the primary PIP3-stimulated Rac activator,
      whereas actin polymerization and the GTPase-activating protein ArhGAP15 are
      essential for proper Rac turnoff. This circuit is masked by feedback and
      redundancy when chemoattractant is used as the input, highlighting the value of
      probing signaling networks at intermediate nodes to deconvolve complex signaling 
      cascades.

TI  - Dynamic ubiquitin signaling in cell cycle regulation.
PG  - 2259-2271
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703170 [doi]
AB  - The cell division cycle is driven by a collection of enzymes that coordinate DNA 
      duplication and separation, ensuring that genomic information is faithfully and
      perpetually maintained. The activity of the effector proteins that perform and
      coordinate these biological processes oscillates by regulated expression and/or
      posttranslational modifications. Ubiquitylation is a cardinal cellular
      modification and is long known for driving cell cycle transitions. In this
      review, we emphasize emerging concepts of how ubiquitylation brings the necessary
      dynamicity and plasticity that underlie the processes of DNA replication and
      mitosis. New studies, often focusing on the regulation of chromosomal proteins
      like DNA polymerases or kinetochore kinases, are demonstrating that
      ubiquitylation is a versatile modification that can be used to fine-tune these
      cell cycle events, frequently through processes that do not involve proteasomal
      degradation. Understanding how the increasing variety of identified ubiquitin
      signals are transduced will allow us to develop a deeper mechanistic perception
      of how the multiple factors come together to faithfully propagate genomic
      information. Here, we discuss these and additional conceptual challenges that are
      currently under study toward understanding how ubiquitin governs cell cycle
      regulation.

TI  - Pink1 and Parkin regulate Drosophila intestinal stem cell proliferation during
      stress and aging.
PG  - 2315-2327
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610036 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) maintain the midgut epithelium in Drosophila
      melanogaster Proper cellular turnover and tissue function rely on tightly
      regulated rates of ISC division and appropriate differentiation of daughter
      cells. However, aging and epithelial injury cause elevated ISC proliferation and 
      decreased capacity for terminal differentiation of daughter enteroblasts (EBs).
      The mechanisms causing functional decline of stem cells with age remain elusive; 
      however, recent findings suggest that stem cell metabolism plays an important
      role in the regulation of stem cell activity. Here, we investigate how
      alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis modulate stem cell behavior in vivo via 
      RNA interference-mediated knockdown of factors involved in mitochondrial
      dynamics. ISC/EB-specific knockdown of the mitophagy-related genes Pink1 or
      Parkin suppresses the age-related loss of tissue homeostasis, despite dramatic
      changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure and mitochondrial damage in ISCs/EBs.
      Maintenance of tissue homeostasis upon reduction of Pink1 or Parkin appears to
      result from reduction of age- and stress-induced ISC proliferation, in part,
      through induction of ISC senescence. Our results indicate an uncoupling of
      cellular, tissue, and organismal aging through inhibition of ISC proliferation
      and provide insight into strategies used by stem cells to maintain tissue
      homeostasis despite severe damage to organelles.

      nuclear pore complexes.
PG  - 2425-2442
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612129 [doi]
AB  - The spindle pole body (SPB) of budding yeast duplicates once per cell cycle. In
      G1, the satellite, an SPB precursor, assembles next to the mother SPB (mSPB) on
      the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (NE). How the growing satellite
      subsequently inserts into the NE is an open question. To address this, we have
      uncoupled satellite growth from NE insertion. We show that the bridge structure
      that separates the mSPB from the satellite is a distance holder that prevents
      deleterious fusion of both structures. Binding of the gamma-tubulin receptor
      Spc110 to the central plaque from within the nucleus is important for NE
      insertion of the new SPB. Moreover, we provide evidence that a nuclear pore
      complex associates with the duplicating SPB and helps to insert the SPB into the 
      NE. After SPB insertion, membrane-associated proteins including the conserved
      Ndc1 encircle the SPB and retain it within the NE. Thus, uncoupling SPB growth
      from NE insertion unmasks functions of the duplication machinery.

      regulates synapse development and plasticity.
PG  - 2551-2564
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612042 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic spines are small postsynaptic compartments of excitatory synapses in
      the vertebrate brain that are modified during learning, aging, and neurological
      disorders. The formation and modification of dendritic spines depend on rapid
      assembly and dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in this highly
      compartmentalized space, but the precise mechanisms remain to be fully
      elucidated. In this study, we report that spatiotemporal enrichment of actin
      monomers (G-actin) in dendritic spines regulates spine development and
      plasticity. We first show that dendritic spines contain a locally enriched pool
      of G-actin that can be regulated by synaptic activity. We further find that this 
      G-actin pool functions in spine development and its modification during synaptic 
      plasticity. Mechanistically, the relatively immobile G-actin pool in spines
      depends on the phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 and involves the actin
      monomer-binding protein profilin. Together, our results have revealed a novel
      mechanism by which dynamic enrichment of G-actin in spines regulates the actin
      remodeling underlying synapse development and plasticity.

AB  - Despite abundant knowledge of the regulation and biochemistry of glycolytic
      enzymes, we have limited understanding on how they are spatially organized in the
      cell. Emerging evidence indicates that nonglycolytic metabolic enzymes regulating
      diverse pathways can assemble into polymers. We now show tetramer- and
      substrate-dependent filament assembly by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), which is
      considered the "gatekeeper" of glycolysis because it catalyzes the step
      committing glucose to breakdown. Recombinant liver PFK1 (PFKL) isoform, but not
      platelet PFK1 (PFKP) or muscle PFK1 (PFKM) isoforms, assembles into filaments.
      Negative-stain electron micrographs reveal that filaments are apolar and made of 
      stacked tetramers oriented with exposed catalytic sites positioned along the edge
      of the polymer. Electron micrographs and biochemical data with a PFKL/PFKP
      chimera indicate that the PFKL regulatory domain mediates filament assembly.
      Quantified live-cell imaging shows dynamic properties of localized PFKL puncta
      that are enriched at the plasma membrane. These findings reveal a new behavior of
      a key glycolytic enzyme with insights on spatial organization and
      isoform-specific glucose metabolism in cells.

TI  - Nuclear phosphorylated Dicer processes double-stranded RNA in response to DNA
      damage.
PG  - 2373-2389
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612131 [doi]
AB  - The endoribonuclease Dicer is a key component of the human RNA interference
      pathway and is known for its role in cytoplasmic microRNA production. Recent
      findings suggest that noncanonical Dicer generates small noncoding RNA to mediate
      the DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that human Dicer is phosphorylated
      in the platform-Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille-connector helix cassette (S1016) upon
      induction of DNA damage. Phosphorylated Dicer (p-Dicer) accumulates in the
      nucleus and is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks. We further demonstrate that
      turnover of damage-induced nuclear, double-stranded (ds) RNA requires additional 
      phosphorylation of carboxy-terminal Dicer residues (S1728 and S1852). DNA
      damage-induced nuclear Dicer accumulation is conserved in mammals. Dicer
      depletion causes endogenous DNA damage and delays the DDR by impaired recruitment
      of repair factors MDC1 and 53BP1. Collectively, we place Dicer within the context
      of the DDR by demonstrating a DNA damage-inducible phosphoswitch that causes
      localized processing of nuclear dsRNA by p-Dicer to promote DNA repair.

TI  - Regulation of RhoA by STAT3 coordinates glial scar formation.
PG  - 2533-2550
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610102 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of
      transcription-3 (STAT3) controls glial scar formation may have important clinical
      implications. We show that astrocytic STAT3 is associated with greater amounts of
      secreted MMP2, a crucial protease in scar formation. Moreover, we report that
      STAT3 inhibits the small GTPase RhoA and thereby controls actomyosin tonus,
      adhesion turnover, and migration of reactive astrocytes, as well as corralling of
      leukocytes in vitro. The inhibition of RhoA by STAT3 involves ezrin, the
      phosphorylation of which is reduced in STAT3-CKO astrocytes. Reduction of
      phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) levels in STAT3-CKO rescues reactive
      astrocytes dynamics in vitro. By specific targeting of lesion-proximal, reactive 
      astrocytes in Nestin-Cre mice, we show that reduction of PTEN rescues glial scar 
      formation in Nestin-Stat3(+/-) mice. These findings reveal novel intracellular
      signaling mechanisms underlying the contribution of reactive astrocyte dynamics
      to glial scar formation.

PG  - 2355-2371
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610071 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase can generate a novel telomere at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), an
      event called de novo telomere addition. How this activity is suppressed remains
      unclear. Combining single-molecule imaging and deep sequencing, we show that the 
      budding yeast telomerase RNA (TLC1 RNA) is spatially segregated to the nucleolus 
      and excluded from sites of DNA repair in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Although 
      TLC1 RNA accumulates in the nucleoplasm in G1/S, Pif1 activity promotes TLC1 RNA 
      localization in the nucleolus in G2/M. In the presence of DSBs, TLC1 RNA remains 
      nucleolar in most G2/M cells but accumulates in the nucleoplasm and colocalizes
      with DSBs in rad52Delta cells, leading to de novo telomere additions.
      Nucleoplasmic accumulation of TLC1 RNA depends on Cdc13 localization at DSBs and 
      on the SUMO ligase Siz1, which is required for de novo telomere addition in
      rad52Delta cells. This study reveals novel roles for Pif1, Rad52, and
      Siz1-dependent sumoylation in the spatial exclusion of telomerase from sites of
      DNA repair.

AB  - Specialized assembly factors facilitate the formation of many macromolecular
      complexes in vivo. The formation of Sm core structures of spliceosomal U-rich
      small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (UsnRNPs) requires assembly factors
      united in protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and survival motor neuron 
      (SMN) complexes. We demonstrate that perturbations of this assembly machinery
      trigger complex cellular responses that prevent aggregation of unassembled Sm
      proteins. Inactivation of the SMN complex results in the initial tailback of Sm
      proteins on the PRMT5 complex, followed by down-regulation of their encoding
      mRNAs. In contrast, reduction of pICln, a PRMT5 complex subunit, leads to the
      retention of newly synthesized Sm proteins on ribosomes and their subsequent
      lysosomal degradation. Overexpression of Sm proteins under these conditions
      results in a surplus of Sm proteins over pICln, promoting their aggregation. Our 
      studies identify an elaborate safeguarding system that prevents individual Sm
      proteins from aggregating, contributing to cellular UsnRNP homeostasis.

AB  - Fertilization occurs during female meiosis in most animals, which raises the
      question of what prevents the sperm DNA from interacting with the meiotic
      spindle. In this study, we find that Caenorhabditis elegans sperm DNA stays in a 
      fixed position at the opposite end of the embryo from the meiotic spindle while
      yolk granules are transported throughout the embryo by kinesin-1. In the absence 
      of F-actin, the sperm DNA, centrioles, and organelles were transported as a unit 
      with the yolk granules, resulting in sperm DNA within 2 microm of the meiotic
      spindle. F-actin imaging revealed a cytoplasmic meshwork that might restrict
      transport in a size-dependent manner. However, increasing yolk granule size did
      not slow their velocity, and the F-actin moved with the yolk granules. Instead,
      sperm contents connect to the cortical F-actin to prevent interaction with the
      meiotic spindle.

TI  - Autophagy gene FIP200 in neural progenitors non-cell autonomously controls
      differentiation by regulating microglia.
PG  - 2581-2596
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609093 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown important roles for autophagy genes in the regulation
      of different tissue stem cells, including neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs).
      However, little is known about whether autophagy can regulate NSCs through
      cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Here, we show that deletion of an essential autophagy 
      gene, FIP200, in NSCs increased expression of Ccl5 and Cxcl10 in a
      p53-independent manner, mediating increased infiltration of microglia into the
      subventricular zone of both FIP200hGFAP conditional knockout (cKO) and
      FIP200;p53hGFAP 2cKO mice. The microglia exhibited an activated M1 phenotype
      consistent with their potential to inhibit differentiation of FIP200-null NSCs.
      Blocking either microglia infiltration or activation rescued the deficient
      differentiation of FIP200-null NSCs from FIP200;p53hGFAP 2cKO mice. Lastly, we
      showed that increased chemokine expression in FIP200-null NSCs was induced by
      abnormal p62 aggregate formation and activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Our
      results suggest that autophagy plays a crucial role in regulating neurogenesis
      and restricting local immune response in postnatal NSCs through non-cell
      autonomous mechanisms.

AB  - In mitosis, cells undergo a precisely orchestrated series of spatiotemporal
      changes in cytoskeletal structure to divide their genetic material. These changes
      are coordinated by a sophisticated network of protein-protein interactions and
      posttranslational modifications. In this study, we report a bifurcation in a
      signaling cascade of the NIMA-related kinases (Neks) Nek6, Nek7, and Nek9 that is
      required for the localization and function of two kinesins essential for
      cytokinesis, Mklp2 and Kif14. We demonstrate that a Nek9, Nek6, and Mklp2
      signaling module controls the timely localization and bundling activity of Mklp2 
      at the anaphase central spindle. We further show that a separate Nek9, Nek7, and 
      Kif14 signaling module is required for the recruitment of the Rho-interacting
      kinase citron to the anaphase midzone. Our findings uncover an anaphase-specific 
      function for these effector kinesins that is controlled by specific Nek kinase
      signaling modules to properly coordinate cytokinesis.

AB  - Disturbances in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis create a condition termed 
      ER stress. This activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which alters the
      expression of many genes involved in ER quality control. We show here that ER
      stress causes the aggregation of proteins, most of which are not ER or secretory 
      pathway proteins. Proteomic analysis of the aggregated proteins revealed
      enrichment for intrinsically aggregation-prone proteins rather than proteins
      which are affected in a stress-specific manner. Aggregation does not arise
      because of overwhelming proteasome-mediated degradation but because of a general 
      disruption of cellular protein homeostasis. We further show that overexpression
      of certain chaperones abrogates protein aggregation and protects a UPR mutant
      against ER stress conditions. The onset of ER stress is known to correlate with
      various disease processes, and our data indicate that widespread amorphous and
      amyloid protein aggregation is an unanticipated outcome of such stress.

TI  - Activity-dependent trafficking of lysosomes in dendrites and dendritic spines.
PG  - 2499-2513
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201704068 [doi]
AB  - In neurons, lysosomes, which degrade membrane and cytoplasmic components, are
      thought to primarily reside in somatic and axonal compartments, but there is
      little understanding of their distribution and function in dendrites. Here, we
      used conventional and two-photon imaging and electron microscopy to show that
      lysosomes traffic bidirectionally in dendrites and are present in dendritic
      spines. We find that lysosome inhibition alters their mobility and also decreases
      dendritic spine number. Furthermore, perturbing microtubule and actin
      cytoskeletal dynamics has an inverse relationship on the distribution and
      motility of lysosomes in dendrites. We also find trafficking of lysosomes is
      correlated with synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
      acid-type glutamate receptors. Strikingly, lysosomes traffic to dendritic spines 
      in an activity-dependent manner and can be recruited to individual spines in
      response to local activation. These data indicate the position of lysosomes is
      regulated by synaptic activity and thus plays an instructive role in the turnover
      of synaptic membrane proteins.

TI  - CRMP-1 enhances EVL-mediated actin elongation to build lamellipodia and the actin
      cortex.
PG  - 2463-2479
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606084 [doi]
AB  - Cells can control actin polymerization by nucleating new filaments or elongating 
      existing ones. We recently identified CRMP-1 as a factor that stimulates the
      formation of Listeria monocytogenes actin comet tails, thereby implicating it in 
      actin assembly. We now show that CRMP-1 is a major contributor to actin assembly 
      in epithelial cells, where it works with the Ena/VASP family member EVL to
      assemble the actin cytoskeleton in the apical cortex and in protruding
      lamellipodia. CRMP-1 and EVL bind to one another and together accelerate actin
      filament barbed-end elongation. CRMP-1 also stimulates actin assembly in the
      presence of VASP and Mena in vitro, but CRMP-1-dependent actin assembly in MDCK
      cells is EVL specific. Our results identify CRMP-1 as a novel regulator of actin 
      filament elongation and reveal a surprisingly important role for CRMP-1, EVL, and
      actin polymerization in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial
      sheets.

TI  - The G protein-coupled receptor GPR31 promotes membrane association of KRAS.
PG  - 2329-2338
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609096 [doi]
AB  - The product of the KRAS oncogene, KRAS4B, promotes tumor growth when associated
      with the plasma membrane (PM). PM association is mediated, in part, by
      farnesylation of KRAS4B, but trafficking of nascent KRAS4B to the PM is
      incompletely understood. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify genes
      required for KRAS4B membrane association and identified a G protein-coupled
      receptor, GPR31. GPR31 associated with KRAS4B on cellular membranes in a
      farnesylation-dependent fashion, and retention of GPR31 on the endoplasmic
      reticulum inhibited delivery of KRAS4B to the PM. Silencing of GPR31 expression
      partially mislocalized KRAS4B, slowed the growth of KRAS-dependent tumor cells,
      and blocked KRAS-stimulated macropinocytosis. Our data suggest that GPR31 acts as
      a secretory pathway chaperone for KRAS4B.

AB  - Microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs), known as centrosomes in animals and
      spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in fungi, are important for the faithful distribution 
      of chromosomes between daughter cells during mitosis as well as for other
      cellular functions. The cytoplasmic duplication cycle and regulation of the
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe SPB is analogous to centrosomes, making it an ideal
      model to study MTOC assembly. Here, we use superresolution structured
      illumination microscopy with single-particle averaging to localize 14 S. pombe
      SPB components and regulators, determining both the relationship of proteins to
      each other within the SPB and how each protein is assembled into a new structure 
      during SPB duplication. These data enabled us to build the first comprehensive
      molecular model of the S. pombe SPB, resulting in structural and functional
      insights not ascertained through investigations of individual subunits, including
      functional similarities between Ppc89 and the budding yeast SPB scaffold Spc42,
      distribution of Sad1 to a ring-like structure and multiple modes of Mto1
      recruitment.

AB  - Partitioning of cell organelles and cytoplasmic components determines the fate of
      daughter cells upon asymmetric division. We studied the role of mitochondria in
      this process using budding yeast as a model. Anterograde mitochondrial transport 
      is mediated by the myosin motor, Myo2. A genetic screen revealed an unexpected
      interaction of MYO2 and genes required for mitochondrial fusion. Genetic
      analyses, live-cell microscopy, and simulations in silico showed that fused
      mitochondria become critical for inheritance and transport across the bud neck in
      myo2 mutants. Similarly, fused mitochondria are essential for retention in the
      mother when bud-directed transport is enforced. Inheritance of a less than
      critical mitochondrial quantity causes a severe decline of replicative life span 
      of daughter cells. Myo2-dependent mitochondrial distribution also is critical for
      the capture of heat stress-induced cytosolic protein aggregates and their
      retention in the mother cell. Together, these data suggest that coordination of
      mitochondrial transport, fusion, and fission is critical for asymmetric division 
      and rejuvenation of daughter cells.

PG  - 2075-2090
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611144 [doi]
AB  - Adaptation to environmental stress is critical for cell survival. Adaptation
      generally occurs via changes in transcription and translation. However, there is 
      a time lag before changes in gene expression, which suggests that more rapid
      mechanisms likely exist. In this study, we show that in yeast, the
      cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85/CDK5 provides protection against hyperosmotic
      stress and acts before long-term adaptation provided by Hog1. This protection
      requires the vacuolar/endolysosomal signaling lipid PI3,5P2 We show that
      Pho85/CDK5 directly phosphorylates and positively regulates the PI3P-5 kinase
      Fab1/PIKfyve complex and provide evidence that this regulation is conserved in
      mammalian cells. Moreover, this regulation is particularly crucial in yeast for
      the stress-induced transient elevation of PI3,5P2 Our study reveals a rapid
      protection mechanism regulated by Pho85/CDK5 via signaling from the
      vacuole/lysosome, which is distinct temporally and spatially from the previously 
      discovered long-term adaptation Hog1 pathway, which signals from the nucleus.

PG  - 2217-2230
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601109 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recently reported as crucial mediators in 
      cell-to-cell communication in development and disease. In this study, we
      investigate whether mesenchymal stromal cells that constitute a supportive
      microenvironment for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) released EVs
      that could affect the gene expression and function of HSPCs. By taking advantage 
      of two fetal liver-derived stromal lines with widely differing abilities to
      maintain HSPCs ex vivo, we demonstrate that stromal EVs play a critical role in
      the regulation of HSPCs. Both supportive and nonsupportive stromal lines secreted
      EVs, but only those delivered by the supportive line were taken up by HSPCs ex
      vivo and in vivo. These EVs harbored a specific molecular signature, modulated
      the gene expression in HSPCs after uptake, and maintained the survival and
      clonogenic potential of HSPCs, presumably by preventing apoptosis. In conclusion,
      our study reveals that EVs are an important component of the HSPC niche, which
      may have major applications in regenerative medicine.

TI  - BAIAP3, a C2 domain-containing Munc13 protein, controls the fate of dense-core
      vesicles in neuroendocrine cells.
PG  - 2151-2166
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702099 [doi]
AB  - Dense-core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis is a SNARE (soluble
      N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor)-dependent
      anterograde trafficking pathway that requires multiple proteins for regulation.
      Several C2 domain-containing proteins are known to regulate Ca(2+)-dependent DCV 
      exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. In this study, we identified others by
      screening all ( approximately 139) human C2 domain-containing proteins by RNA
      interference in neuroendocrine cells. 40 genes were identified, including several
      encoding proteins with known roles (CAPS [calcium-dependent activator protein for
      secretion 1], Munc13-2, RIM1, and SYT10) and many with unknown roles. One of the 
      latter, BAIAP3, is a secretory cell-specific Munc13-4 paralog of unknown
      function. BAIAP3 knockdown caused accumulation of fusion-incompetent DCVs in BON 
      neuroendocrine cells and lysosomal degradation (crinophagy) of insulin-containing
      DCVs in INS-1 beta cells. BAIAP3 localized to endosomes was required for Golgi
      trans-Golgi network 46 (TGN46) recycling, exhibited Ca(2+)-stimulated
      interactions with TGN SNAREs, and underwent Ca(2+)-stimulated TGN recruitment.
      Thus, unlike other Munc13 proteins, BAIAP3 functions indirectly in DCV exocytosis
      by affecting DCV maturation through its role in DCV protein recycling. Ca(2+)
      rises that stimulate DCV exocytosis may stimulate BAIAP3-dependent retrograde
      trafficking to maintain DCV protein homeostasis and DCV function.

TI  - Caspase-8 controls the secretion of inflammatory lysyl-tRNA synthetase in
      exosomes from cancer cells.
PG  - 2201-2216
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605118 [doi]
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs), enzymes that normally control protein
      synthesis, can be secreted and have different activities in the extracellular
      space, but the mechanism of their secretion is not understood. This study
      describes the secretion route of the ARS lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS) and how this
      process is regulated by caspase activity, which has been implicated in the
      unconventional secretion of other proteins. We show that KRS is secreted from
      colorectal carcinoma cells within the lumen of exosomes that can trigger an
      inflammatory response. Caspase-8 cleaved the N-terminal of KRS, thus exposing a
      PDZ-binding motif located in the C terminus of KRS. Syntenin bound to the exposed
      PDZ-binding motif of KRS and facilitated the exosomic secretion of KRS
      dissociated from the multi-tRNA synthetase complex. KRS-containing exosomes
      released by cancer cells induced macrophage migration, and their secretion of
      TNF-alpha and cleaved KRS made a significant contribution to these activities,
      which suggests a novel mechanism by which caspase-8 may promote inflammation.

AB  - Impaired nutrient sensing and dysregulated glucose homeostasis are common in
      diabetes. However, how nutrient-sensitive signaling components control glucose
      homeostasis and beta cell survival under diabetic stress is not well understood. 
      Here, we show that mice lacking the core nutrient-sensitive signaling component
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in beta cells exhibit reduced beta cell mass
      and smaller islets. mTOR deficiency leads to a severe reduction in beta cell
      survival and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress in chemical-induced
      diabetes. Mechanistically, we find that mTOR associates with the
      carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP)-Max-like protein complex
      and inhibits its transcriptional activity, leading to decreased expression of
      thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a potent inducer of beta cell death and 
      oxidative stress. Consistent with this, the levels of TXNIP and ChREBP were
      highly elevated in human diabetic islets and mTOR-deficient mouse islets. Thus,
      our results suggest that a nutrient-sensitive mTOR-regulated transcriptional
      network could be a novel target to improve beta cell survival and glucose
      homeostasis in diabetes.

TI  - Polarity of varicosity initiation in central neuron mechanosensation.
PG  - 2179-2199
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606065 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about mechanical regulation of morphological and functional
      polarity of central neurons. In this study, we report that mechanical stress
      specifically induces varicosities in the axons but not the dendrites of central
      neurons by activating TRPV4, a Ca(2+)/Na(+)-permeable mechanosensitive channel.
      This process is unexpectedly rapid and reversible, consistent with the formation 
      of axonal varicosities in vivo induced by mechanical impact in a mouse model of
      mild traumatic brain injury. In contrast, prolonged stimulation of glutamate
      receptors induces varicosities in dendrites but not in axons. We further show
      that axonal varicosities are induced by persistent Ca(2+) increase, disassembled 
      microtubules (MTs), and subsequently reversible disruption of axonal transport,
      and are regulated by stable tubulin-only polypeptide, an MT-associated protein.
      Finally, axonal varicosity initiation can trigger action potentials to
      antidromically propagate to the soma in retrograde signaling. Therefore, our
      study demonstrates a new feature of neuronal polarity: axons and dendrites
      preferentially respond to physical and chemical stresses, respectively.

PG  - 2011-2025
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606047 [doi]
AB  - RAS association domain family 4 (RASSF4) is involved in tumorigenesis and
      regulation of the Hippo pathway. In this study, we identify new functional roles 
      of RASSF4. First, we discovered that RASSF4 regulates store-operated Ca(2+) entry
      (SOCE), a fundamental Ca(2+) signaling mechanism, by affecting the translocation 
      of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) sensor stromal interaction molecule 1
      (STIM1) to ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions. It was further revealed that RASSF4
      regulates the formation of ER-PM junctions and the ER-PM tethering function of
      extended synaptotagmins E-Syt2 and E-Syt3. Moreover, steady-state PM
      phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2) levels, important for
      localization of STIM1 and E-Syts at ER-PM junctions, were reduced in
      RASSF4-knockdown cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RASSF4 interacts with
      and regulates the activity of adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6),
      a small G protein and upstream regulator of type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate
      kinases (PIP5Ks) and PM PI(4,5)P2 levels. Overall, our study suggests that RASSF4
      controls SOCE and ER-PM junctions through ARF6-dependent regulation of PM
      PI(4,5)P2 levels, pivotal for a variety of physiological processes.

      membrane remodeling in live animals.

AB  - Membrane remodeling plays a fundamental role during a variety of biological
      events. However, the dynamics and the molecular mechanisms regulating this
      process within cells in mammalian tissues in situ remain largely unknown. In this
      study, we use intravital subcellular microscopy in live mice to study the role of
      the actomyosin cytoskeleton in driving the remodeling of membranes of large
      secretory granules, which are integrated into the plasma membrane during
      regulated exocytosis. We show that two isoforms of nonmuscle myosin II, NMIIA and
      NMIIB, control distinct steps of the integration process. Furthermore, we find
      that F-actin is not essential for the recruitment of NMII to the secretory
      granules but plays a key role in the assembly and activation of NMII into
      contractile filaments. Our data support a dual role for the actomyosin
      cytoskeleton in providing the mechanical forces required to remodel the lipid
      bilayer and serving as a scaffold to recruit key regulatory molecules.

TI  - Cellular differentiation state modulates the mRNA export activity of SR proteins.
PG  - 1993-2009
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610051 [doi]
AB  - SR proteins function in nuclear pre-mRNA processing, mRNA export, and
      translation. To investigate their cellular dynamics, we developed a quantitative 
      assay, which detects differences in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling among seven
      canonical SR protein family members. As expected, SRSF2 and SRSF5 shuttle poorly 
      in HeLa cells but surprisingly display considerable shuttling in pluripotent
      murine P19 cells. Combining individual-resolution cross-linking and
      immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) and mass spectrometry, we show that elevated arginine
      methylation of SRSF5 and lower phosphorylation levels of cobound SRSF2 enhance
      shuttling of SRSF5 in P19 cells by modulating protein-protein and protein-RNA
      interactions. Moreover, SRSF5 is bound to pluripotency-specific transcripts such 
      as Lin28a and Pou5f1/Oct4 in the cytoplasm. SRSF5 depletion reduces and
      overexpression increases their cytoplasmic mRNA levels, suggesting that enhanced 
      mRNA export by SRSF5 is required for the expression of pluripotency factors.
      Remarkably, neural differentiation of P19 cells leads to dramatically reduced
      SRSF5 shuttling. Our findings indicate that posttranslational modification of SR 
      proteins underlies the regulation of their mRNA export activities and
      distinguishes pluripotent from differentiated cells.

PG  - 2167-2177
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612040 [doi]
AB  - Ubiquitinated plasma membrane proteins (cargo) are delivered to endosomes and
      sorted by endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery into
      endosome intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) for degradation. In contrast to the current
      model that postulates that ILVs form individually from inward budding of the
      endosomal limiting membrane, plant ILVs form as networks of concatenated vesicle 
      buds by a novel vesiculation mechanism. We ran computational simulations based on
      experimentally derived diffusion coefficients of an ESCRT cargo protein and
      electron tomograms of Arabidopsis thaliana endosomes to measure cargo escape from
      budding ILVs. We found that 50% of the ESCRT cargo would escape from a single
      budding profile in 5-20 ms and from three concatenated ILVs in 80-200 ms. These
      short cargo escape times predict the need for strong diffusion barriers in ILVs. 
      Consistent with a potential role as a diffusion barrier, we find that the
      ESCRT-III protein SNF7 remains associated with ILVs and is delivered to the
      vacuole for degradation.

PG  - 2131-2150
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611138 [doi]
AB  - Primary cilia perceive the extracellular environment through receptors localized 
      in the ciliary membrane, but mechanisms directing specific proteins to this
      domain are poorly understood. To address this question, we knocked down proteins 
      potentially important for ciliary membrane targeting and determined how this
      affects the ciliary trafficking of fibrocystin, polycystin-2, and smoothened. Our
      analysis showed that fibrocystin and polycystin-2 are dependent on IFT20,
      GMAP210, and the exocyst complex, while smoothened delivery is largely
      independent of these components. In addition, we found that polycystin-2, but not
      smoothened or fibrocystin, requires the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles
      complex-1 (BLOC-1) for ciliary delivery. Consistent with the role of BLOC-1 in
      sorting from the endosome, we find that disrupting the recycling endosome reduces
      ciliary polycystin-2 and causes its accumulation in the recycling endosome. This 
      is the first demonstration of a role for BLOC-1 in ciliary assembly and
      highlights the complexity of pathways taken to the cilium.

TI  - Dynein is regulated by the stability of its microtubule track.
PG  - 2047-2058
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611105 [doi]
AB  - How dynein motors accurately move cargoes is an important question. In budding
      yeast, dynein moves the mitotic spindle to the predetermined site of cytokinesis 
      by pulling on astral microtubules. In this study, using high-resolution imaging
      in living cells, we discover that spindle movement is regulated by changes in
      microtubule plus-end dynamics that occur when dynein generates force. Mutants
      that increase plus-end stability increase the frequency and duration of spindle
      movements, causing positioning errors. We find that dynein plays a primary role
      in regulating microtubule dynamics by destabilizing microtubules. In contrast,
      the dynactin complex counteracts dynein and stabilizes microtubules through a
      mechanism involving the shoulder subcomplex and the cytoskeletal-associated
      protein glycine-rich domain of Nip100/p150(glued) Our results support a model in 
      which dynein destabilizes its microtubule substrate by using its motility to
      deplete dynactin from the plus end. We propose that interplay among dynein,
      dynactin, and the stability of the microtubule substrate creates a mechanism that
      regulates accurate spindle positioning.

TI  - Histone demethylase KDM5A regulates the ZMYND8-NuRD chromatin remodeler to
      promote DNA repair.
PG  - 1959-1974
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611135 [doi]
AB  - Upon DNA damage, histone modifications are dynamically reshaped to accommodate
      DNA damage signaling and repair within chromatin. In this study, we report the
      identification of the histone demethylase KDM5A as a key regulator of the
      bromodomain protein ZMYND8 and NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone
      deacetylation) complex in the DNA damage response. We observe KDM5A-dependent
      H3K4me3 demethylation within chromatin near DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites. 
      Mechanistically, demethylation of H3K4me3 is required for ZMYND8-NuRD binding to 
      chromatin and recruitment to DNA damage. Functionally, KDM5A deficiency results
      in impaired transcriptional silencing and repair of DSBs by homologous
      recombination. Thus, this study identifies a crucial function for KDM5A in
      demethylating H3K4 to allow ZMYND8-NuRD to operate within damaged chromatin to
      repair DSBs.

TI  - Persistent mTORC1 signaling in cell senescence results from defects in amino acid
      and growth factor sensing.
PG  - 1949-1957
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610113 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and cell senescence are
      intimately linked to each other and to organismal aging. Inhibition of mTORC1 is 
      the best-known intervention to extend lifespan, and recent evidence suggests that
      clearance of senescent cells can also improve health and lifespan. Enhanced
      mTORC1 activity drives characteristic phenotypes of senescence, although the
      underlying mechanisms responsible for increased activity are not well understood.
      We have identified that in human fibroblasts rendered senescent by stress,
      replicative exhaustion, or oncogene activation, mTORC1 is constitutively active
      and resistant to serum and amino acid starvation. This is driven in part by
      depolarization of senescent cell plasma membrane, which leads to primary cilia
      defects and a resultant failure to inhibit growth factor signaling. Further,
      increased autophagy and high levels of intracellular amino acids may act to
      support mTORC1 activity in starvation conditions. Interventions to correct these 
      phenotypes restore sensitivity to the mTORC1 signaling pathway and cause death,
      indicating that persistent signaling supports senescent cell survival.

AB  - Mitochondrial stress activates a mitonuclear response to safeguard and repair
      mitochondrial function and to adapt cellular metabolism to stress. Using a
      multiomics approach in mammalian cells treated with four types of mitochondrial
      stressors, we identify activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as the main
      regulator of the stress response. Surprisingly, canonical mitochondrial unfolded 
      protein response genes mediated by ATF5 are not activated. Instead, ATF4
      activates the expression of cytoprotective genes, which reprogram cellular
      metabolism through activation of the integrated stress response (ISR).
      Mitochondrial stress promotes a local proteostatic response by reducing
      mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, inhibiting mitochondrial translation, and
      coupling the activation of the ISR with the attenuation of mitochondrial
      function. Through a trans-expression quantitative trait locus analysis, we
      provide genetic evidence supporting a role for Fh1 in the control of Atf4
      expression in mammals. Using gene expression data from mice and humans with
      mitochondrial diseases, we show that the ATF4 pathway is activated in vivo upon
      mitochondrial stress. Our data illustrate the value of a multiomics approach to
      characterize complex cellular networks and provide a versatile resource to
      identify new regulators of mitochondrial-related diseases.

TI  - Hsc70 chaperone activity is required for the cytosolic slow axonal transport of
      synapsin.
PG  - 2059-2074
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604028 [doi]
AB  - Soluble cytosolic proteins vital to axonal and presynaptic function are
      synthesized in the neuronal soma and conveyed via slow axonal transport. Our
      previous studies suggest that the overall slow transport of synapsin is mediated 
      by dynamic assembly/disassembly of cargo complexes followed by short-range
      vectorial transit (the "dynamic recruitment" model). However, neither the
      composition of these complexes nor the mechanistic basis for the dynamic behavior
      is understood. In this study, we first examined putative cargo complexes
      associated with synapsin using coimmunoprecipitation and multidimensional protein
      identification technology mass spectrometry (MS). MS data indicate that synapsin 
      is part of a multiprotein complex enriched in chaperones/cochaperones including
      Hsc70. Axonal synapsin-Hsc70 coclusters are also visualized by two-color
      superresolution microscopy. Inhibition of Hsc70 ATPase activity blocked the slow 
      transport of synapsin, disrupted axonal synapsin organization, and attenuated
      Hsc70-synapsin associations, advocating a model where Hsc70 activity dynamically 
      clusters cytosolic proteins into cargo complexes, allowing transport.
      Collectively, our study offers insight into the molecular organization of
      cytosolic transport complexes and identifies a novel regulator of slow transport.

TI  - TRPM8 inhibits endothelial cell migration via a non-channel function by trapping 
      the small GTPase Rap1.
PG  - 2107-2130
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506024 [doi]
AB  - Endothelial cell adhesion and migration are critical steps of the angiogenic
      process, whose dysfunction is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. The
      TRPM8 channel has recently been proposed to play a protective role in prostate
      cancer by impairing cell motility. However, the mechanisms by which it could
      influence vascular behavior are unknown. Here, we reveal a novel non-channel
      function for TRPM8 that unexpectedly acts as a Rap1 GTPase inhibitor, thereby
      inhibiting endothelial cell motility, independently of pore function. TRPM8
      retains Rap1 intracellularly through direct protein-protein interaction, thus
      preventing its cytoplasm-plasma membrane trafficking. In turn, this mechanism
      impairs the activation of a major inside-out signaling pathway that triggers the 
      conformational activation of integrin and, consequently, cell adhesion,
      migration, in vitro endothelial tube formation, and spheroid sprouting. Our
      results bring to light a novel, pore-independent molecular mechanism by which
      endogenous TRPM8 expression inhibits Rap1 GTPase and thus plays a critical role
      in the behavior of vascular endothelial cells by inhibiting migration.

AB  - Eukaryotic genomes are replicated in a reproducible temporal order; however, the 
      physiological significance is poorly understood. We compared replication timing
      in divergent yeast species and identified genomic features with conserved
      replication times. Histone genes were among the earliest replicating loci in all 
      species. We specifically delayed the replication of HTA1-HTB1 and discovered that
      this halved the expression of these histone genes. Finally, we showed that
      histone and cell cycle genes in general are exempt from Rtt109-dependent dosage
      compensation, suggesting the existence of pathways excluding specific loci from
      dosage compensation mechanisms. Thus, we have uncovered one of the first
      physiological requirements for regulated replication time and demonstrated a
      direct link between replication timing and gene expression.

TI  - Nesprin 1alpha2 is essential for mouse postnatal viability and nuclear
      positioning in skeletal muscle.
PG  - 1915-1924
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612128 [doi]
AB  - The position of the nucleus in a cell is controlled by interactions between the
      linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex and the cytoskeleton.
      Defects in nuclear positioning and abnormal aggregation of nuclei occur in many
      muscle diseases and correlate with muscle dysfunction. Nesprin 1, which includes 
      multiple isoforms, is an integral component of the LINC complex, critical for
      nuclear positioning and anchorage in skeletal muscle, and is thought to provide
      an essential link between nuclei and actin. However, previous studies have yet to
      identify which isoform is responsible. To elucidate this, we generated a series
      of nesprin 1 mutant mice. We showed that the actin-binding domains of nesprin 1
      were dispensable, whereas nesprin 1alpha2, which lacks actin-binding domains, was
      crucial for postnatal viability, nuclear positioning, and skeletal muscle
      function. Furthermore, we revealed that kinesin 1 was displaced in fibers of
      nesprin 1alpha2-knockout mice, suggesting that this interaction may play an
      important role in positioning of myonuclei and functional skeletal muscle.

TI  - Histone chaperone HIRA regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation and
      neurogenesis via beta-catenin.
PG  - 1975-1992
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610014 [doi]
AB  - Histone cell cycle regulator (HIRA) is a histone chaperone and has been
      identified as an epigenetic regulator. Subsequent studies have provided evidence 
      that HIRA plays key roles in embryonic development, but its function during early
      neurogenesis remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that HIRA is enriched in
      neural progenitor cells, and HIRA knockdown reduces neural progenitor cell
      proliferation, increases terminal mitosis and cell cycle exit, and ultimately
      results in premature neuronal differentiation. Additionally, we demonstrate that 
      HIRA enhances beta-catenin expression by recruiting H3K4 trimethyltransferase
      Setd1A, which increases H3K4me3 levels and heightens the promoter activity of
      beta-catenin. Significantly, overexpression of HIRA, HIRA N-terminal domain, or
      beta-catenin can override neurogenesis abnormities caused by HIRA defects.
      Collectively, these data implicate that HIRA, cooperating with Setd1A, modulates 
      beta-catenin expression and then regulates neurogenesis. This finding represents 
      a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying the histone code and has profound and
      lasting implications for diseases and neurobiology.

PG  - 1895-1906
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611113 [doi]
AB  - Synapses are functionally distinct neuronal compartments that are critical for
      brain function, with synaptic dysfunction being an early pathological feature in 
      aging and disease. Given the large number of proteins needed for synaptic
      function, the proliferation of defective proteins and the subsequent loss of
      protein homeostasis may be a leading cause of synaptic dysfunction. Autophagic
      mechanisms are cellular digestion processes that recycle cellular components and 
      contribute to protein homeostasis. Autophagy is important within the nervous
      system, but its function in specific compartments such as the synapse has been
      unclear. Evidence from research on both autophagy and synaptic function suggests 
      that there are links between the two and that synaptic homeostasis during aging
      requires autophagy to regulate protein homeostasis. Exciting new work on
      autophagy-modulating proteins that are enriched at the synapse has begun to link 
      autophagy to synapses and synaptic dysfunction in disease. A better understanding
      of these links will help us harness the potential therapeutic benefits of
      autophagy in combating age-related disorders of the nervous system.

TI  - Rab2 promotes autophagic and endocytic lysosomal degradation.
PG  - 1937-1947
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611027 [doi]
AB  - Rab7 promotes fusion of autophagosomes and late endosomes with lysosomes in yeast
      and metazoan cells, acting together with its effector, the tethering complex
      HOPS. Here we show that another small GTPase, Rab2, is also required for
      autophagosome and endosome maturation and proper lysosome function in Drosophila 
      melanogaster We demonstrate that Rab2 binds to HOPS, and that its active,
      GTP-locked form associates with autolysosomes. Importantly, expression of active 
      Rab2 promotes autolysosomal fusions unlike that of GTP-locked Rab7, suggesting
      that its amount is normally rate limiting. We also demonstrate that RAB2A is
      required for autophagosome clearance in human breast cancer cells. In conclusion,
      we identify Rab2 as a key factor for autophagic and endocytic cargo delivery to
      and degradation in lysosomes.

TI  - Spindle assembly checkpoint satisfaction occurs via end-on but not lateral
      attachments under tension.
PG  - 1533-1542
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611104 [doi]
AB  - To ensure accurate chromosome segregation, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) 
      prevents anaphase until all kinetochores attach to the spindle. What signals the 
      SAC monitors remains unclear. We do not know the contributions of different
      microtubule attachment features or tension from biorientation to SAC satisfaction
      nor how these possible cues change during attachment. In this study, we quantify 
      concurrent Mad1 intensity and report on SAC silencing, real-time attachment
      geometry, occupancy, and tension at individual mammalian kinetochores. We show
      that Mad1 loss from the kinetochore is switch-like with robust kinetics and that 
      tension across sister kinetochores is established just before Mad1 loss events at
      the first sister. We demonstrate that CenpE-mediated lateral attachment of the
      second sister can persistently generate this metaphase-like tension before
      biorientation, likely stabilizing sister end-on attachment, yet cannot induce
      Mad1 loss from that kinetochore. Instead, Mad1 loss begins after several end-on
      microtubules attach. Thus, end-on attachment provides geometry-specific molecular
      cues or force on specific kinetochore linkages that other attachment geometries
      cannot provide.

TI  - Assembly of the U5 snRNP component PRPF8 is controlled by the HSP90/R2TP
      chaperones.
PG  - 1579-1596
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701165 [doi]
AB  - Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of five major small nuclear
      ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). The pre-mRNA splicing factor PRPF8 is a
      crucial component of the U5 snRNP, and together with EFTUD2 and SNRNP200, it
      forms a central module of the spliceosome. Using quantitative proteomics, we
      identified assembly intermediates containing PRPF8, EFTUD2, and SNRNP200 in
      association with the HSP90/R2TP complex, its ZNHIT2 cofactor, and additional
      proteins. HSP90 and R2TP bind unassembled U5 proteins in the cytoplasm, stabilize
      them, and promote the formation of the U5 snRNP. We further found that PRPF8
      mutants causing Retinitis pigmentosa assemble less efficiently with the U5 snRNP 
      and bind more strongly to R2TP, with one mutant retained in the cytoplasm in an
      R2TP-dependent manner. We propose that the HSP90/R2TP chaperone system promotes
      the assembly of a key module of U5 snRNP while assuring the quality control of
      PRPF8. The proteomics data further reveal new interactions between R2TP and the
      tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), pointing to a potential link between growth
      signals and the assembly of key cellular machines.

      formation.
PG  - 1641-1657
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610090 [doi]
AB  - XMAP215, CLASP, and Crescerin use arrayed tubulin-binding tumor overexpressed
      gene (TOG) domains to modulate microtubule dynamics. We hypothesized that TOGs
      have distinct architectures and tubulin-binding properties that underlie each
      family's ability to promote microtubule polymerization or pause. As a model, we
      investigated the pentameric TOG array of a Drosophila melanogaster XMAP215
      member, Msps. We found that Msps TOGs have distinct architectures that bind
      either free or polymerized tubulin, and that a polarized array drives microtubule
      polymerization. An engineered TOG1-2-5 array fully supported Msps-dependent
      microtubule polymerase activity. Requisite for this activity was a TOG5-specific 
      N-terminal HEAT repeat that engaged microtubule lattice-incorporated tubulin.
      TOG5-microtubule binding maintained mitotic spindle formation as deleting or
      mutating TOG5 compromised spindle architecture and increased the mitotic index.
      Mad2 knockdown released the spindle assembly checkpoint triggered when
      TOG5-microtubule binding was compromised, indicating that TOG5 is essential for
      spindle function. Our results reveal a TOG5-specific role in mitotic fidelity and
      support our hypothesis that architecturally distinct TOGs arranged in a
      sequence-specific order underlie TOG array microtubule regulator activity.

PG  - 1543-1556
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609095 [doi]
AB  - Efficient collective migration depends on a balance between contractility and
      cytoskeletal rearrangements, adhesion, and mechanical cell-cell communication,
      all controlled by GTPases of the RHO family. By comprehensive screening of
      guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in human bronchial epithelial cell
      monolayers, we identified GEFs that are required for collective migration at
      large, such as SOS1 and beta-PIX, and RHOA GEFs that are implicated in
      intercellular communication. Down-regulation of the latter GEFs differentially
      enhanced front-to-back propagation of guidance cues through the monolayer and was
      mirrored by down-regulation of RHOA expression and myosin II activity.
      Phenotype-based clustering of knockdown behaviors identified RHOA-ARHGEF18 and
      ARHGEF3-ARHGEF28-ARHGEF11 clusters, indicating that the latter may signal through
      other RHO-family GTPases. Indeed, knockdown of RHOC produced an intermediate
      between the two phenotypes. We conclude that for effective collective migration, 
      the RHOA-GEFs --> RHOA/C --> actomyosin pathways must be optimally tuned to
      compromise between generation of motility forces and restriction of intercellular
      communication.

TI  - The chromokinesin Klp3a and microtubules facilitate acentric chromosome
      segregation.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604079 [doi]
AB  - Although poleward segregation of acentric chromosomes is well documented, the
      underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that
      microtubules play a key role in poleward movement of acentric chromosome
      fragments generated in Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts. Acentrics segregate
      with either telomeres leading or lagging in equal frequency and are
      preferentially associated with peripheral bundled microtubules. In addition,
      laser ablation studies demonstrate that segregating acentrics are mechanically
      associated with microtubules. Finally, we show that successful acentric
      segregation requires the chromokinesin Klp3a. Reduced Klp3a function results in
      disorganized interpolar microtubules and shortened spindles. Normally, acentric
      poleward segregation occurs at the periphery of the spindle in association with
      interpolar microtubules. In klp3a mutants, acentrics fail to localize and
      segregate along the peripheral interpolar microtubules and are abnormally
      positioned in the spindle interior. These studies demonstrate an unsuspected role
      for interpolar microtubules in driving acentric segregation.

TI  - UPR transducer BBF2H7 allows export of type II collagen in a cargo- and
      developmental stage-specific manner.
PG  - 1761-1774
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609100 [doi]
AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) handles unfolded/misfolded proteins
      accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, it is unclear how
      vertebrates correctly use the total of ten UPR transducers. We have found that ER
      stress occurs physiologically during early embryonic development in medaka fish
      and that the smooth alignment of notochord cells requires ATF6 as a UPR
      transducer, which induces ER chaperones for folding of type VIII (short-chain)
      collagen. After secretion of hedgehog for tissue patterning, notochord cells
      differentiate into sheath cells, which synthesize type II collagen. In this
      study, we show that this vacuolization step requires both ATF6 and BBF2H7 as UPR 
      transducers and that BBF2H7 regulates a complete set of genes (Sec23/24/13/31,
      Tango1, Sedlin, and KLHL12) essential for the enlargement of COPII vesicles to
      accommodate long-chain collagen for export, leading to the formation of the
      perinotochordal basement membrane. Thus, the most appropriate UPR transducer is
      activated to cope with the differing physiological ER stresses of different
      content types depending on developmental stage.

AB  - Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1) causes combined hearing and sight defects, but how
      mutations in USH1 genes lead to retinal dystrophy in patients remains elusive.
      The USH1 protein complex is associated with calyceal processes, which are
      microvilli of unknown function surrounding the base of the photoreceptor outer
      segment. We show that in Xenopus tropicalis, these processes are connected to the
      outer-segment membrane by links composed of protocadherin-15 (USH1F protein).
      Protocadherin-15 deficiency, obtained by a knockdown approach, leads to impaired 
      photoreceptor function and abnormally shaped photoreceptor outer segments. Rod
      basal outer disks displayed excessive outgrowth, and cone outer segments were
      curved, with lamellae of heterogeneous sizes, defects also observed upon
      knockdown of Cdh23, encoding cadherin-23 (USH1D protein). The calyceal processes 
      were virtually absent in cones and displayed markedly reduced F-actin content in 
      rods, suggesting that protocadherin-15-containing links are essential for their
      development and/or maintenance. We propose that calyceal processes, together with
      their associated links, control the sizing of rod disks and cone lamellae
      throughout their daily renewal.

AB  - Kinetochores mediate chromosome congression by either sliding along the lattice
      of spindle microtubules or forming end-on attachments to their depolymerizing
      plus-ends. By following the fates of individual kinetochores as they congress in 
      live cells, we reveal that the Ska complex is required for a distinct substep of 
      the depolymerization-coupled pulling mechanism. Ska depletion increases the
      frequency of naturally occurring, force-dependent P kinetochore detachment
      events, while being dispensable for the initial biorientation and movement of
      chromosomes. In unperturbed cells, these release events are followed by
      reattachment and successful congression, whereas in Ska-depleted cells, detached 
      kinetochores remain in a futile reattachment/detachment cycle that prevents
      congression. We further find that Ska is progressively loaded onto bioriented
      kinetochore pairs as they congress. We thus propose a model in which kinetochores
      mature through Ska complex recruitment and that this is required for improved
      load-bearing capacity and silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint.

PG  - 1557-1566
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607020 [doi]
AB  - Correct positioning of organelles is essential to eukaryotic cells. Molecular
      motors transport organelles to their proper destinations, yet little is known
      about the pathways that define these destinations. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
      the myosin V motor Myo2 binds the vacuole-specific adapter Vac17 to attach to the
      vacuole/lysosome and initiate transport. After arrival in the bud, Myo2 releases 
      the vacuole, and Vac17 is degraded. However, the mechanisms that spatially
      regulate this release were not established. In this study, we report that the bud
      cortex is a landmark that signals a successful delivery of the vacuole to the
      bud. We demonstrate that upon arrival at the bud cortex, Vac17 is phosphorylated 
      by Cla4. Cla4-dependent phosphorylation is required for the ubiquitylation and
      subsequent degradation of Vac17 and the release of the vacuole from Myo2. Our
      study reveals a critical step in the spatial regulation of myosin V-dependent
      organelle transport and may reveal common mechanisms for how molecular motors
      accurately deposit cargoes at the correct locations.

AB  - The primary goal of a dividing somatic cell is to accurately and equally
      segregate its genome into two new daughter cells. In eukaryotes, this process is 
      performed by a self-organized structure called the mitotic spindle. It has long
      been appreciated that mechanical forces must be applied to chromosomes. At the
      same time, the network of microtubules in the spindle must be able to apply and
      sustain large forces to maintain spindle integrity. Here we consider recent
      efforts to measure forces generated within microtubule networks by ensembles of
      key proteins. New findings, such as length-dependent force generation, protein
      clustering by asymmetric friction, and entropic expansion forces will help
      advance models of force generation needed for spindle function and maintaining
      integrity.

      motility.
PG  - 1673-1688
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201701074 [doi]
AB  - Diverse eukaryotic cells crawl through complex environments using distinct modes 
      of migration. To understand the underlying mechanisms and their evolutionary
      relationships, we must define each mode and identify its phenotypic and molecular
      markers. In this study, we focus on a widely dispersed migration mode
      characterized by dynamic actin-filled pseudopods that we call "alpha-motility."
      Mining genomic data reveals a clear trend: only organisms with both WASP and
      SCAR/WAVE-activators of branched actin assembly-make actin-filled pseudopods.
      Although SCAR has been shown to drive pseudopod formation, WASP's role in this
      process is controversial. We hypothesize that these genes collectively represent 
      a genetic signature of alpha-motility because both are used for pseudopod
      formation. WASP depletion from human neutrophils confirms that both proteins are 
      involved in explosive actin polymerization, pseudopod formation, and cell
      migration. WASP and WAVE also colocalize to dynamic signaling structures.
      Moreover, retention of WASP together with SCAR correctly predicts alpha-motility 
      in disease-causing chytrid fungi, which we show crawl at >30 microm/min with
      actin-filled pseudopods. By focusing on one migration mode in many eukaryotes, we
      identify a genetic marker of pseudopod formation, the morphological feature of
      alpha-motility, providing evidence for a widely distributed mode of cell crawling
      with a single evolutionary origin.

AB  - Nutrient availability controls the landscape of nutrient transporters present at 
      the plasma membrane, notably by regulating their ubiquitylation and subsequent
      endocytosis. In yeast, this involves the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and
      arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ARTs). ARTs are targeted by signaling
      pathways and warrant that cargo ubiquitylation and endocytosis appropriately
      respond to nutritional inputs. Here, we show that glucose deprivation regulates
      the ART protein Csr2/Art8 at multiple levels to trigger high-affinity glucose
      transporter endocytosis. Csr2 is transcriptionally induced in these conditions
      through the AMPK orthologue Snf1 and downstream transcriptional repressors. Upon 
      synthesis, Csr2 becomes activated by ubiquitylation. In contrast, glucose
      replenishment induces CSR2 transcriptional shutdown and switches Csr2 to an
      inactive, deubiquitylated form. This glucose-induced deubiquitylation of Csr2
      correlates with its phospho-dependent association with 14-3-3 proteins and
      involves protein kinase A. Thus, two glucose signaling pathways converge onto
      Csr2 to regulate hexose transporter endocytosis by glucose availability. These
      data illustrate novel mechanisms by which nutrients modulate ART activity and
      endocytosis.

AB  - The resting membrane potential (Deltapsi) of the cell is negative on the
      cytosolic side and determined primarily by the plasma membrane's selective
      permeability to K(+) We show that lysosomal Deltapsi is set by lysosomal membrane
      permeabilities to Na(+) and H(+), but not K(+), and is positive on the cytosolic 
      side. An increase in juxta-lysosomal Ca(2+) rapidly reversed lysosomal Deltapsi
      by activating a large voltage-dependent and K(+)-selective conductance
      (LysoKVCa). LysoKVCa is encoded molecularly by SLO1 proteins known for forming
      plasma membrane BK channels. Opening of single LysoKVCa channels is sufficient to
      cause the rapid, striking changes in lysosomal Deltapsi. Lysosomal Ca(2+) stores 
      may be refilled from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) via ER-lysosome membrane
      contact sites. We propose that LysoKVCa serves as the perilysosomal Ca(2+)
      effector to prime lysosomes for the refilling process. Consistently, genetic
      ablation or pharmacological inhibition of LysoKVCa, or abolition of its Ca(2+)
      sensitivity, blocks refilling and maintenance of lysosomal Ca(2+) stores,
      resulting in lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and a lysosome storage phenotype.

AB  - In lower vertebrates, retinal stem cells (RSCs) capable of producing all retinal 
      cell types are a resource for retinal tissue growth throughout life. However, the
      embryonic origin of RSCs remains largely elusive. Using a Zebrabow-based clonal
      analysis, we characterized the RSC niche in the ciliary marginal zone of
      zebrafish retina and illustrate that blood vessels associated with RSCs are
      required for the maintenance of actively proliferating RSCs. Full lineage
      analysis of RSC progenitors reveals lineage patterns of RSC production. Moreover,
      in vivo lineage analysis demonstrates that these RSC progenitors are the direct
      descendants of a set of bipotent progenitors in the medial epithelial layer of
      developing optic vesicles, suggesting the involvement of the mixed-lineage states
      in the RSC lineage specification.

AB  - The initial kinetochore (KT) encounter with a spindle microtubule (MT; KT
      capture) is one of the rate-limiting steps in establishing proper KT-MT
      interaction during mitosis. KT capture is facilitated by multiple factors, such
      as MT extension in various directions, KT diffusion, and MT pivoting. In
      addition, KTs generate short MTs, which subsequently interact with a spindle MT. 
      KT-derived MTs may facilitate KT capture, but their contribution is elusive. In
      this study, we find that Stu1 recruits Stu2 to budding yeast KTs, which promotes 
      MT generation there. By removing Stu2 specifically from KTs, we show that
      KT-derived MTs shorten the half-life of noncaptured KTs from 48-49 s to 28-34 s. 
      Using computational simulation, we found that multiple factors facilitate KT
      capture redundantly or synergistically. In particular, KT-derived MTs play
      important roles both by making a significant contribution on their own and by
      synergistically enhancing the effects of KT diffusion and MT pivoting. Our study 
      reveals fundamental mechanisms facilitating the initial KT encounter with spindle
      MTs.

TI  - TANGO1 recruits Sec16 to coordinately organize ER exit sites for efficient
      secretion.
PG  - 1731-1743
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703084 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites export a variety of cargo
      molecules including oversized cargoes such as collagens. However, the mechanisms 
      of their assembly and organization are not fully understood. TANGO1L is
      characterized as a collagen receptor, but the function of TANGO1S remains to be
      investigated. Here, we show that direct interaction between both isoforms of
      TANGO1 and Sec16 is not only important for their correct localization but also
      critical for the organization of ER exit sites. The depletion of TANGO1
      disassembles COPII components as well as membrane-bound ER-resident complexes,
      resulting in fewer functional ER exit sites and delayed secretion. The
      ectopically expressed TANGO1 C-terminal domain responsible for Sec16 binding in
      mitochondria is capable of recruiting Sec16 and other COPII components. Moreover,
      TANGO1 recruits membrane-bound macromolecular complexes consisting of cTAGE5 and 
      Sec12 to the ER exit sites. These data suggest that mammalian ER exit sites are
      organized by TANGO1 acting as a scaffold, in cooperation with Sec16 for efficient
      secretion.

AB  - Minus end-directed cargo transport along microtubules (MTs) is exclusively driven
      by the molecular motor dynein in a wide variety of cell types. Interestingly,
      during evolution, plants have lost the genes encoding dynein; the MT motors that 
      compensate for dynein function are unknown. Here, we show that two members of the
      kinesin-14 family drive minus end-directed transport in plants. Gene knockout
      analyses of the moss Physcomitrella patens revealed that the plant-specific class
      VI kinesin-14, KCBP, is required for minus end-directed transport of the nucleus 
      and chloroplasts. Purified KCBP directly bound to acidic phospholipids and
      unidirectionally transported phospholipid liposomes along MTs in vitro. Thus,
      minus end-directed transport of membranous cargoes might be driven by their
      direct interaction with this motor protein. Newly nucleated cytoplasmic MTs
      represent another known cargo exhibiting minus end-directed motility, and we
      identified the conserved class I kinesin-14 (ATK) as the motor involved. These
      results suggest that kinesin-14 motors were duplicated and developed as
      alternative MT-based minus end-directed transporters in land plants.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is driven by cooperating oncogenic mutations. In this study, we
      use organotypic cultures derived from transgenic mice inducibly expressing
      oncogenic beta-catenin and/or PIK3CA(H1047R) to follow sequential changes in
      cancer-related signaling networks, intestinal cell metabolism, and physiology in 
      a three-dimensional environment mimicking tissue architecture. Activation of
      beta-catenin alone results in the formation of highly clonogenic cells that are
      nonmotile and prone to undergo apoptosis. In contrast, coexpression of stabilized
      beta-catenin and PIK3CA(H1047R) gives rise to intestinal cells that are
      apoptosis-resistant, proliferative, stem cell-like, and motile. Systematic
      inhibitor treatments of organoids followed by quantitative phenotyping and
      phosphoprotein analyses uncover key changes in the signaling network topology of 
      intestinal cells after induction of stabilized beta-catenin and PIK3CA(H1047R) We
      find that survival and motility of organoid cells are associated with 4EBP1 and
      AKT phosphorylation, respectively. Our work defines phenotypes, signaling network
      states, and vulnerabilities of transgenic intestinal organoids as a novel
      approach to understanding oncogene activities and guiding the development of
      targeted therapies.

PG  - 1795-1810
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608095 [doi]
AB  - The PIDDosome (PIDD-RAIDD-caspase-2 complex) is considered to be the primary
      signaling platform for caspase-2 activation in response to genotoxic stress. Yet 
      studies of PIDD-deficient mice show that caspase-2 activation can proceed in the 
      absence of PIDD. Here we show that DNA damage induces the assembly of at least
      two distinct activation platforms for caspase-2: a cytoplasmic platform that is
      RAIDD dependent but PIDD independent, and a nucleolar platform that requires both
      PIDD and RAIDD. Furthermore, the nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM1)
      acts as a scaffold for PIDD and is essential for PIDDosome assembly in the
      nucleolus after DNA damage. Inhibition of NPM1 impairs caspase-2 processing,
      apoptosis, and caspase-2-dependent inhibition of cell growth, demonstrating that 
      the NPM1-dependent nucleolar PIDDosome is a key initiator of the caspase-2
      activation cascade. Thus we have identified the nucleolus as a novel site for
      caspase-2 activation and function.

      polarization.
PG  - 1689-1703
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607045 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate filaments (IFs) are key players in the control of cell morphology
      and structure as well as in active processes such as cell polarization,
      migration, and mechanoresponses. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling
      IF dynamics and organization in motile cells are still poorly understood. In this
      study, we investigate the mechanisms leading to the polarized rearrangement of
      the IF network along the polarity axis. Using photobleaching and photoconversion 
      experiments in glial cells expressing vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, 
      and nestin, we show that the distribution of cytoplasmic IFs results from a
      continuous turnover based on the cooperation of an actin-dependent retrograde
      flow and anterograde and retrograde microtubule-dependent transports. During
      wound-induced astrocyte polarization, IF transport becomes directionally biased
      from the cell center toward the cell front. Such asymmetry in the transport is
      mainly caused by a Cdc42- and atypical PKC-dependent inhibition of
      dynein-dependent retrograde transport. Our results show how polarity signaling
      can affect the dynamic turnover of the IF network to promote the polarization of 
      the network itself.

PG  - 1745-1759
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201702135 [doi]
AB  - The coat protein complex II (COPII) is essential for the transport of large
      cargo, such as 300-nm procollagen I (PC1) molecules, from the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. Previous work has shown that the CUL3-KLHL12 complex
      increases the size of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites to more than 300 nm in
      diameter and accelerates the secretion of PC1. However, the role of large COPII
      vesicles as PC1 transport carriers was not unambiguously demonstrated. In this
      study, using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, correlated light
      electron microscopy, and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate the existence of
      mobile COPII-coated vesicles that completely encapsulate the cargo PC1 and are
      physically separated from ER. We also developed a cell-free COPII vesicle budding
      reaction that reconstitutes the capture of PC1 into large COPII vesicles. This
      process requires COPII proteins and the GTPase activity of the COPII subunit
      SAR1. We conclude that large COPII vesicles are bona fide carriers of PC1.

TI  - GOP-1 promotes apoptotic cell degradation by activating the small GTPase Rab2 in 
      C. elegans.
PG  - 1775-1794
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610001 [doi]
AB  - Apoptotic cells generated by programmed cell death are engulfed by phagocytes and
      enclosed within plasma membrane-derived phagosomes. Maturation of phagosomes
      involves a series of membrane-remodeling events that are governed by the
      sequential actions of Rab GTPases and lead to formation of phagolysosomes, where 
      cell corpses are degraded. Here we identified gop-1 as a novel regulator of
      apoptotic cell clearance in Caenorhabditis elegans Loss of gop-1 affects
      phagosome maturation through the RAB-5-positive stage, causing defects in
      phagosome acidification and phagolysosome formation, phenotypes identical to and 
      unaffected by loss of unc-108, the C. elegans Rab2 GOP-1 transiently associates
      with cell corpse-containing phagosomes, and loss of its function abrogates
      phagosomal association of UNC-108. GOP-1 interacts with GDP-bound and
      nucleotide-free UNC-108/Rab2, disrupts GDI-UNC-108 complexes, and promotes
      activation and membrane recruitment of UNC-108/Rab2 in vitro. Loss of gop-1 also 
      abolishes association of UNC-108 with endosomes, causing defects in endosome and 
      dense core vesicle maturation. Thus, GOP-1 is an activator of UNC-108/Rab2 in
      multiple processes.

AB  - Cilia are cellular projections that assemble on centriole-derived basal bodies.
      While cilia assembly is absolutely dependent on centrioles, it is not known to
      what extent they contribute to downstream events. The nematode C. elegans
      provides a unique opportunity to address this question, as centrioles do not
      persist at the base of mature cilia. Using fluorescence microscopy and electron
      tomography, we find that centrioles degenerate early during ciliogenesis. The
      transition zone and axoneme are not completely formed at this time, indicating
      that cilia maturation does not depend on intact centrioles. The hydrolethalus
      syndrome protein HYLS-1 is the only centriolar protein known to remain at the
      base of mature cilia and is required for intraflagellar transport trafficking.
      Surprisingly, targeted degradation of HYLS-1 after initiation of ciliogenesis
      does not affect ciliary structures. Taken together, our results indicate that
      while centrioles are essential to initiate cilia formation, they are dispensable 
      for cilia maturation and maintenance.

TI  - Suppression of integrin alpha3beta1 by alpha9beta1 in the epidermis controls the 
      paracrine resolution of wound angiogenesis.
PG  - 1473-1488
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510042 [doi]
AB  - Development of wound therapies is hindered by poor understanding of combinatorial
      integrin function in the epidermis. In this study, we generated mice with
      epidermis-specific deletion of alpha3beta1, alpha9beta1, or both integrins as
      well as keratinocyte lines expressing these integrin combinations. Consistent
      with proangiogenic roles for alpha3beta1, alpha3-null keratinocytes showed
      reduced paracrine stimulation of endothelial cell migration and survival, and
      wounds of epidermis-specific alpha3 knockout mice displayed impaired
      angiogenesis. Interestingly, alpha9beta1 in keratinocytes suppressed
      alpha3beta1-mediated stimulation of endothelial cells, and wounds of
      epidermis-specific alpha9 knockout mice displayed delayed vascular normalization 
      and reduced endothelial apoptosis, indicating that alpha9beta1 cross-suppresses
      alpha3beta1 proangiogenic functions. Moreover, alpha9beta1 inhibited alpha3beta1 
      signaling downstream of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) autoactivation at the point
      of Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK Y861/Y925. Finally, alpha9beta1
      cross-suppressed many alpha3beta1-dependent genes, including the gene that
      encodes MMP-9, which we implicated as a regulator of integrin-dependent cross
      talk to endothelial cells. Our findings identify a novel physiological context
      for combinatorial integrin signaling, laying the foundation for therapeutic
      strategies that manipulate alpha9beta1 and/or alpha3beta1 during wound healing.

TI  - Smurf1 inhibits integrin activation by controlling Kindlin-2 ubiquitination and
      degradation.
PG  - 1455-1471
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609073 [doi]
AB  - Integrin activation is an indispensable step for various integrin-mediated
      biological functions. Kindlin-2 is known to coactivate integrins with Talin;
      however, molecules that restrict integrin activation are elusive. Here, we
      demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 controls the amount of Kindlin-2 
      protein in cells and hinders integrin activation. Smurf1 interacts with and
      promotes Kindlin-2 ubiquitination and degradation. Smurf1 selectively mediates
      degradation of Kindlin-2 but not Talin, leading to inhibition of alphaIIbbeta3
      integrin activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells and beta1 integrin activation 
      in fibroblasts. Enhanced activation of beta1 integrin was found in
      Smurf1-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which correlates with an increase in
      Kindlin-2 protein levels. Similarly, a reciprocal relationship between Smurf1 and
      Kindlin-2 protein levels is found in tissues from colon cancer patients,
      suggesting that Smurf1 mediates Kindlin-2 degradation in vivo. Collectively, we
      demonstrate that Smurf1 acts as a brake for integrin activation by controlling
      Kindlin-2 protein levels, a new mechanism that permits precise modulation of
      integrin-mediated cellular functions.

TI  - Preprotein mature domains contain translocase targeting signals that are
      essential for secretion.
PG  - 1357-1369
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609022 [doi]
AB  - Secretory proteins are only temporary cytoplasmic residents. They are typically
      synthesized as preproteins, carrying signal peptides N-terminally fused to their 
      mature domains. In bacteria secretion largely occurs posttranslationally through 
      the membrane-embedded SecA-SecYEG translocase. Upon crossing the plasma membrane,
      signal peptides are cleaved off and mature domains reach their destinations and
      fold. Targeting to the translocase is mediated by signal peptides. The role of
      mature domains in targeting and secretion is unclear. We now reveal that mature
      domains harbor their own independent targeting signals (mature domain targeting
      signals [MTSs]). These are multiple, degenerate, interchangeable, linear or 3D
      hydrophobic stretches that become available because of the unstructured states of
      targeting-competent preproteins. Their receptor site on the cytoplasmic face of
      the SecYEG-bound SecA is also of hydrophobic nature and is located adjacent to
      the signal peptide cleft. Both the preprotein MTSs and their receptor site on
      SecA are essential for protein secretion. Evidently, mature domains have their
      own previously unsuspected distinct roles in preprotein targeting and secretion.

TI  - The BEACH-containing protein WDR81 coordinates p62 and LC3C to promote
      aggrephagy.

AB  - Autophagy-dependent clearance of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins is
      critical to protein quality control, but the underlying mechanisms are not well
      understood. Here, we report the essential role of the BEACH (beige and
      Chediak-Higashi) and WD40 repeat-containing protein WDR81 in eliminating
      ubiquitinated proteins through autophagy. WDR81 associates with ubiquitin
      (Ub)-positive protein foci, and its loss causes accumulation of Ub proteins and
      the autophagy cargo receptor p62. WDR81 interacts with p62, facilitating
      recognition of Ub proteins by p62. Furthermore, WDR81 interacts with LC3C through
      canonical LC3-interacting regions in the BEACH domain, promoting LC3C recruitment
      to ubiquitinated proteins. Inactivation of LC3C or defective autophagy results in
      accumulation of Ub protein aggregates enriched for WDR81. In mice, WDR81
      inactivation causes accumulation of p62 bodies in cortical and striatal neurons
      in the brain. These data suggest that WDR81 coordinates p62 and LC3C to
      facilitate autophagic removal of Ub proteins, and provide important insights into
      CAMRQ2 syndrome, a WDR81-related developmental disorder.

TI  - Shaping proteostasis at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level.
PG  - 1231-1241
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201612111 [doi]
AB  - The proteostasis network (PN) regulates protein synthesis, folding, transport,
      and degradation to maintain proteome integrity and limit the accumulation of
      protein aggregates, a hallmark of aging and degenerative diseases. In
      multicellular organisms, the PN is regulated at the cellular, tissue, and
      systemic level to ensure organismal health and longevity. Here we review these
      three layers of PN regulation and examine how they collectively maintain cellular
      homeostasis, achieve cell type-specific proteomes, and coordinate proteostasis
      across tissues. A precise understanding of these layers of control has important 
      implications for organismal health and could offer new therapeutic approaches for
      neurodegenerative diseases and other chronic disorders related to PN dysfunction.

PG  - 1371-1386
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603070 [doi]
AB  - The cell cortex is essential to maintain animal cell shape, and contractile
      forces generated within it by nonmuscle myosin II (NMY-2) drive cellular
      morphogenetic processes such as cytokinesis. The role of actin cross-linking
      proteins in cortical dynamics is still incompletely understood. Here, we show
      that the evolutionarily conserved actin bundling/cross-linking protein plastin is
      instrumental for the generation of potent cortical actomyosin contractility in
      the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. PLST-1 was enriched in contractile structures 
      and was required for effective coalescence of NMY-2 filaments into large
      contractile foci and for long-range coordinated contractility in the cortex. In
      the absence of PLST-1, polarization was compromised, cytokinesis was delayed or
      failed, and 50% of embryos died during development. Moreover, mathematical
      modeling showed that an optimal amount of bundling agents enhanced the ability of
      a network to contract. We propose that by increasing the connectivity of the
      F-actin meshwork, plastin enables the cortex to generate stronger and more
      coordinated forces to accomplish cellular morphogenesis.

TI  - Neuralized regulates Crumbs endocytosis and epithelium morphogenesis via specific
      Stardust isoforms.

AB  - Crumbs (Crb) is a conserved determinant of apical membrane identity that
      regulates epithelial morphogenesis in many developmental contexts. In this study,
      we identify the Crb complex protein Stardust (Sdt) as a target of the E3
      ubiquitin ligase Neuralized (Neur) in Drosophila melanogaster Neur interacts with
      and down-regulates specific Sdt isoforms containing a Neur binding motif (NBM).
      Using a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeats)-induced deletion of the NBM-encoding exon, we found that Sdt is a key
      Neur target and that Neur acts via Sdt to down-regulate Crb. We further show that
      Neur promotes the endocytosis of Crb via the NBM-containing isoforms of Sdt.
      Although the regulation of Crb by Neur is not strictly essential, it contributes 
      to epithelium remodeling in the posterior midgut and thereby facilitates the
      trans-epithelial migration of the primordial germ cells in early embryos. Thus,
      our study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism for the developmental control of 
      Crb-mediated morphogenesis.

      paraplegia.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609033 [doi]
AB  - Contacts between endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) promote endosomal
      tubule fission, but the mechanisms involved and consequences of tubule fission
      failure are incompletely understood. We found that interaction between the
      microtubule-severing enzyme spastin and the ESCRT protein IST1 at ER-endosome
      contacts drives endosomal tubule fission. Failure of fission caused defective
      sorting of mannose 6-phosphate receptor, with consequently disrupted lysosomal
      enzyme trafficking and abnormal lysosomal morphology, including in mouse primary 
      neurons and human stem cell-derived neurons. Consistent with a role for
      ER-mediated endosomal tubule fission in lysosome function, similar lysosomal
      abnormalities were seen in cellular models lacking the WASH complex component
      strumpellin or the ER morphogen REEP1. Mutations in spastin, strumpellin, or
      REEP1 cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a disease characterized by
      axonal degeneration. Our results implicate failure of the ER-endosome contact
      process in axonopathy and suggest that coupling of ER-mediated endosomal tubule
      fission to lysosome function links different classes of HSP proteins, previously 
      considered functionally distinct, into a unifying pathway for axonal
      degeneration.

TI  - The daughter centriole controls ciliogenesis by regulating Neurl-4 localization
      at the centrosome.
PG  - 1287-1300
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608119 [doi]
AB  - The two centrioles of the centrosome differ in age and function. Although the
      mother centriole mediates most centrosome-dependent processes, the role of the
      daughter remains poorly understood. A recent study has implicated the daughter
      centriole in centriole amplification in multiciliated cells, but its contribution
      to primary ciliogenesis is unclear. We found that manipulations that prevent
      daughter centriole formation or induce its separation from the mother abolish
      ciliogenesis. This defect was caused by stabilization of the negative
      ciliogenesis regulator CP110 and was corrected by CP110 depletion. CP110
      dysregulation may be caused by effects on Neurl-4, a daughter
      centriole-associated ubiquitin ligase cofactor, which was required for
      ciliogenesis. Centrosome-targeted Neurl-4 was sufficient to restore ciliogenesis 
      in cells with manipulated daughter centrioles. Interestingly, early during
      ciliogenesis, Neurl-4 transiently associated with the mother centriole in a
      process that required mother-daughter centriole proximity. Our data support a
      model in which the daughter centriole promotes ciliogenesis through
      Neurl-4-dependent regulation of CP110 levels at the mother centriole.

      ectosome release.
PG  - 1489-1499
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608081 [doi]
AB  - The primary cilium is a highly conserved organelle housing specialized molecules 
      responsible for receiving and processing extracellular signals. A recently
      discovered property shared across many cilia is the ability to release small
      vesicles called ectosomes, which are used for exchanging protein and genetic
      material among cells. In this study, we report a novel role for ciliary ectosomes
      in building the elaborate photoreceptor outer segment filled with hundreds of
      tightly packed "disc" membranes. We demonstrate that the photoreceptor cilium has
      an innate ability to release massive amounts of ectosomes. However, this process 
      is suppressed by the disc-specific protein peripherin, which enables retained
      ectosomes to be morphed into discs. This new function of peripherin is performed 
      independently from its well-established role in maintaining the high curvature of
      disc edges, and each function is fulfilled by a separate part of peripherin's
      molecule. Our findings explain how the outer segment structure evolved from the
      primary cilium to provide photoreceptor cells with vast membrane surfaces for
      efficient light capture.

TI  - Three-tier regulation of cell number plasticity by neurotrophins and Tolls in
      Drosophila.
PG  - 1421-1438
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607098 [doi]
AB  - Cell number plasticity is coupled to circuitry in the nervous system, adjusting
      cell mass to functional requirements. In mammals, this is achieved by
      neurotrophin (NT) ligands, which promote cell survival via their Trk and p75(NTR)
      receptors and cell death via p75(NTR) and Sortilin. Drosophila NTs (DNTs) bind
      Toll receptors instead to promote neuronal survival, but whether they can also
      regulate cell death is unknown. In this study, we show that DNTs and Tolls can
      switch from promoting cell survival to death in the central nervous system (CNS) 
      via a three-tier mechanism. First, DNT cleavage patterns result in alternative
      signaling outcomes. Second, different Tolls can preferentially promote cell
      survival or death. Third, distinct adaptors downstream of Tolls can drive either 
      apoptosis or cell survival. Toll-6 promotes cell survival via MyD88-NF-kappaB and
      cell death via Wek-Sarm-JNK. The distribution of adaptors changes in space and
      time and may segregate to distinct neural circuits. This novel mechanism for CNS 
      cell plasticity may operate in wider contexts.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions play key roles in development and cancer and
      entail the loss of epithelial polarity and cell adhesion. In this study, we use
      quantitative live imaging of ingressing neuroblasts (NBs) in Drosophila
      melanogaster embryos to assess apical domain loss and junctional disassembly.
      Ingression is independent of the Snail family of transcriptional repressors and
      down-regulation of Drosophila E-cadherin (DEcad) transcription. Instead, the
      posttranscriptionally regulated decrease in DEcad coincides with the reduction of
      cell contact length and depends on tension anisotropy between NBs and their
      neighbors. A major driver of apical constriction and junctional disassembly are
      periodic pulses of junctional and medial myosin II that result in progressively
      stronger cortical contractions during ingression. Effective contractions require 
      the molecular coupling between myosin and junctions and apical relaxation of
      neighboring cells. Moreover, planar polarization of myosin leads to the loss of
      anterior-posterior junctions before the loss of dorsal-ventral junctions. We
      conclude that planar-polarized dynamic actomyosin networks drive apical
      constriction and the anisotropic loss of cell contacts during NB ingression.

PG  - 1267-1276
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608104 [doi]
AB  - VopL and VopF (VopL/F) are tandem WH2-domain actin assembly factors used by
      infectious Vibrio species to induce actin assembly in host cells. There is
      disagreement about the filament assembly mechanism of VopL/F, including whether
      they associate with the filament barbed or pointed end. Here, we used multicolor 
      total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to directly observe actin
      assembly with fluorescently labeled VopL/F. In actin monomer assembly reactions, 
      VopL/F exclusively nucleate actin filament assemblies, remaining only briefly
      associated with the pointed end. VopL/F do not associate with the ends of
      preassembled filaments. In assembly reactions with saturating profilin,
      approximately 85% of VopL/F molecules also promote nucleation from the pointed
      end, whereas a smaller fraction (<15%) associate for approximately 25 s with the 
      barbed end of preassembled filaments, inhibiting their elongation. We conclude
      that VopL/F function primarily as actin nucleation factors that remain briefly ( 
      approximately 100 s) associated with the pointed end.

PG  - 1439-1453

AB  - Stem cells require different types of supporting cells, or niches, to control
      stem cell maintenance and differentiation. However, little is known about how
      those niches are formed. We report that in the development of the Drosophila
      melanogaster ovary, the Hedgehog (Hh) gradient sets differential cell affinity
      for somatic gonadal precursors to specify stromal intermingled cells, which
      contributes to both germline stem cell maintenance and differentiation niches in 
      the adult. We also report that Traffic Jam (an orthologue of a large Maf
      transcription factor in mammals) is a novel transcriptional target of Hh
      signaling to control cell-cell adhesion by negative regulation of E-cadherin
      expression. Our results demonstrate the role of Hh signaling in niche
      establishment by segregating somatic cell lineages for differentiation.

      driving ER fusion.
PG  - 1321-1335
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609071 [doi]
AB  - The homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum membranes is catalyzed by the
      atlastin GTPase. The mechanism involves trans-dimerization between GTPase heads
      and a favorable crossover conformational shift, catalyzed by GTP hydrolysis, that
      converts the dimer from a "prefusion" to "postfusion" state. However, whether
      crossover formation actually energizes fusion remains unclear, as do the sequence
      of events surrounding it. Here, we made mutations in atlastin to selectively
      destabilize the crossover conformation and used fluorescence-based kinetic assays
      to analyze the variants. All variants underwent dimerization and crossover
      concurrently, and at wild-type rates. However, certain variants were unstable
      once in the crossover dimer conformation, and crossover dimer stability closely
      paralleled lipid-mixing activity. Tethering, however, appeared to be unimpaired
      in all mutant variants. The results suggest that tethering and lipid mixing are
      catalyzed concurrently by GTP hydrolysis but that the energy requirement for
      lipid mixing exceeds that for tethering, and the full energy released through
      crossover formation is necessary for fusion.

PG  - 1243-1253
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608042 [doi]
AB  - Mitotically dividing cells use a surveillance mechanism, the spindle assembly
      checkpoint, that monitors the attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores 
      as a means of detecting errors. However, end-on kinetochore attachments have not 
      been observed in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes and chromosomes instead associate
      with lateral microtubule bundles; whether errors can be sensed in this context is
      not known. Here, we show that C. elegans oocytes delay key events in anaphase,
      including AIR-2/Aurora B relocalization to the microtubules, in response to a
      variety of meiotic defects, demonstrating that errors can be detected in these
      cells and revealing a mechanism that regulates anaphase progression. This
      mechanism does not appear to rely on several components of the spindle assembly
      checkpoint but does require the kinetochore, as depleting kinetochore components 
      prevents the error-induced anaphase delays. These findings therefore suggest that
      in this system, kinetochores could be involved in sensing meiotic errors using an
      unconventional mechanism that does not use canonical end-on attachments.

TI  - Centrosome and spindle assembly checkpoint loss leads to neural apoptosis and
      reduced brain size.
PG  - 1255-1265
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607022 [doi]
AB  - Accurate mitotic spindle assembly is critical for mitotic fidelity and organismal
      development. Multiple processes coordinate spindle assembly and chromosome
      segregation. Two key components are centrosomes and the spindle assembly
      checkpoint (SAC), and mutations affecting either can cause human microcephaly. In
      vivo studies in Drosophila melanogaster found that loss of either component alone
      is well tolerated in the developing brain, in contrast to epithelial tissues of
      the imaginal discs. In this study, we reveal that one reason for that tolerance
      is the compensatory relationship between centrosomes and the SAC. In the absence 
      of both centrosomes and the SAC, brain cells, including neural stem cells,
      experience massive errors in mitosis, leading to increased cell death, which
      reduces the neural progenitor pool and severely disrupts brain development.
      However, our data also demonstrate that neural cells are much more tolerant of
      aneuploidy than epithelial cells. Our data provide novel insights into the
      mechanisms by which different tissues manage genome stability and parallels with 
      human microcephaly.

TI  - Membrane remodeling during embryonic abscission in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 1277-1286
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607030 [doi]
AB  - Abscission is the final step of cytokinesis and results in the physical
      separation of two daughter cells. In this study, we conducted a time-resolved
      series of electron tomographic reconstructions to define the steps required for
      the first embryonic abscission in Caenorhabditis elegans Our findings indicate
      that membrane scission occurs on both sides of the midbody ring with random order
      and that completion of the scission process requires actomyosin-driven membrane
      remodeling, but not microtubules. Moreover, continuous membrane removal
      predominates during the late stages of cytokinesis, mediated by both dynamin and 
      the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery.
      Surprisingly, in the absence of ESCRT function in C. elegans, cytokinetic
      abscission is delayed but can be completed, suggesting the existence of parallel 
      membrane-reorganizing pathways that cooperatively enable the efficient severing
      of cytoplasmic connections between dividing daughter cells.

      microRNA-dependent inhibition of fission.
PG  - 1071-1089
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608063 [doi]
AB  - Obligate intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis depend on
      metabolites of the host cell and thus protect their sole replication niche by
      interfering with the host cells' stress response. Here, we investigated the
      involvement of host microRNAs (miRNAs) in maintaining the viability of C.
      trachomatis-infected primary human cells. We identified miR-30c-5p as a
      prominently up-regulated miRNA required for the stable down-regulation of p53, a 
      major suppressor of metabolite supply in C. trachomatis-infected cells. Loss of
      miR-30c-5p led to the up-regulation of Drp1, a mitochondrial fission regulator
      and a target gene of p53, which, in turn, severely affected chlamydial growth and
      had a marked effect on the mitochondrial network. Drp1-induced mitochondrial
      fragmentation prevented replication of C. trachomatis even in p53-deficient
      cells. Additionally, Chlamydia maintain mitochondrial integrity during reactive
      oxygen species-induced stress that occurs naturally during infection. We show
      that C. trachomatis require mitochondrial ATP for normal development and hence
      postulate that they preserve mitochondrial integrity through a
      miR-30c-5p-dependent inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission.

      analogs.
PG  - 1183-1204
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607086 [doi]
AB  - Sphingomyelin (SM) has been proposed to form cholesterol-dependent raft domains
      and sphingolipid domains in the plasma membrane (PM). How SM contributes to the
      formation and function of these domains remains unknown, primarily because of the
      scarcity of suitable fluorescent SM analogs. We developed new fluorescent SM
      analogs by conjugating a hydrophilic fluorophore to the SM choline headgroup
      without eliminating its positive charge, via a hydrophilic nonaethylene glycol
      linker. The new analogs behaved similarly to the native SM in terms of their
      partitioning behaviors in artificial liquid order-disorder phase-separated
      membranes and detergent-resistant PM preparations. Single fluorescent molecule
      tracking in the live-cell PM revealed that they indirectly interact with each
      other in cholesterol- and sphingosine backbone-dependent manners, and that, for
      approximately 10-50 ms, they undergo transient colocalization-codiffusion with a 
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, CD59 (in monomers,
      transient-dimer rafts, and clusters), in CD59-oligomer size-, cholesterol-, and
      GPI anchoring-dependent manners. These results suggest that SM continually and
      rapidly exchanges between CD59-associated raft domains and the bulk PM.

AB  - Endocytic, autophagic, and phagocytic vesicles move on microtubule tracks to fuse
      with lysosomes. Small GTPases, such as Rab7 and Arl8b, recruit their downstream
      effectors to mediate this transport and fusion. However, the potential cross talk
      between these two GTPases is unclear. Here, we show that the Rab7 effector
      PLEKHM1 simultaneously binds Rab7 and Arl8b, bringing about clustering and fusion
      of late endosomes and lysosomes. We show that the N-terminal RUN domain of
      PLEKHM1 is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Arl8b and its subsequent
      localization to lysosomes. Notably, we also demonstrate that Arl8b mediates
      recruitment of HOPS complex to PLEKHM1-positive vesicle contact sites.
      Consequently, Arl8b binding to PLEKHM1 is required for its function in delivery
      and, therefore, degradation of endocytic and autophagic cargo in lysosomes.
      Finally, we also show that PLEKHM1 competes with SKIP for Arl8b binding, which
      dictates lysosome positioning. These findings suggest that Arl8b, along with its 
      effectors, orchestrates lysosomal transport and fusion.

TI  - Structure of the RZZ complex and molecular basis of its interaction with Spindly.
PG  - 961-981
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611060 [doi]
AB  - Kinetochores are macromolecular assemblies that connect chromosomes to spindle
      microtubules (MTs) during mitosis. The metazoan-specific approximately 800-kD
      ROD-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex builds a fibrous corona that assembles on mitotic
      kinetochores before MT attachment to promote chromosome alignment and robust
      spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. In this study, we combine biochemical
      reconstitutions, single-particle electron cryomicroscopy, cross-linking mass
      spectrometry, and structural modeling to build a complete model of human RZZ. We 
      find that RZZ is structurally related to self-assembling cytosolic coat scaffolds
      that mediate membrane cargo trafficking, including Clathrin, Sec13-Sec31, and
      alphabeta'epsilon-COP. We show that Spindly, a dynein adaptor, is related to
      BicD2 and binds RZZ directly in a farnesylation-dependent but
      membrane-independent manner. Through a targeted chemical biology approach, we
      identify ROD as the Spindly farnesyl receptor. Our results suggest that RZZ is
      dynein's cargo at human kinetochores.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of dynein recruitment to kinetochores by the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch 
      complex and Spindly.
PG  - 943-960
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610108 [doi]
AB  - The molecular motor dynein concentrates at the kinetochore region of mitotic
      chromosomes in animals to accelerate spindle microtubule capture and to control
      spindle checkpoint signaling. In this study, we describe the molecular mechanism 
      used by the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch complex and the adaptor Spindly to recruit dynein to 
      kinetochores in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos and human cells. We show that
      Rod's N-terminal beta-propeller and the associated Zwilch subunit bind Spindly's 
      C-terminal domain, and we identify a specific Zwilch mutant that abrogates
      Spindly and dynein recruitment in vivo and Spindly binding to a Rod
      beta-propeller-Zwilch complex in vitro. Spindly's N-terminal coiled-coil uses
      distinct motifs to bind dynein light intermediate chain and the pointed-end
      complex of dynactin. Mutations in these motifs inhibit assembly of a
      dynein-dynactin-Spindly complex, and a null mutant of the dynactin pointed-end
      subunit p27 prevents kinetochore recruitment of dynein-dynactin without affecting
      other mitotic functions of the motor. Conservation of Spindly-like motifs in
      adaptors involved in intracellular transport suggests a common mechanism for
      linking dynein to cargo.

TI  - An engineered minimal chromosomal passenger complex reveals a role for
      INCENP/Sli15 spindle association in chromosome biorientation.
PG  - 911-923
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609123 [doi]
AB  - The four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), whose enzymatic subunit is 
      Aurora B kinase, promotes chromosome biorientation by detaching incorrect
      kinetochore-microtubule attachments. In this study, we use a combination of
      truncations and artificial dimerization in budding yeast to define the minimal
      CPC elements essential for its biorientation function. We engineered a minimal
      CPC comprised of the dimerized last third of the kinase-activating Sli15/INCENP
      scaffold and the catalytic subunit Ipl1/Aurora B. Although native Sli15 is not
      oligomeric, artificial dimerization suppressed the biorientation defect and
      lethality associated with deletion of a majority of its microtubule-binding
      domain. Dimerization did not act through a physical clustering-based kinase
      activation mechanism but instead promoted spindle association, likely via a
      putative helical domain in Sli15 that is essential even when dimerized and is
      required to target kinetochore substrates. Based on the engineering and
      characterization of a minimal CPC, we suggest that spindle association is
      important for active Ipl1/Aurora B complexes to preferentially destabilize
      misattached kinetochores.

TI  - Dual recognition of chromatin and microtubules by INCENP is important for mitotic
      progression.
PG  - 925-941
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609061 [doi]
AB  - The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of inner centromere protein
      (INCENP), Survivin, Borealin, and the kinase Aurora B, contributes to the
      activation of the mitotic checkpoint. The regulation of CPC function remains
      unclear. Here, we reveal that in addition to Survivin and Borealin, the single
      alpha-helix (SAH) domain of INCENP supports CPC localization to chromatin and the
      mitotic checkpoint. The INCENP SAH domain also mediates INCENP's microtubule
      binding, which is negatively regulated by Cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated
      phosphorylation of segments flanking the SAH domain. The microtubule-binding
      capacity of the SAH domain is important for mitotic arrest in conditions of
      suppressed microtubule dynamics, and the duration of mitotic arrest dictates the 
      probability, but not the timing, of cell death. Although independent targeting of
      INCENP to microtubules or the kinetochore/centromere promotes the mitotic
      checkpoint, it is insufficient for a robust mitotic arrest. Altogether, our
      results demonstrate that dual recognition of chromatin and microtubules by CPC is
      important for checkpoint maintenance and determination of cell fate in mitosis.

TI  - FUS inclusions disrupt RNA localization by sequestering kinesin-1 and inhibiting 
      microtubule detyrosination.
PG  - 1015-1034
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608022 [doi]
AB  - Cytoplasmic inclusions of the RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS)
      represent one type of membraneless ribonucleoprotein compartment. Formation of
      FUS inclusions is promoted by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked
      mutations, but the cellular functions affected upon inclusion formation are
      poorly defined. In this study, we find that FUS inclusions lead to the
      mislocalization of specific RNAs from fibroblast cell protrusions and neuronal
      axons. This is mediated by recruitment of kinesin-1 mRNA and protein within FUS
      inclusions, leading to a loss of detyrosinated glutamate (Glu)-microtubules (MTs;
      Glu-MTs) and an inability to support the localization of RNAs at protrusions.
      Importantly, dissolution of FUS inclusions using engineered Hsp104 disaggregases,
      or overexpression of kinesin-1, reverses these effects. We further provide
      evidence that kinesin-1 affects MT detyrosination not through changes in MT
      stability, but rather through targeting the tubulin carboxypeptidase enzyme onto 
      specific MTs. Interestingly, other pathological inclusions lead to similar
      outcomes, but through apparently distinct mechanisms. These results reveal a
      novel kinesin-dependent mechanism controlling the MT cytoskeleton and identify
      loss of Glu-MTs and RNA mislocalization as common outcomes of ALS pathogenic
      mutations.

TI  - AMPK negatively regulates tensin-dependent integrin activity.
PG  - 1107-1121
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609066 [doi]
AB  - Tight regulation of integrin activity is paramount for dynamic cellular functions
      such as cell matrix adhesion and mechanotransduction. Integrin activation is
      achieved through intracellular interactions at the integrin cytoplasmic tails and
      through integrin-ligand binding. In this study, we identify the metabolic sensor 
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a beta1-integrin inhibitor in fibroblasts.
      Loss of AMPK promotes beta1-integrin activity, the formation of centrally located
      active beta1-integrin- and tensin-rich mature fibrillar adhesions, and cell
      spreading. Moreover, in the absence of AMPK, cells generate more mechanical
      stress and increase fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Mechanistically, we show that
      AMPK negatively regulates the expression of the integrin-binding proteins tensin1
      and tensin3. Transient expression of tensins increases beta1-integrin activity,
      whereas tensin silencing reduces integrin activity in fibroblasts lacking AMPK.
      Accordingly, tensin silencing in AMPK-depleted fibroblasts impedes enhanced cell 
      spreading, traction stress, and fibronectin fiber formation. Collectively, we
      show that the loss of AMPK up-regulates tensins, which bind beta1-integrins,
      supporting their activity and promoting fibrillar adhesion formation and
      integrin-dependent processes.

AB  - Signal integration between activating Fc receptors and inhibitory signal
      regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) controls macrophage phagocytosis. Here,
      using dual-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, we report
      that Fcgamma receptor I (FcgammaRI), FcgammaRII, and SIRPalpha are not
      homogeneously distributed at macrophage surfaces but are organized in discrete
      nanoclusters, with a mean radius of 71 +/- 11 nm, 60 +/- 6 nm, and 48 +/- 3 nm,
      respectively. Nanoclusters of FcgammaRI, but not FcgammaRII, are constitutively
      associated with nanoclusters of SIRPalpha, within 62 +/- 5 nm, mediated by the
      actin cytoskeleton. Upon Fc receptor activation, Src-family kinase signaling
      leads to segregation of FcgammaRI and SIRPalpha nanoclusters to be 197 +/- 3 nm
      apart. Co-ligation of SIRPalpha with CD47 abrogates nanocluster segregation. If
      the balance of signals favors activation, FcgammaRI nanoclusters reorganize into 
      periodically spaced concentric rings. Thus, a nanometer- and micron-scale
      reorganization of activating and inhibitory receptors occurs at the surface of
      human macrophages concurrent with signal integration.

TI  - Tango1 spatially organizes ER exit sites to control ER export.
PG  - 1035-1049
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201611088 [doi]
AB  - Exit of secretory cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) takes place at
      specialized domains called ER exit sites (ERESs). In mammals, loss of TANGO1 and 
      other MIA/cTAGE (melanoma inhibitory activity/cutaneous T cell
      lymphoma-associated antigen) family proteins prevents ER exit of large cargoes
      such as collagen. Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster Tango1, the only
      MIA/cTAGE family member in fruit flies, is a critical organizer of the ERES-Golgi
      interface. Tango1 rings hold COPII (coat protein II) carriers and Golgi in close 
      proximity at their center. Loss of Tango1, present at ERESs in all tissues,
      reduces ERES size and causes ERES-Golgi uncoupling, which impairs secretion of
      not only collagen, but also all other cargoes we examined. Further supporting an 
      organizing role of Tango1, its overexpression creates more and larger ERESs. Our 
      results suggest that spatial coordination of ERES, carrier, and Golgi elements
      through Tango1's multiple interactions increases secretory capacity in Drosophila
      and allows secretion of large cargo.

TI  - TANGO1 assembles into rings around COPII coats at ER exit sites.
PG  - 901-909
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608080 [doi]
AB  - TANGO1 (transport and Golgi organization 1) interacts with CTAGE5 and COPII
      components Sec23/Sec24 and recruits ERGIC-53 (endoplasmic reticulum [ER]-Golgi
      intermediate compartment 53)-containing membranes to generate a mega-transport
      carrier for export of collagens and apolipoproteins from the ER. We now show that
      TANGO1, at the ER, assembles in a ring that encircles COPII components. The
      C-terminal, proline-rich domains of TANGO1 molecules in the ring are initially
      tilted onto COPII coats but appear to be pushed apart as the carrier grows. These
      findings lend support to our suggestion that growth of transport carriers for
      exporting bulky cargoes requires addition of membranes and not simply
      COPII-mediated accretion of a larger surface of ER. TANGO1 remains at the neck of
      the newly forming transport carrier, which grows in size by addition of
      ERGIC-53-containing membranes to generate a transport intermediate for the export
      of bulky collagens.

TI  - Structural analysis of the role of TPX2 in branching microtubule nucleation.
PG  - 983-997
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607060 [doi]
AB  - The mitotic spindle consists of microtubules (MTs), which are nucleated by the
      gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC). How the gamma-TuRC gets activated at the
      right time and location remains elusive. Recently, it was uncovered that MTs
      nucleate from preexisting MTs within the mitotic spindle, which requires the
      protein TPX2, but the mechanism basis for TPX2 action is unknown. Here, we
      investigate the role of TPX2 in branching MT nucleation. We establish the domain 
      organization of Xenopus laevis TPX2 and define the minimal TPX2 version that
      stimulates branching MT nucleation, which we find is unrelated to TPX2's ability 
      to nucleate MTs in vitro. Several domains of TPX2 contribute to its MT-binding
      and bundling activities. However, the property necessary for TPX2 to induce
      branching MT nucleation is contained within newly identified gamma-TuRC
      nucleation activator motifs. Separation-of-function mutations leave the binding
      of TPX2 to gamma-TuRC intact, whereas branching MT nucleation is abolished,
      suggesting that TPX2 may activate gamma-TuRC to promote branching MT nucleation.

TI  - Unique spectral signatures of the nucleic acid dye acridine orange can
      distinguish cell death by apoptosis and necroptosis.
PG  - 1163-1181
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602028 [doi]
AB  - Cellular injury and death are ubiquitous features of disease, yet tools to detect
      them are limited and insensitive to subtle pathological changes. Acridine orange 
      (AO), a nucleic acid dye with unique spectral properties, enables real-time
      measurement of RNA and DNA as proxies for cell viability during exposure to
      various noxious stimuli. This tool illuminates spectral signatures unique to
      various modes of cell death, such as cells undergoing apoptosis versus
      necrosis/necroptosis. This new approach also shows that cellular RNA decreases
      during necrotic, necroptotic, and apoptotic cell death caused by demyelinating,
      ischemic, and traumatic injuries, implying its involvement in a wide spectrum of 
      tissue pathologies. Furthermore, cells with pathologically low levels of
      cytoplasmic RNA are detected earlier and in higher numbers than with standard
      markers including TdT-mediated dUTP biotin nick-end labeling and cleaved caspase 
      3 immunofluorescence. Our technique highlights AO-labeled cytoplasmic RNA as an
      important early marker of cellular injury and a sensitive indicator of various
      modes of cell death in a range of experimental models.

TI  - ELKS1 localizes the synaptic vesicle priming protein bMunc13-2 to a specific
      subset of active zones.
PG  - 1143-1161
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606086 [doi]
AB  - Presynaptic active zones (AZs) are unique subcellular structures at neuronal
      synapses, which contain a network of specific proteins that control synaptic
      vesicle (SV) tethering, priming, and fusion. Munc13s are core AZ proteins with an
      essential function in SV priming. In hippocampal neurons, two different
      Munc13s-Munc13-1 and bMunc13-2-mediate opposite forms of presynaptic short-term
      plasticity and thus differentially affect neuronal network characteristics. We
      found that most presynapses of cortical and hippocampal neurons contain only
      Munc13-1, whereas approximately 10% contain both Munc13-1 and bMunc13-2. Whereas 
      the presynaptic recruitment and activation of Munc13-1 depends on
      Rab3-interacting proteins (RIMs), we demonstrate here that bMunc13-2 is recruited
      to synapses by the AZ protein ELKS1, but not ELKS2, and that this recruitment
      determines basal SV priming and short-term plasticity. Thus, synapse-specific
      interactions of different Munc13 isoforms with ELKS1 or RIMs are key determinants
      of the molecular and functional heterogeneity of presynaptic AZs.

AB  - Glutamate is the dominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, but under
      conditions of metabolic stress it can accumulate to excitotoxic levels. Although 
      pharmacologic modulation of excitatory amino acid receptors is well studied,
      minimal consideration has been given to targeting mitochondrial glutamate
      metabolism to control neurotransmitter levels. Here we demonstrate that chemical 
      inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) protects primary cortical 
      neurons from excitotoxic death. Reductions in mitochondrial pyruvate uptake do
      not compromise cellular energy metabolism, suggesting neuronal metabolic
      flexibility. Rather, MPC inhibition rewires mitochondrial substrate metabolism to
      preferentially increase reliance on glutamate to fuel energetics and anaplerosis.
      Mobilizing the neuronal glutamate pool for oxidation decreases the quantity of
      glutamate released upon depolarization and, in turn, limits the positive-feedback
      cascade of excitotoxic neuronal injury. The finding links mitochondrial pyruvate 
      metabolism to glutamatergic neurotransmission and establishes the MPC as a
      therapeutic target to treat neurodegenerative diseases characterized by
      excitotoxicity.

AB  - Telomeres, the protective ends of linear chromosomes, shorten throughout an
      individual's lifetime. Telomere shortening is proposed to be a primary molecular 
      cause of aging. Short telomeres block the proliferative capacity of stem cells,
      affecting their potential to regenerate tissues, and trigger the development of
      age-associated diseases. Mutations in telomere maintenance genes are associated
      with pathologies referred to as telomere syndromes, including
      Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, pulmonary fibrosis,
      aplastic anemia, and liver fibrosis. Telomere shortening induces chromosomal
      instability that, in the absence of functional tumor suppressor genes, can
      contribute to tumorigenesis. In addition, mutations in telomere length
      maintenance genes and in shelterin components, the protein complex that protects 
      telomeres, have been found to be associated with different types of cancer. These
      observations have encouraged the development of therapeutic strategies to treat
      and prevent telomere-associated diseases, namely aging-related diseases,
      including cancer. Here we review the molecular mechanisms underlying
      telomere-driven diseases and highlight recent advances in the preclinical
      development of telomere-targeted therapies using mouse models.

AB  - The inner membrane (IM) of mitochondria displays an intricate, highly folded
      architecture and can be divided into two domains: the inner boundary membrane
      adjacent to the outer membrane and invaginations toward the matrix, called
      cristae. Both domains are connected by narrow, tubular membrane segments called
      cristae junctions (CJs). The formation and maintenance of CJs is of vital
      importance for the organization of the mitochondrial IM and for mitochondrial and
      cellular physiology. The multisubunit mitochondrial contact site and cristae
      organizing system (MICOS) was found to be a major factor in CJ formation. In this
      study, we show that the MICOS core component Mic60 actively bends membranes and, 
      when inserted into prokaryotic membranes, induces the formation of cristae-like
      plasma membrane invaginations. The intermembrane space domain of Mic60 has a
      lipid-binding capacity and induces membrane curvature even in the absence of the 
      transmembrane helix. Mic60 homologues from alpha-proteobacteria display the same 
      membrane deforming activity and are able to partially overcome the deletion of
      Mic60 in eukaryotic cells. Our results show that membrane bending by Mic60 is an 
      ancient mechanism, important for cristae formation, and had already evolved
      before alpha-proteobacteria developed into mitochondria.

      stability.
PG  - 999-1013
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607032 [doi]
AB  - Cilia assembly and disassembly are coupled to actin dynamics, ensuring a coherent
      cellular response during environmental change. How these processes are integrated
      remains undefined. The histone lysine demethylase KDM3A plays important roles in 
      organismal homeostasis. Loss-of-function mouse models of Kdm3a phenocopy features
      associated with human ciliopathies, whereas human somatic mutations correlate
      with poor cancer prognosis. We demonstrate that absence of KDM3A facilitates
      ciliogenesis, but these resulting cilia have an abnormally wide range of axonemal
      lengths, delaying disassembly and accumulating intraflagellar transport (IFT)
      proteins. KDM3A plays a dual role by regulating actin gene expression and binding
      to the actin cytoskeleton, creating a responsive "actin gate" that involves
      ARP2/3 activity and IFT. Promoting actin filament formation rescues KDM3A mutant 
      ciliary defects. Conversely, the simultaneous depolymerization of actin networks 
      and IFT overexpression mimics the abnormal ciliary traits of KDM3A mutants. KDM3A
      is thus a negative regulator of ciliogenesis required for the controlled
      recruitment of IFT proteins into cilia through the modulation of actin dynamics.

AB  - Axonal branching and terminal arborization are fundamental events during the
      establishment of synaptic connectivity. They are triggered by assembly of actin
      filaments along axon shafts giving rise to filopodia. The specific contribution
      of the three actin isoforms, Actalpha, Actbeta, and Actgamma, to filopodia
      stability and dynamics during this process is not well understood. Here, we
      report that Actalpha, Actbeta, and Actgamma isoforms are expressed in primary
      mouse motoneurons and their transcripts are translocated into axons.
      shRNA-mediated depletion of Actalpha reduces axonal filopodia dynamics and
      disturbs collateral branch formation. Knockdown of Actbeta reduces dynamic
      movements of growth cone filopodia and impairs presynaptic differentiation.
      Ablation of Actbeta or Actgamma leads to compensatory up-regulation of the two
      other isoforms, which allows maintenance of total actin levels and preserves
      F-actin polymerization. Collectively, our data provide evidence for specific
      roles of different actin isoforms in spatial regulation of actin dynamics and
      stability in axons of developing motoneurons.

TI  - TorsinA controls TAN line assembly and the retrograde flow of dorsal perinuclear 
      actin cables during rearward nuclear movement.
PG  - 657-674
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507113 [doi]
AB  - The nucleus is positioned toward the rear of most migratory cells. In fibroblasts
      and myoblasts polarizing for migration, retrograde actin flow moves the nucleus
      rearward, resulting in the orientation of the centrosome in the direction of
      migration. In this study, we report that the nuclear envelope-localized AAA+
      (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) torsinA (TA) and its
      activator, the inner nuclear membrane protein lamina-associated polypeptide 1
      (LAP1), are required for rearward nuclear movement during centrosome orientation 
      in migrating fibroblasts. Both TA and LAP1 contributed to the assembly of
      transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines, which couple the nucleus to
      dorsal perinuclear actin cables undergoing retrograde flow. In addition, TA
      localized to TAN lines and was necessary for the proper mobility of
      EGFP-mini-nesprin-2G, a functional TAN line reporter construct, within the
      nuclear envelope. Furthermore, TA and LAP1 were indispensable for the retrograde 
      flow of dorsal perinuclear actin cables, supporting the recently proposed
      function for the nucleus in spatially organizing actin flow and cytoplasmic
      polarity. Collectively, these results identify TA as a key regulator of
      actin-dependent rearward nuclear movement during centrosome orientation.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis replicates within necrotic human macrophages.
PG  - 583-594
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603040 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis modulation of macrophage cell death is a
      well-documented phenomenon, but its role during bacterial replication is less
      characterized. In this study, we investigate the impact of plasma membrane (PM)
      integrity on bacterial replication in different functional populations of human
      primary macrophages. We discovered that IFN-gamma enhanced bacterial replication 
      in macrophage colony-stimulating factor-differentiated macrophages more than in
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-differentiated macrophages. We
      show that permissiveness in the different populations of macrophages to bacterial
      growth is the result of a differential ability to preserve PM integrity. By
      combining live-cell imaging, correlative light electron microscopy, and
      single-cell analysis, we found that after infection, a population of macrophages 
      became necrotic, providing a niche for M. tuberculosis replication before
      escaping into the extracellular milieu. Thus, in addition to bacterial
      dissemination, necrotic cells provide first a niche for bacterial replication.
      Our results are relevant to understanding the environment of M. tuberculosis
      replication in the host.

      2-4% of alpha-satellite assembled with CENP-A protects DNA lengths centered on
      133 bp, consistent with octameric nucleosomes with DNA unwrapping at entry and
      exit. CENP-A chromatin is shown to contain equimolar amounts of CENP-A and
      histones H2A, H2B, and H4, with no H3. Solid-state nanopore analyses show it to
      be nucleosomal in size. Thus, in contrast to models for hemisomes that briefly
      transition to octameric nucleosomes at specific cell cycle points or heterotypic 
      nucleosomes containing both CENP-A and histone H3, human CENP-A chromatin
      complexes are octameric nucleosomes with two molecules of CENP-A at all cell
      cycle phases.

AB  - Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) is an adhesion molecule assigned to
      the activated endothelium mediating immune cells adhesion and extravasation.
      However, its expression in renal carcinomas inversely correlates with tumor
      malignancy. Our experiments in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines
      demonstrated that von Hippel Lindau (VHL) loss, hypoxia, or PHD (for prolyl
      hydroxylase domain-containing proteins) inactivation decreased VCAM-1 levels
      through a transcriptional mechanism that was independent of the hypoxia-inducible
      factor and dependent on the nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway. Conversely, 
      VHL expression leads to high VCAM-1 levels in ccRCC, which in turn leads to
      better outcomes, possibly by favoring antitumor immunity through VCAM-1
      interaction with the alpha4beta1 integrin expressed in immune cells. Remarkably, 
      in ccRCC human samples with VHL nonmissense mutations, we observed a negative
      correlation between VCAM-1 levels and ccRCC stage, microvascular invasion, and
      symptom presentation, pointing out the clinical value of VCAM-1 levels as a
      marker of ccRCC progression.

TI  - TOPBP1(Dpb11) plays a conserved role in homologous recombination DNA repair
      through the coordinated recruitment of 53BP1(Rad9).
PG  - 623-639
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607031 [doi]
AB  - Genome maintenance and cancer suppression require homologous recombination (HR)
      DNA repair. In yeast and mammals, the scaffold protein TOPBP1(Dpb11) has been
      implicated in HR, although its precise function and mechanism of action remain
      elusive. In this study, we show that yeast Dpb11 plays an antagonistic role in
      recombination control through regulated protein interactions. Dpb11 mediates
      opposing roles in DNA end resection by coordinating both the stabilization and
      exclusion of Rad9 from DNA lesions. The Mec1 kinase promotes the pro-resection
      function of Dpb11 by mediating its interaction with the Slx4 scaffold. Human
      TOPBP1(Dpb11) engages in interactions with the anti-resection factor 53BP1 and
      the pro-resection factor BRCA1, suggesting that TOPBP1 also mediates opposing
      functions in HR control. Hyperstabilization of the 53BP1-TOPBP1 interaction
      enhances the recruitment of 53BP1 to nuclear foci in the S phase, resulting in
      impaired HR and the accumulation of chromosomal aberrations. Our results support 
      a model in which TOPBP1(Dpb11) plays a conserved role in mediating a
      phosphoregulated circuitry for the control of recombinational DNA repair.

TI  - A Drosophila model of Fragile X syndrome exhibits defects in phagocytosis by
      innate immune cells.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common known monogenic cause of autism, results from
      the loss of FMR1, a conserved, ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein. Recent
      evidence suggests that Fragile X syndrome and other types of autism are
      associated with immune system defects. We found that Drosophila melanogaster Fmr1
      mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to bacterial infection and decreased
      phagocytosis of bacteria by systemic immune cells. Using tissue-specific
      RNAi-mediated knockdown, we showed that Fmr1 plays a cell-autonomous role in the 
      phagocytosis of bacteria. Fmr1 mutants also exhibit delays in two processes that 
      require phagocytosis by glial cells, the immune cells in the brain: neuronal
      clearance after injury in adults and the development of the mushroom body, a
      brain structure required for learning and memory. Delayed neuronal clearance is
      associated with reduced recruitment of activated glia to the site of injury.
      These results suggest a previously unrecognized role for Fmr1 in regulating the
      activation of phagocytic immune cells both in the body and the brain.

TI  - Mitochondrial dysfunction induces dendritic loss via eIF2alpha phosphorylation.
PG  - 815-834
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604065 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria are key contributors to the etiology of diseases associated with
      neuromuscular defects or neurodegeneration. How changes in cellular metabolism
      specifically impact neuronal intracellular processes and cause neuropathological 
      events is still unclear. We here dissect the molecular mechanism by which
      mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Prel aberrant function mediates selective
      dendritic loss in Drosophila melanogaster class IV dendritic arborization
      neurons. Using in vivo ATP imaging, we found that neuronal cellular ATP levels
      during development are not correlated with the progression of dendritic loss. We 
      searched for mitochondrial stress signaling pathways that induce dendritic loss
      and found that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with increased eIF2alpha
      phosphorylation, which is sufficient to induce dendritic pathology in class IV
      arborization neurons. We also observed that eIF2alpha phosphorylation mediates
      dendritic loss when mitochondrial dysfunction results from other genetic
      perturbations. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction induces translation
      repression in class IV neurons in an eIF2alpha phosphorylation-dependent manner, 
      suggesting that differential translation attenuation among neuron subtypes is a
      determinant of preferential vulnerability.

TI  - Osteoblastic Lrp4 promotes osteoclastogenesis by regulating ATP release and
      adenosine-A2AR signaling.
PG  - 761-778
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608002 [doi]
AB  - Bone homeostasis depends on the functional balance of osteoblasts (OBs) and
      osteoclasts (OCs). Lrp4 is a transmembrane protein that is mutated in patients
      with high bone mass. Loss of Lrp4 in OB-lineage cells increases bone mass by
      elevating bone formation by OBs and reducing bone resorption by OCs. However, it 
      is unclear how Lrp4 deficiency in OBs impairs osteoclastogenesis. Here, we
      provide evidence that loss of Lrp4 in the OB lineage stabilizes the prorenin
      receptor (PRR) and increases PRR/V-ATPase-driven ATP release, thereby enhancing
      the production of the ATP derivative adenosine. Both pharmacological and genetic 
      inhibition of adenosine-2A receptor (A2AR) in culture and Lrp4 mutant mice
      diminishes the osteoclastogenic deficit and reduces trabecular bone mass.
      Furthermore, elevated adenosine-A2AR signaling reduces receptor activator of
      nuclear factor kappaB (RANK)-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, these
      results identify a mechanism by which osteoblastic Lrp4 controls
      osteoclastogenesis, reveal a cross talk between A2AR and RANK signaling in
      osteoclastogenesis, and uncover an unrecognized pathophysiological mechanism of
      high-bone-mass disorders.

TI  - The nuclear transport receptor Importin-11 is a tumor suppressor that maintains
      PTEN protein.
PG  - 641-656
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604025 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) protein levels are critical for tumor
      suppression. However, the search for a recurrent cancer-associated gene
      alteration that causes PTEN degradation has remained futile. In this study, we
      show that Importin-11 (Ipo11) is a transport receptor for PTEN that is required
      to physically separate PTEN from elements of the PTEN degradation machinery.
      Mechanistically, we find that the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and IPO11
      cargo, UBE2E1, is a limiting factor for PTEN degradation. Using in vitro and in
      vivo gene-targeting methods, we show that Ipo11 loss results in degradation of
      Pten, lung adenocarcinoma, and neoplasia in mouse prostate with aberrantly high
      levels of Ube2e1 in the cytoplasm. These findings explain the correlation between
      loss of IPO11 and PTEN protein in human lung tumors. Furthermore, we find that
      IPO11 status predicts disease recurrence and progression to metastasis in
      patients choosing radical prostatectomy. Thus, our data introduce the IPO11 gene 
      as a tumor-suppressor locus, which is of special importance in cancers that still
      retain at least one intact PTEN allele.

AB  - In this issue, Chen et al. (2017. J. Cell Biol.
      https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201604025) show that Importin-11 traffics the tumor
      suppressor PTEN into the nucleus and in so doing protects it from cytoplasmic
      proteins that cause PTEN degradation. This work helps explain the nuclear
      accumulation of PTEN observed in many healthy tissues and, because Ipo11 mutant
      mice develop lung tumors, also implicates Importin-11 as a novel tumor
      suppressor.

TI  - CLUH regulates mitochondrial metabolism by controlling translation and decay of
      target mRNAs.
PG  - 675-693
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607019 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria are essential organelles that host crucial metabolic pathways and
      produce adenosine triphosphate. The mitochondrial proteome is heterogeneous among
      tissues and can dynamically change in response to different metabolic conditions.
      Although the transcriptional programs that govern mitochondrial biogenesis and
      respiratory function are well known, posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms
      remain unclear. In this study, we show that the cytosolic RNA-binding protein
      clustered mitochondria homologue (CLUH) regulates the expression of a
      mitochondrial protein network supporting key metabolic programs required under
      nutrient deprivation. CLUH exerts its function by controlling the stability and
      translation of target messenger RNAs. In the absence of Cluh, mitochondria are
      severely depleted of crucial enzymes involved in catabolic energy-converting
      pathways. CLUH preserves oxidative mitochondrial function and glucose
      homeostasis, thus preventing death at the fetal-neonatal transition. In the adult
      liver, CLUH ensures maximal respiration capacity and the metabolic response to
      starvation. Our results shed new light on the posttranscriptional mechanisms
      controlling the expression of mitochondrial proteins and suggest novel strategies
      to tailor mitochondrial function to physiological and pathological conditions.

AB  - Metabolic energy reprogramming facilitates adaptations to a variety of stress
      conditions and cellular dysfunction, but how the energetic demands are monitored 
      and met in response to physiological stimuli remains elusive. Our data support a 
      model demonstrating that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a master transcriptional
      regulator of the chaperone response, has been coopted from its role as a critical
      protein quality-control regulator to having a central role in systemic energy
      sensing and for metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability. We found that in
      the absence of HSF1, levels of NAD(+) and ATP are not efficiently sustained in
      hepatic cells, largely because of transcriptional repression of nicotinamide
      phosphoribosyltransferase in the NAD(+) salvage pathway. Mechanistically, the
      defect in NAD(+) and ATP synthesis linked to a loss of NAD(+)-dependent
      deacetylase activity, increased protein acetylation, and impaired mitochondrial
      integrity. Remarkably, the drop in ATP level caused by HSF1 loss invoked an
      adaptive response featuring the inhibition of energetically demanding processes, 
      including gluconeogenesis, translation, and lipid synthesis. Our work identifies 
      HSF1 as a central regulator of cellular bioenergetics and protein homeostasis
      that benefits malignant cell progression and exacerbates development of metabolic
      diseases.

TI  - The VDAC2-BAK axis regulates peroxisomal membrane permeability.
PG  - 709-722
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605002 [doi]
AB  - Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are fatal genetic diseases consisting of 
      14 complementation groups (CGs). We previously isolated a peroxisome-deficient
      Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, ZP114, which belongs to none of these CGs.
      Using a functional screening strategy, VDAC2 was identified as rescuing the
      peroxisomal deficiency of ZP114 where VDAC2 expression was not detected.
      Interestingly, knockdown of BAK or overexpression of the BAK inhibitors BCL-XL
      and MCL-1 restored peroxisomal biogenesis in ZP114 cells. Although VDAC2 is not
      localized to the peroxisome, loss of VDAC2 shifts the localization of BAK from
      mitochondria to peroxisomes, resulting in peroxisomal deficiency. Introduction of
      peroxisome-targeted BAK harboring the Pex26p transmembrane region into wild-type 
      cells resulted in the release of peroxisomal matrix proteins to cytosol.
      Moreover, overexpression of BAK activators PUMA and BIM permeabilized peroxisomes
      in a BAK-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings suggest that BAK plays a 
      role in peroxisomal permeability, similar to mitochondrial outer membrane
      permeabilization.

TI  - Patterned cell and matrix dynamics in branching morphogenesis.
PG  - 559-570
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610048 [doi]
AB  - Many embryonic organs undergo branching morphogenesis to maximize their
      functional epithelial surface area. Branching morphogenesis requires the
      coordinated interplay of multiple types of cells with the extracellular matrix
      (ECM). During branching morphogenesis, new branches form by "budding" or
      "clefting." Cell migration, proliferation, rearrangement, deformation, and ECM
      dynamics have varied roles in driving budding versus clefting in different
      organs. Elongation of the newly formed branch and final maturation of the tip
      involve cellular mechanisms that include cell elongation, intercalation,
      convergent extension, proliferation, and differentiation. New methodologies such 
      as high-resolution live imaging, tension sensors, and force-mapping techniques
      are providing exciting new opportunities for future research into branching
      morphogenesis.

TI  - Tubby family proteins are adapters for ciliary trafficking of integral membrane
      proteins.
PG  - 743-760
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607095 [doi]
AB  - The primary cilium is a paradigmatic organelle for studying compartmentalized
      signaling; however, unlike soluble protein trafficking, processes targeting
      integral membrane proteins to cilia are poorly understood. In this study, we
      determine that the tubby family protein TULP3 functions as a general adapter for 
      ciliary trafficking of structurally diverse integral membrane cargo, including
      multiple reported and novel rhodopsin family G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 
      and the polycystic kidney disease-causing polycystin 1/2 complex. The founding
      tubby family member TUB also localizes to cilia similar to TULP3 and determines
      trafficking of a subset of these GPCRs to neuronal cilia. Using minimal ciliary
      localization sequences from GPCRs and fibrocystin (also implicated in polycystic 
      kidney disease), we demonstrate these motifs to be sufficient and TULP3 dependent
      for ciliary trafficking. We propose a three-step model for TULP3/TUB-mediated
      ciliary trafficking, including the capture of diverse membrane cargo by the tubby
      domain in a phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-dependent manner,
      ciliary delivery by intraflagellar transport complex A binding to the TULP3/TUB N
      terminus, and subsequent release into PI(4,5)P2-deficient ciliary membrane.

TI  - Arabidopsis HAP2/GCS1 is a gamete fusion protein homologous to somatic and viral 
      fusogens.
PG  - 571-581
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610093 [doi]
AB  - Cell-cell fusion is inherent to sexual reproduction. Loss of HAPLESS 2/GENERATIVE
      CELL SPECIFIC 1 (HAP2/GCS1) proteins results in gamete fusion failure in diverse 
      organisms, but their exact role is unclear. In this study, we show that
      Arabidopsis thaliana HAP2/GCS1 is sufficient to promote mammalian cell-cell
      fusion. Hemifusion and complete fusion depend on HAP2/GCS1 presence in both
      fusing cells. Furthermore, expression of HAP2 on the surface of pseudotyped
      vesicular stomatitis virus results in homotypic virus-cell fusion. We demonstrate
      that the Caenorhabditis elegans Epithelial Fusion Failure 1 (EFF-1) somatic cell 
      fusogen can replace HAP2/GCS1 in one of the fusing membranes, indicating that
      HAP2/GCS1 and EFF-1 share a similar fusion mechanism. Structural modeling of the 
      HAP2/GCS1 protein family predicts that they are homologous to EFF-1 and viral
      class II fusion proteins (e.g., Zika virus). We name this superfamily Fusexins:
      fusion proteins essential for sexual reproduction and exoplasmic merger of plasma
      membranes. We suggest a common origin and evolution of sexual reproduction,
      enveloped virus entry into cells, and somatic cell fusion.

      rescue PINK1 deficiency.

AB  - PINK1 is mutated in Parkinson's disease (PD), and mutations cause mitochondrial
      defects that include inefficient electron transport between complex I and
      ubiquinone. Neurodegeneration is also connected to changes in lipid homeostasis, 
      but how these are related to PINK1-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is unknown. 
      Based on an unbiased genetic screen, we found that partial genetic and
      pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) suppresses toxicity
      induced by PINK1 deficiency in flies, mouse cells, patient-derived fibroblasts,
      and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons. Lower FASN
      activity in PINK1 mutants decreases palmitate levels and increases the levels of 
      cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrial inner membrane-specific lipid. Direct
      supplementation of CL to isolated mitochondria not only rescues the PINK1-induced
      complex I defects but also rescues the inefficient electron transfer between
      complex I and ubiquinone in specific mutants. Our data indicate that genetic or
      pharmacologic inhibition of FASN to increase CL levels bypasses the enzymatic
      defects at complex I in a PD model.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) promote either tolerogenic or immunogenic T cell responses,
      the latter upon sensing microbes. Using an in vitro system, we analyzed
      transcriptional determinants that enable mature DCs to direct these opposing T
      cell outcomes. In the absence of microbial products, the transcription factor
      interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) promotes regulatory T cell (Treg)
      generation by enhancing expression of genes required for antigen presentation
      along with those for T cell tolerance. IRF4-deficient DCs were impaired for Treg 
      generation in vivo. When exposed to microbial stimuli, DCs activated nuclear
      factor (NF)-kappaB, which induced expression of a proinflammatory cytokine module
      that, along with the antigen presentation module, promoted the generation of
      effector T cells. NF-kappaB was, however, dispensable for Treg development.
      Chromatin profiling revealed transcriptional motifs associated with the divergent
      DC programs. Thus, DCs modulate their ability to prime tolerogenic or immunogenic
      T cells by expressing a core antigen presentation module that is overlaid by
      distinctive regulatory modules to promote either tolerance or immunity.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201610060 [doi]
AB  - Activation of protein kinase Akt via its direct phosphorylation by mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) couples extracellular growth and
      survival cues with pathways controlling cell growth and proliferation, yet how
      growth factors target the activity of mTORC2 toward Akt is unknown. In this
      study, we examine the localization of the obligate mTORC2 component, mSin1,
      inside cells and report the development of a reporter to examine intracellular
      localization and regulation by growth factors of the endogenous mTORC2 activity. 
      Using a combination of imaging and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that
      inside cells, mTORC2 activity localizes to the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and
      a subpopulation of endosomal vesicles. We show that unlike the endosomal pool,
      the activity and localization of mTORC2 via the Sin1 pleckstrin homology domain
      at the plasma membrane is PI3K and growth factor independent. Furthermore, we
      show that membrane recruitment is sufficient for Akt phosphorylation in response 
      to growth factors. Our results indicate the existence of spatially separated
      mTORC2 populations with distinct sensitivity to PI3K inside cells and suggest
      that intracellular localization could contribute to regulation of mTORC2 activity
      toward Akt.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606052 [doi]
AB  - Loss of the Merlin tumor suppressor and activation of the Hippo signaling pathway
      play major roles in the control of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We have 
      identified completely novel roles for Merlin and the Hippo pathway effector
      Yes-associated protein (YAP) in the control of Schwann cell (SC) plasticity and
      peripheral nerve repair after injury. Injury to the peripheral nervous system
      (PNS) causes a dramatic shift in SC molecular phenotype and the generation of
      repair-competent SCs, which direct functional repair. We find that loss of Merlin
      in these cells causes a catastrophic failure of axonal regeneration and
      remyelination in the PNS. This effect is mediated by activation of YAP expression
      in Merlin-null SCs, and loss of YAP restores axonal regrowth and functional
      repair. This work identifies new mechanisms that control the regenerative
      potential of SCs and gives new insight into understanding the correct control of 
      functional nerve repair in the PNS.

TI  - Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 regulates dNTP pool and promotes homologous
      recombination repair in cancer cells.
PG  - 409-424
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607008 [doi]
AB  - Glycolytic enzymes are known to play pivotal roles in cancer cell survival, yet
      their molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Phosphoglycerate mutase 1
      (PGAM1) is an important glycolytic enzyme that coordinates glycolysis, pentose
      phosphate pathway, and serine biosynthesis in cancer cells. Herein, we report
      that PGAM1 is required for homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA
      double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by DNA-damaging agents. Mechanistically, PGAM1
      facilitates DSB end resection by regulating the stability of CTBP-interacting
      protein (CtIP). Knockdown of PGAM1 in cancer cells accelerates CtIP degradation
      through deprivation of the intracellular deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate pool
      and associated activation of the p53/p73 pathway. Enzymatic inhibition of PGAM1
      decreases CtIP protein levels, impairs HR repair, and hence sensitizes
      BRCA1/2-proficient breast cancer to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
      inhibitors. Together, this study identifies a metabolically dependent function of
      PGAM1 in promoting HR repair and reveals a potential therapeutic opportunity for 
      PGAM1 inhibitors in combination with PARP inhibitors.

      and TGN homotypic fusion.
PG  - 425-439
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606078 [doi]
AB  - Yeast VPS13 is the founding member of a eukaryotic gene family of growing
      interest in cell biology and medicine. Mutations in three of four human VPS13
      genes cause autosomal recessive neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disease, 
      making yeast Vps13p an important structural and functional model. Using cell-free
      reconstitution with purified Vps13p, we show that Vps13p is directly required
      both for transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the late
      endosome/prevacuolar compartment (PVC) and for TGN homotypic fusion. Vps13p must 
      be in complex with the small calcium-binding protein Cdc31p to be active.
      Single-particle electron microscopic analysis of negatively stained Vps13p
      indicates that this 358-kD protein is folded into a compact rod-shaped density
      (20 x 4 nm) with a loop structure at one end with a circular opening
      approximately 6 nm in diameter. Vps13p exhibits ATP-stimulated binding to yeast
      membranes and specific interactions with phosphatidic acid and phosphorylated
      forms of phosphatidyl inositol at least in part through the binding affinities of
      conserved N- and C-terminal domains.

      human cells held together by a tethering complex of VAPA/B (vesicle-associated
      membrane protein-associated proteins A/B) and ACBD5 (acyl Co-A binding protein
      5).

TI  - VAPs and ACBD5 tether peroxisomes to the ER for peroxisome maintenance and lipid 
      homeostasis.
PG  - 367-377
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608128 [doi]
AB  - Lipid exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and peroxisomes is
      necessary for the synthesis and catabolism of lipids, the trafficking of
      cholesterol, and peroxisome biogenesis in mammalian cells. However, how lipids
      are exchanged between these two organelles is not understood. In this study, we
      report that the ER-resident VAMP-associated proteins A and B (VAPA and VAPB)
      interact with the peroxisomal membrane protein acyl-CoA binding domain containing
      5 (ACBD5) and that this interaction is required to tether the two organelles
      together, thereby facilitating the lipid exchange between them. Depletion of
      either ACBD5 or VAP expression results in increased peroxisome mobility,
      suggesting that VAP-ACBD5 complex acts as the primary ER-peroxisome tether. We
      also demonstrate that tethering of peroxisomes to the ER is necessary for
      peroxisome growth, the synthesis of plasmalogen phospholipids, and the
      maintenance of cellular cholesterol levels. Collectively, our data highlight the 
      importance of VAP-ACBD5-mediated contact between the ER and peroxisomes for
      organelle maintenance and lipid homeostasis.

TI  - ACBD5 and VAPB mediate membrane associations between peroxisomes and the ER.
PG  - 331-342
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607055 [doi]
AB  - Peroxisomes (POs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cooperate in cellular lipid 
      metabolism and form tight structural associations, which were first observed in
      ultrastructural studies decades ago. PO-ER associations have been suggested to
      impact on a diverse number of physiological processes, including lipid
      metabolism, phospholipid exchange, metabolite transport, signaling, and PO
      biogenesis. Despite their fundamental importance to cell metabolism, the
      mechanisms by which regions of the ER become tethered to POs are unknown, in
      particular in mammalian cells. Here, we identify the PO membrane protein
      acyl-coenzyme A-binding domain protein 5 (ACBD5) as a binding partner for the
      resident ER protein vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B
      (VAPB). We show that ACBD5-VAPB interaction regulates PO-ER associations.
      Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PO-ER association perturbs PO membrane
      expansion and increases PO movement. Our findings reveal the first molecular
      mechanism for establishing PO-ER associations in mammalian cells and report a new
      function for ACBD5 in PO-ER tethering.

TI  - A STRIPAK complex mediates axonal transport of autophagosomes and dense core
      vesicles through PP2A regulation.
PG  - 441-461
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606082 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy plays an essential role in the cellular homeostasis of neurons,
      facilitating the clearance of cellular debris. This clearance process is
      orchestrated through the assembly, transport, and fusion of autophagosomes with
      lysosomes for degradation. The motor protein dynein drives autophagosome motility
      from distal sites of assembly to sites of lysosomal fusion. In this study, we
      identify the scaffold protein CKA (connector of kinase to AP-1) as essential for 
      autophagosome transport in neurons. Together with other core components of the
      striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, we show that CKA
      associates with dynein and directly binds Atg8a, an autophagosomal protein. CKA
      is a regulatory subunit of PP2A, a component of the STRIPAK complex. We propose
      that the STRIPAK complex modulates dynein activity. Consistent with this
      hypothesis, we provide evidence that CKA facilitates axonal transport of dense
      core vesicles and autophagosomes in a PP2A-dependent fashion. In addition,
      CKA-deficient flies exhibit PP2A-dependent motor coordination defects. CKA
      function within the STRIPAK complex is crucial to prevent transport defects that 
      may contribute to neurodegeneration.

TI  - Noncanonical function of DGCR8 controls mESC exit from pluripotency.
PG  - 355-366
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606073 [doi]
AB  - Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) deficient for DGCR8, a key component of the
      microprocessor complex, present strong differentiation defects. However, the
      exact reasons impairing their commitment remain elusive. The analysis of newly
      generated mutant mESCs revealed that DGCR8 is essential for the exit from the
      pluripotency state. To dissociate canonical versus noncanonical functions of
      DGCR8, we complemented the mutant mESCs with a phosphomutant DGCR8, which
      restored microRNA levels but did not rescue the exit from pluripotency defect.
      Integration of omics data and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments established
      DGCR8 as a direct interactor of Tcf7l1 mRNA, a core component of the pluripotency
      network. Finally, we found that DGCR8 facilitated the splicing of Tcf7l1, an
      event necessary for the differentiation of mESCs. Our data reveal a new
      noncanonical function of DGCR8 in the modulation of the alternative splicing of
      Tcf7l1 mRNA in addition to its established function in microRNA biogenesis.

TI  - Heat stress induces ferroptosis-like cell death in plants.
PG  - 463-476
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605110 [doi]
AB  - In plants, regulated cell death (RCD) plays critical roles during development and
      is essential for plant-specific responses to abiotic and biotic stresses.
      Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, oxidative, nonapoptotic form of cell death
      recently described in animal cells. In animal cells, this process can be
      triggered by depletion of glutathione (GSH) and accumulation of lipid reactive
      oxygen species (ROS). We investigated whether a similar process could be relevant
      to cell death in plants. Remarkably, heat shock (HS)-induced RCD, but not
      reproductive or vascular development, was found to involve a ferroptosis-like
      cell death process. In root cells, HS triggered an iron-dependent cell death
      pathway that was characterized by depletion of GSH and ascorbic acid and
      accumulation of cytosolic and lipid ROS. These results suggest a physiological
      role for this lethal pathway in response to heat stress in Arabidopsis thaliana
      The similarity of ferroptosis in animal cells and ferroptosis-like death in
      plants suggests that oxidative, iron-dependent cell death programs may be
      evolutionarily ancient.

TI  - Regulating chromosomal movement by the cochaperone FKB-6 ensures timely pairing
      and synapsis.
PG  - 393-408
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606126 [doi]
AB  - In meiotic prophase I, homologous chromosome pairing is promoted through
      chromosome movement mediated by nuclear envelope proteins, microtubules, and
      dynein. After proper homologue pairing has been established, the synaptonemal
      complex (SC) assembles along the paired homologues, stabilizing their interaction
      and allowing for crossing over to occur. Previous studies have shown that
      perturbing chromosome movement leads to pairing defects and SC polycomplex
      formation. We show that FKB-6 plays a role in SC assembly and is required for
      timely pairing and proper double-strand break repair kinetics. FKB-6 localizes
      outside the nucleus, and in its absence, the microtubule network is altered.
      FKB-6 is required for proper movement of dynein, increasing resting time between 
      movements. Attenuating chromosomal movement in fkb-6 mutants partially restores
      the defects in synapsis, in agreement with FKB-6 acting by decreasing chromosomal
      movement. Therefore, we suggest that FKB-6 plays a role in regulating dynein
      movement by preventing excess chromosome movement, which is essential for proper 
      SC assembly and homologous chromosome pairing.

AB  - Endosome transport by transcytosis is the primary mechanism by which proteins and
      other large cargo traverse epithelial barriers in normal tissue. Transcytosis is 
      also essential for establishing and maintaining membrane polarity in epithelia
      and other polarized cells. To identify novel components of this pathway, we
      conducted a high-throughput RNA interference screen for factors necessary for the
      bidirectional transcytosis of IgG by the Fcgamma receptor FcRn. This screen
      identified 23 genes whose suppression resulted in a reproducible decrease in
      FcRn-mediated transcytosis. Pulse-chase kinetic transport assays on four of the
      top-ranking genes (EXOC2, EXOC7, PARD6B, and LEPROT) revealed distinct effects on
      the apical and basolateral recycling and transcytotic pathways, demonstrating
      that these pathways are genetically separable. We also found a strong dependence 
      on PARD6B for apical, but not basolateral, recycling, implicating this cell
      polarity gene in assembly or maintenance of the apical endosomal system. This
      dataset yields insights into how vesicular transport is adapted to the
      specialized functions of differentiated cell types and opens new research avenues
      into epithelial trafficking.

TI  - GSK3B-mediated phosphorylation of MCL1 regulates axonal autophagy to promote
      Wallerian degeneration.
PG  - 477-493
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606020 [doi]
AB  - Macroautophagy is a catabolic process, in which portions of cytoplasm or
      organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Emerging evidence has
      indicated a pathological connection between axonal degeneration and autophagy.
      However, the physiological function and induction mechanism of autophagy in axons
      remain elusive. We herein show that, through activation of BECLIN1, glycogen
      synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B)-mediated phosphorylation of BCL2 family member MCL1
      induces axonal autophagy and axonal degeneration. Phosphorylated MCL1 is
      ubiquitinated by the FBXW7 ubiquitin ligase and degraded by the proteasome,
      thereby releasing BECLIN1 to induce axonal autophagy. Axonal autophagy
      contributes to local adenosine triphosphate production in degenerating axons and 
      the exposure of phosphatidylserine-an "eat-me" signal for phagocytes-on
      transected axons and is required for normal recruitment of phagocytes to axonal
      debris in vivo. These results suggest that GSK3B-MCL1 signaling to regulate
      autophagy might be important for the successful completion of Wallerian
      degeneration.

PG  - 305-315

AB  - The nucleus is linked mechanically to the extracellular matrix via multiple
      polymers that transmit forces to the nuclear envelope and into the nuclear
      interior. Here, we review some of the emerging mechanisms of nuclear
      mechanosensing, which range from changes in protein conformation and
      transcription factor localization to chromosome reorganization and membrane
      dilation up to rupture. Nuclear mechanosensing encompasses biophysically complex 
      pathways that often converge on the main structural proteins of the nucleus, the 
      lamins. We also perform meta-analyses of public transcriptomics and proteomics
      data, which indicate that some of the mechanosensing pathways relaying signals
      from the collagen matrix to the nucleus apply to a broad range of species,
      tissues, and diseases.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are conserved from yeast to man 
      and regulate a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation and
      differentiation. Recent developments show how MAPK pathways perform exquisite
      spatial and temporal signal processing and underscores the importance of studying
      the dynamics of signaling pathways to understand their physiological response.
      The importance of dynamic mechanisms that process input signals into graded
      downstream responses has been demonstrated in the pheromone-induced and osmotic
      stress-induced MAPK pathways in yeast and in the mammalian extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase MAPK pathway. Particularly, recent studies in the yeast
      pheromone response have shown how positive feedback generates switches, negative 
      feedback enables gradient detection, and coherent feedforward regulation
      underlies cellular memory. More generally, a new wave of quantitative single-cell
      studies has begun to elucidate how signaling dynamics determine cell physiology
      and represents a paradigm shift from descriptive to predictive biology.

TI  - Trypanosome outer kinetochore proteins suggest conservation of chromosome
      segregation machinery across eukaryotes.
PG  - 379-391
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608043 [doi]
AB  - Kinetochores are multiprotein complexes that couple eukaryotic chromosomes to the
      mitotic spindle to ensure proper segregation. The model for kinetochore assembly 
      is conserved between humans and yeast, and homologues of several components are
      widely distributed in eukaryotes, but key components are absent in some lineages.
      The recent discovery in a lineage of protozoa called kinetoplastids of
      unconventional kinetochores with no apparent homology to model organisms suggests
      that more than one system for eukaryotic chromosome segregation may exist. In
      this study, we report a new family of proteins distantly related to outer
      kinetochore proteins Ndc80 and Nuf2. The family member in kinetoplastids,
      KKT-interacting protein 1 (KKIP1), associates with the kinetochore, and its
      depletion causes severe defects in karyokinesis, loss of individual chromosomes, 
      and gross defects in spindle assembly or stability. Immunopurification of KKIP1
      from stabilized kinetochores identifies six further components, which form part
      of a trypanosome outer kinetochore complex. These findings suggest that
      kinetochores in organisms such as kinetoplastids are built from a divergent, but 
      not ancestrally distinct, set of components and that Ndc80/Nuf2-like proteins are
      universal in eukaryotic division.

AB  - In the last ten years, there has been a dramatic surge in the number of
      publications where single or groups of cells are grown in substrata that have
      elements of basement membrane leading to the formation of tissue-like structures 
      referred to as organoids. However, this field of research began many decades ago,
      when the pioneers of cell culture began to ask questions we still ask today: How 
      does organogenesis occur? How do signals integrate to make such vastly different 
      tissues and organs given that the sequence of the genome in our trillions of
      cells is identical? Here, we summarize how work over the past century generated
      the conceptual framework that has allowed us to make progress in the
      understanding of tissue-specific morphogenetic programs. The development of cell 
      culture systems that provide accurate and physiologically relevant models are
      proving to be key in establishing appropriate platforms for the development of
      new therapeutic strategies.

TI  - The palmitoyltransferase Approximated promotes growth via the Hippo pathway by
      palmitoylation of Fat.
PG  - 265-277
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201609094 [doi]
AB  - The large protocadherin Fat functions to promote Hippo pathway activity in
      restricting tissue growth. Loss of Fat leads to accumulation of the atypical
      myosin Dachs at the apical junctional region, which in turn promotes growth by
      inhibiting Warts. We previously identified Approximated (App), a DHHC domain
      palmitoyltransferase, as a negative regulator of Fat signaling in growth control.
      We show here that App promotes growth by palmitoylating the intracellular domain 
      of Fat, and that palmitoylation negatively regulates Fat function. Independently,
      App also recruits Dachs to the apical junctional region through protein-protein
      association, thereby stimulating Dachs's activity in promoting growth. Further,
      we show that palmitoylation by App functions antagonistically to phosphorylation 
      by Discs-overgrown, which activates Fat. Together, these findings suggest a model
      in which App promotes Dachs activity by simultaneously repressing Fat via
      posttranslational modification and recruiting Dachs to the apical junctional
      region, thereby promoting tissue growth.

AB  - The science universe is dimmer after one of our brightest stars, Susan Lee
      Lindquist, was taken by cancer on October 27, 2016. Sue was an innovative,
      creative, out-of-the-box scientific thinker. She had unique biological
      intuition-an instinct for both the way things worked and the right questions to
      ask to uncover new research insights. Her wide-ranging career began with the
      study of protein folding and molecular chaperones, and she went on to show that
      protein folding can have profound and unexpected biological effects on such
      diverse processes as cancer, evolution, and neurodegenerative disease. As Sue's
      laboratory manager, I would like to offer a ground-floor perspective on what made
      her an exceptional scientist, mentor, and leader. She created a harmonious,
      collegial environment where collaborative synergy fueled meaningful progress that
      will impact science for decades to come.

TI  - Two distinct membrane potential-dependent steps drive mitochondrial matrix
      protein translocation.
PG  - 83-92
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607066 [doi]
AB  - Two driving forces energize precursor translocation across the inner
      mitochondrial membrane. Although the membrane potential (Deltapsi) is considered 
      to drive translocation of positively charged presequences through the TIM23
      complex (presequence translocase), the activity of the Hsp70-powered import motor
      is crucial for the translocation of the mature protein portion into the matrix.
      In this study, we show that mitochondrial matrix proteins display surprisingly
      different dependencies on the Deltapsi. However, a precursor's hypersensitivity
      to a reduction of the Deltapsi is not linked to the respective presequence, but
      rather to the mature portion of the polypeptide chain. The presequence
      translocase constituent Pam17 is specifically recruited by the receptor Tim50 to 
      promote the transport of hypersensitive precursors into the matrix. Our analyses 
      show that two distinct Deltapsi-driven translocation steps energize precursor
      passage across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The Deltapsi- and
      Pam17-dependent import step identified in this study is positioned between the
      two known energy-dependent steps: Deltapsi-driven presequence translocation and
      adenosine triphosphate-driven import motor activity.

      lipotoxicity.
PG  - 131-147
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606059 [doi]
AB  - Ceramides are key intermediates in sphingolipid biosynthesis and potent signaling
      molecules. However, excess ceramide is toxic, causing growth arrest and
      apoptosis. In this study, we identify a novel mechanism by which cells prevent
      the toxic accumulation of ceramides; they facilitate nonvesicular ceramide
      transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex, where
      ceramides are converted to complex sphingolipids. We find that the yeast protein 
      Nvj2p promotes the nonvesicular transfer of ceramides from the ER to the Golgi
      complex. The protein is a tether that generates close contacts between these
      compartments and may directly transport ceramide. Nvj2p normally resides at
      contacts between the ER and other organelles, but during ER stress, it
      relocalizes to and increases ER-Golgi contacts. ER-Golgi contacts fail to form
      during ER stress in cells lacking Nvj2p. Our findings demonstrate that cells
      regulate ER-Golgi contacts in response to stress and reveal that nonvesicular
      ceramide transfer out of the ER prevents the buildup of toxic amounts of
      ceramides.

TI  - Podosome assembly is controlled by the GTPase ARF1 and its nucleotide exchange
      factor ARNO.
PG  - 181-197
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605104 [doi]
AB  - Podosomes represent a class of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions formed by 
      migrating and matrix-degrading cells. We demonstrate that in macrophage-like THP1
      cells and fibroblasts stimulated to produce podosomes, down-regulation of the
      G-protein ARF1 or the ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, ARNO, by small,
      interfering RNA or pharmacological inhibitors led to striking podosome
      elimination. Concomitantly, treatments inducing podosome formation increased the 
      level of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound ARF1. ARNO was found to colocalize
      with the adhesive rings of podosomes, whereas ARF1 was localized to vesicular
      structures transiently contacting podosome rings. Inhibition of ARF1 led to an
      increase in RhoA-GTP levels and triggered assembly of myosin-IIA filaments in
      THP1 cells, whereas the suppression of myosin-IIA rescued podosome formation
      regardless of ARF1 inhibition. Finally, expression of constitutively active ARF1 
      in fibroblasts induced formation of putative podosome precursors: actin-rich
      puncta coinciding with matrix degradation sites and containing proteins of the
      podosome core but not of the adhesive ring. Thus, ARNO-ARF1 regulates formation
      of podosomes by inhibition of RhoA/myosin-II and promotion of actin core
      assembly.

      Scrib.
PG  - 199-215
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602002 [doi]
AB  - Semaphorins comprise a large family of ligands that regulate key cellular
      functions through their receptors, plexins. In this study, we show that the
      transmembrane semaphorin 4A (Sema4A) can also function as a receptor, rather than
      a ligand, and transduce signals triggered by the binding of Plexin-B1 through
      reverse signaling. Functionally, reverse Sema4A signaling regulates the migration
      of various cancer cells as well as dendritic cells. By combining mass
      spectrometry analysis with small interfering RNA screening, we identify the
      polarity protein Scrib as a downstream effector of Sema4A. We further show that
      binding of Plexin-B1 to Sema4A promotes the interaction of Sema4A with Scrib,
      thereby removing Scrib from its complex with the Rac/Cdc42 exchange factor
      betaPIX and decreasing the activity of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac1
      and Cdc42. Our data unravel a role for Plexin-B1 as a ligand and Sema4A as a
      receptor and characterize a reverse signaling pathway downstream of Sema4A, which
      controls cell migration.

PG  - 167-179
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201608071 [doi]
AB  - The critical initiation phase of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) determines
      where and when endocytosis occurs. Heterotetrameric adaptor protein 2 (AP2)
      complexes, which initiate clathrin-coated pit (CCP) assembly, are activated by
      conformational changes in response to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
      (PIP2) and cargo binding at multiple sites. However, the functional hierarchy of 
      interactions and how these conformational changes relate to distinct steps in CCP
      formation in living cells remains unknown. We used quantitative live-cell
      analyses to measure discrete early stages of CME and show how sequential,
      allosterically regulated conformational changes activate AP2 to drive both
      nucleation and subsequent stabilization of nascent CCPs. Our data establish that 
      cargoes containing Yxxphi motif, but not dileucine motif, play a critical role in
      the earliest stages of AP2 activation and CCP nucleation. Interestingly, these
      cargo and PIP2 interactions are not conserved in yeast. Thus, we speculate that
      AP2 has evolved as a key regulatory node to coordinate CCP formation and cargo
      sorting and ensure high spatial and temporal regulation of CME.

AB  - Cells are physical objects that exert mechanical forces on their surroundings as 
      they migrate and take their places within tissues. New techniques are now poised 
      to enable the measurement of cell-generated mechanical forces in intact tissues
      in vivo, which will illuminate the secret dynamic lives of cells and change our
      current perception of cell biology.

TI  - Fife organizes synaptic vesicles and calcium channels for high-probability
      neurotransmitter release.
PG  - 231-246
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601098 [doi]
AB  - The strength of synaptic connections varies significantly and is a key
      determinant of communication within neural circuits. Mechanistic insight into
      presynaptic factors that establish and modulate neurotransmitter release
      properties is crucial to understanding synapse strength, circuit function, and
      neural plasticity. We previously identified Drosophila Piccolo-RIM-related Fife, 
      which regulates neurotransmission and motor behavior through an unknown
      mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that Fife localizes and interacts with RIM at the
      active zone cytomatrix to promote neurotransmitter release. Loss of Fife results 
      in the severe disruption of active zone cytomatrix architecture and molecular
      organization. Through electron tomographic and electrophysiological studies, we
      find a decrease in the accumulation of release-ready synaptic vesicles and their 
      release probability caused by impaired coupling to Ca(2+) channels. Finally, we
      find that Fife is essential for the homeostatic modulation of neurotransmission. 
      We propose that Fife organizes active zones to create synaptic vesicle release
      sites within nanometer distance of Ca(2+) channel clusters for reliable and
      modifiable neurotransmitter release.

TI  - Activating the nuclear piston mechanism of 3D migration in tumor cells.
PG  - 93-100
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605097 [doi]
AB  - Primary human fibroblasts have the remarkable ability to use their nucleus like a
      piston, switching from low- to high-pressure protrusions in response to the
      surrounding three-dimensional (3D) matrix. Although migrating tumor cells can
      also change how they migrate in response to the 3D matrix, it is not clear if
      they can switch between high- and low-pressure protrusions like primary
      fibroblasts. We report that unlike primary fibroblasts, the nuclear piston is not
      active in fibrosarcoma cells. Protease inhibition rescued the nuclear piston
      mechanism in polarized HT1080 and SW684 cells and generated compartmentalized
      pressure. Achieving compartmentalized pressure required the
      nucleoskeleton-cytoskeleton linker protein nesprin 3, actomyosin contractility,
      and integrin-mediated adhesion, consistent with lobopodia-based fibroblast
      migration. In addition, this activation of the nuclear piston mechanism slowed
      the 3D movement of HT1080 cells. Together, these data indicate that inhibiting
      protease activity during polarized tumor cell 3D migration is sufficient to
      restore the nuclear piston migration mechanism with compartmentalized pressure
      characteristic of nonmalignant cells.

TI  - INPP5E regulates phosphoinositide-dependent cilia transition zone function.
PG  - 247-263
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511055 [doi]
AB  - Human ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JBTS), arise from cilia
      dysfunction. The inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase INPP5E localizes to cilia
      and is mutated in JBTS. Murine Inpp5e ablation is embryonically lethal and
      recapitulates JBTS, including neural tube defects and polydactyly; however, the
      underlying defects in cilia signaling and the function of INPP5E at cilia are
      still emerging. We report Inpp5e(-/-) embryos exhibit aberrant Hedgehog-dependent
      patterning with reduced Hedgehog signaling. Using mouse genetics, we show
      increasing Hedgehog signaling via Smoothened M2 expression rescues some
      Inpp5e(-/-) ciliopathy phenotypes and "normalizes" Hedgehog signaling. INPP5E's
      phosphoinositide substrates PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 accumulated at the
      transition zone (TZ) in Hedgehog-stimulated Inpp5e(-/-) cells, which was
      associated with reduced recruitment of TZ scaffolding proteins and reduced
      Smoothened levels at cilia. Expression of wild-type, but not 5-phosphatase-dead, 
      INPP5E restored TZ molecular organization and Smoothened accumulation at cilia.
      Therefore, we identify INPP5E as an essential point of convergence between
      Hedgehog and phosphoinositide signaling at cilia that maintains TZ function and
      Hedgehog-dependent embryonic development.

AB  - Reduced mitochondrial electron transport chain activity promotes longevity and
      improves energy homeostasis via cell-autonomous and -non-autonomous factors in
      multiple model systems. This mitohormetic effect is thought to involve the
      mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)), an adaptive stress-response
      pathway activated by mitochondrial proteotoxic stress. Using mice with skeletal
      muscle-specific deficiency of Crif1 (muscle-specific knockout [MKO]), an integral
      protein of the large mitoribosomal subunit (39S), we identified growth
      differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a UPR(mt)-associated cell-non-autonomous
      myomitokine that regulates systemic energy homeostasis. MKO mice were protected
      against obesity and sensitized to insulin, an effect associated with elevated
      GDF15 secretion after UPR(mt) activation. In ob/ob mice, administration of
      recombinant GDF15 decreased body weight and improved insulin sensitivity, which
      was attributed to elevated oxidative metabolism and lipid mobilization in the
      liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Thus, GDF15 is a potent mitohormetic signal
      that safeguards against the onset of obesity and insulin resistance.

AB  - Single-molecule manipulation and imaging techniques have become important
      elements of the biologist's toolkit to gain mechanistic insights into cellular
      processes. By removing ensemble averaging, single-molecule methods provide unique
      access to the dynamic behavior of biomolecules. Recently, the use of these
      approaches has expanded to the study of complex multiprotein systems and has
      enabled detailed characterization of the behavior of individual molecules inside 
      living cells. In this review, we provide an overview of the various force- and
      fluorescence-based single-molecule methods with applications both in vitro and in
      vivo, highlighting these advances by describing their applications in studies on 
      cytoskeletal motors and DNA replication. We also discuss how single-molecule
      approaches have increased our understanding of the dynamic behavior of complex
      multiprotein systems. These methods have shown that the behavior of
      multicomponent protein complexes is highly stochastic and less linear and
      deterministic than previously thought. Further development of single-molecule
      tools will help to elucidate the molecular dynamics of these complex systems both
      inside the cell and in solutions with purified components.

TI  - 4E-BP is a target of the GCN2-ATF4 pathway during Drosophila development and
      aging.

AB  - Reduced amino acid availability attenuates mRNA translation in cells and helps to
      extend lifespan in model organisms. The amino acid deprivation-activated kinase
      GCN2 mediates this response in part by phosphorylating eIF2alpha. In addition,
      the cap-dependent translational inhibitor 4E-BP is transcriptionally induced to
      extend lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster, but through an unclear mechanism.
      Here, we show that GCN2 and its downstream transcription factor, ATF4, mediate
      4E-BP induction, and GCN2 is required for lifespan extension in response to
      dietary restriction of amino acids. The 4E-BP intron contains ATF4-binding sites 
      that not only respond to stress but also show inherent ATF4 activity during
      normal development. Analysis of the newly synthesized proteome through metabolic 
      labeling combined with click chemistry shows that certain stress-responsive
      proteins are resistant to inhibition by 4E-BP, and gcn2 mutant flies have reduced
      levels of stress-responsive protein synthesis. These results indicate that GCN2
      and ATF4 are important regulators of 4E-BP transcription during normal
      development and aging.

AB  - Mass spectrometry (MS) is an essential part of the cell biologist's proteomics
      toolkit, allowing analyses at molecular and system-wide scales. However,
      proteomics still lag behind genomics in popularity and ease of use. We discuss
      key differences between MS-based -omics and other booming -omics technologies and
      highlight what we view as the future of MS and its role in our increasingly deep 
      understanding of cell biology.

      vertebrate cells.
PG  - 101-113
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605001 [doi]
AB  - Centromeres are specified by sequence-independent epigenetic mechanisms, and the 
      centromere position may drift at each cell cycle, but once this position is
      specified, it may not be frequently moved. Currently, it is unclear whether the
      centromere position is stable. To address this question, we systematically
      analyzed the position of nonrepetitive centromeres in 21 independent clones
      isolated from a laboratory stock of chicken DT40 cells using chromatin
      immunoprecipitation combined with massive parallel sequencing analysis with
      anti-CENP-A antibody. We demonstrated that the centromere position varies among
      the clones, suggesting that centromere drift occurs during cell proliferation.
      However, when we analyzed this position in the subclones obtained from one
      isolated clone, the position was found to be relatively stable. Interestingly,
      the centromere drift was shown to occur frequently in CENP-U- and
      CENP-S-deficient cells. Based on these results, we suggest that the centromere
      position can change after many cell divisions, but this drift is suppressed in
      short-term cultures, and the complete centromere structure contributes to the
      suppression of the centromere drift.

AB  - With recent advances in high-throughput, automated microscopy, there has been an 
      increased demand for effective computational strategies to analyze large-scale,
      image-based data. To this end, computer vision approaches have been applied to
      cell segmentation and feature extraction, whereas machine-learning approaches
      have been developed to aid in phenotypic classification and clustering of data
      acquired from biological images. Here, we provide an overview of the commonly
      used computer vision and machine-learning methods for generating and categorizing
      phenotypic profiles, highlighting the general biological utility of each
      approach.

AB  - Synthetic biology is advancing the design of genetic devices that enable the
      study of cellular and molecular biology in mammalian cells. These genetic devices
      use diverse regulatory mechanisms to both examine cellular processes and achieve 
      precise and dynamic control of cellular phenotype. Synthetic biology tools
      provide novel functionality to complement the examination of natural cell
      systems, including engineered molecules with specific activities and model
      systems that mimic complex regulatory processes. Continued development of
      quantitative standards and computational tools will expand capacities to probe
      cellular mechanisms with genetic devices to achieve a more comprehensive
      understanding of the cell. In this study, we review synthetic biology tools that 
      are being applied to effectively investigate diverse cellular processes,
      regulatory networks, and multicellular interactions. We also discuss current
      challenges and future developments in the field that may transform the types of
      investigation possible in cell biology.

PG  - 217-230
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201607064 [doi]
AB  - Antibody production and affinity maturation are driven by B cell extraction and
      internalization of antigen from immune synapses. However, the extraction
      mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we develop DNA-based nanosensors to
      interrogate two previously proposed mechanisms, enzymatic liberation and
      mechanical force. Using antigens presented by either artificial substrates or
      live cells, we show that B cells primarily use force-dependent extraction and
      resort to enzymatic liberation only if mechanical forces fail to retrieve
      antigen. The use of mechanical forces renders antigen extraction sensitive to the
      physical properties of the presenting cells. We show that follicular dendritic
      cells are stiff cells that promote strong B cell pulling forces and stringent
      affinity discrimination. In contrast, dendritic cells are soft and promote
      acquisition of low-affinity antigens through low forces. Thus, the mechanical
      properties of B cell synapses regulate antigen extraction, suggesting that
      distinct properties of presenting cells support different stages of B cell
      responses.

AB  - In 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists who have
      made groundbreaking contributions to the field of superresolution (SR) microscopy
      (SRM). The first commercial SR microscope came to market a decade earlier, and
      many other commercial options have followed. As commercialization has lowered the
      barrier to using SRM and the awarding of the Nobel Prize has drawn attention to
      these methods, biologists have begun adopting SRM to address a wide range of
      questions in many types of specimens. There is no shortage of reviews on the
      fundamental principles of SRM and the remarkable achievements made with these
      methods. We approach SRM from another direction: we focus on the current
      practical limitations and compromises that must be made when designing an SRM
      experiment. We provide information and resources to help biologists navigate
      through common pitfalls in SRM specimen preparation and optimization of image
      acquisition as well as errors and artifacts that may compromise the
      reproducibility of SRM data.

TI  - Robust gap repair in the contractile ring ensures timely completion of
      cytokinesis.
PG  - 789-799
AB  - Cytokinesis in animal cells requires the constriction of an actomyosin
      contractile ring, whose architecture and mechanism remain poorly understood. We
      use laser microsurgery to explore the biophysical properties of constricting
      rings in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Laser cutting causes rings to snap open.
      However, instead of disintegrating, ring topology recovers and constriction
      proceeds. In response to severing, a finite gap forms and is repaired by
      recruitment of new material in an actin polymerization-dependent manner. An open 
      ring is able to constrict, and rings repair from successive cuts. After gap
      repair, an increase in constriction velocity allows cytokinesis to complete at
      the same time as controls. Our analysis demonstrates that tension in the ring
      increases while net cortical tension at the site of ingression decreases
      throughout constriction and suggests that cytokinesis is accomplished by
      contractile modules that assemble and contract autonomously, enabling local
      repair of the actomyosin network. Consequently, cytokinesis is a highly robust
      process impervious to discontinuities in contractile ring structure.

TI  - LINC complexes promote homologous recombination in part through inhibition of
      nonhomologous end joining.
PG  - 801-821
AB  - The Caenorhabditis elegans SUN domain protein, UNC-84, functions in nuclear
      migration and anchorage in the soma. We discovered a novel role for UNC-84 in DNA
      damage repair and meiotic recombination. Loss of UNC-84 leads to defects in the
      loading and disassembly of the recombinase RAD-51. Similar to mutations in
      Fanconi anemia (FA) genes, unc-84 mutants and human cells depleted of Sun-1 are
      sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents, and sensitivity is rescued by the
      inactivation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). UNC-84 also recruits FA
      nuclease FAN-1 to the nucleoplasm, suggesting that UNC-84 both alters the extent 
      of repair by NHEJ and promotes the processing of cross-links by FAN-1. UNC-84
      interacts with the KASH protein ZYG-12 for DNA damage repair. Furthermore, the
      microtubule network and interaction with the nucleoskeleton are important for
      repair, suggesting that a functional linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton
      (LINC) complex is required. We propose that LINC complexes serve a conserved role
      in DNA repair through both the inhibition of NHEJ and the promotion of homologous
      recombination at sites of chromosomal breaks.

TI  - ULK1 cycling: The ups and downs of the autophagy response.
PG  - 757-759
AB  - The Ser/Thr kinase ULK1/Atg1 controls autophagy initiation under nutrient
      starvation conditions. In this issue, Nazio et al. (2016. J. Cell Biol.
      https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201605089) demonstrate that oscillatory modulation of
      NEDD4L-mediated proteasomal degradation and mTOR-dependent de novo protein
      synthesis of ULK1 ensures the proper amplitude and duration of the autophagy
      response during prolonged starvation, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis.

TI  - Fine-tuning of ULK1 mRNA and protein levels is required for autophagy
      oscillation.
PG  - 841-856
AB  - Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway whose levels are tightly
      controlled to secure cell homeostasis. Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is a conserved
      serine-threonine kinase that plays a central role in the initiation of autophagy.
      Here, we report that upon autophagy progression, ULK1 protein levels are
      specifically down-regulated by the E3 ligase NEDD4L, which ubiquitylates ULK1 for
      degradation by the proteasome. However, whereas ULK1 protein is degraded, ULK1
      mRNA is actively transcribed. Upon reactivation of mTOR-dependent protein
      synthesis, basal levels of ULK1 are promptly restored, but the activity of newly 
      synthesized ULK1 is inhibited by mTOR. This prepares the cell for a new possible 
      round of autophagy stimulation. Our results thus place NEDD4L and ULK1 in a key
      position to control oscillatory activation of autophagy during prolonged stress
      to keep the levels of this process under a safe and physiological threshold.

TI  - MOZART1 and gamma-tubulin complex receptors are both required to turn gamma-TuSC 
      into an active microtubule nucleation template.
PG  - 823-840
AB  - MOZART1/Mzt1 is required for the localization of gamma-tubulin complexes to
      microtubule (MT)-organizing centers from yeast to human cells. Nevertheless, the 
      molecular function of MOZART1/Mzt1 is largely unknown. Taking advantage of the
      minimal MT nucleation system of Candida albicans, we reconstituted the
      interactions of Mzt1, gamma-tubulin small complex (gamma-TuSC), and gamma-tubulin
      complex receptors (gamma-TuCRs) Spc72 and Spc110 in vitro. With affinity
      measurements, domain deletion, and swapping, we show that Spc110 and Mzt1 bind to
      distinct regions of the gamma-TuSC. In contrast, both Mzt1 and gamma-TuSC
      interact with the conserved CM1 motif of Spc110/Spc72. Spc110/Spc72 and Mzt1
      constitute "oligomerization chaperones," cooperatively promoting and directing
      gamma-TuSC oligomerization into MT nucleation-competent rings. Consistent with
      the functions of Mzt1, human MOZART1 directly interacts with the CM1-containing
      region of the gamma-TuCR CEP215. MOZART1 depletion in human cells destabilizes
      the large gamma-tubulin ring complex and abolishes CEP215(CM1)-induced ectopic MT
      nucleation. Together, we reveal conserved functions of MOZART1/Mzt1 through
      interactions with gamma-tubulin complex subunits and gamma-TuCRs.

TI  - NK cells converge lytic granules to promote cytotoxicity and prevent bystander
      killing.
PG  - 875-889
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cell activation triggers sequential cellular events leading
      to destruction of diseased cells. We previously identified lytic granule
      convergence, a dynein- and integrin signal-dependent movement of lysosome-related
      organelles to the microtubule-organizing center, as an early step in the cell
      biological process underlying NK cell cytotoxicity. Why lytic granules converge
      during NK cell cytotoxicity, however, remains unclear. We experimentally
      controlled the availability of human ligands to regulate NK cell signaling and
      promote granule convergence with either directed or nondirected degranulation. By
      the use of acoustic trap microscopy, we generated specific effector-target cell
      arrangements to define the impact of the two modes of degranulation. NK cells
      with converged granules had greater targeted and less nonspecific "bystander"
      killing. Additionally, NK cells in which dynein was inhibited or integrin blocked
      under physiological conditions demonstrated increased nondirected degranulation
      and bystander killing. Thus, NK cells converge lytic granules and thereby improve
      the efficiency of targeted killing and prevent collateral damage to neighboring
      healthy cells.

TI  - Protein sorting at the ER-Golgi interface.
PG  - 769-778
AB  - Protein traffic is of critical importance for normal cellular physiology. In
      eukaryotes, spherical transport vesicles move proteins and lipids from one
      internal membrane-bound compartment to another within the secretory pathway. The 
      process of directing each individual protein to a specific destination (known as 
      protein sorting) is a crucial event that is intrinsically linked to vesicle
      biogenesis. In this review, we summarize the principles of cargo sorting by the
      vesicle traffic machinery and consider the diverse mechanisms by which cargo
      proteins are selected and captured into different transport vesicles. We focus on
      the first two compartments of the secretory pathway: the endoplasmic reticulum
      and Golgi. We provide an overview of the complexity and diversity of cargo
      adaptor function and regulation, focusing on recent mechanistic discoveries that 
      have revealed insight into protein sorting in cells.

TI  - Calcium channel regulator Mid1 links TORC2-mediated changes in mitochondrial
      respiration to autophagy.
PG  - 779-788
AB  - Autophagy is a catabolic process that recycles cytoplasmic contents and is
      crucial for cell survival during stress. The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase
      regulates autophagy as part of two distinct protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2.
      TORC1 negatively regulates autophagy according to nitrogen availability. In
      contrast, TORC2 functions as a positive regulator of autophagy during amino acid 
      starvation, via its target kinase Ypk1, by repressing the activity of the
      calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and promoting the general amino acid
      control (GAAC) response. Precisely how TORC2-Ypk1 signaling regulates calcineurin
      within this pathway remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that activation of
      calcineurin requires Mid1, an endoplasmic reticulum-localized calcium channel
      regulatory protein implicated in the oxidative stress response. We find that
      normal mitochondrial respiration is perturbed in TORC2-Ypk1-deficient cells,
      which results in the accumulation of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen
      species that signal to Mid1 to activate calcineurin, thereby inhibiting the GAAC 
      response and autophagy. These findings describe a novel pathway involving TORC2, 
      mitochondrial oxidative stress, and calcium homeostasis for autophagy regulation.

TI  - Atg8 family LC3/GABARAP proteins are crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion
      but not autophagosome formation during PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and starvation.
PG  - 857-874
AB  - Members of the Atg8 family of proteins are conjugated to autophagosomal
      membranes, where they have been proposed to drive autophagosome formation and
      selective sequestration of cargo. In mammals, the Atg8 family consists of six
      members divided into the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies. To define Atg8 function, we
      used genome editing to generate knockouts of the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies as
      well as all six Atg8 family members in HeLa cells. We show that Atg8s are
      dispensable for autophagosome formation and selective engulfment of mitochondria,
      but essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We find that the GABARAP
      subfamily promotes PLEKHM1 recruitment and governs autophagosome-lysosome fusion,
      whereas the LC3 subfamily plays a less prominent role in these processes.
      Although neither GABARAPs nor LC3s are required for autophagosome biogenesis,
      loss of all Atg8s yields smaller autophagosomes and a slowed initial rate of
      autophagosome formation. Our results clarify the essential function of the Atg8
      family and identify GABARAP subfamily members as primary contributors to
      PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and starvation autophagy.

TI  - Postnatal activation of TLR4 in astrocytes promotes excitatory synaptogenesis in 
      hippocampal neurons.
PG  - 719-734
AB  - Astrocytes are critical in synapse development, and their dysfunction in crucial 
      developmental stages leads to serious neurodevelopmental diseases, including
      seizures and epilepsy. Immune challenges not only affect brain development, but
      also promote seizure generation and epileptogenesis, implying immune activation
      is one of the key factors linking seizures and epilepsy to abnormal brain
      development. In this study, we report that activating astrocytes by systemic
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges in the second postnatal week promotes
      excitatory synapse development, leading to enhanced seizure susceptibility in
      mice. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in astrocytes increased astrocytic
      extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and phospho-Erk1/2 levels in a
      myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent manner.
      Constitutively activating Erk1/2 in astrocytes was sufficient to enhance
      excitatory synaptogenesis without activating TLR4. Deleting MyD88 or suppressing 
      Erk1/2 in astrocytes rescued LPS-induced developmental abnormalities of
      excitatory synapses and restored the enhanced seizure sensitivity. Thus, we
      provide direct evidence for a developmental role of astrocytes in shaping a
      predisposition to seizure generation.

TI  - Structures of human mitofusin 1 provide insight into mitochondrial tethering.
PG  - 621-629
AB  - Mitochondria undergo fusion and fission. The merging of outer mitochondrial
      membranes requires mitofusin (MFN), a dynamin-like GTPase. How exactly MFN
      mediates membrane fusion is poorly understood. Here, we determined crystal
      structures of a minimal GTPase domain (MGD) of human MFN1, including the
      predicted GTPase and the distal part of the C-terminal tail (CT). The structures 
      revealed that a helix bundle (HB) formed by three helices extending from the
      GTPase and one extending from the CT closely attaches to the GTPase domain,
      resembling the configuration of bacterial dynamin-like protein. We show that the 
      nucleotide-binding pocket is shallow and narrow, rendering weak hydrolysis and
      less dependence on magnesium ion, and that association of HB affects GTPase
      activity. MFN1 forms a dimer when GTP or GDP/BeF3(-), but not GDP or other
      analogs, is added. In addition, clustering of vesicles containing
      membrane-anchored MGD requires continuous GTP hydrolysis. These results suggest
      that MFN tethers apposing membranes, likely through nucleotide-dependent
      dimerization.

TI  - Mitochondrial division occurs concurrently with autophagosome formation but
      independently of Drp1 during mitophagy.
PG  - 649-665
AB  - Mitophagy is thought to play an important role in mitochondrial quality control. 
      Mitochondrial division is believed to occur first, and autophagosome formation
      subsequently occurs to enwrap mitochondria as a process of mitophagy. However,
      there has not been any temporal analysis of mitochondrial division and
      autophagosome formation in mitophagy. Therefore, the relationships among these
      processes remain unclear. We show that the mitochondrial division factor Dnm1 in 
      yeast or Drp1 in mammalian cells is dispensable for mitophagy. Autophagosome
      formation factors, such as FIP200, ATG14, and WIPIs, were essential for the
      mitochondrial division for mitophagy. Live-cell imaging showed that isolation
      membranes formed on the mitochondria. A small portion of the mitochondria then
      divided from parental mitochondria simultaneously with the extension of isolation
      membranes and autophagosome formation. These findings suggest the presence of a
      mitophagy process in which mitochondrial division for mitophagy is accomplished
      together with autophagosome formation.

TI  - EphA2 is a functional receptor for the growth factor progranulin.
PG  - 687-703
AB  - Although the growth factor progranulin was discovered more than two decades ago, 
      the functional receptor remains elusive. Here, we discovered that EphA2, a member
      of the large family of Ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases, is a functional
      signaling receptor for progranulin. Recombinant progranulin bound with high
      affinity to EphA2 in both solid phase and solution. Interaction of progranulin
      with EphA2 caused prolonged activation of the receptor, downstream stimulation of
      mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, and promotion of capillary
      morphogenesis. Furthermore, we found an autoregulatory mechanism of progranulin
      whereby a feed-forward loop occurred in an EphA2-dependent manner that was
      independent of the endocytic receptor sortilin. The discovery of a functional
      signaling receptor for progranulin offers a new avenue for understanding the
      underlying mode of action of progranulin in cancer progression, tumor
      angiogenesis, and perhaps neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - A GPI processing phospholipase A2, PGAP6, modulates Nodal signaling in embryos by
      shedding CRIPTO.
PG  - 705-718
AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) can be shed from the
      cell membrane by GPI cleavage. In this study, we report a novel GPI-processing
      enzyme, termed post-glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to proteins 6
      (PGAP6), which is a GPI-specific phospholipase A2 mainly localized at the cell
      surface. CRIPTO, a GPI-AP, which plays critical roles in early embryonic
      development by acting as a Nodal coreceptor, is a highly sensitive substrate of
      PGAP6, whereas CRYPTIC, a close homologue of CRIPTO, is not sensitive. CRIPTO
      processed by PGAP6 was released as a lysophosphatidylinositol-bearing form, which
      is further cleaved by phospholipase D. CRIPTO shed by PGAP6 was active as a
      coreceptor in Nodal signaling, whereas cell-associated CRIPTO activity was
      reduced when PGAP6 was expressed. Homozygous Pgap6 knockout mice showed defects
      in early embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the
      anterior-posterior axis, which are common features with Cripto knockout embryos. 
      These results suggest PGAP6 plays a critical role in Nodal signaling modulation
      through CRIPTO shedding.

TI  - GTSE1 tunes microtubule stability for chromosome alignment and segregation by
      inhibiting the microtubule depolymerase MCAK.
PG  - 631-647
AB  - The dynamic regulation of microtubules (MTs) during mitosis is critical for
      accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. Cancer cell lines with
      hyperstabilized kinetochore MTs have increased segregation errors and elevated
      chromosomal instability (CIN), but the genetic defects responsible remain largely
      unknown. The MT depolymerase MCAK (mitotic centromere-associated kinesin) can
      influence CIN through its impact on MT stability, but how its potent activity is 
      controlled in cells remains unclear. In this study, we show that GTSE1, a protein
      found overexpressed in aneuploid cancer cell lines and tumors, regulates MT
      stability during mitosis by inhibiting MCAK MT depolymerase activity. Cells
      lacking GTSE1 have defects in chromosome alignment and spindle positioning as a
      result of MT instability caused by excess MCAK activity. Reducing GTSE1 levels in
      CIN cancer cell lines reduces chromosome missegregation defects, whereas
      artificially inducing GTSE1 levels in chromosomally stable cells elevates
      chromosome missegregation and CIN. Thus, GTSE1 inhibition of MCAK activity
      regulates the balance of MT stability that determines the fidelity of chromosome 
      alignment, segregation, and chromosomal stability.

TI  - Meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation in oocytes.
PG  - 611-619
AB  - Oocytes accumulate maternal stores (proteins, mRNAs, metabolites, etc.) during
      their growth in the ovary to support development after fertilization. To preserve
      this cytoplasmic maternal inheritance, they accomplish the difficult task of
      partitioning their cytoplasm unequally while dividing their chromosomes equally. 
      Added to this complexity, most oocytes, for reasons still speculative, lack the
      major microtubule organizing centers that most cells use to assemble and position
      their spindles, namely canonical centrosomes. In this review, we will address
      recent work on the mechanisms of meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome
      alignment/segregation in female gametes to try to understand the origin of errors
      of oocyte meiotic divisions. The challenge of oocyte divisions appears indeed not
      trivial because in both mice and humans oocyte meiotic divisions are prone to
      chromosome segregation errors, a leading cause of frequent miscarriages and
      congenital defects.

TI  - MicroRNAs-103/107 coordinately regulate macropinocytosis and autophagy.
PG  - 667-685
AB  - Macropinocytosis, by which cells ingest large amounts of fluid, and autophagy,
      the lysosome-based catabolic process, involve vesicular biogenesis (early stage) 
      and turnover (end stage). Much is known about early-stage events; however, our
      understanding of how the end stages of these processes are governed is
      incomplete. Here we demonstrate that the microRNA-103/107(miR-103/107) family,
      which is preferentially expressed in the stem cell-enriched limbal epithelium,
      coordinately regulates aspects of both these activities. Loss of miR-103/107
      causes dysregulation of macropinocytosis with the formation of large vacuoles,
      primarily through up-regulation of Src, Ras, and Ankfy1. Vacuole accumulation is 
      not a malfunction of early-stage autophagy; rather, miR-103/107 ensure proper
      end-stage autophagy by regulating diacylglycerol/protein kinase C and
      cyclin-dependent kinase 5 signaling, which enables dynamin to function in vacuole
      clearance. Our findings unveil a key biological function for miR-103/107 in
      coordinately suppressing macropinocytosis and preserving end-stage autophagy,
      thereby contributing to maintenance of a stem cell-enriched epithelium.

TI  - Cadherin-6B proteolysis promotes the neural crest cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
      transition through transcriptional regulation.
PG  - 735-747
AB  - During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), cells disassemble
      cadherin-based junctions to segregate from the epithelia. Chick premigratory
      cranial neural crest cells reduce Cadherin-6B (Cad6B) levels through several
      mechanisms, including proteolysis, to permit their EMT and migration. Serial
      processing of Cad6B by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) proteins and
      gamma-secretase generates intracellular C-terminal fragments (CTF2s) that could
      acquire additional functions. Here we report that Cad6B CTF2 possesses a novel
      pro-EMT role by up-regulating EMT effector genes in vivo. After proteolysis, CTF2
      remains associated with beta-catenin, which stabilizes and redistributes both
      proteins to the cytosol and nucleus, leading to up-regulation of beta-catenin,
      CyclinD1, Snail2, and Snail2 promoter-based GFP expression in vivo. A CTF2
      beta-catenin-binding mutant, however, fails to alter gene expression, indicating 
      that CTF2 modulates beta-catenin-responsive EMT effector genes. Notably, CTF2
      association with the endogenous Snail2 promoter in the neural crest is
      beta-catenin dependent. Collectively, our data reveal how Cad6B proteolysis
      orchestrates multiple pro-EMT regulatory inputs, including CTF2-mediated
      up-regulation of the Cad6B repressor Snail2, to ensure proper cranial neural
      crest EMT.

TI  - The endosomal transcriptional regulator RNF11 integrates degradation and
      transport of EGFR.
PG  - 543-558
AB  - Stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces internalization
      and partial degradation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) by the endo-lysosomal pathway.
      For continuous cell functioning, EGFR plasma membrane levels are maintained by
      transporting newly synthesized EGFRs to the cell surface. The regulation of this 
      process is largely unknown. In this study, we find that EGF stimulation
      specifically increases the transport efficiency of newly synthesized EGFRs from
      the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. This coincides with an
      up-regulation of the inner coat protein complex II (COPII) components SEC23B,
      SEC24B, and SEC24D, which we show to be specifically required for EGFR transport.
      Up-regulation of these COPII components requires the transcriptional regulator
      RNF11, which localizes to early endosomes and appears additionally in the cell
      nucleus upon continuous EGF stimulation. Collectively, our work identifies a new 
      regulatory mechanism that integrates the degradation and transport of EGFR in
      order to maintain its physiological levels at the plasma membrane.

TI  - Proteolipid protein-deficient myelin promotes axonal mitochondrial dysfunction
      via altered metabolic coupling.
PG  - 531-542
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a neurological syndrome characterized by
      degeneration of central nervous system (CNS) axons. Mutated HSP proteins include 
      myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and axon-enriched proteins involved in
      mitochondrial function, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) structure, and
      microtubule (MT) stability/function. We characterized axonal mitochondria, SER,
      and MTs in rodent optic nerves where PLP is replaced by the peripheral nerve
      myelin protein, P0 (P0-CNS mice). Mitochondrial pathology and degeneration were
      prominent in juxtaparanodal axoplasm at 1 mo of age. In wild-type (WT) optic
      nerve axons, 25% of mitochondria-SER associations occurred on extensions of the
      mitochondrial outer membrane. Mitochondria-SER associations were reduced by 86%
      in 1-mo-old P0-CNS juxtaparanodal axoplasm. 1-mo-old P0-CNS optic nerves were
      more sensitive to oxygen-glucose deprivation and contained less adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) than WT nerves. MT pathology and paranodal axonal ovoids were 
      prominent at 6 mo. These data support juxtaparanodal mitochondrial degeneration, 
      reduced mitochondria-SER associations, and reduced ATP production as causes of
      axonal ovoid formation and axonal degeneration.

TI  - A family of membrane-shaping proteins at ER subdomains regulates pre-peroxisomal 
      vesicle biogenesis.
PG  - 515-529
AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three conserved reticulon and reticulon-like
      proteins that help maintain ER structure by stabilizing high membrane curvature
      in ER tubules and the edges of ER sheets. A mutant lacking all three proteins has
      dramatically altered ER morphology. We found that ER shape is restored in this
      mutant when Pex30p or its homologue Pex31p is overexpressed. Pex30p can tubulate 
      membranes both in cells and when reconstituted into proteoliposomes, indicating
      that Pex30p is a novel ER-shaping protein. In contrast to the reticulons, Pex30p 
      is low abundance, and we found that it localizes to subdomains in the ER. We show
      that these ER subdomains are the sites where most preperoxisomal vesicles (PPVs) 
      are generated. In addition, overproduction or deletion of Pex30p or Pex31p alters
      the size, shape, and number of PPVs. Our findings suggest that Pex30p and Pex31p 
      help shape and generate regions of the ER where PPV biogenesis occurs.

TI  - GTPase cross talk regulates TRAPPII activation of Rab11 homologues during vesicle
      biogenesis.
PG  - 499-513
AB  - Rab guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) control cellular trafficking pathways by 
      regulating vesicle formation, transport, and tethering. Rab11 and its paralogs
      regulate multiple secretory and endocytic recycling pathways, yet the guanine
      nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rab11 in most eukaryotic cells is
      unresolved. The large multisubunit transport protein particle (TRAPP) II complex 
      has been proposed to act as a GEF for Rab11 based on genetic evidence, but
      conflicting biochemical experiments have created uncertainty regarding Rab11
      activation. Using physiological Rab-GEF reconstitution reactions, we now provide 
      definitive evidence that TRAPPII is a bona fide GEF for the yeast Rab11
      homologues Ypt31/32. We also uncover a direct role for Arf1, a distinct GTPase,
      in recruiting TRAPPII to anionic membranes. Given the known role of Ypt31/32 in
      stimulating activation of Arf1, a bidirectional cross talk mechanism appears to
      drive biogenesis of secretory and endocytic recycling vesicles. By coordinating
      simultaneous activation of two essential GTPase pathways, this mechanism ensures 
      recruitment of the complete set of effectors needed for vesicle formation,
      transport, and tethering.

TI  - Integrin-mediated mechanotransduction.
PG  - 445-456
AB  - Cells can detect and react to the biophysical properties of the extracellular
      environment through integrin-based adhesion sites and adapt to the extracellular 
      milieu in a process called mechanotransduction. At these adhesion sites,
      integrins connect the extracellular matrix (ECM) with the F-actin cytoskeleton
      and transduce mechanical forces generated by the actin retrograde flow and myosin
      II to the ECM through mechanosensitive focal adhesion proteins that are
      collectively termed the "molecular clutch." The transmission of forces across
      integrin-based adhesions establishes a mechanical reciprocity between the
      viscoelasticity of the ECM and the cellular tension. During mechanotransduction, 
      force allosterically alters the functions of mechanosensitive proteins within
      adhesions to elicit biochemical signals that regulate both rapid responses in
      cellular mechanics and long-term changes in gene expression. Integrin-mediated
      mechanotransduction plays important roles in development and tissue homeostasis, 
      and its dysregulation is often associated with diseases.

TI  - Analysis of membrane proteins localizing to the inner nuclear envelope in living 
      cells.
PG  - 575-590
AB  - Understanding the protein composition of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is
      fundamental to elucidating its role in normal nuclear function and in disease;
      however, few tools exist to examine the INM in living cells, and the INM-specific
      proteome remains poorly characterized. Here, we adapted split green fluorescent
      protein (split-GFP) to systematically localize known and predicted integral
      membrane proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the INM as opposed to the outer 
      nuclear membrane. Our data suggest that components of the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) as well as other organelles are able to access the INM, particularly if they
      contain a small extraluminal domain. By pairing split-GFP with fluorescence
      correlation spectroscopy, we compared the composition of complexes at the INM and
      ER, finding that at least one is unique: Sbh2, but not Sbh1, has access to the
      INM. Collectively, our work provides a comprehensive analysis of transmembrane
      protein localization to the INM and paves the way for further research into INM
      composition and function.

TI  - Rac1/RhoA antagonism defines cell-to-cell heterogeneity during epidermal
      morphogenesis in nematodes.
PG  - 483-498
AB  - The antagonism between the GTPases Rac1 and RhoA controls cell-to-cell
      heterogeneity in isogenic populations of cells in vitro and epithelial
      morphogenesis in vivo. Its involvement in the regulation of cell-to-cell
      heterogeneity during epidermal morphogenesis has, however, never been addressed. 
      We used a quantitative cell imaging approach to characterize epidermal
      morphogenesis at a single-cell level during early elongation of Caenorhabditis
      elegans embryos. This study reveals that a Rac1-like pathway, involving the
      Rac/Cdc42 guanine-exchange factor beta-PIX/PIX-1 and effector PAK1/PAK-1, and a
      RhoA-like pathway, involving ROCK/LET-502, control the remodeling of apical
      junctions and the formation of basolateral protrusions in distinct subsets of
      hypodermal cells. In these contexts, protrusions adopt lamellipodia or an
      amoeboid morphology. We propose that lamella formation may reduce tension
      building at cell-cell junctions during morphogenesis. Cell-autonomous antagonism 
      between these pathways enables cells to switch between Rac1- and RhoA-like
      morphogenetic programs. This study identifies the first case of cell-to-cell
      heterogeneity controlled by Rac1/RhoA antagonism during epidermal morphogenesis.

TI  - Plastin 1 widens stereocilia by transforming actin filament packing from
      hexagonal to liquid.
PG  - 467-482
AB  - With their essential role in inner ear function, stereocilia of sensory hair
      cells demonstrate the importance of cellular actin protrusions. Actin packing in 
      stereocilia is mediated by cross-linkers of the plastin, fascin, and espin
      families. Although mice lacking espin (ESPN) have no vestibular or auditory
      function, we found that mice that either lacked plastin 1 (PLS1) or had
      nonfunctional fascin 2 (FSCN2) had reduced inner ear function, with double-mutant
      mice most strongly affected. Targeted mass spectrometry indicated that PLS1 was
      the most abundant cross-linker in vestibular stereocilia and the second most
      abundant protein overall; ESPN only accounted for approximately 15% of the total 
      cross-linkers in bundles. Mouse utricle stereocilia lacking PLS1 were shorter and
      thinner than wild-type stereocilia. Surprisingly, although wild-type stereocilia 
      had random liquid packing of their actin filaments, stereocilia lacking PLS1 had 
      orderly hexagonal packing. Although all three cross-linkers are required for
      stereocilia structure and function, PLS1 biases actin toward liquid packing,
      which allows stereocilia to grow to a greater diameter.

TI  - Asymmetrically localized proteins stabilize basal bodies against ciliary beating 
      forces.
PG  - 457-466
AB  - Basal bodies are radially symmetric, microtubule-rich structures that nucleate
      and anchor motile cilia. Ciliary beating produces asymmetric mechanical forces
      that are resisted by basal bodies. To resist these forces, distinct regions
      within the basal body ultrastructure and the microtubules themselves must be
      stable. However, the molecular components that stabilize basal bodies remain
      poorly defined. Here, we determine that Fop1 functionally interacts with the
      established basal body stability components Bld10 and Poc1. We find that Fop1 and
      microtubule glutamylation incorporate into basal bodies at distinct stages of
      assembly, culminating in their asymmetric enrichment at specific triplet
      microtubule regions that are predicted to experience the greatest mechanical
      force from ciliary beating. Both Fop1 and microtubule glutamylation are required 
      to stabilize basal bodies against ciliary beating forces. Our studies reveal that
      microtubule glutamylation and Bld10, Poc1, and Fop1 stabilize basal bodies
      against the forces produced by ciliary beating via distinct yet interdependent
      mechanisms.

TI  - DAAM1 stabilizes epithelial junctions by restraining WAVE complex-dependent
      lateral membrane motility.
PG  - 559-573
AB  - Epithelial junctions comprise two subdomains, the apical junctional complex (AJC)
      and the adjacent lateral membrane contacts (LCs), that span the majority of the
      junction. The AJC is lined with circumferential actin cables, whereas the LCs are
      associated with less-organized actin filaments whose roles are elusive. We found 
      that DAAM1, a formin family actin regulator, accumulated at the LCs, and its
      depletion caused dispersion of actin filaments at these sites while hardly
      affecting circumferential actin cables. DAAM1 loss enhanced the motility of
      LC-forming membranes, leading to their invasion of neighboring cell layers, as
      well as disruption of polarized epithelial layers. We found that components of
      the WAVE complex and its downstream targets were required for the elevation of LC
      motility caused by DAAM1 loss. These findings suggest that the LC membranes are
      motile by nature because of the WAVE complex, but DAAM1-mediated actin regulation
      normally restrains this motility, thereby stabilizing epithelial architecture,
      and that DAAM1 loss evokes invasive abilities of epithelial cells.

TI  - Increased intracellular pH is necessary for adult epithelial and embryonic stem
      cell differentiation.
PG  - 345-355
AB  - Despite extensive knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of stem cell
      differentiation, less is known about the role of dynamic cytosolic cues. We
      report that an increase in intracellular pH (pHi) is necessary for the efficient 
      differentiation of Drosophila adult follicle stem cells (FSCs) and mouse
      embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We show that pHi increases with differentiation
      from FSCs to prefollicle cells (pFCs) and follicle cells. Loss of the Drosophila 
      Na(+)-H(+) exchanger DNhe2 lowers pHi in differentiating cells, impairs pFC
      differentiation, disrupts germarium morphology, and decreases fecundity. In
      contrast, increasing pHi promotes excess pFC cell differentiation toward a
      polar/stalk cell fate through suppressing Hedgehog pathway activity. Increased
      pHi also occurs with mESC differentiation and, when prevented, attenuates
      spontaneous differentiation of naive cells, as determined by expression of
      microRNA clusters and stage-specific markers. Our findings reveal a previously
      unrecognized role of pHi dynamics for the differentiation of two distinct types
      of stem cell lineages, which opens new directions for understanding conserved
      regulatory mechanisms.

TI  - Mechanistic insights into mammalian stress granule dynamics.
PG  - 313-323
AB  - The accumulation of stalled translation preinitiation complexes (PICs) mediates
      the condensation of stress granules (SGs). Interactions between prion-related
      domains and intrinsically disordered protein regions found in SG-nucleating
      proteins promote the condensation of ribonucleoproteins into SGs. We propose that
      PIC components, especially 40S ribosomes and mRNA, recruit nucleators that
      trigger SG condensation. With resolution of stress, translation reinitiation
      reverses this process and SGs disassemble. By cooperatively modulating the
      assembly and disassembly of SGs, ribonucleoprotein condensation can influence the
      survival and recovery of cells exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions.

TI  - Intracellular TRPA1 mediates Ca2+ release from lysosomes in dorsal root ganglion 
      neurons.
PG  - 369-381
AB  - Transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) is a nonselective cation channel
      implicated in thermosensation and inflammatory pain. In this study, we show that 
      TRPA1 (activated by allyl isothiocyanate, acrolein, and 4-hydroxynonenal)
      elevates the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in dorsal root
      ganglion (DRG) neurons in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca(2+)
      Pharmacological and immunocytochemical analyses revealed the presence of TRPA1
      channels both on the plasma membrane and in endolysosomes. Confocal line-scan
      imaging demonstrated Ca(2+) signals elicited from individual endolysosomes
      ("lysosome Ca(2+) sparks") by TRPA1 activation. In physiological solutions, the
      TRPA1-mediated endolysosomal Ca(2+) release contributed to approximately 40% of
      the overall [Ca(2+)]i rise and directly triggered vesicle exocytosis and
      calcitonin gene-related peptide release, which greatly enhanced the excitability 
      of DRG neurons. Thus, in addition to working via Ca(2+) influx, TRPA1 channels
      trigger vesicle release in sensory neurons by releasing Ca(2+) from lysosome-like
      organelles.

TI  - -Back-to-back mechanisms drive actomyosin ring closure during Drosophila embryo
      cleavage.
PG  - 335-344
AB  - Contraction of actomyosin rings during cytokinesis is typically attributed to
      actin filaments sliding toward each other via Myosin-2 motor activity. However,
      rings constrict in some cells in the absence of Myosin-2 activity. Thus, ring
      closure uses Myosin-2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. But what the
      Myosin-2-independent mechanisms are, and to what extent they are sufficient to
      drive closure, remains unclear. During cleavage in Drosophila melanogaster
      embryos, actomyosin rings constrict in two sequential and mechanistically
      distinct phases. We show that these phases differ in constriction speed and are
      genetically and pharmacologically separable. Further, Myosin-2 activity is
      required for slow constriction in "phase 1" but is largely dispensable for fast
      constriction in "phase 2," and F-actin disassembly is only required for fast
      constriction in phase 2. Switching from phase 1 to phase 2 seemingly relies on
      the spatial organization of F-actin as controlled by Cofilin, Anillin, and
      Septin. Our work shows that fly embryos present a singular opportunity to compare
      separable ring constriction mechanisms, with varying Myosin-2 dependencies, in
      one cell type and in vivo.

TI  - Msi RNA-binding proteins control reserve intestinal stem cell quiescence.
PG  - 401-413
AB  - Regeneration of the intestinal epithelium is driven by multiple intestinal stem
      cell (ISC) types, including an active, radiosensitive Wnt(high) ISC that fuels
      turnover during homeostasis and a reserve, radioresistant Wnt(low/off) ISC
      capable of generating active Wnt(high) ISCs. We examined the role of the Msi
      family of oncoproteins in the ISC compartment. We demonstrated that Msi proteins 
      are dispensable for normal homeostasis and self-renewal of the active ISC,
      despite their being highly expressed in these cells. In contrast, Msi proteins
      are required specifically for activation of reserve ISCs, where Msi activity is
      both necessary and sufficient to drive exit from quiescence and entry into the
      cell cycle. Ablation of Msi activity in reserve ISCs rendered the epithelium
      unable to regenerate in response to injury that ablates the active stem cell
      compartment. These findings delineate a molecular mechanism governing reserve ISC
      quiescence and demonstrate a necessity for the activity of this rare stem cell
      population in intestinal regeneration.

TI  - Formin-generated actomyosin arcs propel T cell receptor microcluster movement at 
      the immune synapse.
PG  - 383-399
AB  - Actin assembly and inward flow in the plane of the immunological synapse (IS)
      drives the centralization of T cell receptor microclusters (TCR MCs) and the
      integrin leukocyte functional antigen 1 (LFA-1). Using structured-illumination
      microscopy (SIM), we show that actin arcs populating the medial, lamella-like
      region of the IS arise from linear actin filaments generated by one or more
      formins present at the IS distal edge. After traversing the outer,
      Arp2/3-generated, lamellipodia-like region of the IS, these linear filaments are 
      organized by myosin II into antiparallel concentric arcs. Three-dimensional SIM
      shows that active LFA-1 often aligns with arcs, whereas TCR MCs commonly reside
      between arcs, and total internal reflection fluorescence SIM shows TCR MCs being 
      swept inward by arcs. Consistently, disrupting actin arc formation via formin
      inhibition results in less centralized TCR MCs, missegregated integrin clusters, 
      decreased T-B cell adhesion, and diminished TCR signaling. Together, our results 
      define the origin, organization, and functional significance of a major
      actomyosin contractile structure at the IS that directly propels TCR MC
      transport.

TI  - HMGB2 orchestrates the chromatin landscape of senescence-associated secretory
      phenotype gene loci.
PG  - 325-334
AB  - Cellular senescence is a stable cell growth arrest that is characterized by the
      silencing of proliferation-promoting genes through compaction of chromosomes into
      senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). Paradoxically, senescence is
      also accompanied by increased transcription of certain genes encoding for
      secreted factors such as cytokines and chemokines, known as the
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). How SASP genes are excluded
      from SAHF-mediated global gene silencing remains unclear. In this study, we
      report that high mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) orchestrates the chromatin
      landscape of SASP gene loci. HMGB2 preferentially localizes to SASP gene loci
      during senescence. Loss of HMGB2 during senescence blunts SASP gene expression by
      allowing for spreading of repressive heterochromatin into SASP gene loci. This
      correlates with incorporation of SASP gene loci into SAHF. Our results establish 
      HMGB2 as a novel master regulator that orchestrates SASP through prevention of
      heterochromatin spreading to allow for exclusion of SASP gene loci from a global 
      heterochromatin environment during senescence.

TI  - Five factors can reconstitute all three phases of microtubule polymerization
      dynamics.
PG  - 357-368
AB  - Cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) undergo growth, shrinkage, and pausing. However,
      how MT polymerization cycles are produced and spatiotemporally regulated at a
      molecular level is unclear, as the entire cycle has not been recapitulated in
      vitro with defined components. In this study, we reconstituted dynamic MT plus
      end behavior involving all three phases by mixing tubulin with five Drosophila
      melanogaster proteins (EB1, XMAP215(Msps), Sentin, kinesin-13(Klp10A), and
      CLASP(Mast/Orbit)). When singly mixed with tubulin, CLASP(Mast/Orbit) strongly
      inhibited MT catastrophe and reduced the growth rate. However, in the presence of
      the other four factors, CLASP(Mast/Orbit) acted as an inducer of pausing. The
      mitotic kinase Plk1(Polo) modulated the activity of CLASP(Mast/Orbit) and
      kinesin-13(Klp10A) and increased the dynamic instability of MTs, reminiscent of
      mitotic cells. These results suggest that five conserved proteins constitute the 
      core factors for creating dynamic MTs in cells and that Plk1-dependent
      phosphorylation is a crucial event for switching from the interphase to mitotic
      mode.

TI  - Sema3d controls collective endothelial cell migration by distinct mechanisms via 
      Nrp1 and PlxnD1.
PG  - 415-430
AB  - During cardiovascular development, tight spatiotemporal regulation of molecular
      cues is essential for controlling endothelial cell (EC) migration. Secreted class
      III Semaphorins play an important role in guidance of neuronal cell migration and
      were lately linked to regulating cardiovascular development. Recently, SEMA3D
      gene disruptions were associated with cardiovascular defects in patients;
      however, the mechanisms of action were not revealed. Here we show for the first
      time that Sema3d regulates collective EC migration in zebrafish through two
      separate mechanisms. Mesenchymal Sema3d guides outgrowth of the common cardinal
      vein via repulsion and signals through PlexinD1. Additionally, within the same
      ECs, we identified a novel function of autocrine Sema3d signaling in regulating
      Actin network organization and EC morphology. We show that this new function
      requires Sema3d signaling through Neuropilin1, which then regulates Actin network
      organization through RhoA upstream of Rock, stabilizing the EC sheet. Our
      findings are highly relevant for understanding EC migration and the mechanisms of
      collective migration in other contexts.

TI  - Subdiffractional tracking of internalized molecules reveals heterogeneous motion 
      states of synaptic vesicles.
PG  - 277-292
AB  - Our understanding of endocytic pathway dynamics is severely restricted by the
      diffraction limit of light microscopy. To address this, we implemented a novel
      technique based on the subdiffractional tracking of internalized molecules
      (sdTIM). This allowed us to image anti-green fluorescent protein Atto647N-tagged 
      nanobodies trapped in synaptic vesicles (SVs) from live hippocampal nerve
      terminals expressing vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2)-pHluorin with 
      36-nm localization precision. Our results showed that, once internalized,
      VAMP2-pHluorin/Atto647N-tagged nanobodies exhibited a markedly lower mobility
      than on the plasma membrane, an effect that was reversed upon restimulation in
      presynapses but not in neighboring axons. Using Bayesian model selection applied 
      to hidden Markov modeling, we found that SVs oscillated between diffusive states 
      or a combination of diffusive and transport states with opposite directionality. 
      Importantly, SVs exhibiting diffusive motion were relatively less likely to
      switch to the transport motion. These results highlight the potential of the
      sdTIM technique to provide new insights into the dynamics of endocytic pathways
      in a wide variety of cellular settings.

TI  - Independent modes of ganglion cell translocation ensure correct lamination of the
      zebrafish retina.
PG  - 259-275
AB  - The arrangement of neurons into distinct layers is critical for neuronal
      connectivity and function. During development, most neurons move from their
      birthplace to the appropriate layer, where they polarize. However, kinetics and
      modes of many neuronal translocation events still await exploration. In this
      study, we investigate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) translocation across the
      embryonic zebrafish retina. After completing their translocation, RGCs establish 
      the most basal retinal layer where they form the optic nerve. Using in toto light
      sheet microscopy, we show that somal translocation of RGCs is a fast and directed
      event. It depends on basal process attachment and stabilized microtubules.
      Interestingly, interference with somal translocation induces a switch to
      multipolar migration. This multipolar mode is less efficient but still leads to
      successful RGC layer formation. When both modes are inhibited though, RGCs fail
      to translocate and induce lamination defects. This indicates that correct RGC
      translocation is crucial for subsequent retinal lamination.

TI  - Regulation of morphine-induced synaptic alterations: Role of oxidative stress, ER
      stress, and autophagy.
PG  - 245-258
AB  - Our findings suggest that morphine dysregulates synaptic balance in the
      hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory, via a novel signaling pathway 
      involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and
      autophagy. We demonstrate in this study that exposure of morphine to hippocampal 
      neurons leads to a reduction in excitatory synapse densities with a concomitant
      enhancement of inhibitory synapse densities via activation of the mu opioid
      receptor. Furthermore, these effects of morphine are mediated by up-regulation of
      intracellular ROS from NADPH oxidase, leading, in turn, to sequential induction
      of ER stress and autophagy. The detrimental effects of morphine on synaptic
      densities were shown to be reversed by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a
      pleiotropic growth factor that has been implicated in neuroprotection. These
      results identify a novel cellular mechanism involved in morphine-mediated
      synaptic alterations with implications for therapeutic interventions by PDGF.

TI  - Nuclear calcium is required for human T cell activation.
PG  - 231-243
AB  - Calcium signals in stimulated T cells are generally considered single entities
      that merely trigger immune responses, whereas costimulatory events specify the
      type of reaction. Here we show that the "T cell calcium signal" is a composite
      signal harboring two distinct components that antagonistically control genomic
      programs underlying the immune response. Using human T cells from healthy
      individuals, we establish nuclear calcium as a key signal in human T cell
      adaptogenomics that drives T cell activation and is required for signaling to
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein and the induction
      of CD25, CD69, interleukin-2, and gamma-interferon. In the absence of nuclear
      calcium signaling, cytosolic calcium activating nuclear factor of activated T
      cells translocation directed the genomic response toward enhanced expression of
      genes that negatively modulate T cell activation and are associated with a
      hyporesponsive state. Thus, nuclear calcium controls the T cell fate decision
      between a proliferative immune response and tolerance. Modulators of nuclear
      calcium-driven transcription may be used to develop a new type of pro-tolerance
      immunosuppressive therapy.

TI  - Unidirectional Eph/ephrin signaling creates a cortical actomyosin differential to
      drive cell segregation.
PG  - 217-229
AB  - Cell segregation is the process by which cells self-organize to establish
      developmental boundaries, an essential step in tissue formation. Cell segregation
      is a common outcome of Eph/ephrin signaling, but the mechanisms remain unclear.
      In craniofrontonasal syndrome, X-linked mosaicism for ephrin-B1 expression has
      been hypothesized to lead to aberrant Eph/ephrin-mediated cell segregation. Here,
      we use mouse genetics to exploit mosaicism to study cell segregation in the
      mammalian embryo and integrate live-cell imaging to examine the underlying
      cellular and molecular mechanisms. Our data demonstrate that dramatic
      ephrin-B1-mediated cell segregation occurs in the early neuroepithelium. In
      contrast to the paradigm that repulsive bidirectional signaling drives cell
      segregation, unidirectional EphB kinase signaling leads to cell sorting by the
      Rho kinase-dependent generation of a cortical actin differential between
      ephrin-B1- and EphB-expressing cells. These results define mechanisms of
      Eph/ephrin-mediated cell segregation, implicating unidirectional regulation of
      cortical actomyosin contractility as a key effector of this fundamental process.

TI  - Kinesin-1 controls mast cell degranulation and anaphylaxis through PI3K-dependent
      recruitment to the granular Slp3/Rab27b complex.
PG  - 203-216
AB  - Cross-linking of mast cell (MC) IgE receptors (FcepsilonRI) triggers
      degranulation of secretory granules (SGs) and the release of many allergic and
      inflammatory mediators. Although degranulation depends crucially on microtubule
      dynamics, the molecular machinery that couples SGs to microtubule-dependent
      transport is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that mice lacking
      Kif5b (the heavy chain of kinesin-1) in hematopoietic cells are less sensitive to
      IgE-mediated, passive, systemic anaphylaxis. After IgE-induced stimulation, bone 
      marrow-derived MCs from Kif5b knockout mice exhibited a marked reduction in SG
      translocation toward the secretion site. In contrast, a lack of Kif5b did not
      affect cytokine secretion, early FcepsilonRI-initiated signaling pathways, or
      microtubule reorganization upon FcepsilonRI stimulation. We identified Slp3 as
      the critical effector linking kinesin-1 to Rab27b-associated SGs. Kinesin-1
      recruitment to the Slp3/Rab27b effector complex was independent of microtubule
      reorganization but occurred only upon stimulation requiring phosphatidylinositol 
      3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Our findings demonstrate that PI3K-dependent formation 
      of a kinesin-1/Slp3/Rab27b complex is critical for the microtubule-dependent
      movement of SGs required for MC degranulation.

TI  - The mitochondrial protein CHCHD2 primes the differentiation potential of human
      induced pluripotent stem cells to neuroectodermal lineages.
PG  - 187-202
AB  - Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) utility is limited by variations in
      the ability of these cells to undergo lineage-specific differentiation. We have
      undertaken a transcriptional comparison of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines
      and hiPSC lines and have shown that hiPSCs are inferior in their ability to
      undergo neuroectodermal differentiation. Among the differentially expressed
      candidates between hESCs and hiPSCs, we identified a mitochondrial protein,
      CHCHD2, whose expression seems to correlate with neuroectodermal differentiation 
      potential of pluripotent stem cells. We provide evidence that hiPSC variability
      with respect to CHCHD2 expression and differentiation potential is caused by
      clonal variation during the reprogramming process and that CHCHD2 primes
      neuroectodermal differentiation of hESCs and hiPSCs by binding and sequestering
      SMAD4 to the mitochondria, resulting in suppression of the activity of the
      TGFbeta signaling pathway. Using CHCHD2 as a marker for assessing and comparing
      the hiPSC clonal and/or line differentiation potential provides a tool for large 
      scale differentiation and hiPSC banking studies.

TI  - The lysosomal membrane protein SCAV-3 maintains lysosome integrity and adult
      longevity.
PG  - 167-185
AB  - Lysosomes degrade macromolecules and recycle metabolites as well as being
      involved in diverse processes that regulate cellular homeostasis. The lysosome is
      limited by a single phospholipid bilayer that forms a barrier to separate the
      potent luminal hydrolases from other cellular constituents, thus protecting the
      latter from unwanted degradation. The mechanisms that maintain lysosomal membrane
      integrity remain unknown. Here, we identified SCAV-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans 
      homologue of human LIMP-2, as a key regulator of lysosome integrity, motility,
      and dynamics. Loss of scav-3 caused rupture of lysosome membranes and
      significantly shortened lifespan. Both of these phenotypes were suppressed by
      reinforced expression of LMP-1 or LMP-2, the C. elegans LAMPs, indicating that
      longevity requires maintenance of lysosome integrity. Remarkably, reduction in
      insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling suppressed lysosomal
      damage and extended the lifespan in scav-3(lf) animals in a DAF-16-dependent
      manner. Our data reveal that SCAV-3 is essential for preserving lysosomal
      membrane stability and that modulation of lysosome integrity by the insulin/IGF-1
      signaling pathway affects longevity.

TI  - The ubiquitin ligase CRL2ZYG11 targets cyclin B1 for degradation in a conserved
      pathway that facilitates mitotic slippage.
PG  - 151-166
AB  - The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase is known to
      target the degradation of cyclin B1, which is crucial for mitotic progression in 
      animal cells. In this study, we show that the ubiquitin ligase CRL2(ZYG-11)
      redundantly targets the degradation of cyclin B1 in Caenorhabditis elegans and
      human cells. In C. elegans, both CRL2(ZYG-11) and APC/C are required for proper
      progression through meiotic divisions. In human cells, inactivation of
      CRL2(ZYG11A/B) has minimal effects on mitotic progression when APC/C is active.
      However, when APC/C is inactivated or cyclin B1 is overexpressed,
      CRL2(ZYG11A/B)-mediated degradation of cyclin B1 is required for normal
      progression through metaphase. Mitotic cells arrested by the spindle assembly
      checkpoint, which inactivates APC/C, often exit mitosis in a process termed
      "mitotic slippage," which generates tetraploid cells and limits the effectiveness
      of antimitotic chemotherapy drugs. We show that ZYG11A/B subunit knockdown, or
      broad cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase inactivation with the small molecule MLN4924, 
      inhibits mitotic slippage in human cells, suggesting the potential for
      antimitotic combination therapy.

TI  - GEF-H1 is necessary for neutrophil shear stress-induced migration during
      inflammation.
PG  - 107-119
AB  - Leukocyte crawling and transendothelial migration (TEM) are potentiated by shear 
      stress caused by blood flow. The mechanism that couples shear stress to migration
      has not been fully elucidated. We found that mice lacking GEF-H1 (GEF-H1(-/-)), a
      RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), displayed limited
      migration and recruitment of neutrophils into inflamed tissues. GEF-H1(-/-)
      leukocytes were deficient in in vivo crawling and TEM in the postcapillary
      venules. We demonstrated that although GEF-H1 deficiency had little impact on the
      migratory properties of neutrophils under static conditions, shear stress
      triggered GEF-H1-dependent spreading and crawling of neutrophils and
      relocalization of GEF-H1 to flotillin-2-rich uropods. Our results identify GEF-H1
      as a component of the shear stress response machinery in neutrophils required for
      a fully competent immune response to bacterial infection.

TI  - The circadian coordination of cell biology.
PG  - 15-25
AB  - Circadian clocks are cell-autonomous timing mechanisms that organize cell
      functions in a 24-h periodicity. In mammals, the main circadian oscillator
      consists of transcription-translation feedback loops composed of transcriptional 
      regulators, enzymes, and scaffolds that generate and sustain daily oscillations
      of their own transcript and protein levels. The clock components and their
      targets impart rhythmic functions to many gene products through transcriptional, 
      posttranscriptional, translational, and posttranslational mechanisms. This, in
      turn, temporally coordinates many signaling pathways, metabolic activity,
      organelles' structure and functions, as well as the cell cycle and the
      tissue-specific functions of differentiated cells. When the functions of these
      circadian oscillators are disrupted by age, environment, or genetic mutation, the
      temporal coordination of cellular functions is lost, reducing organismal health
      and fitness.

TI  - A human in vitro model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy muscle formation and
      contractility.
PG  - 47-56
AB  - Tongue weakness, like all weakness in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), occurs
      as a result of contraction-induced muscle damage and deficient muscular repair.
      Although membrane fragility is known to potentiate injury in DMD, whether muscle 
      stem cells are implicated in deficient muscular repair remains unclear. We
      hypothesized that DMD myoblasts are less sensitive to cues in the extracellular
      matrix designed to potentiate structure-function relationships of healthy muscle.
      To test this hypothesis, we drew inspiration from the tongue and engineered
      contractile human muscle tissues on thin films. On this platform, DMD myoblasts
      formed fewer and smaller myotubes and exhibited impaired polarization of the cell
      nucleus and contractile cytoskeleton when compared with healthy cells. These
      structural aberrations were reflected in their functional behavior, as engineered
      tongues from DMD myoblasts failed to achieve the same contractile strength as
      healthy tongue structures. These data suggest that dystrophic muscle may fail to 
      organize with respect to extracellular cues necessary to potentiate adaptive
      growth and remodeling.

TI  - Nanoscopic compartmentalization of membrane protein motion at the axon initial
      segment.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - The axon initial segment (AIS) is enriched in specific adaptor, cytoskeletal, and
      transmembrane molecules. During AIS establishment, a membrane diffusion barrier
      is formed between the axonal and somatodendritic domains. Recently, an axonal
      periodic pattern of actin, spectrin, and ankyrin forming 190-nm-spaced, ring-like
      structures has been discovered. However, whether this structure is related to the
      diffusion barrier function is unclear. Here, we performed single-particle
      tracking time-course experiments on hippocampal neurons during AIS development.
      We analyzed the mobility of lipid-anchored molecules by high-speed
      single-particle tracking and correlated positions of membrane molecules with the 
      nanoscopic organization of the AIS cytoskeleton. We observe a strong reduction in
      mobility early in AIS development. Membrane protein motion in the AIS plasma
      membrane is confined to a repetitive pattern of approximately 190-nm-spaced
      segments along the AIS axis as early as day in vitro 4, and this pattern
      alternates with actin rings. Mathematical modeling shows that diffusion barriers 
      between the segments significantly reduce lateral diffusion along the axon.

TI  - Opposing roles for SNAP23 in secretion in exocrine and endocrine pancreatic
      cells.
PG  - 121-138
AB  - The membrane fusion of secretory granules with plasma membranes is crucial for
      the exocytosis of hormones and enzymes. Secretion disorders can cause various
      diseases such as diabetes or pancreatitis. Synaptosomal-associated protein 23
      (SNAP23), a soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein attachment protein
      receptor (SNARE) molecule, is essential for secretory granule fusion in several
      cell lines. However, the in vivo functions of SNAP23 in endocrine and exocrine
      tissues remain unclear. In this study, we show opposing roles for SNAP23 in
      secretion in pancreatic exocrine and endocrine cells. The loss of SNAP23 in the
      exocrine and endocrine pancreas resulted in decreased and increased fusion of
      granules to the plasma membrane after stimulation, respectively. Furthermore, we 
      identified a low molecular weight compound, MF286, that binds specifically to
      SNAP23 and promotes insulin secretion in mice. Our results demonstrate opposing
      roles for SNAP23 in the secretion mechanisms of the endocrine and exocrine
      pancreas and reveal that the SNAP23-binding compound MF286 may be a promising
      drug for diabetes treatment.

TI  - Simple rules for passive diffusion through the nuclear pore complex.
PG  - 57-76
AB  - Passive macromolecular diffusion through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is thought
      to decrease dramatically beyond a 30-60-kD size threshold. Using thousands of
      independent time-resolved fluorescence microscopy measurements in vivo, we show
      that the NPC lacks such a firm size threshold; instead, it forms a soft barrier
      to passive diffusion that intensifies gradually with increasing molecular mass in
      both the wild-type and mutant strains with various subsets of
      phenylalanine-glycine (FG) domains and different levels of baseline passive
      permeability. Brownian dynamics simulations replicate these findings and indicate
      that the soft barrier results from the highly dynamic FG repeat domains and the
      diffusing macromolecules mutually constraining and competing for available volume
      in the interior of the NPC, setting up entropic repulsion forces. We found that
      FG domains with exceptionally high net charge and low hydropathy near the
      cytoplasmic end of the central channel contribute more strongly to obstruction of
      passive diffusion than to facilitated transport, revealing a compartmentalized
      functional arrangement within the NPC.

TI  - ASB7 regulates spindle dynamics and genome integrity by targeting DDA3 for
      proteasomal degradation.
PG  - 95-106
AB  - Proper dynamic regulation of the spindle is essential for successful cell
      division. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate spindle dynamics in
      mitosis are not fully understood. In this study, we show that Cullin
      5-interacting suppressor of cytokine signaling box protein ASB7 ubiquitinates
      DDA3, a regulator of spindle dynamics, thereby targeting it for proteasomal
      degradation. The presence of microtubules (MTs) prevented the ASB7-DDA3
      interaction, thus stabilizing DDA3. Knockdown of ASB7 decreased MT polymerization
      and increased the proportion of cells with unaligned chromosomes, and this
      phenotype was rescued by deletion of DDA3. Collectively, these data indicate that
      ASB7 plays a crucial role in regulating spindle dynamics and genome integrity by 
      controlling the expression of DDA3.

TI  - The Ska complex promotes Aurora B activity to ensure chromosome biorientation.
PG  - 77-93
AB  - Chromosome biorientation and accurate segregation rely on the plasticity of
      kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) attachments. Aurora B facilitates KT-MT dynamics 
      by phosphorylating kinetochore proteins that are critical for KT-MT interactions.
      Among the substrates whose microtubule and kinetochore binding is curtailed by
      Aurora B is the spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) complex, a key factor
      for KT-MT stability. Here, we show that Ska is not only a substrate of Aurora B, 
      but is also required for Aurora B activity. Ska-deficient cells fail to biorient 
      and display chromosome segregation errors underlying suppressed KT-MT turnover.
      These defects coincide with KNL1-Mis12-Ndc80 network hypophosphorylation, reduced
      mitotic centromere-associated kinesin localization, and Aurora B T-loop
      phosphorylation at kinetochores. We further show that Ska requires its
      microtubule-binding capability to promote Aurora B activity in cells and
      stimulates Aurora B catalytic activity in vitro. Finally, we show that protein
      phosphatase 1 counteracts Aurora B activity to enable Ska kinetochore
      accumulation once biorientation is achieved. We propose that Ska promotes Aurora 
      B activity to limit its own microtubule and kinetochore association and to ensure
      that KT-MT dynamics and stability fall within an optimal balance for
      biorientation.

TI  - Nuclear envelope rupture is induced by actin-based nucleus confinement.
PG  - 27-36
AB  - Repeated rounds of nuclear envelope (NE) rupture and repair have been observed in
      laminopathy and cancer cells and result in intermittent loss of nucleus
      compartmentalization. Currently, the causes of NE rupture are unclear. Here, we
      show that NE rupture in cancer cells relies on the assembly of contractile actin 
      bundles that interact with the nucleus via the linker of nucleoskeleton and
      cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. We found that the loss of actin bundles or the LINC 
      complex did not rescue nuclear lamina defects, a previously identified
      determinant of nuclear membrane stability, but did decrease the number and size
      of chromatin hernias. Finally, NE rupture inhibition could be rescued in cells
      treated with actin-depolymerizing drugs by mechanically constraining nucleus
      height. These data suggest a model of NE rupture where weak membrane areas,
      caused by defects in lamina organization, rupture because of an increase in
      intranuclear pressure from actin-based nucleus confinement.

TI  - Defective fluid shear stress mechanotransduction mediates hereditary hemorrhagic 
      telangiectasia.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603106 [doi]
AB  - Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces
      from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited
      autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and
      telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous
      mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9
      and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of
      endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that
      spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress
      potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced
      association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses,
      whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates 
      both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells;
      thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1
      signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a
      molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.

TI  - The Munc18-1 domain 3a hinge-loop controls syntaxin-1A nanodomain assembly and

AB  - Munc18-1 and syntaxin-1A control SNARE-dependent neuroexocytosis and are
      organized in nanodomains on the plasma membrane of neurons and neurosecretory
      cells. Deciphering the intra- and intermolecular steps via which they prepare
      secretory vesicles (SVs) for fusion is key to understanding neuronal and hormonal
      communication. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a priming-deficient mutant
      lacking 17 residues of the domain 3a hinge-loop (Munc18-1(Delta317-333)) in PC12 
      cells engineered to knockdown Munc18-1/2 markedly prolonged SV docking.
      Single-molecule analysis revealed nonhomogeneous diffusion of Munc18-1 and
      syntaxin-1A in and out of partially overlapping nanodomains. Whereas Munc18-1(WT)
      mobility increased in response to stimulation, syntaxin-1A became less mobile.
      These Munc18-1 and syntaxin-1A diffusional switches were blocked by the
      expression of Munc18-1(Delta317-333), suggesting that a conformational change in 
      the Munc18-1 hinge-loop controls syntaxin-1A and subsequent SNARE complex
      assembly. Accordingly, syntaxin-1A confinement was prevented by expression of
      botulinum neurotoxin type E. The Munc18-1 domain 3a hinge-loop therefore controls
      syntaxin-1A engagement into SNARE complex formation during priming.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602069 [doi]
AB  - Transient "kiss and run" interactions between endosomes containing iron-bound
      transferrin (Tf) and mitochondria have been shown to facilitate direct iron
      transfer in erythroid cells. In this study, we used superresolution
      three-dimensional (3D) direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy to
      show that Tf-containing endosomes directly interact with mitochondria in
      epithelial cells. We used live-cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, followed 
      by 3D rendering, object tracking, and a distance transformation algorithm, to
      track Tf-endosomes and characterize the dynamics of their interactions with
      mitochondria. Quenching of iron sensor RDA-labeled mitochondria confirmed
      functional iron transfer by an interacting Tf-endosome. The motility of
      Tf-endosomes is significantly reduced upon interaction with mitochondria. To
      further assess the functional role of iron in the ability of Tf-endosomes to
      interact with mitochondria, we blocked endosomal iron release by using a Tf
      K206E/K534A mutant. Blocking intraendosomal iron release led to significantly
      increased motility of Tf-endosomes and increased duration of
      endosome-mitochondria interactions. Thus, intraendosomal iron regulates the
      kinetics of the interactions between Tf-containing endosomes and mitochondria in 
      epithelial cells.

      organization.
PG  - 817-30
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601071 [doi]
AB  - Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies built on the long noncoding RNA Neat1, which
      regulates a variety of physiological processes including cancer progression and
      corpus luteum formation. To obtain further insight into the molecular basis of
      the function of paraspeckles, we performed fine structural analyses of these
      nuclear bodies using structural illumination microscopy. Notably, paraspeckle
      proteins are found within different layers along the radially arranged bundles of
      Neat1 transcripts, forming a characteristic core-shell spheroidal structure. In
      cells lacking the RNA binding protein Fus, paraspeckle spheroids are disassembled
      into smaller particles containing Neat1, which are diffusely distributed in the
      nucleoplasm. Sequencing analysis of RNAs purified from paraspeckles revealed that
      AG-rich transcripts associate with Neat1, which are distributed along the shell
      of the paraspeckle spheroids. We propose that paraspeckles sequester core
      components inside the spheroids, whereas the outer surface associates with other 
      components in the nucleoplasm to fulfill their function.

AB  - The ciliary transition zone (TZ) is a complex structure found at the cilia base. 
      Defects in TZ assembly are associated with human ciliopathies. In most
      eukaryotes, three protein complexes (CEP290, NPHP, and MKS) cooperate to build
      the TZ. We show that in Drosophila melanogaster, mild TZ defects are observed in 
      the absence of MKS components. In contrast, Cby and Azi1 cooperate to build the
      TZ by acting upstream of Cep290 and MKS components. Without Cby and Azi1,
      centrioles fail to form the TZ, precluding sensory cilia assembly, and no ciliary
      membrane cap associated with sperm ciliogenesis is made. This ciliary cap is
      critical to recruit the tubulin-depolymerizing kinesin Klp59D, required for
      regulation of axonemal growth. Our results show that Drosophila TZ assembly in
      sensory neurons and male germ cells involves cooperative actions of Cby and Dila.
      They further reveal that temporal control of membrane cap assembly by TZ
      components and microtubule elongation by kinesin-13 is required for axoneme
      formation in male germ cells.

TI  - Distinct G protein-coupled receptor recycling pathways allow spatial control of
      downstream G protein signaling.
PG  - 797-806
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512068 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are recycled via a sequence-dependent pathway
      that is spatially and biochemically distinct from bulk recycling. Why there are
      two distinct recycling pathways from the endosome is a fundamental question in
      cell biology. In this study, we show that the separation of these two pathways is
      essential for normal spatial encoding of GPCR signaling. The prototypical beta-2 
      adrenergic receptor (B2AR) activates Galpha stimulatory protein (Galphas) on the 
      endosome exclusively in sequence-dependent recycling tubules marked by
      actin/sorting nexin/retromer tubular (ASRT) microdomains. B2AR was detected in an
      active conformation in bulk recycling tubules, but was unable to activate
      Galphas. Protein kinase A phosphorylation of B2AR increases the fraction of
      receptors localized to ASRT domains and biases the downstream transcriptional
      effects of B2AR to genes controlled by endosomal signals. Our results identify
      the physiological relevance of separating GPCR recycling from bulk recycling and 
      suggest a mechanism to tune downstream responses of GPCR signaling by
      manipulating the spatial origin of G protein signaling.

      impact tumor cell migration.
PG  - 859-73
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601063 [doi]
AB  - Spatiotemporal regulation of RhoGTPases such as RhoA is required at the cell
      leading edge to achieve cell migration. p190RhoGAP (p190A) is the main negative
      regulator of RhoA and localizes to membrane protrusions, where its
      GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity is required for directional migration.
      In this study, we investigated the molecular processes responsible for p190A
      targeting to actin protrusions. By analyzing the subcellular localization of
      truncated versions of p190A in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, we identified a
      novel functional p190A domain: the protrusion localization sequence (PLS)
      necessary and sufficient for p190A targeting to leading edges. Interestingly, the
      PLS is also required for the negative regulation of p190A RhoGAP activity.
      Further, we show that the F-actin binding protein cortactin binds the PLS and is 
      required for p190A targeting to protrusions. Lastly, we demonstrate that
      cancer-associated mutations in PLS affect p190A localization and function, as
      well as tumor cell migration. Altogether, our data unveil a new mechanism of
      regulation of p190A in migrating tumor cells.

TI  - Early epithelial signaling center governs tooth budding morphogenesis.
PG  - 753-67
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512074 [doi]
AB  - During organogenesis, cell fate specification and patterning are regulated by
      signaling centers, specialized clusters of morphogen-expressing cells. In many
      organs, initiation of development is marked by bud formation, but the cellular
      mechanisms involved are ill defined. Here, we use the mouse incisor tooth as a
      model to study budding morphogenesis. We show that a group of nonproliferative
      epithelial cells emerges in the early tooth primordium and identify these cells
      as a signaling center. Confocal live imaging of tissue explants revealed that
      although these cells reorganize dynamically, they do not reenter the cell cycle
      or contribute to the growing tooth bud. Instead, budding is driven by
      proliferation of the neighboring cells. We demonstrate that the activity of the
      ectodysplasin/Edar/nuclear factor kappaB pathway is restricted to the signaling
      center, and its inactivation leads to fewer quiescent cells and a smaller bud.
      These data functionally link the signaling center size to organ size and imply

AB  - Intracellular trafficking is an essential and conserved eukaryotic process. Rab
      GTPases are a family of proteins that regulate and provide specificity for
      discrete membrane trafficking steps by harnessing a nucleotide-bound cycle.
      Global proteomic screens have revealed many Rab GTPases as phosphoproteins, but
      the effects of this modification are not well understood. Using the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae Rab GTPase Sec4p as a model, we have found that phosphorylation
      negatively regulates Sec4p function by disrupting the interaction with the
      exocyst complex via Sec15p. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Sec4p is a
      cell cycle-dependent process associated with cytokinesis. Through a genomic
      kinase screen, we have also identified the polo-like kinase Cdc5p as a positive
      regulator of Sec4p phosphorylation. Sec4p spatially and temporally localizes with
      Cdc5p exclusively when Sec4p phosphorylation levels peak during the cell cycle,
      indicating Sec4p is a direct Cdc5p substrate. Our data suggest the physiological 
      relevance of Sec4p phosphorylation is to facilitate the coordination of
      membrane-trafficking events during cytokinesis.

AB  - Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles found in every eukaryotic cell. They are 
      widely known as terminal catabolic stations that rid cells of waste products and 
      scavenge metabolic building blocks that sustain essential biosynthetic reactions 
      during starvation. In recent years, this classical view has been dramatically
      expanded by the discovery of new roles of the lysosome in nutrient sensing,
      transcriptional regulation, and metabolic homeostasis. These discoveries have
      elevated the lysosome to a decision-making center involved in the control of
      cellular growth and survival. Here we review these recently discovered properties
      of the lysosome, with a focus on how lysosomal signaling pathways respond to
      external and internal cues and how they ultimately enable metabolic homeostasis
      and cellular adaptation.

      in live human cells.
PG  - 769-81
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605024 [doi]
AB  - Translation is an essential step in gene expression. In this study, we used an
      improved SunTag system to label nascent proteins and image translation of single 
      messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) in human cells. Using a dedicated reporter
      RNA, we observe that translation of single mRNPs stochastically turns on and off 
      while they diffuse through the cytoplasm. We further measure a ribosome density
      of 1.3 per kilobase and an elongation rate of 13-18 amino acids per second.
      Tagging the endogenous POLR2A gene revealed similar elongation rates and
      ribosomal densities and that nearly all messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are engaged in
      translation. Remarkably, tagging of the heavy chain of dynein 1 (DYNC1H1) shows
      this mRNA accumulates in foci containing three to seven RNA molecules. These foci
      are translation sites and thus represent specialized translation factories. We
      also observe that DYNC1H1 polysomes are actively transported by motors, which may
      deliver the mature protein at appropriate cellular locations. The SunTag should
      be broadly applicable to study translational regulation in live single cells.

TI  - PEX2 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase required for pexophagy during starvation.
PG  - 677-90
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511034 [doi]
AB  - Peroxisomes are metabolic organelles necessary for anabolic and catabolic lipid
      reactions whose numbers are highly dynamic based on the metabolic need of the
      cells. One mechanism to regulate peroxisome numbers is through an autophagic
      process called pexophagy. In mammalian cells, ubiquitination of peroxisomal
      membrane proteins signals pexophagy; however, the E3 ligase responsible for
      mediating ubiquitination is not known. Here, we report that the peroxisomal E3
      ubiquitin ligase peroxin 2 (PEX2) is the causative agent for mammalian pexophagy.
      Expression of PEX2 leads to gross ubiquitination of peroxisomes and degradation
      of peroxisomes in an NBR1-dependent autophagic process. We identify PEX5 and
      PMP70 as substrates of PEX2 that are ubiquitinated during amino acid starvation. 
      We also find that PEX2 expression is up-regulated during both amino acid
      starvation and rapamycin treatment, suggesting that the mTORC1 pathway regulates 
      pexophagy by regulating PEX2 expression levels. Finally, we validate our findings
      in vivo using an animal model.

TI  - Tiam-Rac signaling mediates trans-endocytosis of ephrin receptor EphB2 and is
      important for cell repulsion.
PG  - 735-52
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512010 [doi]
AB  - Ephrin receptors interact with membrane-bound ephrin ligands to regulate
      contact-mediated attraction or repulsion between opposing cells, thereby
      influencing tissue morphogenesis. Cell repulsion requires bidirectional
      trans-endocytosis of clustered Eph-ephrin complexes at cell interfaces, but the
      mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we identified an 
      actin-regulating pathway allowing ephrinB(+) cells to trans-endocytose EphB
      receptors from opposing cells. Live imaging revealed Rac-dependent F-actin
      enrichment at sites of EphB2 internalization, but not during vesicle trafficking.
      Systematic depletion of Rho family GTPases and their regulatory proteins
      identified the Rac subfamily and the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange
      factor Tiam2 as key components of EphB2 trans-endocytosis, a pathway previously
      implicated in Eph forward signaling, in which ephrins act as in trans ligands of 
      Eph receptors. However, unlike in Eph signaling, this pathway is not required for
      uptake of soluble ligands in ephrinB(+) cells. We also show that this pathway is 
      required for EphB2-stimulated contact repulsion. These results support the
      existence of a conserved pathway for EphB trans-endocytosis that removes the
      physical tether between cells, thereby enabling cell repulsion.

TI  - Munc18-1 is a molecular chaperone for alpha-synuclein, controlling its
      self-replicating aggregation.
PG  - 705-18
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512016 [doi]
AB  - Munc18-1 is a key component of the exocytic machinery that controls
      neurotransmitter release. Munc18-1 heterozygous mutations cause developmental
      defects and epileptic phenotypes, including infantile epileptic encephalopathy
      (EIEE), suggestive of a gain of pathological function. Here, we used
      single-molecule analysis, gene-edited cells, and neurons to demonstrate that
      Munc18-1 EIEE-causing mutants form large polymers that coaggregate wild-type
      Munc18-1 in vitro and in cells. Surprisingly, Munc18-1 EIEE mutants also form
      Lewy body-like structures that contain alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn). We reveal
      that Munc18-1 binds alpha-Syn, and its EIEE mutants coaggregate alpha-Syn.
      Likewise, removal of endogenous Munc18-1 increases the aggregative propensity of 
      alpha-Syn(WT) and that of the Parkinson's disease-causing alpha-Syn(A30P) mutant,
      an effect rescued by Munc18-1(WT) expression, indicative of chaperone activity.
      Coexpression of the alpha-Syn(A30P) mutant with Munc18-1 reduced the number of
      alpha-Syn(A30P) aggregates. Munc18-1 mutations and haploinsufficiency may
      therefore trigger a pathogenic gain of function through both the corruption of
      native Munc18-1 and a perturbed chaperone activity for alpha-Syn leading to
      aggregation-induced neurodegeneration.

      cell invasion.
PG  - 719-34
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201501003 [doi]
AB  - Invadopodia are specialized membrane protrusions that support degradation of
      extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer cells, allowing invasion and metastatic
      spread. Although early stages of invadopodia assembly have been elucidated,
      little is known about maturation of invadopodia into structures competent for ECM
      proteolysis. The localized conversion of phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-triphosphate
      and accumulation of phosphatidylinositol(3,4)-bisphosphate at invadopodia is a
      key determinant for invadopodia maturation. Here we investigate the role of the
      5'-inositol phosphatase, SHIP2, and reveal an unexpected scaffold function of
      SHIP2 as a prerequisite for invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation. Through
      biochemical and structure-function analyses, we identify specific interactions
      between SHIP2 and Mena, an Ena/VASP-family actin regulatory protein. We
      demonstrate that SHIP2 recruits Mena, but not VASP, to invadopodia and that
      disruption of SHIP2-Mena interaction in cancer cells leads to attenuated capacity
      for ECM degradation and invasion in vitro, as well as reduced metastasis in vivo.
      Together, these findings identify SHIP2 as a key modulator of carcinoma
      invasiveness and a target for metastatic disease.

AB  - The one-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is polarized to partition fate
      determinants between the cell lineages generated during its first division. Using
      fluorescence loss in photobleaching, we find that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      of the C. elegans embryo is physically continuous throughout the cell, but its
      membrane is compartmentalized shortly before nuclear envelope breakdown into an
      anterior and a posterior domain, indicating that a diffusion barrier forms in the
      ER membrane between these two domains. Using mutants with disorganized ER, we
      show that ER compartmentalization is independent of the morphological transition 
      that the ER undergoes in mitosis. In contrast, compartmentalization takes place
      at the position of the future cleavage plane in a par-3-dependent manner.
      Together, our data indicate that the ER membrane is compartmentalized in cells as
      diverse as budding yeast, mouse neural stem cells, and the early C. elegans
      embryo.

TI  - An siRNA screen for ATG protein depletion reveals the extent of the
      unconventional functions of the autophagy proteome in virus replication.
PG  - 619-35
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602046 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is a catabolic process regulated by the orchestrated action of the
      autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. Recent work indicates that some of the ATG
      proteins also have autophagy-independent roles. Using an unbiased siRNA screen
      approach, we explored the extent of these unconventional functions of ATG
      proteins. We determined the effects of the depletion of each ATG proteome
      component on the replication of six different viruses. Our screen reveals that up
      to 36% of the ATG proteins significantly alter the replication of at least one
      virus in an unconventional fashion. Detailed analysis of two candidates revealed 
      an undocumented role for ATG13 and FIP200 in picornavirus replication that is
      independent of their function in autophagy as part of the ULK complex. The high
      numbers of unveiled ATG gene-specific and pathogen-specific functions of the ATG 
      proteins calls for caution in the interpretation of data, which rely solely on
      the depletion of a single ATG protein to specifically ablate autophagy.

AB  - Multiciliated cells (MCCs) promote fluid flow through coordinated ciliary
      beating, which requires properly organized basal bodies (BBs). Airway MCCs have
      large numbers of BBs, which are uniformly oriented and, as we show here, align
      linearly. The mechanism for BB alignment is unexplored. To study this mechanism, 
      we developed a long-term and high-resolution live-imaging system and used it to
      observe green fluorescent protein-centrin2-labeled BBs in cultured mouse tracheal
      MCCs. During MCC differentiation, the BB array adopted four stereotypical
      patterns, from a clustering "floret" pattern to the linear "alignment." This
      alignment process was correlated with BB orientations, revealed by double
      immunostaining for BBs and their asymmetrically associated basal feet (BF). The
      BB alignment was disrupted by disturbing apical microtubules with nocodazole and 
      by a BF-depleting Odf2 mutation. We constructed a theoretical model, which
      indicated that the apical cytoskeleton, acting like a viscoelastic fluid,
      provides a self-organizing mechanism in tracheal MCCs to align BBs linearly for
      mucociliary transport.

AB  - The capacity to migrate is fundamental to multicellular and single-celled life.
      Apicomplexan parasites, an ancient protozoan clade that includes malaria
      parasites (Plasmodium) and Toxoplasma, achieve remarkable speeds of directional
      cell movement. This rapidity is achieved via a divergent actomyosin motor system,
      housed within a narrow compartment that lies underneath the length of the
      parasite plasma membrane. How this motor functions at a mechanistic level during 
      motility and host cell invasion is a matter of debate. Here, we integrate old and
      new insights toward refining the current model for the function of this motor
      with the aim of revitalizing interest in the mechanics of how these deadly
      pathogens move.

PG  - 529-37
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604115 [doi]
AB  - The bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system has been repurposed for genome engineering,
      transcription modulation, and chromosome imaging in eukaryotic cells. However,
      the nuclear dynamics of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
      (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) guide RNAs and target interrogation are not 
      well defined in living cells. Here, we deployed a dual-color CRISPR system to
      directly measure the stability of both Cas9 and guide RNA. We found that Cas9 is 
      essential for guide RNA stability and that the nuclear Cas9-guide RNA complex
      levels limit the targeting efficiency. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
      measurements revealed that single mismatches in the guide RNA seed sequence
      reduce the target residence time from >3 h to as low as <2 min in a nucleotide
      identity- and position-dependent manner. We further show that the duration of
      target residence correlates with cleavage activity. These results reveal that
      CRISPR discriminates between genuine versus mismatched targets for genome editing
      via radical alterations in residence time.

TI  - RhoA GTPase inhibition organizes contraction during epithelial morphogenesis.
PG  - 603-17
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603077 [doi]
AB  - During morphogenesis, contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton within
      individual cells drives cell shape changes that fold tissues. Coordination of
      cytoskeletal contractility is mediated by regulating RhoA GTPase activity.
      Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate and GTPase-activating
      proteins (GAPs) inhibit RhoA activity. Most studies of tissue folding, including 
      apical constriction, have focused on how RhoA is activated by GEFs to promote
      cell contractility, with little investigation as to how GAPs may be important.
      Here, we identify a critical role for a RhoA GAP, Cumberland GAP (C-GAP), which
      coordinates with a RhoA GEF, RhoGEF2, to organize spatiotemporal contractility
      during Drosophila melanogaster apical constriction. C-GAP spatially restricts
      RhoA pathway activity to a central position in the apical cortex. RhoGEF2 pulses 
      precede myosin, and C-GAP is required for pulsation, suggesting that contractile 
      pulses result from RhoA activity cycling. Finally, C-GAP expression level
      influences the transition from reversible to irreversible cell shape change,
      which defines the onset of tissue shape change. Our data demonstrate that RhoA
      activity cycling and modulating the ratio of RhoGEF2 to C-GAP are required for
      tissue folding.

AB  - In mitotic exit, proteins that were highly phosphorylated are sequentially
      targeted by the phosphatase PP2A-B55, but what underlies substrate selection is
      unclear. In this issue, Cundell et al. (2016. J. Cell Biol
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201606033) identify the determinants of PP2A-B55's 
      dephosphorylation program, thereby influencing spindle disassembly, nuclear
      envelope reformation, and cytokinesis.

      facilitating membrane fusion.

AB  - Macropinocytosis, the internalization of extracellular fluid and material by
      plasma membrane ruffles, is critical for antigen presentation, cell metabolism,
      and signaling. Macropinosomes mature through homotypic and heterotypic fusion
      with endosomes and ultimately merge with lysosomes. The molecular underpinnings
      of this clathrin-independent endocytic pathway are largely unknown. Here, we show
      that the filamentous septin GTPases associate preferentially with maturing
      macropinosomes in a phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate-dependent manner and
      localize to their contact/fusion sites with macropinosomes/endosomes. Septin
      knockdown results in large clusters of docked macropinosomes, which persist
      longer and exhibit fewer fusion events. Septin depletion and overexpression
      down-regulates and enhances, respectively, the delivery of fluid-phase cargo to
      lysosomes, without affecting Rab5 and Rab7 recruitment to
      macropinosomes/endosomes. In vitro reconstitution assays show that fusion of
      macropinosomes/endosomes is abrogated by septin immunodepletion and
      function-blocking antibodies and is induced by recombinant septins in the absence
      of cytosol and polymerized actin. Thus, septins regulate fluid-phase cargo
      traffic to lysosomes by promoting macropinosome maturation and fusion with
      endosomes/lysosomes.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of central nervous system repair by the Drosophila NG2
      homologue kon-tiki.
PG  - 587-601
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603054 [doi]
AB  - Neuron glia antigen 2 (NG2)-positive glia are repair cells that proliferate upon 
      central nervous system (CNS) damage, promoting functional recovery. However,
      repair is limited because of the failure of the newly produced glial cells to
      differentiate. It is a key goal to discover how to regulate NG2 to enable glial
      proliferation and differentiation conducive to repair. Drosophila has an NG2
      homologue called kon-tiki (kon), of unknown CNS function. We show that kon
      promotes repair and identify the underlying mechanism. Crush injury up-regulates 
      kon expression downstream of Notch. Kon in turn induces glial proliferation and
      initiates glial differentiation by activating glial genes and prospero (pros).
      Two negative feedback loops with Notch and Pros allow Kon to drive the
      homeostatic regulation required for repair. By modulating Kon levels in glia, we 
      could prevent or promote CNS repair. Thus, the functional links between Kon,
      Notch, and Pros are essential for, and can drive, repair. Analogous mechanisms
      could promote CNS repair in mammals.

TI  - A PP2A-B55 recognition signal controls substrate dephosphorylation kinetics
      during mitotic exit.
PG  - 539-54
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201606033 [doi]
AB  - PP2A-B55 is one of the major phosphatases regulating cell division. Despite its
      importance for temporal control during mitotic exit, how B55 substrates are
      recognized and differentially dephosphorylated is unclear. Using
      phosphoproteomics combined with kinetic modeling to extract B55-dependent rate
      constants, we have systematically identified B55 substrates and assigned their
      temporal order in mitotic exit. These substrates share a bipartite polybasic
      recognition determinant (BPR) flanking a Cdk1 phosphorylation site. Experiments
      and modeling show that dephosphorylation rate is encoded into B55 substrates,
      including its inhibitor ENSA, by cooperative action of basic residues within the 
      BPR. A complementary acidic surface on B55 decodes this signal, supporting a
      cooperative electrostatic mechanism for substrate selection. A further level of
      specificity is encoded into B55 substrates because B55 displays selectivity for
      phosphothreonine. These simple biochemical properties, combined with feedback
      control of B55 activity by the phosphoserine-containing substrate/inhibitor ENSA,
      can help explain the temporal sequence of events during exit from mitosis.

PG  - 555-69
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602057 [doi]
AB  - Cytokinesis is the last step of cell division, culminating in the physical
      separation of daughter cells at the end of mitosis. Cytokinesis is a tightly
      regulated process that until recently was mostly viewed as a cell-autonomous
      event. Here, we investigated the role of Ephrin/Eph signaling, a well-known local
      cell-to-cell communication pathway, in cell division. We show that activation of 
      Eph signaling in vitro leads to multinucleation and polyploidy, and we
      demonstrate that this is caused by alteration of the ultimate step of
      cytokinesis, abscission. Control of abscission requires Eph kinase activity, and 
      Src and citron kinase (CitK) are downstream effectors in the Eph-induced signal
      transduction cascade. CitK is phosphorylated on tyrosines in neural progenitors
      in vivo, and Src kinase directly phosphorylates CitK. We have identified the
      specific tyrosine residues of CitK that are phosphorylated and show that tyrosine
      phosphorylation of CitK impairs cytokinesis. Finally, we show that, similar to
      CitK, Ephrin/Eph signaling controls neuronal ploidy in the developing neocortex. 
      Our study indicates that CitK integrates intracellular and extracellular signals 
      provided by the local environment to coordinate completion of cytokinesis.

AB  - The retromer complex acts as a scaffold for endosomal protein complexes that sort

      is a heterotrimer of VPS29, VPS35, and VPS26. Two of these paralogues, VPS26A and

      neurodegenerative disease, and recently, three VPS26A mutations (p.K93E, p.M112V,
      and p.K297X) were discovered to be associated with atypical parkinsonism. Here,
      we apply quantitative proteomics to provide a detailed description of the
      retromer interactome. By establishing a comparative proteomic methodology, we
      identify how this interactome is perturbed in atypical parkinsonism-associated
      VPS26A mutants. In particular, we describe a selective defect in the association 
      of VPS26A (p.K297X) with the SNX27 cargo adaptor. By showing how a retromer
      mutant leads to altered endosomal sorting of specific PDZ ligand-containing cargo
      proteins, we reveal a new mechanism for perturbed endosomal cargo sorting in
      atypical parkinsonism.

AB  - Curving biological membranes establishes the complex architecture of the cell and
      mediates membrane traffic to control flux through subcellular compartments.
      Common molecular mechanisms for bending membranes are evident in different cell
      biological contexts across eukaryotic phyla. These mechanisms can be intrinsic to
      the membrane bilayer (either the lipid or protein components) or can be brought
      about by extrinsic factors, including the cytoskeleton. Here, we review examples 
      of membrane curvature generation in animals, fungi, and plants. We showcase the
      molecular mechanisms involved and how they collaborate and go on to highlight
      contexts of curvature that are exciting areas of future research. Lessons from
      how membranes are bent in yeast and mammals give hints as to the molecular
      mechanisms we expect to see used by plants and protists.

TI  - VPS35 binds farnesylated N-Ras in the cytosol to regulate N-Ras trafficking.
PG  - 445-58
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604061 [doi]
AB  - Ras guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulate signaling pathways only when
      associated with cellular membranes through their C-terminal prenylated regions.
      Ras proteins move between membrane compartments in part via diffusion-limited,
      fluid phase transfer through the cytosol, suggesting that chaperones sequester
      the polyisoprene lipid from the aqueous environment. In this study, we analyze
      the nature of the pool of endogenous Ras proteins found in the cytosol. The
      majority of the pool consists of farnesylated, but not palmitoylated, N-Ras that 
      is associated with a high molecular weight (HMW) complex. Affinity purification
      and mass spectrographic identification revealed that among the proteins found in 
      the HMW fraction is VPS35, a latent cytosolic component of the retromer coat.
      VPS35 bound to N-Ras in a farnesyl-dependent, but neither palmitoyl- nor
      guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent, fashion. Silencing VPS35 increased
      N-Ras's association with cytoplasmic vesicles, diminished GTP loading of Ras, and
      inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and growth of
      N-Ras-dependent melanoma cells.

TI  - ERK signaling promotes cell motility by inducing the localization of myosin 1E to
      lamellipodial tips.

AB  - Signaling by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) plays an essential role 
      in the induction of cell motility, but the precise mechanism underlying such
      regulation has remained elusive. We recently identified SH3P2 as a negative
      regulator of cell motility whose function is inhibited by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase
      (RSK)-mediated phosphorylation downstream of ERK. We here show that myosin 1E
      (Myo1E) is a binding partner of SH3P2 and that the interaction of the two
      proteins in the cytosol prevents the localization of Myo1E to the plasma
      membrane. Serum-induced phosphorylation of SH3P2 at Ser(202) by RSK results in
      dissociation of Myo1E from SH3P2 in the cytosol and the subsequent localization
      of Myo1E to the tips of lamellipodia mediated by binding of its TH2 domain to
      F-actin. This translocation of Myo1E is essential for lamellipodium extension and
      consequent cell migration. The ERK signaling pathway thus promotes cell motility 
      through regulation of the subcellular localization of Myo1E.

TI  - A Toll receptor-FoxO pathway represses Pavarotti/MKLP1 to promote microtubule
      dynamics in motoneurons.
PG  - 459-74
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601014 [doi]
AB  - FoxO proteins are evolutionarily conserved regulators of neuronal structure and
      function, yet the neuron-specific pathways within which they act are poorly
      understood. To elucidate neuronal FoxO function in Drosophila melanogaster, we
      first screened for FoxO's upstream regulators and downstream effectors. On the
      upstream side, we present genetic and molecular pathway analyses indicating that 
      the Toll-6 receptor, the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain adaptor dSARM, and
      FoxO function in a linear pathway. On the downstream side, we find that
      Toll-6-FoxO signaling represses the mitotic kinesin Pavarotti/MKLP1 (Pav-KLP),
      which itself attenuates microtubule (MT) dynamics. We next probed in vivo
      functions for this novel pathway and found that it is essential for axon
      transport and structural plasticity in motoneurons. We demonstrate that elevated 
      expression of Pav-KLP underlies transport and plasticity phenotypes in pathway
      mutants, indicating that Toll-6-FoxO signaling promotes MT dynamics by limiting
      Pav-KLP expression. In addition to uncovering a novel molecular pathway, our work
      reveals an unexpected function for dynamic MTs in enabling rapid
      activity-dependent structural plasticity.

TI  - A disulfide bond in the TIM23 complex is crucial for voltage gating and
      mitochondrial protein import.
PG  - 417-31
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602074 [doi]
AB  - Tim17 is a central, membrane-embedded subunit of the mitochondrial protein import
      machinery. In this study, we show that Tim17 contains a pair of highly conserved 
      cysteine residues that form a structural disulfide bond exposed to the
      intermembrane space (IMS). This disulfide bond is critical for efficient protein 
      translocation through the TIM23 complex and for dynamic gating of its
      preprotein-conducting channel. The disulfide bond in Tim17 is formed during
      insertion of the protein into the inner membrane. Whereas the import of Tim17
      depends on the binding to the IMS protein Mia40, the oxidoreductase activity of
      Mia40 is surprisingly dispensable for Tim17 oxidation. Our observations suggest
      that Tim17 can be directly oxidized by the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1. Thus, import 
      and oxidation of Tim17 are mediated by the mitochondrial disulfide relay, though 
      the mechanism by which the disulfide bond in Tim17 is formed differs considerably
      from that of soluble IMS proteins.

TI  - TMX1 determines cancer cell metabolism as a thiol-based modulator of
      ER-mitochondria Ca2+ flux.
PG  - 433-44
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512077 [doi]
AB  - The flux of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria regulates 
      mitochondria metabolism. Within tumor tissue, mitochondria metabolism is
      frequently repressed, leading to chemotherapy resistance and increased growth of 
      the tumor mass. Therefore, altered ER-mitochondria Ca(2+) flux could be a cancer 
      hallmark, but only a few regulatory proteins of this mechanism are currently
      known. One candidate is the redox-sensitive oxidoreductase TMX1 that is enriched 
      on the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), the site of ER-mitochondria Ca(2+)
      flux. Our findings demonstrate that cancer cells with low TMX1 exhibit increased 
      ER Ca(2+), accelerated cytosolic Ca(2+) clearance, and reduced Ca(2+) transfer to
      mitochondria. Thus, low levels of TMX1 reduce ER-mitochondria contacts, shift
      bioenergetics away from mitochondria, and accelerate tumor growth. For its role
      in intracellular ER-mitochondria Ca(2+) flux, TMX1 requires its thioredoxin motif
      and palmitoylation to target to the MAM. As a thiol-based tumor suppressor, TMX1 
      increases mitochondrial ATP production and apoptosis progression.

TI  - RECQ5 helicase promotes resolution of conflicts between replication and
      transcription in human cells.
PG  - 401-15
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507099 [doi]
AB  - Collisions between replication and transcription machineries represent a
      significant source of genomic instability. RECQ5 DNA helicase binds to
      RNA-polymerase (RNAP) II during transcription elongation and suppresses
      transcription-associated genomic instability. Here, we show that RECQ5 also
      associates with RNAPI and enforces the stability of ribosomal DNA arrays. We
      demonstrate that RECQ5 associates with transcription complexes in DNA replication
      foci and counteracts replication fork stalling in RNAPI- and RNAPII-transcribed
      genes, suggesting that RECQ5 exerts its genome-stabilizing effect by acting at
      sites of replication-transcription collisions. Moreover, RECQ5-deficient cells
      accumulate RAD18 foci and BRCA1-dependent RAD51 foci that are both formed at
      sites of interference between replication and transcription and likely represent 
      unresolved replication intermediates. Finally, we provide evidence for a novel
      mechanism of resolution of replication-transcription collisions wherein the
      interaction between RECQ5 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) promotes 
      RAD18-dependent PCNA ubiquitination and the helicase activity of RECQ5 promotes
      the processing of replication intermediates.

PG  - 309-18
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604002 [doi]
AB  - Metazoan cytoplasmic dynein moves processively along microtubules with the aid of
      dynactin and an adaptor protein that joins dynein and dynactin into a stable
      ternary complex. Here, we examined how Hook3, a cargo adaptor involved in Golgi
      and endosome transport, forms a motile dynein-dynactin complex. We show that the 
      conserved Hook domain interacts directly with the dynein light intermediate chain
      1 (LIC1). By solving the crystal structure of the Hook domain and using
      structure-based mutagenesis, we identify two conserved surface residues that are 
      each critical for LIC1 binding. Hook proteins with mutations in these residues
      fail to form a stable dynein-dynactin complex, revealing a crucial role for LIC1 
      in this interaction. We also identify a region of Hook3 specifically required for
      an allosteric activation of processive motility. Our work reveals the structural 
      details of Hook3's interaction with dynein and offers insight into how cargo
      adaptors form processive dynein-dynactin motor complexes.

TI  - BLOC-1 and BLOC-3 regulate VAMP7 cycling to and from melanosomes via distinct
      tubular transport carriers.
PG  - 293-308
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201605090 [doi]
AB  - Endomembrane organelle maturation requires cargo delivery via fusion with
      membrane transport intermediates and recycling of fusion factors to their sites
      of origin. Melanosomes and other lysosome-related organelles obtain cargoes from 
      early endosomes, but the fusion machinery involved and its recycling pathway are 
      unknown. Here, we show that the v-SNARE VAMP7 mediates fusion of melanosomes with
      tubular transport carriers that also carry the cargo protein TYRP1 and that
      require BLOC-1 for their formation. Using live-cell imaging, we identify a
      pathway for VAMP7 recycling from melanosomes that employs distinct tubular
      carriers. The recycling carriers also harbor the VAMP7-binding scaffold protein
      VARP and the tissue-restricted Rab GTPase RAB38. Recycling carrier formation is
      dependent on the RAB38 exchange factor BLOC-3. Our data suggest that VAMP7
      mediates fusion of BLOC-1-dependent transport carriers with melanosomes,
      illuminate SNARE recycling from melanosomes as a critical BLOC-3-dependent step, 
      and likely explain the distinct hypopigmentation phenotypes associated with
      BLOC-1 and BLOC-3 deficiency in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome variants.

TI  - Syntaxin-17 delivers PINK1/parkin-dependent mitochondrial vesicles to the
      endolysosomal system.

AB  - Mitochondria are considered autonomous organelles, physically separated from
      endocytic and biosynthetic pathways. However, recent work uncovered a
      PINK1/parkin-dependent vesicle transport pathway wherein oxidized or damaged
      mitochondrial content are selectively delivered to the late endosome/lysosome for
      degradation, providing evidence that mitochondria are indeed integrated within
      the endomembrane system. Given that mitochondria have not been shown to use
      canonical soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) machinery for fusion,
      the mechanism by which mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) are targeted to the 
      endosomal compartment has remained unclear. In this study, we identify
      syntaxin-17 as a core mitochondrial SNARE required for the delivery of
      stress-induced PINK1/parkin-dependent MDVs to the late endosome/lysosome.
      Syntaxin-17 remains associated with mature MDVs and forms a ternary SNARE complex
      with SNAP29 and VAMP7 to mediate MDV-endolysosome fusion in a manner dependent on
      the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex.
      Syntaxin-17 can be traced to the last eukaryotic common ancestor, hinting that
      the removal of damaged mitochondrial content may represent one of the earliest
      vesicle transport routes in the cell.

TI  - mito-QC illuminates mitophagy and mitochondrial architecture in vivo.
PG  - 333-45
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603039 [doi]
AB  - Autophagic turnover of mitochondria, termed mitophagy, is proposed to be an
      essential quality-control (QC) mechanism of pathophysiological relevance in
      mammals. However, if and how mitophagy proceeds within specific cellular subtypes
      in vivo remains unclear, largely because of a lack of tractable tools and models.
      To address this, we have developed "mito-QC," a transgenic mouse with a
      pH-sensitive fluorescent mitochondrial signal. This allows the assessment of
      mitophagy and mitochondrial architecture in vivo. Using confocal microscopy, we
      demonstrate that mito-QC is compatible with classical and contemporary techniques
      in histochemistry and allows unambiguous in vivo detection of mitophagy and
      mitochondrial morphology at single-cell resolution within multiple organ systems.
      Strikingly, our model uncovers highly enriched and differential zones of
      mitophagy in the developing heart and within specific cells of the adult kidney. 
      mito-QC is an experimentally advantageous tool of broad relevance to cell biology
      researchers within both discovery-based and translational research communities.

TI  - Deciphering dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a living organism.
PG  - 347-58
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604128 [doi]
AB  - Current understanding of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) dynamics is based on
      detection and tracking of fluorescently tagged clathrin coat components within
      cultured cells. Because of technical limitations inherent to detection and
      tracking of single fluorescent particles, CME dynamics is not characterized in
      vivo, so the effects of mechanical cues generated during development of
      multicellular organisms on formation and dissolution of clathrin-coated
      structures (CCSs) have not been directly observed. Here, we use growth rates of
      fluorescence signals obtained from short CCS intensity trace fragments to assess 
      CME dynamics. This methodology does not rely on determining the complete lifespan
      of individual endocytic assemblies. Therefore, it allows for real-time monitoring
      of spatiotemporal changes in CME dynamics and is less prone to errors associated 
      with particle detection and tracking. We validate the applicability of this
      approach to in vivo systems by demonstrating the reduction of CME dynamics during
      dorsal closure of Drosophila melanogaster embryos.

TI  - The importance of serine metabolism in cancer.
PG  - 249-57
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604085 [doi]
AB  - Serine metabolism is frequently dysregulated in cancers; however, the benefit
      that this confers to tumors remains controversial. In many cases, extracellular
      serine alone is sufficient to support cancer cell proliferation, whereas some
      cancer cells increase serine synthesis from glucose and require de novo serine
      synthesis even in the presence of abundant extracellular serine. Recent studies
      cast new light on the role of serine metabolism in cancer, suggesting that active
      serine synthesis might be required to facilitate amino acid transport, nucleotide
      synthesis, folate metabolism, and redox homeostasis in a manner that impacts
      cancer.

TI  - Tissue homogeneity requires inhibition of unequal gene silencing during
      development.
PG  - 319-31
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601050 [doi]
AB  - Multicellular organisms can generate and maintain homogenous populations of cells
      that make up individual tissues. However, cellular processes that can disrupt
      homogeneity and how organisms overcome such disruption are unknown. We found that
      approximately 100-fold differences in expression from a repetitive DNA transgene 
      can occur between intestinal cells in Caenorhabditis elegans These differences
      are caused by gene silencing in some cells and are actively suppressed by
      parental and zygotic factors such as the conserved exonuclease ERI-1. If
      unsuppressed, silencing can spread between some cells in embryos but can be
      repeat specific and independent of other homologous loci within each cell.
      Silencing can persist through DNA replication and nuclear divisions, disrupting
      uniform gene expression in developed animals. Analysis at single-cell resolution 
      suggests that differences between cells arise during early cell divisions upon
      unequal segregation of an initiator of silencing. Our results suggest that
      organisms with high repetitive DNA content, which include humans, could use
      similar developmental mechanisms to achieve and maintain tissue homogeneity.

TI  - Novel role for the midbody in primary ciliogenesis by polarized epithelial cells.
PG  - 259-73
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601020 [doi]
AB  - The primary cilium is a membrane protrusion that is crucial for vertebrate tissue
      homeostasis and development. Here, we investigated the uncharacterized process of
      primary ciliogenesis in polarized epithelial cells. We show that after
      cytokinesis, the midbody is inherited by one of the daughter cells as a remnant
      that initially locates peripherally at the apical surface of one of the daughter 
      cells. The remnant then moves along the apical surface and, once proximal to the 
      centrosome at the center of the apical surface, enables cilium formation. The
      physical removal of the remnant greatly impairs ciliogenesis. We developed a
      probabilistic cell population-based model that reproduces the experimental data. 
      In addition, our model explains, solely in terms of cell area constraints, the
      various observed transitions of the midbody, the beginning of ciliogenesis, and
      the accumulation of ciliated cells. Our findings reveal a biological mechanism
      that links the three microtubule-based organelles-the midbody, the centrosome,
      and the cilium-in the same cellular process.

TI  - A single-headed fission yeast myosin V transports actin in a
      tropomyosin-dependent manner.
PG  - 167-79
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511102 [doi]
AB  - Myo51, a class V myosin in fission yeast, localizes to and assists in the
      assembly of the contractile ring, a conserved eukaryotic actomyosin structure
      that facilitates cytokinesis. Rng8 and Rng9 are binding partners that dictate the
      cellular localization and function of Myo51. Myo51 was expressed in insect cells 
      in the presence or absence of Rng8/9. Surprisingly, electron microscopy of
      negatively stained images and hydrodynamic measurements showed that Myo51 is
      single headed, unlike most class V myosins. When Myo51-Rng8/9 was bound to
      actin-tropomyosin, two attachment sites were observed: the typical ATP-dependent 
      motor domain attachment and a novel ATP-independent binding of the tail mediated 
      by Rng8/9. A modified motility assay showed that this additional binding site
      anchors Myo51-Rng8/9 so that it can cross-link and slide actin-tropomyosin
      filaments relative to one another, functions that may explain the role of this
      motor in contractile ring assembly.

TI  - 53BP1 and USP28 mediate p53 activation and G1 arrest after centrosome loss or
      extended mitotic duration.
PG  - 155-66
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604081 [doi]
AB  - In normal human cells, centrosome loss induced by centrinone-a specific
      centrosome duplication inhibitor-leads to irreversible, p53-dependent G1 arrest
      by an unknown mechanism. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen for centrinone
      resistance identified genes encoding the p53-binding protein 53BP1, the
      deubiquitinase USP28, and the ubiquitin ligase TRIM37. Deletion of TP53BP1,
      USP28, or TRIM37 prevented p53 elevation in response to centrosome loss but did
      not affect cytokinesis failure-induced arrest or p53 elevation after
      doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. Deletion of TP53BP1 and USP28, but not TRIM37,
      prevented growth arrest in response to prolonged mitotic duration. TRIM37
      knockout cells formed ectopic centrosomal-component foci that suppressed mitotic 
      defects associated with centrosome loss. TP53BP1 and USP28 knockouts exhibited
      compromised proliferation after centrosome removal, suggesting that
      centrosome-independent proliferation is not conferred solely by the inability to 
      sense centrosome loss. Thus, analysis of centrinone resistance identified a
      53BP1-USP28 module as critical for communicating mitotic challenges to the p53
      circuit and TRIM37 as an enforcer of the singularity of centrosome assembly.

AB  - Precise regulation of centrosome number is critical for accurate chromosome
      segregation and the maintenance of genomic integrity. In nontransformed cells,
      centrosome loss triggers a p53-dependent surveillance pathway that protects
      against genome instability by blocking cell growth. However, the mechanism by
      which p53 is activated in response to centrosome loss remains unknown. Here, we
      have used genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify a
      USP28-53BP1-p53-p21 signaling axis at the core of the centrosome surveillance
      pathway. We show that USP28 and 53BP1 act to stabilize p53 after centrosome loss 
      and demonstrate this function to be independent of their previously characterized
      role in the DNA damage response. Surprisingly, the USP28-53BP1-p53-p21 signaling 
      pathway is also required to arrest cell growth after a prolonged prometaphase. We
      therefore propose that centrosome loss or a prolonged mitosis activate a common
      signaling pathway that acts to prevent the growth of cells that have an increased
      propensity for mitotic errors.

TI  - Mitotic noncoding RNA processing promotes kinetochore and spindle assembly in
      Xenopus.
PG  - 133-41
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201604029 [doi]
AB  - Transcription at the centromere of chromosomes plays an important role in
      kinetochore assembly in many eukaryotes, and noncoding RNAs contribute to
      activation of the mitotic kinase Aurora B. However, little is known about how
      mitotic RNA processing contributes to spindle assembly. We found that inhibition 
      of transcription initiation or RNA splicing, but not translation, leads to
      spindle defects in Xenopus egg extracts. Spliceosome inhibition resulted in the
      accumulation of high molecular weight centromeric transcripts, concomitant with
      decreased recruitment of the centromere and kinetochore proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, 
      and NDC80 to mitotic chromosomes. In addition, blocking transcript synthesis or
      processing during mitosis caused accumulation of MCAK, a microtubule
      depolymerase, on the spindle, indicating misregulation of Aurora B. These
      findings suggest that co-transcriptional recruitment of the RNA processing
      machinery to nascent mitotic transcripts is an important step in kinetochore and 
      spindle assembly and challenge the idea that RNA processing is globally repressed
      during mitosis.

PG  - 181-95
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512075 [doi]
AB  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) activates G protein-dependent 
      and internalization-dependent signaling mechanisms. Here, we report that the
      cyclic AMP (cAMP) response of CRHR1 in physiologically relevant scenarios engages
      separate cAMP sources, involving the atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) in
      addition to transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs). cAMP produced by tmACs and
      sAC is required for the acute phase of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 
      activation triggered by CRH-stimulated CRHR1, but only sAC activity is essential 
      for the sustained internalization-dependent phase. Thus, different cAMP sources
      are involved in different signaling mechanisms. Examination of the cAMP response 
      revealed that CRH-activated CRHR1 generates cAMP after endocytosis.
      Characterizing CRHR1 signaling uncovered a specific link between CRH-activated
      CRHR1, sAC, and endosome-based signaling. We provide evidence of sAC being
      involved in an endocytosis-dependent cAMP response, strengthening the emerging
      model of GPCR signaling in which the cAMP response does not occur exclusively at 
      the plasma membrane and introducing the notion of sAC as an alternative source of
      cAMP.

AB  - Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that influence cellular behavior and enhance 
      cancer aggressiveness by carrying bioactive molecules. The mechanisms that
      regulate exosome secretion are poorly understood. Here, we show that the actin
      cytoskeletal regulatory protein cortactin promotes exosome secretion. Knockdown
      or overexpression of cortactin in cancer cells leads to a respective decrease or 
      increase in exosome secretion, without altering exosome cargo content. Live-cell 
      imaging revealed that cortactin controls both trafficking and plasma membrane
      docking of multivesicular late endosomes (MVEs). Regulation of exosome secretion 
      by cortactin requires binding to the branched actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex and
      to actin filaments. Furthermore, cortactin, Rab27a, and coronin 1b coordinately
      control stability of cortical actin MVE docking sites and exosome secretion.
      Functionally, the addition of purified exosomes to cortactin-knockdown cells
      rescued defects of those cells in serum-independent growth and invasion. These
      data suggest a model in which cortactin promotes exosome secretion by stabilizing
      cortical actin-rich MVE docking sites.

AB  - Inheritance depends on the expansion of a small number of primordial germ cells
      (PGCs) in the early embryo. Proliferation of mammalian PGCs is concurrent with
      their movement through changing microenvironments; however, mechanisms
      coordinating these conflicting processes remain unclear. Here, we find that PGC
      proliferation varies by location rather than embryonic age. Ror2 and Wnt5a
      mutants with mislocalized PGCs corroborate the microenvironmental regulation of
      the cell cycle, except in the hindgut, where Wnt5a is highly expressed. Molecular
      and genetic evidence suggests that Wnt5a acts via Ror2 to suppress
      beta-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling in PGCs and limit their proliferation in
      specific locations, which we validate by overactivating beta-catenin in PGCs. Our
      results suggest that the balance between expansion and movement of migratory PGCs
      is fine-tuned in different niches by the opposing beta-catenin-dependent and
      Ror2-mediated pathways through Wnt5a This could serve as a selective mechanism to
      favor early and efficient migrators with clonal dominance in the ensuing germ
      cell pool while penalizing stragglers.

AB  - The mammalian cell nucleus contains membraneless suborganelles referred to as
      nuclear bodies (NBs). Some NBs are formed with an architectural RNA (arcRNA) as
      the structural core. Here, we searched for new NBs that are built on unidentified
      arcRNAs by screening for ribonuclease (RNase)-sensitive NBs using 32,651
      fluorescently tagged human cDNA clones. We identified 32 tagged proteins that
      required RNA for their localization in distinct nuclear foci. Among them, seven
      RNA-binding proteins commonly localized in the Sam68 nuclear body (SNB), which
      was disrupted by RNase treatment. Knockdown of each SNB protein revealed that
      SNBs are composed of two distinct RNase-sensitive substructures. One substructure
      is present as a distinct NB, termed the DBC1 body, in certain conditions, and the
      more dynamic substructure including Sam68 joins to form the intact SNB. HNRNPL
      acts as the adaptor to combine the two substructures and form the intact SNB
      through the interaction of two sets of RNA recognition motifs with the putative
      arcRNAs in the respective substructures.

PG  - 25-34
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511042 [doi]
AB  - In pancreatic beta-cells, liver hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes, chronic exposure
      to high levels of fatty acids (lipotoxicity) inhibits autophagic flux and
      concomitantly decreases lysosomal acidity. Whether impaired lysosomal
      acidification is causally inhibiting autophagic flux and cellular functions could
      not, up to the present, be determined because of the lack of an approach to
      modify lysosomal acidity. To address this question, lysosome-localizing
      nanoparticles are described that, upon UV photoactivation, enable controlled
      acidification of impaired lysosomes. The photoactivatable, acidifying
      nanoparticles (paNPs) demonstrate lysosomal uptake in INS1 and mouse beta-cells. 
      Photoactivation of paNPs in fatty acid-treated INS1 cells enhances lysosomal
      acidity and function while decreasing p62 and LC3-II levels, indicating rescue of
      autophagic flux upon acute lysosomal acidification. Furthermore, paNPs improve
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is reduced under lipotoxicity in INS1
      cells and mouse islets. These results establish a causative role for impaired
      lysosomal acidification in the deregulation of autophagy and beta-cell function
      under lipotoxicity.

AB  - All eukaryotic genomes are packaged into basic units of DNA wrapped around
      histone proteins called nucleosomes. The ability of histones to specify a variety
      of epigenetic states at defined chromatin domains is essential for cell survival.
      The most distinctive type of chromatin is found at centromeres, which are marked 
      by the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A. Many of the factors that
      regulate CENP-A chromatin have been identified; however, our understanding of the
      mechanisms of centromeric nucleosome assembly, maintenance, and reorganization
      remains limited. This review discusses recent insights into these processes and
      draws parallels between centromeric and noncentromeric chromatin assembly
      mechanisms.

TI  - Phosphatidylserine transport by Ups2-Mdm35 in respiration-active mitochondria.
PG  - 77-88
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601082 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is an essential phospholipid for mitochondrial
      functions and is synthesized mainly by phosphatidylserine (PS) decarboxylase at
      the mitochondrial inner membrane. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PS is synthesized 
      in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such that mitochondrial PE synthesis requires 
      PS transport from the ER to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we provide
      evidence that Ups2-Mdm35, a protein complex localized at the mitochondrial
      intermembrane space, mediates PS transport for PE synthesis in respiration-active
      mitochondria. UPS2- and MDM35-null mutations greatly attenuated conversion of PS 
      to PE in yeast cells growing logarithmically under nonfermentable conditions, but
      not fermentable conditions. A recombinant Ups2-Mdm35 fusion protein exhibited
      phospholipid-transfer activity between liposomes in vitro. Furthermore, UPS2
      expression was elevated under nonfermentable conditions and at the diauxic shift,
      the metabolic transition from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. These
      results demonstrate that Ups2-Mdm35 functions as a PS transfer protein and
      enhances mitochondrial PE synthesis in response to the cellular metabolic state.

TI  - SEC16A is a RAB10 effector required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking in
      adipocytes.
PG  - 61-76
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201509052 [doi]
AB  - RAB10 is a regulator of insulin-stimulated translocation of the GLUT4 glucose
      transporter to the plasma membrane (PM) of adipocytes, which is essential for
      whole-body glucose homeostasis. We establish SEC16A as a novel RAB10 effector in 
      this process. Colocalization of SEC16A with RAB10 is augmented by insulin
      stimulation, and SEC16A knockdown attenuates insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation,
      phenocopying RAB10 knockdown. We show that SEC16A and RAB10 promote
      insulin-stimulated mobilization of GLUT4 from a perinuclear recycling
      endosome/TGN compartment. We propose RAB10-SEC16A functions to accelerate
      formation of the vesicles that ferry GLUT4 to the PM during insulin stimulation. 
      Because GLUT4 continually cycles between the PM and intracellular compartments,
      the maintenance of elevated cell-surface GLUT4 in the presence of insulin
      requires accelerated biogenesis of the specialized GLUT4 transport vesicles. The 
      function of SEC16A in GLUT4 trafficking is independent of its previously
      characterized activity in ER exit site formation and therefore independent of
      canonical COPII-coated vesicle function. However, our data support a role for
      SEC23A, but not the other COPII components SEC13, SEC23B, and SEC31, in the
      insulin stimulation of GLUT4 trafficking, suggesting that vesicles derived from
      subcomplexes of COPII coat proteins have a role in the specialized trafficking of
      GLUT4.

PG  - 89-101
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508082 [doi]
AB  - How primary cilia impact epidermal growth and differentiation during
      embryogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that during skin development,
      Notch signaling occurs within the ciliated, differentiating cells of the first
      few suprabasal epidermal layers. Moreover, both Notch signaling and cilia
      disappear in the upper layers, where key ciliary proteins distribute to cell-cell
      borders. Extending this correlation, we find that Presenilin-2 localizes to basal
      bodies/cilia through a conserved VxPx motif. When this motif is mutated, a
      GFP-tagged Presenilin-2 still localizes to intercellular borders, but basal body 
      localization is lost. Notably, in contrast to wild type, this mutant fails to
      rescue epidermal differentiation defects seen upon Psen1 and 2 knockdown.
      Screening components implicated in ciliary targeting and polarized exocytosis, we
      provide evidence that the small GTPase ARF4 is required for Presenilin basal body
      localization, Notch signaling, and subsequent epidermal differentiation.
      Collectively, our findings raise the possibility that ARF4-dependent polarized
      exocytosis acts through the basal body-ciliary complex to spatially regulate
      Notch signaling during epidermal differentiation.

      guidance.
PG  - 35-44
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201601085 [doi]
AB  - The cellular release of membranous vesicles known as extracellular vesicles (EVs)
      or exosomes represents a novel mode of intercellular communication. Eph receptor 
      tyrosine kinases and their membrane-tethered ephrin ligands have very important
      roles in such biologically diverse processes as neuronal development, plasticity,
      and pathological diseases. Until now, it was thought that ephrin-Eph signaling
      requires direct cell contact. Although the biological functions of ephrin-Eph
      signaling are well understood, our mechanistic understanding remains modest. Here
      we report the release of EVs containing Ephs and ephrins by different cell types,
      a process requiring endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)
      activity and regulated by neuronal activity. Treatment of cells with purified
      EphB2(+) EVs induces ephrinB1 reverse signaling and causes neuronal axon
      repulsion. These results indicate a novel mechanism of ephrin-Eph signaling
      independent of direct cell contact and proteolytic cleavage and suggest the
      participation of EphB2(+) EVs in neural development and synapse physiology.

AB  - Although neuronal regeneration is a highly energy-demanding process, axonal
      mitochondrial transport progressively declines with maturation. Mature neurons
      typically fail to regenerate after injury, thus raising a fundamental question as
      to whether mitochondrial transport is necessary to meet enhanced metabolic
      requirements during regeneration. Here, we reveal that reduced mitochondrial
      motility and energy deficits in injured axons are intrinsic mechanisms
      controlling regrowth in mature neurons. Axotomy induces acute mitochondrial
      depolarization and ATP depletion in injured axons. Thus, mature neuron-associated
      increases in mitochondria-anchoring protein syntaphilin (SNPH) and decreases in
      mitochondrial transport cause local energy deficits. Strikingly, enhancing
      mitochondrial transport via genetic manipulation facilitates regenerative
      capacity by replenishing healthy mitochondria in injured axons, thereby rescuing 
      energy deficits. An in vivo sciatic nerve crush study further shows that enhanced
      mitochondrial transport in snph knockout mice accelerates axon regeneration.
      Understanding deficits in mitochondrial trafficking and energy supply in injured 
      axons of mature neurons benefits development of new strategies to stimulate axon 
      regeneration.

PG  - 693-704
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602010 [doi]
AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control mechanisms target terminally misfolded
      proteins for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Misfolded
      glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are, however, generally
      poor ERAD substrates and are targeted mainly to the vacuole/lysosome for
      degradation, leading to predictions that a GPI anchor sterically obstructs ERAD. 
      Here we analyzed the degradation of the misfolded GPI-AP Gas1* in yeast. We could
      efficiently route Gas1* to Hrd1-dependent ERAD and provide evidence that it
      contains a GPI anchor, ruling out that a GPI anchor obstructs ERAD. Instead, we
      show that the normally decreased susceptibility of Gas1* to ERAD is caused by
      canonical remodeling of its GPI anchor, which occurs in all GPI-APs and provides 
      a protein-independent ER export signal. Thus, GPI anchor remodeling is
      independent of protein folding and leads to efficient ER export of even misfolded
      species. Our data imply that ER quality control is limited for the entire class
      of GPI-APs, many of them being clinically relevant.

TI  - SUMOylation of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha regulates histone H3 kinase Haspin and
      H3 phosphorylation in mitosis.
PG  - 665-78
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511079 [doi]
AB  - DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2) plays a pivotal role in faithful chromosome
      separation through its strand-passaging activity that resolves tangled genomic
      DNA during mitosis. Additionally, TOP2 controls progression of mitosis by
      activating cell cycle checkpoints. Recent work showed that the enzymatically
      inert C-terminal domain (CTD) of TOP2 and its posttranslational modification are 
      critical to this checkpoint regulation. However, the molecular mechanism has not 
      yet been determined. By using Xenopus laevis egg extract, we found that
      SUMOylation of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) CTD regulates the localization
      of the histone H3 kinase Haspin and phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 3 
      at the centromere, two steps known to be involved in the recruitment of the
      chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) to kinetochores in mitosis. Robust
      centromeric Haspin localization requires SUMOylated TOP2A CTD binding activity
      through SUMO-interaction motifs and the phosphorylation of Haspin. We propose a
      novel mechanism through which the TOP2 CTD regulates the CPC via direct
      interaction with Haspin at mitotic centromeres.

AB  - Faithful chromosome segregation depends on the precise timing of chromatid
      separation, which is enforced by checkpoint signals generated at kinetochores.
      Here, we provide evidence that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of DNA topoisomerase
      IIalpha (Topo II) provides a novel function at inner centromeres of kinetochores 
      in mitosis. We find that the yeast CTD is required for recruitment of the tension
      checkpoint kinase Ipl1/Aurora B to inner centromeres in metaphase but is not
      required in interphase. Conserved CTD SUMOylation sites are required for Ipl1
      recruitment. This inner-centromere CTD function is distinct from the catalytic
      activity of Topo II. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that Topo II
      recruits Ipl1 via the Haspin-histone H3 threonine 3 phosphorylation pathway.
      Finally, Topo II and Sgo1 are equally important for Ipl1 recruitment to inner
      centromeres. This indicates H3 T3-Phos/H2A T120-Phos is a universal epigenetic
      signature that defines the eukaryotic inner centromere and provides the binding
      site for Ipl1/Aurora B.

AB  - Lysosome exocytosis plays a major role in resealing plasma membrane (PM)
      disruptions. This process involves two sequential steps. First, lysosomes are
      recruited to the periphery of the cell and then fuse with the damaged PM.
      However, the trafficking molecular machinery involved in lysosome exocytosis and 
      PM repair (PMR) is poorly understood. We performed a systematic screen of the
      human Rab family to identify Rabs required for lysosome exocytosis and PMR.
      Rab3a, which partially localizes to peripheral lysosomes, was one of the most
      robust hits. Silencing of Rab3a or its effector, synaptotagmin-like protein 4a
      (Slp4-a), leads to the collapse of lysosomes to the perinuclear region and
      inhibition of PMR. Importantly, we have also identified a new Rab3 effector,
      nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA, as part of the complex formed by Rab3a and
      Slp4-a that is responsible for lysosome positioning at the cell periphery and
      lysosome exocytosis.

AB  - Over the past decade, numerous advances have been made in the role and regulation
      of inflammasomes during pathogenic and sterile insults. An inflammasome complex
      comprises a sensor, an adaptor, and a zymogen procaspase-1. The functional output
      of inflammasome activation includes secretion of cytokines, IL-1beta and IL-18,
      and induction of an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Recent
      studies have highlighted the intersection of this inflammatory response with
      fundamental cellular processes. Novel modulators and functions of inflammasome
      activation conventionally associated with the maintenance of homeostatic
      biological functions have been uncovered. In this review, we discuss the
      biological processes involved in the activation and regulation of the
      inflammasome.

TI  - An actin-dependent annexin complex mediates plasma membrane repair in muscle.
PG  - 705-18
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512022 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of the plasma membrane often accompanies cellular injury, and in
      muscle, plasma membrane resealing is essential for efficient recovery from
      injury. Muscle contraction, especially of lengthened muscle, disrupts the
      sarcolemma. To define the molecular machinery that directs repair, we applied
      laser wounding to live mammalian myofibers and assessed translocation of
      fluorescently tagged proteins using high-resolution microscopy. Within seconds of
      membrane disruption, annexins A1, A2, A5, and A6 formed a tight repair "cap."
      Actin was recruited to the site of damage, and annexin A6 cap formation was both 
      actin dependent and Ca(2+) regulated. Repair proteins, including dysferlin, EHD1,
      EHD2, MG53, and BIN1, localized adjacent to the repair cap in a "shoulder" region
      enriched with phosphatidlyserine. Dye influx into muscle fibers lacking both
      dysferlin and the related protein myoferlin was substantially greater than
      control or individual null muscle fibers, underscoring the importance of
      shoulder-localized proteins. These data define the cap and shoulder as subdomains
      within the repair complex accumulating distinct and nonoverlapping components.

      microtubule-organizing activity (MTOC) at the centrosome, but the mechanisms
      regulating this transition remain largely unexplored. Here, we use the robust
      loss of centrosomal MTOC activity in the epidermis to identify two pools of
      gamma-tubulin that are biochemically and functionally distinct and differentially
      regulated. Nucleation-competent CDK5RAP2-gamma-tubulin complexes were maintained 
      at centrosomes upon initial epidermal differentiation. In contrast,
      Nedd1-gamma-tubulin complexes did not promote nucleation but were required for
      anchoring of microtubules, a previously uncharacterized activity for this
      complex. Cell cycle exit specifically triggered loss of Nedd1-gamma-tubulin
      complexes, providing a mechanistic link connecting MTOC activity and
      differentiation. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that distinct
      gamma-tubulin complexes regulate different microtubule behaviors at the
      centrosome and show that differential regulation of these complexes drives loss
      of centrosomal MTOC activity.

AB  - The GTPase RhoA promotes contractile ring assembly and furrow ingression during
      cytokinesis. Although many factors that regulate RhoA during cytokinesis have
      been characterized, the spatiotemporal regulatory logic remains undefined. We
      have developed an optogenetic probe to gain tight spatial and temporal control of
      RhoA activity in mammalian cells and demonstrate that cytokinetic furrowing is
      primarily regulated at the level of RhoA activation. Light-mediated recruitment
      of a RhoGEF domain to the plasma membrane leads to rapid induction of RhoA
      activity, leading to assembly of cytokinetic furrows that partially ingress.
      Furthermore, furrow formation in response to RhoA activation is not temporally or
      spatially restricted. RhoA activation is sufficient to generate furrows at both
      the cell equator and cell poles, in both metaphase and anaphase. Remarkably,
      furrow formation can be initiated in rounded interphase cells, but not adherent
      cells. These results indicate that RhoA activation is sufficient to induce
      assembly of functional contractile rings and that cell rounding facilitates
      furrow formation.

TI  - Roles of paxillin family members in adhesion and ECM degradation coupling at
      invadosomes.
PG  - 585-99
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510036 [doi]
AB  - Invadosomes are acto-adhesive structures able to both bind the extracellular
      matrix (ECM) and digest it. Paxillin family members-paxillin, Hic-5, and
      leupaxin-are implicated in mechanosensing and turnover of adhesion sites, but the
      contribution of each paxillin family protein to invadosome activities is unclear.
      We use genetic approaches to show that paxillin and Hic-5 have both redundant and
      distinctive functions in invadosome formation. The essential function of
      paxillin-like activity is based on the coordinated activity of LD motifs and LIM 
      domains, which support invadosome assembly and morphology, respectively. However,
      paxillin preferentially regulates invadosome assembly, whereas Hic-5 regulates
      the coupling between ECM degradation and acto-adhesive functions. Mass
      spectrometry analysis revealed new partners that are important for paxillin and
      Hic-5 specificities: paxillin regulates the acto-adhesive machinery through janus
      kinase 1 (JAK1), whereas Hic-5 controls ECM degradation via IQGAP1. Integrating
      the redundancy and specificities of paxillin and Hic-5 in a functional complex
      provides insights into the coupling between the acto-adhesive and ECM-degradative
      machineries in invadosomes.

AB  - The histone locus body (HLB) assembles at replication-dependent histone genes and

      FLASH (Flice-associated huge protein) and U7 small nuclear RNP (snRNP) are HLB
      components that participate in 3' processing of the nonpolyadenylated histone
      mRNAs by recruiting the endonuclease CPSF-73 to histone pre-mRNA. Using
      transgenes to complement a FLASH mutant, we show that distinct domains of FLASH
      involved in U7 snRNP binding, histone pre-mRNA cleavage, and HLB localization are
      all required for proper FLASH function in vivo. By genetically manipulating HLB
      composition using mutations in FLASH, mutations in the HLB assembly factor Mxc,
      or depletion of the variant histone H2aV, we find that failure to concentrate
      FLASH and/or U7 snRNP in the HLB impairs histone pre-mRNA processing. This
      failure results in accumulation of small amounts of polyadenylated histone mRNA
      and nascent read-through transcripts at the histone locus. Thus, the HLB
      concentrates FLASH and U7 snRNP, promoting efficient histone mRNA biosynthesis
      and coupling 3' end processing with transcription termination.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms that drive mammalian cardiomyocytes out of the cell
      cycle soon after birth remain largely unknown. Here, we identify telomere
      dysfunction as a critical physiological signal for cardiomyocyte cell-cycle
      arrest. We show that telomerase activity and cardiomyocyte telomere length
      decrease sharply in wild-type mouse hearts after birth, resulting in
      cardiomyocytes with dysfunctional telomeres and anaphase bridges and positive for
      the cell-cycle arrest protein p21. We further show that premature telomere
      dysfunction pushes cardiomyocytes out of the cell cycle. Cardiomyocytes from
      telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres (G3 Terc(-/-)) show
      precocious development of anaphase-bridge formation, p21 up-regulation, and
      binucleation. In line with these findings, the cardiomyocyte proliferative
      response after cardiac injury was lost in G3 Terc(-/-) newborns but rescued in G3
      Terc(-/-)/p21(-/-) mice. These results reveal telomere dysfunction as a crucial
      signal for cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest after birth and suggest interventions 
      to augment the regeneration capacity of mammalian hearts.

AB  - Triggering of the T cell receptor (TCR) integrates both binding kinetics and
      mechanical forces. To understand the contribution of the T cell cytoskeleton to
      these forces, we triggered T cells using a novel application of atomic force
      microscopy (AFM). We presented antigenic stimulation using the AFM cantilever
      while simultaneously imaging with optical microscopy and measuring forces on the 
      cantilever. T cells respond forcefully to antigen after calcium flux. All forces 
      and calcium responses were abrogated upon treatment with an F-actin inhibitor.
      When we emulated the forces of the T cell using the AFM cantilever, even these
      actin-inhibited T cells became activated. Purely mechanical stimulation was not
      sufficient; the exogenous forces had to couple through the TCR. These studies
      suggest a mechanical-chemical feedback loop in which TCR-triggered T cells
      generate forceful contacts with antigen-presenting cells to improve access to
      antigen.

TI  - MICOS and phospholipid transfer by Ups2-Mdm35 organize membrane lipid synthesis
      in mitochondria.
PG  - 525-34
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602007 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria exert critical functions in cellular lipid metabolism and promote
      the synthesis of major constituents of cellular membranes, such as
      phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine. Here, we demonstrate that 
      the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase Psd1, located in the inner mitochondrial
      membrane, promotes mitochondrial PE synthesis via two pathways. First, Ups2-Mdm35
      complexes (SLMO2-TRIAP1 in humans) serve as phosphatidylserine (PS)-specific
      lipid transfer proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, allowing
      formation of PE by Psd1 in the inner membrane. Second, Psd1 decarboxylates PS in 
      the outer membrane in trans, independently of PS transfer by Ups2-Mdm35. This
      latter pathway requires close apposition between both mitochondrial membranes and
      the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS). In
      MICOS-deficient cells, limiting PS transfer by Ups2-Mdm35 and reducing
      mitochondrial PE accumulation preserves mitochondrial respiration and cristae
      formation. These results link mitochondrial PE metabolism to MICOS, combining
      functions in protein and lipid homeostasis to preserve mitochondrial structure
      and function.

TI  - In vivo confinement promotes collective migration of neural crest cells.
PG  - 543-55
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201602083 [doi]
AB  - Collective cell migration is fundamental throughout development and in many
      diseases. Spatial confinement using micropatterns has been shown to promote
      collective cell migration in vitro, but its effect in vivo remains unclear.
      Combining computational and experimental approaches, we show that the in vivo
      collective migration of neural crest cells (NCCs) depends on such confinement. We
      demonstrate that confinement may be imposed by the spatiotemporal distribution of
      a nonpermissive substrate provided by versican, an extracellular matrix molecule 
      previously proposed to have contrasting roles: barrier or promoter of NCC
      migration. We resolve the controversy by demonstrating that versican works as an 
      inhibitor of NCC migration and also acts as a guiding cue by forming exclusionary
      boundaries. Our model predicts an optimal number of cells in a given confinement 
      width to allow for directional migration. This optimum coincides with the width
      of neural crest migratory streams analyzed across different species, proposing an
      explanation for the highly conserved nature of NCC streams during development.

TI  - Num1 anchors mitochondria to the plasma membrane via two domains with different
      lipid binding specificities.
PG  - 513-24
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511021 [doi]
AB  - The mitochondria-ER cortex anchor (MECA) is required for proper mitochondrial
      distribution and functions by tethering mitochondria to the plasma membrane. The 
      core component of MECA is the multidomain protein Num1, which assembles into
      clusters at the cell cortex. We show Num1 adopts an extended, polarized
      conformation. Its N-terminal coiled-coil domain (Num1CC) is proximal to
      mitochondria, and the C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain is associated with
      the plasma membrane. We find that Num1CC interacts directly with phospholipid
      membranes and displays a strong preference for the mitochondria-specific
      phospholipid cardiolipin. This direct membrane interaction is critical for MECA
      function. Thus, mitochondrial anchoring is mediated by a protein that interacts
      directly with two different membranes through lipid-specific binding domains,
      suggesting a general mechanism for interorganelle tethering.

TI  - Extracellular chloride signals collagen IV network assembly during basement
      membrane formation.
PG  - 479-94
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510065 [doi]
AB  - Basement membranes are defining features of the cellular microenvironment;
      however, little is known regarding their assembly outside cells. We report that
      extracellular Cl(-) ions signal the assembly of collagen IV networks outside
      cells by triggering a conformational switch within collagen IV noncollagenous 1
      (NC1) domains. Depletion of Cl(-) in cell culture perturbed collagen IV networks,
      disrupted matrix architecture, and repositioned basement membrane proteins.
      Phylogenetic evidence indicates this conformational switch is a fundamental
      mechanism of collagen IV network assembly throughout Metazoa. Using recombinant
      triple helical protomers, we prove that NC1 domains direct both protomer and
      network assembly and show in Drosophila that NC1 architecture is critical for
      incorporation into basement membranes. These discoveries provide an atomic-level 
      understanding of the dynamic interactions between extracellular Cl(-) and
      collagen IV assembly outside cells, a critical step in the assembly and
      organization of basement membranes that enable tissue architecture and function. 
      Moreover, this provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the molecular
      pathobiology of NC1 domains.

TI  - DSCR1 is required for both axonal growth cone extension and steering.
PG  - 451-62
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510107 [doi]
AB  - Local information processing in the growth cone is essential for correct wiring
      of the nervous system. As an axon navigates through the developing nervous
      system, the growth cone responds to extrinsic guidance cues by coordinating axon 
      outgrowth with growth cone steering. It has become increasingly clear that axon
      extension requires proper actin polymerization dynamics, whereas growth cone
      steering involves local protein synthesis. However, molecular components
      integrating these two processes have not been identified. Here, we show that Down
      syndrome critical region 1 protein (DSCR1) controls axon outgrowth by modulating 
      growth cone actin dynamics through regulation of cofilin activity
      (phospho/dephospho-cofilin). Additionally, DSCR1 mediates brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor-induced local protein synthesis and growth cone turning. Our 
      study identifies DSCR1 as a key protein that couples axon growth and pathfinding 
      by dually regulating actin dynamics and local protein synthesis.

AB  - Centrioles are the foundation of two organelles, centrosomes and cilia. Centriole
      numbers and functions are tightly controlled, and mutations in centriole proteins
      are linked to a variety of diseases, including microcephaly. Loss of the
      centriole protein Asterless (Asl), the Drosophila melanogaster orthologue of
      Cep152, prevents centriole duplication, which has limited the study of its
      nonduplication functions. Here, we identify populations of cells with Asl-free
      centrioles in developing Drosophila tissues, allowing us to assess its
      duplication-independent function. We show a role for Asl in controlling centriole
      length in germline and somatic tissue, functioning via the centriole protein
      Cep97. We also find that Asl is not essential for pericentriolar material
      recruitment or centrosome function in organizing mitotic spindles. Lastly, we
      show that Asl is required for proper basal body function and spermatid axoneme
      formation. Insights into the role of Asl/Cep152 beyond centriole duplication
      could help shed light on how Cep152 mutations lead to the development of
      microcephaly.

      properties.
PG  - 425-33
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603050 [doi]
AB  - Diversity in cytoskeleton organization and function may be achieved through
      variations in primary sequence of tubulin isotypes. Recently, isotype functional 
      diversity has been linked to a "tubulin code" in which the C-terminal tail, a
      region of substantial sequence divergence between isotypes, specifies
      interactions with microtubule-associated proteins. However, it is not known
      whether residue changes in this region alter microtubule dynamic instability.
      Here, we examine recombinant tubulin with human beta isotype IIB and characterize
      polymerization dynamics. Microtubules with betaIIB have catastrophe frequencies
      approximately threefold lower than those with isotype betaIII, a suppression
      similar to that achieved by regulatory proteins. Further, we generate chimeric
      beta tubulins with native tail sequences swapped between isotypes. These chimeras
      have catastrophe frequencies similar to that of the corresponding full-length
      construct with the same core sequence. Together, our data indicate that residue
      changes within the conserved beta tubulin core are largely responsible for the
      observed isotype-specific changes in dynamic instability parameters and tune
      tubulin's polymerization properties across a wide range.

TI  - Diaphanous formin mDia2 regulates CENP-A levels at centromeres.
PG  - 415-24
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512034 [doi]
AB  - Centromeres of higher eukaryotes are epigenetically defined by centromere protein
      A (CENP-A), a centromere-specific histone H3 variant. The incorporation of new
      CENP-A into centromeres to maintain the epigenetic marker after genome
      replication in S phase occurs in G1 phase; however, how new CENP-A is loaded and 
      stabilized remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the formin mDia2 as
      essential for stable replenishment of new CENP-A at centromeres. Quantitative
      imaging, pulse-chase analysis, and high-resolution ratiometric live-cell studies 
      demonstrate that mDia2 and its nuclear localization are required to maintain
      CENP-A levels at centromeres. Depletion of mDia2 results in a prolonged
      centromere association of holiday junction recognition protein (HJURP), the
      chaperone required for CENP-A loading. A constitutively active form of mDia2
      rescues the defect in new CENP-A loading caused by depletion of male germ cell
      Rac GTPase-activating protein (MgcRacGAP), a component of the small GTPase
      pathway essential for CENP-A maintenance. Thus, the formin mDia2 functions
      downstream of the MgcRacGAP-dependent pathway in regulating assembly of new
      CENP-A containing nucleosomes at centromeres.

      progenitor migration.
PG  - 463-77
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201505082 [doi]
AB  - During embryonic development, Mesp1 marks the earliest cardiovascular progenitors
      (CPs) and promotes their specification, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
      and cardiovascular differentiation. However, Mesp1 deletion in mice does not
      impair initial CP specification and early cardiac differentiation but induces
      cardiac malformations thought to arise from a defect of CP migration. Using
      inducible gain-of-function experiments during embryonic stem cell
      differentiation, we found that Mesp2, its closest homolog, was as efficient as
      Mesp1 at promoting CP specification, EMT, and cardiovascular differentiation.
      However, only Mesp1 stimulated polarity and directional cell migration through a 
      cell-autonomous mechanism. Transcriptional analysis and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Mesp1 and Mesp2 activate common
      target genes that promote CP specification and differentiation. We identified two
      direct Mesp1 target genes, Prickle1 and RasGRP3, that are strongly induced by
      Mesp1 and not by Mesp2 and that control the polarity and the speed of cell
      migration. Altogether, our results identify the molecular interface controlled by
      Mesp1 that links CP specification and cell migration.

AB  - Integrin-dependent adhesions are mechanosensitive structures in which talin
      mediates a linkage to actin filaments either directly or indirectly by recruiting
      vinculin. Here, we report the development and validation of a talin tension
      sensor. We find that talin in focal adhesions is under tension, which is higher
      in peripheral than central adhesions. Tension on talin is increased by vinculin
      and depends mainly on actin-binding site 2 (ABS2) within the middle of the rod
      domain, rather than ABS3 at the far C terminus. Unlike vinculin, talin is under
      lower tension on soft substrates. The difference between central and peripheral
      adhesions requires ABS3 but not vinculin or ABS2. However, differential stiffness
      sensing by talin requires ABS2 but not vinculin or ABS3. These results indicate
      that central versus peripheral adhesions must be organized and regulated
      differently, and that ABS2 and ABS3 have distinct functions in spatial variations
      and stiffness sensing. Overall, these results shed new light on talin function
      and constrain models for cellular mechanosensing.

TI  - A mitotic SKAP isoform regulates spindle positioning at astral microtubule plus
      ends.
PG  - 315-28
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510117 [doi]
AB  - The Astrin/SKAP complex plays important roles in mitotic chromosome alignment and
      centrosome integrity, but previous work found conflicting results for SKAP
      function. Here, we demonstrate that SKAP is expressed as two distinct isoforms in
      mammals: a longer, testis-specific isoform that was used for the previous studies
      in mitotic cells and a novel, shorter mitotic isoform. Unlike the long isoform,
      short SKAP rescues SKAP depletion in mitosis and displays robust microtubule
      plus-end tracking, including localization to astral microtubules. Eliminating
      SKAP microtubule binding results in severe chromosome segregation defects. In
      contrast, SKAP mutants specifically defective for plus-end tracking facilitate
      proper chromosome segregation but display spindle positioning defects. Cells
      lacking SKAP plus-end tracking have reduced Clasp1 localization at microtubule
      plus ends and display increased lateral microtubule contacts with the cell
      cortex, which we propose results in unbalanced dynein-dependent cortical pulling 
      forces. Our work reveals an unappreciated role for the Astrin/SKAP complex as an 
      astral microtubule mediator of mitotic spindle positioning.

      cell border.
PG  - 385-402
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201504038 [doi]
AB  - Endothelial barrier dysfunction underlies chronic inflammatory diseases. In
      searching for new proteins essential to the human endothelial inflammatory
      response, we have found that the endosomal GTPase RhoB is up-regulated in
      response to inflammatory cytokines and expressed in the endothelium of some
      chronically inflamed tissues. We show that although RhoB and the related RhoA and
      RhoC play additive and redundant roles in various aspects of endothelial barrier 
      function, RhoB specifically inhibits barrier restoration after acute cell
      contraction by preventing plasma membrane extension. During barrier restoration, 
      RhoB trafficking is induced between vesicles containing RhoB nanoclusters and
      plasma membrane protrusions. The Rho GTPase Rac1 controls membrane spreading and 
      stabilizes endothelial barriers. We show that RhoB colocalizes with Rac1 in
      endosomes and inhibits Rac1 activity and trafficking to the cell border during
      barrier recovery. Inhibition of endosomal trafficking impairs barrier
      reformation, whereas induction of Rac1 translocation to the plasma membrane
      accelerates it. Therefore, RhoB-specific regulation of Rac1 trafficking controls 
      endothelial barrier integrity during inflammation.

      from the endoplasmic reticulum.
PG  - 343-54
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201603072 [doi]
AB  - Procollagens, pre-chylomicrons, and pre-very low-density lipoproteins (pre-VLDLs)
      are too big to fit into conventional COPII-coated vesicles, so how are these
      bulky cargoes exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)? We have shown that
      TANGO1 located at the ER exit site is necessary for procollagen export. We report
      a role for TANGO1 and TANGO1-like (TALI), a chimeric protein resulting from
      fusion of MIA2 and cTAGE5 gene products, in the export of pre-chylomicrons and
      pre-VLDLs from the ER. TANGO1 binds TALI, and both interact with apolipoprotein B
      (ApoB) and are necessary for the recruitment of ApoB-containing lipid particles
      to ER exit sites for their subsequent export. Although export of ApoB requires
      the function of both TANGO1 and TALI, the export of procollagen XII by the same
      cells requires only TANGO1. These findings reveal a general role for TANGO1 in
      the export of bulky cargoes from the ER and identify a specific requirement for
      TALI in assisting TANGO1 to export bulky lipid particles.

AB  - Sorting and export of transmembrane cargoes and lysosomal hydrolases at the
      trans-Golgi network (TGN) are well understood. However, elucidation of the
      mechanism by which secretory cargoes are segregated for their release into the
      extracellular space remains a challenge. We have previously demonstrated that, in
      a reaction that requires Ca(2+), the soluble TGN-resident protein Cab45 is
      necessary for the sorting of secretory cargoes at the TGN. Here, we report that
      Cab45 reversibly assembles into oligomers in the presence of Ca(2+) These Cab45
      oligomers specifically bind secretory proteins, such as COMP and LyzC, in a
      Ca(2+)-dependent manner in vitro. In intact cells, mutation of the Ca(2+)-binding
      sites in Cab45 impairs oligomerization, as well as COMP and LyzC sorting.
      Superresolution microscopy revealed that Cab45 colocalizes with secretory
      proteins and the TGN Ca(2+) pump (SPCA1) in specific TGN microdomains. These
      findings reveal that Ca(2+)-dependent changes in Cab45 mediate sorting of
      specific cargo molecules at the TGN.

AB  - MDCK II cells, a widely used model of polarized epithelia, develop into different
      structures depending on culture conditions: two-dimensional (2D) monolayers when 
      grown on synthetic supports or three-dimensional (3D) cysts when surrounded by an
      extracellular matrix. The establishment of epithelial polarity is accompanied by 
      transcytosis of the apical marker podocalyxin from the outer plasma membrane to
      the newly formed apical domain, but its exact route and regulation remain poorly 
      understood. Here, through comprehensive colocalization and knockdown screenings, 
      we identified the Rab GTPases mediating podocalyxin transcytosis and showed that 
      different sets of Rabs coordinate its transport during cell polarization in 2D
      and 3D structures. Moreover, we demonstrated that different Rab35 effectors
      regulate podocalyxin trafficking in 2D and 3D environments; trafficking is
      mediated by OCRL in 2D monolayers and ACAP2 in 3D cysts. Our results give
      substantial insight into regulation of the transcytosis of this apical marker and
      highlight differences between trafficking mechanisms in 2D and 3D cell cultures.

TI  - Sliding of centrosome-unattached microtubules defines key features of neuronal
      phenotype.
PG  - 329-41
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506140 [doi]
AB  - Contemporary models for neuronal migration are grounded in the view that
      virtually all functionally relevant microtubules (MTs) in migrating neurons are
      attached to the centrosome, which occupies a position between the nucleus and a
      short leading process. It is assumed that MTs do not undergo independent
      movements but rather transduce forces that enable movements of the centrosome and
      nucleus. The present results demonstrate that although this is mostly true, a
      small fraction of the MTs are centrosome-unattached, and this permits limited
      sliding of MTs. When this sliding is pharmacologically inhibited, the leading
      process becomes shorter, migration of the neuron deviates from its normal path,
      and the MTs within the leading process become buckled. Partial depletion of
      ninein, a protein that attaches MTs to the centrosome, leads to greater numbers
      of centrosome-unattached MTs as well as greater sliding of MTs. Concomitantly,
      the soma becomes less mobile and the leading process acquires an elongated
      morphology akin to an axon.

TI  - Remodeling the zonula adherens in response to tension and the role of afadin in
      this response.
PG  - 243-60
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506115 [doi]
AB  - Morphogenesis requires dynamic coordination between cell-cell adhesion and the
      cytoskeleton to allow cells to change shape and move without losing tissue
      integrity. We used genetic tools and superresolution microscopy in a simple model
      epithelial cell line to define how the molecular architecture of cell-cell zonula
      adherens (ZA) is modified in response to elevated contractility, and how these
      cells maintain tissue integrity. We previously found that depleting zonula
      occludens 1 (ZO-1) family proteins in MDCK cells induces a highly organized
      contractile actomyosin array at the ZA. We find that ZO knockdown elevates
      contractility via a Shroom3/Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase
      (ROCK) pathway. Our data suggest that each bicellular border is an independent
      contractile unit, with actin cables anchored end-on to cadherin complexes at
      tricellular junctions. Cells respond to elevated contractility by increasing
      junctional afadin. Although ZO/afadin knockdown did not prevent contractile array
      assembly, it dramatically altered cell shape and barrier function in response to

AB  - Inclusion bodies (IBs) containing aggregated disease-associated proteins and
      polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) conjugates are universal histopathological features of
      neurodegenerative diseases. Ub has been proposed to target proteins to IBs for
      degradation via autophagy, but the mechanisms that govern recruitment of
      ubiquitylated proteins to IBs are not well understood. In this paper, we use
      conditionally destabilized reporters that undergo misfolding and ubiquitylation
      upon removal of a stabilizing ligand to examine the role of Ub conjugation in
      targeting proteins to IBs that are composed of an N-terminal fragment of mutant
      huntingtin, the causative protein of Huntington's disease. We show that reporters
      are excluded from IBs in the presence of the stabilizing ligand but are recruited
      to IBs after ligand washout. However, we find that Ub conjugation is not
      necessary to target reporters to IBs. We also report that forced Ub conjugation
      by the Ub fusion degradation pathway is not sufficient for recruitment to IBs.
      Finally, we find that reporters and Ub conjugates are stable at IBs. These data
      indicate that compromised folding states, rather than conjugation to Ub, can
      specify recruitment to IBs.

      endosomes, and are targeted to the ER.
PG  - 173-84
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506084 [doi]
AB  - Exosomes are nanovesicles released by virtually all cells, which act as
      intercellular messengers by transfer of protein, lipid, and RNA cargo. Their
      quantitative efficiency, routes of cell uptake, and subcellular fate within
      recipient cells remain elusive. We quantitatively characterize exosome cell
      uptake, which saturates with dose and time and reaches near 100% transduction
      efficiency at picomolar concentrations. Highly reminiscent of pathogenic bacteria
      and viruses, exosomes are recruited as single vesicles to the cell body by
      surfing on filopodia as well as filopodia grabbing and pulling motions to reach
      endocytic hot spots at the filopodial base. After internalization, exosomes
      shuttle within endocytic vesicles to scan the endoplasmic reticulum before being 
      sorted into the lysosome as their final intracellular destination. Our data
      quantify and explain the efficiency of exosome internalization by recipient
      cells, establish a new parallel between exosome and virus host cell interaction, 
      and suggest unanticipated routes of subcellular cargo delivery.

      Although once considered a subtype of pain, itch is now recognized as a unique

      recent advances in our understanding of itch and the molecular players that

TI  - Osteopontin ablation ameliorates muscular dystrophy by shifting macrophages to a 
      pro-regenerative phenotype.
PG  - 275-88
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510086 [doi]
AB  - In the degenerative disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, inflammatory cells enter
      muscles in response to repetitive muscle damage. Immune factors are required for 
      muscle regeneration, but chronic inflammation creates a profibrotic milieu that
      exacerbates disease progression. Osteopontin (OPN) is an immunomodulator highly
      expressed in dystrophic muscles. Ablation of OPN correlates with reduced fibrosis
      and improved muscle strength as well as reduced natural killer T (NKT) cell
      counts. Here, we demonstrate that the improved dystrophic phenotype observed with
      OPN ablation does not result from reductions in NKT cells. OPN ablation skews
      macrophage polarization toward a pro-regenerative phenotype by reducing M1 and
      M2a and increasing M2c subsets. These changes are associated with increased
      expression of pro-regenerative factors insulin-like growth factor 1, leukemia
      inhibitory factor, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Furthermore, altered
      macrophage polarization correlated with increases in muscle weight and muscle
      fiber diameter, resulting in long-term improvements in muscle strength and
      function in mdx mice. These findings suggest that OPN ablation promotes muscle
      repair via macrophage secretion of pro-myogenic growth factors.

TI  - Kinesin-5 inhibitor resistance is driven by kinesin-12.
PG  - 213-27
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507036 [doi]
AB  - The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton bipolarizes at the onset of mitosis to form the
      spindle. In animal cells, the kinesin-5 Eg5 primarily drives this reorganization 
      by actively sliding MTs apart. Its primacy during spindle assembly renders Eg5
      essential for mitotic progression, demonstrated by the lethal effects of
      kinesin-5/Eg5 inhibitors (K5Is) administered in cell culture. However, cultured
      cells can acquire resistance to K5Is, indicative of alternative spindle assembly 
      mechanisms and/or pharmacological failure. Through characterization of novel
      K5I-resistant cell lines, we unveil an Eg5 motility-independent spindle assembly 
      pathway that involves both an Eg5 rigor mutant and the kinesin-12 Kif15. This
      pathway centers on spindle MT bundling instead of Kif15 overexpression,
      distinguishing it from those previously described. We further show that large
      populations ( approximately 10(7) cells) of HeLa cells require Kif15 to survive
      K5I treatment. Overall, this study provides insight into the functional
      plasticity of mitotic kinesins during spindle assembly and has important
      implications for the development of antimitotic regimens that target this
      process.

TI  - A requirement for filopodia extension toward Slit during Robo-mediated axon
      repulsion.
PG  - 261-74
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201509062 [doi]
AB  - Axons navigate long distances through complex 3D environments to interconnect the
      nervous system during development. Although the precise spatiotemporal effects of
      most axon guidance cues remain poorly characterized, a prevailing model posits
      that attractive guidance cues stimulate actin polymerization in neuronal growth
      cones whereas repulsive cues induce actin disassembly. Contrary to this model, we
      find that the repulsive guidance cue Slit stimulates the formation and elongation
      of actin-based filopodia from mouse dorsal root ganglion growth cones.
      Surprisingly, filopodia form and elongate toward sources of Slit, a response that
      we find is required for subsequent axonal repulsion away from Slit.
      Mechanistically, Slit evokes changes in filopodium dynamics by increasing direct 
      binding of its receptor, Robo, to members of the actin-regulatory Ena/VASP
      family. Perturbing filopodium dynamics pharmacologically or genetically disrupts 
      Slit-mediated repulsion and produces severe axon guidance defects in vivo. Thus, 
      Slit locally stimulates directional filopodial extension, a process that is
      required for subsequent axonal repulsion downstream of the Robo receptor.

TI  - Spindle-E cycling between nuage and cytoplasm is controlled by Qin and PIWI
      proteins.
PG  - 201-11
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201411076 [doi]
AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) are silenced in germ cells by a mechanism in which
      PIWI proteins generate and use PIWI-interacting ribonucleic acid (piRNA) to
      repress expression of TE genes. piRNA biogenesis occurs by an amplification cycle
      in microscopic organelles called nuage granules, which are localized to the outer
      face of the nuclear envelope. One cofactor required for amplification is the
      helicase Spindle-E (Spn-E). We found that the Spn-E protein physically associates
      with the Tudor domain protein Qin and the PIWI proteins Aubergine (Aub) and
      Argonaute3 (Ago3). Spn-E and Qin proteins are mutually dependent for their exit
      from nuage granules, whereas Spn-E and both Aub and Ago3 are mutually dependent
      for their entry or retention in nuage. The result is a dynamic cycling of Spn-E
      and its associated factors in and out of nuage granules. This implies that nuage 
      granules can be considered to be hubs for active, mobile, and transient
      complexes. We suggest that this is in some way coupled with the execution of the 
      piRNA amplification cycle.

AB  - Mitochondrial fission is essential for the degradation of damaged mitochondria.
      It is currently unknown how the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-associated
      fission machinery is selectively targeted to segregate damaged mitochondria. We
      show that PTEN-induced putative kinase (PINK1) serves as a pro-fission signal,
      independently of Parkin. Normally, the scaffold protein AKAP1 recruits protein
      kinase A (PKA) to the outer mitochondrial membrane to phospho-inhibit DRP1. We
      reveal that after damage, PINK1 triggers PKA displacement from A-kinase anchoring
      protein 1. By ejecting PKA, PINK1 ensures the requisite fission of damaged
      mitochondria for organelle degradation. We propose that PINK1 functions as a
      master mitophagy regulator by activating Parkin and DRP1 in response to damage.
      We confirm that PINK1 mutations causing Parkinson disease interfere with the
      orchestration of selective fission and mitophagy by PINK1.

TI  - ZRF1 mediates remodeling of E3 ligases at DNA lesion sites during nucleotide
      excision repair.
PG  - 185-200
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506099 [doi]
AB  - Faithful DNA repair is essential to maintain genome integrity. Ultraviolet (UV)
      irradiation elicits both the recruitment of DNA repair factors and the deposition
      of histone marks such as monoubiquitylation of histone H2A at lesion sites. Here,
      we report how a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex specific to DNA repair is remodeled
      at lesion sites in the global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) pathway.
      Monoubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2A-ubiquitin) is catalyzed predominantly by a
      novel E3 ligase complex consisting of DDB2, DDB1, CUL4B, and RING1B (UV-RING1B
      complex) that acts early during lesion recognition. The H2A-ubiquitin binding
      protein ZRF1 mediates remodeling of this E3 ligase complex directly at the DNA
      lesion site, causing the assembly of the UV-DDB-CUL4A E3 ligase complex
      (DDB1-DDB2-CUL4A-RBX1). ZRF1 is an essential factor in GG-NER, and its function
      at damaged chromatin sites is linked to damage recognition factor XPC. Overall,
      the results shed light on the interplay between epigenetic and DNA repair
      recognition factors at DNA lesion sites.

TI  - Metalloproteinase MT1-MMP islets act as memory devices for podosome reemergence.
PG  - 109-25
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510043 [doi]
AB  - Podosomes are dynamic cell adhesions that are also sites of extracellular matrix 
      degradation, through recruitment of matrix-lytic enzymes, particularly of matrix 
      metalloproteinases. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we
      show that the membrane-bound metalloproteinase MT1-MMP is enriched not only at
      podosomes but also at distinct "islets" embedded in the plasma membrane of
      primary human macrophages. MT1-MMP islets become apparent upon podosome
      dissolution and persist beyond podosome lifetime. Importantly, the majority of
      MT1-MMP islets are reused as sites of podosome reemergence. siRNA-mediated
      knockdown and recomplementation analyses show that islet formation is based on
      the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP and its ability to bind the subcortical actin
      cytoskeleton. Collectively, our data reveal a previously unrecognized phase in
      the podosome life cycle and identify a structural function of MT1-MMP that is
      independent of its proteolytic activity. MT1-MMP islets thus act as cellular
      memory devices that enable efficient and localized reformation of podosomes,
      ensuring coordinated matrix degradation and invasion.

TI  - Sigma1 receptors inhibit store-operated Ca2+ entry by attenuating coupling of
      STIM1 to Orai1.
PG  - 65-79
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506022 [doi]
AB  - Sigma1 receptors (sigma1Rs) are expressed widely; they bind diverse ligands,
      including psychotropic drugs and steroids, regulate many ion channels, and are
      implicated in cancer and addiction. It is not known how sigma1Rs exert such
      varied effects. We demonstrate that sigma1Rs inhibit store-operated Ca(2+)entry
      (SOCE), a major Ca(2+)influx pathway, and reduce the Ca(2+)content of the
      intracellular stores. SOCE was inhibited by expression of sigma1R or an agonist
      of sigma1R and enhanced by loss of sigma1R or an antagonist. Within the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER), sigma1R associated with STIM1, the ER Ca(2+)sensor
      that regulates SOCE. This interaction was modulated by sigma1R ligands. After
      depletion of Ca(2+)stores, sigma1R accompanied STIM1 to ER-plasma membrane (PM)
      junctions where STIM1 stimulated opening of the Ca(2+)channel, Orai1. The
      association of STIM1 with sigma1R slowed the recruitment of STIM1 to ER-PM
      junctions and reduced binding of STIM1 to PM Orai1. We conclude that sigma1R
      attenuates STIM1 coupling to Orai1 and thereby inhibits SOCE.

TI  - A versatile multivariate image analysis pipeline reveals features of Xenopus
      extract spindles.
PG  - 127-36
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201509079 [doi]
AB  - Imaging datasets are rich in quantitative information. However, few cell
      biologists possess the tools necessary to analyze them. Here, we present a large 
      dataset of Xenopusextract spindle images together with an analysis pipeline
      designed to assess spindle morphology across a range of experimental conditions. 
      Our analysis of different spindle types illustrates how kinetochore microtubules 
      amplify spindle microtubule density. Extract mixing experiments reveal that some 
      spindle features titrate, while others undergo switch-like transitions, and
      multivariate analysis shows the pleiotropic morphological effects of modulating
      the levels of TPX2, a key spindle assembly factor. We also apply our pipeline to 
      analyze nuclear morphology in human cell culture, showing the general utility of 
      the segmentation approach. Our analyses provide new insight into the diversity of
      spindle types and suggest areas for future study. The approaches outlined can be 
      applied by other researchers studying spindle morphology and adapted with minimal
      modification to other experimental systems.

TI  - Micron-scale plasma membrane curvature is recognized by the septin cytoskeleton.
PG  - 23-32
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512029 [doi]
AB  - Cells change shape in response to diverse environmental and developmental
      conditions, creating topologies with micron-scale features. Although individual
      proteins can sense nanometer-scale membrane curvature, it is unclear if a cell
      could also use nanometer-scale components to sense micron-scale contours, such as
      the cytokinetic furrow and base of neuronal branches. Septins are
      filament-forming proteins that serve as signaling platforms and are frequently
      associated with areas of the plasma membrane where there is micron-scale
      curvature, including the cytokinetic furrow and the base of cell protrusions. We 
      report here that fungal and human septins are able to distinguish between
      different degrees of micron-scale curvature in cells. By preparing supported
      lipid bilayers on beads of different curvature, we reconstitute and measure the
      intrinsic septin curvature preference. We conclude that micron-scale curvature
      recognition is a fundamental property of the septin cytoskeleton that provides
      the cell with a mechanism to know its local shape.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511041 [doi]
AB  - Advances in next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry have revealed
      widespread messenger RNA modifications and RNA editing, with dramatic effects on 
      mammalian transcriptomes. Factors introducing, deleting, or interpreting specific
      modifications have been identified, and analogous with epigenetic terminology,
      have been designated "writers," "erasers," and "readers." Such modifications in
      the transcriptome are referred to as epitranscriptomic changes and represent a
      fascinating new layer of gene expression regulation that has only recently been
      appreciated. Here, we outline how RNA editing and RNA modification can rapidly
      affect gene expression, making both processes as well suited to respond to
      cellular stress and to regulate the transcriptome during development or circadian
      periods.

TI  - Kindlin-2 directly binds actin and regulates integrin outside-in signaling.
PG  - 97-108
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201501006 [doi]
AB  - Reduced levels of kindlin-2 (K2) in endothelial cells derived from K2(+/-)mice or
      C2C12 myoblastoid cells treated with K2 siRNA showed disorganization of their
      actin cytoskeleton and decreased spreading. These marked changes led us to
      examine direct binding between K2 and actin. Purified K2 interacts with F-actin
      in cosedimentation and surface plasmon resonance analyses and induces actin
      aggregation. We further find that the F0 domain of K2 binds actin. A mutation,
      LK(47)/AA, within a predicted actin binding site (ABS) of F0 diminishes its
      interaction with actin by approximately fivefold. Wild-type K2 and K2 bearing the
      LK(47)/AA mutation were equivalent in their ability to coactivate integrin
      alphaIIbbeta3 in a CHO cell system when coexpressed with talin. However,
      K2-LK(47)/AA exhibited a diminished ability to support cell spreading and actin
      organization compared with wild-type K2. The presence of an ABS in F0 of K2 that 
      influences outside-in signaling across integrins establishes a new foundation for
      considering how kindlins might regulate cellular responses.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510002 [doi]
AB  - Drug resistance, metastasis, and a mesenchymal transcriptional program are
      central features of aggressive breast tumors. The GTPase Arf6, often
      overexpressed in tumors, is critical to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      and invasiveness. The metabolic mevalonate pathway (MVP) is associated with tumor
      invasiveness and known to prenylate proteins, but which prenylated proteins are
      critical for MVP-driven cancers is unknown. We show here that MVP requires the
      Arf6-dependent mesenchymal program. The MVP enzyme geranylgeranyl transferase II 
      (GGT-II) and its substrate Rab11b are critical for Arf6 trafficking to the plasma
      membrane, where it is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Consistently,
      mutant p53, which is known to support tumorigenesis via MVP, promotes Arf6
      activation via GGT-II and Rab11b. Inhibition of MVP and GGT-II blocked invasion
      and metastasis and reduced cancer cell resistance against chemotherapy agents,
      but only in cells overexpressing Arf6 and components of the mesenchymal program. 
      Overexpression of Arf6 and mesenchymal proteins as well as enhanced MVP activity 
      correlated with poor patient survival. These results provide insights into the
      molecular basis of MVP-driven malignancy.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites play an integral role
      in cellular processes such as excitation-contraction coupling and store-operated 
      calcium entry (SOCE). Another ER-PM assembly is one tethered by the extended
      synaptotagmins (E-Syt). We have discovered that at steady state, E-Syt2 positions
      the ER and Sac1, an integral ER membrane lipid phosphatase, in discrete ER-PM
      junctions. Here, Sac1 participates in phosphoinositide homeostasis by limiting PM
      phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), the precursor of PI(4,5)P2 Activation 
      of G protein-coupled receptors that deplete PM PI(4,5)P2disrupts E-Syt2-mediated 
      ER-PM junctions, reducing Sac1's access to the PM and permitting PM PI(4)P and
      PI(4,5)P2to recover. Conversely, depletion of ER luminal calcium and subsequent
      activation of SOCE increases the amount of Sac1 in contact with the PM, depleting
      PM PI(4)P. Thus, the dynamic presence of Sac1 at ER-PM contact sites allows it to
      act as a cellular sensor and controller of PM phosphoinositides, thereby
      influencing many PM processes.

TI  - Doa1 targets ubiquitinated substrates for mitochondria-associated degradation.
PG  - 49-63
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510098 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD) mediated by the Cdc48 complex and
      proteasome degrades ubiquitinated mitochondrial outer-membrane proteins. MAD is
      critical for mitochondrial proteostasis, but it remains poorly characterized. We 
      identified several mitochondrial Cdc48 substrates and developed a genetic screen 
      assay to uncover regulators of the Cdc48-dependent MAD pathway. Surprisingly, we 
      identified Doa1, a substrate-processing factor of Cdc48 that inhibits the
      degradation of some Cdc48 substrates, as a critical mediator of the turnover of
      mitochondrial Cdc48 substrates. Deletion ofDOA1causes the accumulation and
      mislocalization of substrates on mitochondria. Profiling of Cdc48 cofactors shows
      that Doa1 and Cdc48(-Ufd1-Npl4)form a functional complex mediating MAD.
      Biochemically, Doa1 interacts with ubiquitinated substrates and facilitates
      substrate recruitment to the Cdc48(-Ufd1-Npl4)complex. Functionally, Doa1 is
      critical for cell survival under mitochondrial oxidative stress, but not ER
      stress, conditions. Collectively, our results demonstrate the essential role of
      the Doa1-Cdc48(-Ufd1-Npl4)complex in mitochondrial proteostasis and suggest that 
      Doa1 plays dual roles on the Cdc48 complex.

PG  - 845-60
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508028 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian stress granules (SGs) contain stalled translation preinitiation
      complexes that are assembled into discrete granules by specific RNA-binding
      proteins such as G3BP. We now show that cells lacking both G3BP1 and G3BP2 cannot
      form SGs in response to eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha phosphorylation or
      eIF4A inhibition, but are still SG-competent when challenged with severe heat or 
      osmotic stress. Rescue experiments using G3BP1 mutants show that phosphomimetic
      G3BP1-S149E fails to rescue SG formation, whereas G3BP1-F33W, a mutant unable to 
      bind G3BP partner proteins Caprin1 or USP10, rescues SG formation. Caprin1/USP10 
      binding to G3BP is mutually exclusive: Caprin binding promotes, but USP10 binding
      inhibits, SG formation. G3BP interacts with 40S ribosomal subunits through its
      RGG motif, which is also required for G3BP-mediated SG formation. We propose that
      G3BP mediates the condensation of SGs by shifting between two different states
      that are controlled by the phosphorylation of S149 and by binding to Caprin1 or
      USP10.

TI  - The proteasome controls presynaptic differentiation through modulation of an
      on-site pool of polyubiquitinated conjugates.
PG  - 789-801
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201509039 [doi]
AB  - Differentiation of the presynaptic terminal is a complex and rapid event that
      normally occurs in spatially specific axonal regions distant from the soma; thus,
      it is believed to be dependent on intra-axonal mechanisms. However, the full
      nature of the local events governing presynaptic assembly remains unknown.
      Herein, we investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS),
      the major degradative pathway, in the local modulation of presynaptic
      differentiation. We found that proteasome inhibition has a synaptogenic effect on
      isolated axons. In addition, formation of a stable cluster of synaptic vesicles
      onto a postsynaptic partner occurs in parallel to an on-site decrease in
      proteasome degradation. Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins at nascent sites
      is a local trigger for presynaptic clustering. Finally, proteasome-related
      ubiquitin chains (K11 and K48) function as signals for the assembly of
      presynaptic terminals. Collectively, we propose a new axon-intrinsic mechanism
      for presynaptic assembly through local UPS inhibition. Subsequent on-site
      accumulation of proteins in their polyubiquitinated state triggers formation of
      presynapses.

AB  - Although mechanisms that contribute to microtubule (MT) aster positioning have
      been extensively studied, still little is known on how asters move inside cells
      to faithfully target a cellular location. Here, we study sperm aster centration
      in sea urchin eggs, as a stereotypical large-scale aster movement with extreme
      constraints on centering speed and precision. By tracking three-dimensional aster
      centration dynamics in eggs with manipulated shapes, we show that aster geometry 
      resulting from MT growth and interaction with cell boundaries dictates aster
      instantaneous directionality, yielding cell shape-dependent centering
      trajectories. Aster laser surgery and modeling suggest that dynein-dependent MT
      cytoplasmic pulling forces that scale to MT length function to convert aster
      geometry into directionality. In contrast, aster speed remains largely
      independent of aster size, shape, or absolute dynein activity, which suggests it 
      may be predominantly determined by aster growth rate rather than MT force
      amplitude. These studies begin to define the geometrical principles that control 
      aster movements.

      starfish oocytes.
PG  - 815-27
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510083 [doi]
AB  - Centriole elimination is an essential process that occurs in female meiosis of
      metazoa to reset centriole number in the zygote at fertilization. How centrioles 
      are eliminated remains poorly understood. Here we visualize the entire
      elimination process live in starfish oocytes. Using specific fluorescent markers,
      we demonstrate that the two older, mother centrioles are selectively removed from
      the oocyte by extrusion into polar bodies. We show that this requires specific
      positioning of the second meiotic spindle, achieved by dynein-driven transport,
      and anchorage of the mother centriole to the plasma membrane via mother-specific 
      appendages. In contrast, the single daughter centriole remaining in the egg is
      eliminated before the first embryonic cleavage. We demonstrate that these
      distinct elimination mechanisms are necessary because if mother centrioles are
      artificially retained, they cannot be inactivated, resulting in multipolar
      zygotic spindles. Thus, our findings reveal a dual mechanism to eliminate
      centrioles: mothers are physically removed, whereas daughters are eliminated in
      the cytoplasm, preparing the egg for fertilization.

TI  - Ca2+/H+ exchange by acidic organelles regulates cell migration in vivo.
PG  - 803-13
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510019 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence implicates Ca(2+) in the control of cell migration. However, 
      the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Acidic Ca(2+) stores are
      fast emerging as signaling centers. But how Ca(2+) is taken up by these
      organelles in metazoans and the physiological relevance for migration is unclear.
      Here, we identify a vertebrate Ca(2+)/H(+)exchanger (CAX) as part of a widespread
      family of homologues in animals. CAX is expressed in neural crest cells and
      required for their migration in vivo. It localizes to acidic organelles, tempers 
      evoked Ca(2+) signals, and regulates cell-matrix adhesion during migration. Our
      data provide new molecular insight into how Ca(2+) is handled by acidic
      organelles and link this to migration, thereby underscoring the role of
      noncanonical Ca(2+) stores in the control of Ca(2+)-dependent function.

TI  - Smoothened determines beta-arrestin-mediated removal of the G protein-coupled
      receptor Gpr161 from the primary cilium.
PG  - 861-75
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506132 [doi]
AB  - Dynamic changes in membrane protein composition of the primary cilium are central
      to development and homeostasis, but we know little about mechanisms regulating
      membrane protein flux. Stimulation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway in
      vertebrates results in accumulation and activation of the effector Smoothened
      within cilia and concomitant disappearance of a negative regulator, the orphan G 
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Gpr161. Here, we describe a two-step process
      determining removal of Gpr161 from cilia. The first step involves beta-arrestin
      recruitment by the signaling competent receptor, which is facilitated by the GPCR
      kinase Grk2. An essential factor here is the ciliary trafficking and activation
      of Smoothened, which by increasing Gpr161-beta-arrestin binding promotes Gpr161
      removal, both during resting conditions and upon Shh pathway activation. The
      second step involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which functions outside of
      the ciliary compartment in coordinating Gpr161 removal. Mechanisms determining
      dynamic compartmentalization of Gpr161 in cilia define a new paradigm for
      down-regulation of GPCRs during developmental signaling from a specialized
      subcellular compartment.

TI  - MLL5 maintains spindle bipolarity by preventing aberrant cytosolic aggregation of
      PLK1.
PG  - 829-43
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201501021 [doi]
AB  - Faithful chromosome segregation with bipolar spindle formation is critical for
      the maintenance of genomic stability. Perturbation of this process often leads to
      severe mitotic failure, contributing to tumorigenesis. MLL5 has been demonstrated
      to play vital roles in cell cycle progression and the maintenance of genomic
      stability. Here, we identify a novel interaction between MLL5 and PLK1 in the
      cytosol that is crucial for sustaining spindle bipolarity during mitosis.
      Knockdown of MLL5 caused aberrant PLK1 aggregation that led to acentrosomal
      microtubule-organizing center (aMTOC) formation and subsequent spindle
      multipolarity. Further molecular studies revealed that the polo-box domain (PBD) 
      of PLK1 interacted with a binding motif on MLL5 (Thr887-Ser888-Thr889), and this 
      interaction was essential for spindle bipolarity. Overexpression of wild-type
      MLL5 was able to rescue PLK1 mislocalization and aMTOC formation in MLL5-KD
      cells, whereas MLL5 mutants incapable of interacting with the PBD failed to do
      so. We thus propose that MLL5 preserves spindle bipolarity through maintaining
      cytosolic PLK1 in a nonaggregated form.

AB  - Accurate chromosome segregation depends on proper kinetochore-microtubule
      attachment. Upon microtubule interaction, kinetochores are subjected to forces
      generated by the microtubules. In this work, we used laser ablation to sever
      microtubules attached to a merotelic kinetochore, which is laterally stretched by
      opposing pulling forces exerted by microtubules, and inferred the mechanical
      response of the kinetochore from its length change. In both mammalian PtK1 cells 
      and in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, kinetochores shortened after 
      microtubule severing. Interestingly, the inner kinetochore-centromere relaxed
      faster than the outer kinetochore. Whereas in fission yeast all kinetochores
      relaxed to a similar length, in PtK1 cells the more stretched kinetochores
      remained more stretched. Simple models suggest that these differences arise
      because the mechanical structure of the mammalian kinetochore is more complex.
      Our study establishes merotelic kinetochores as an experimental model for
      studying the mechanical response of the kinetochore in live cells and reveals a
      viscoelastic behavior of the kinetochore that is conserved in yeast and mammalian
      cells.

AB  - Inhibitory synapses comprise only approximately 20% of the total synapses in the 
      mammalian brain but play essential roles in controlling neuronal activity. In
      fact, perturbing inhibitory synapses is associated with complex brain disorders, 
      such as schizophrenia and epilepsy. Although many types of inhibitory synapses
      exist, these disorders have been strongly linked to defects in inhibitory
      synapses formed by Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Here, we discovered a
      novel role for an unconventional collagen-collagen XIX-in the formation of
      Parvalbumin(+) inhibitory synapses. Loss of this collagen results not only in
      decreased inhibitory synapse number, but also in the acquisition of
      schizophrenia-related behaviors. Mechanistically, these studies reveal that a
      proteolytically released fragment of this collagen, termed a matricryptin,
      promotes the assembly of inhibitory nerve terminals through integrin receptors.
      Collectively, these studies not only identify roles for collagen-derived
      matricryptins in cortical circuit formation, but they also reveal a novel
      paracrine mechanism that regulates the assembly of these synapses.

AB  - Breast tumor progression is accompanied by changes in the surrounding
      extracellular matrix (ECM) that increase stiffness of the microenvironment.
      Mammary epithelial cells engage regulatory pathways that permit dynamic responses
      to mechanical cues from the ECM. Here, we identify a SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling
      circuit as a key regulatory mechanism by which cells sense and respond to ECM
      stiffness to preserve tensional homeostasis. We observed that Robo1 ablation in
      the developing mammary gland compromised actin stress fiber assembly and
      inhibited cell contractility to perturb tissue morphogenesis, whereas SLIT2
      treatment stimulated Rac and increased focal adhesion kinase activity to enhance 
      cell tension by maintaining cell shape and matrix adhesion. Further investigation
      revealed that a stiff ECM increased Robo1 levels by down-regulating miR-203.
      Consistently, patients whose tumor expressed a low miR-203/high Robo1 expression 
      pattern exhibited a better overall survival prognosis. These studies show that
      cells subjected to stiffened environments up-regulate Robo1 as a protective
      mechanism that maintains cell shape and facilitates ECM adherence.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507112 [doi]
AB  - We examined the luminal pH of individual lysosomes using quantitative ratiometric
      fluorescence microscopy and report an unappreciated heterogeneity: peripheral
      lysosomes are less acidic than juxtanuclear ones despite their comparable
      buffering capacity. An increased passive (leak) permeability to protons, together
      with reduced vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) activity, accounts
      for the reduced acidifying ability of peripheral lysosomes. The altered
      composition of peripheral lysosomes is due, at least in part, to more limited
      access to material exported by the biosynthetic pathway. The balance between Rab7
      and Arl8b determines the subcellular localization of lysosomes; more peripheral
      lysosomes have reduced Rab7 density. This in turn results in decreased
      recruitment of Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), an effector that
      regulates the recruitment and stability of the V1G1 component of the lysosomal
      V-ATPase. Deliberate margination of lysosomes is associated with reduced
      acidification and impaired proteolytic activity. The heterogeneity in lysosomal
      pH may be an indication of a broader functional versatility.

      during starvation.
PG  - 621-31
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508102 [doi]
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are conserved organelles for intracellular neutral lipid
      storage. Recent studies suggest that LDs function as direct lipid sources for
      autophagy, a central catabolic process in homeostasis and stress response. Here, 
      we demonstrate that LDs are dispensable as a membrane source for autophagy, but
      fulfill critical functions for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis linked to
      autophagy regulation. In the absence of LDs, yeast cells display alterations in
      their phospholipid composition and fail to buffer de novo fatty acid (FA)
      synthesis causing chronic stress and morphologic changes in the ER. These defects
      compromise regulation of autophagy, including formation of multiple aberrant Atg8
      puncta and drastically impaired autophagosome biogenesis, leading to severe
      defects in nutrient stress survival. Importantly, metabolically corrected
      phospholipid composition and improved FA resistance of LD-deficient cells cure
      autophagy and cell survival. Together, our findings provide novel insight into
      the complex interrelation between LD-mediated lipid homeostasis and the
      regulation of autophagy potentially relevant for neurodegenerative and metabolic 
      diseases.

PG  - 633-46
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508068 [doi]
AB  - In budding yeast, targeting of active genes to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and
      interchromosomal clustering is mediated by transcription factor (TF) binding
      sites in the gene promoters. For example, the binding sites for the TFs Put3,
      Ste12, and Gcn4 are necessary and sufficient to promote positioning at the
      nuclear periphery and interchromosomal clustering. However, in all three cases,
      gene positioning and interchromosomal clustering are regulated. Under uninducing 
      conditions, local recruitment of the Rpd3(L) histone deacetylase by
      transcriptional repressors blocks Put3 DNA binding. This is a general function of
      yeast repressors: 16 of 21 repressors blocked Put3-mediated subnuclear
      positioning; 11 of these required Rpd3. In contrast, Ste12-mediated gene
      positioning is regulated independently of DNA binding by mitogen-activated
      protein kinase phosphorylation of the Dig2 inhibitor, and Gcn4-dependent
      targeting is up-regulated by increasing Gcn4 protein levels. These different
      regulatory strategies provide either qualitative switch-like control or
      quantitative control of gene positioning over different time scales.

      signaling in a stiffness-independent manner.
PG  - 693-706
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508018 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how cells integrate multiple signaling pathways to achieve specific
      cell differentiation is a challenging question in cell biology. We have explored 
      the physiological presentation of BMP-2 by using a biomaterial that harbors
      tunable mechanical properties to promote localized BMP-2 signaling. We show that 
      matrix-bound BMP-2 is sufficient to induce beta3 integrin-dependent C2C12 cell
      spreading by overriding the soft signal of the biomaterial and impacting actin
      organization and adhesion site dynamics. In turn, alphavbeta3 integrin is
      required to mediate BMP-2-induced Smad signaling through a Cdc42-Src-FAK-ILK
      pathway. beta3 integrin regulates a multistep process to control first BMP-2
      receptor activity and second the inhibitory role of GSK3 on Smad signaling.
      Overall, our results show that BMP receptors and beta3 integrin work together to 
      control Smad signaling and tensional homeostasis, thereby coupling cell adhesion 
      and fate commitment, two fundamental aspects of developmental biology and
      regenerative medicine.

TI  - Arl2- and Msps-dependent microtubule growth governs asymmetric division.
PG  - 661-76
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201503047 [doi]
AB  - Asymmetric division of neural stem cells is a fundamental strategy to balance
      their self-renewal and differentiation. It is long thought that microtubules are 
      not essential for cell polarity in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila
      melanogaster neuroblasts (NBs; neural stem cells). Here, we show that Drosophila 
      ADP ribosylation factor like-2 (Arl2) and Msps, a known microtubule-binding
      protein, control cell polarity and spindle orientation of NBs. Upon arl2 RNA
      intereference, Arl2-GDP expression, or arl2 deletions, microtubule abnormalities 
      and asymmetric division defects were observed. Conversely, overactivation of Arl2
      leads to microtubule overgrowth and depletion of NBs. Arl2 regulates microtubule 
      growth and asymmetric division through localizing Msps to the centrosomes in NBs.
      Moreover, Arl2 regulates dynein function and in turn centrosomal localization of 
      D-TACC and Msps. Arl2 physically associates with tubulin cofactors C, D, and E.
      Arl2 functions together with tubulin-binding cofactor D to control microtubule
      growth, Msps localization, and NB self-renewal. Therefore, Arl2- and
      Msps-dependent microtubule growth is a new paradigm regulating asymmetric
      division of neural stem cells.

TI  - ARHGEF17 is an essential spindle assembly checkpoint factor that targets Mps1 to 
      kinetochores.
PG  - 647-59
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201408089 [doi]
AB  - To prevent genome instability, mitotic exit is delayed until all chromosomes are 
      properly attached to the mitotic spindle by the spindle assembly checkpoint
      (SAC). In this study, we characterized the function of ARHGEF17, identified in a 
      genome-wide RNA interference screen for human mitosis genes. Through a series of 
      quantitative imaging, biochemical, and biophysical experiments, we showed that
      ARHGEF17 is essential for SAC activity, because it is the major targeting factor 
      that controls localization of the checkpoint kinase Mps1 to the kinetochore. This
      mitotic function is mediated by direct interaction of the central domain of
      ARHGEF17 with Mps1, which is autoregulated by the activity of Mps1 kinase, for
      which ARHGEF17 is a substrate. This mitosis-specific role is independent of
      ARHGEF17's RhoGEF activity in interphase. Our study thus assigns a new mitotic
      function to ARHGEF17 and reveals the molecular mechanism for a key step in SAC
      establishment.

TI  - Synergistic action of nectins and cadherins generates the mosaic cellular pattern
      of the olfactory epithelium.

AB  - In the olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory cells (OCs) and supporting cells
      (SCs), which express different cadherins, are arranged in a characteristic mosaic
      pattern in which OCs are enclosed by SCs. However, the mechanism underlying this 
      cellular patterning is unclear. Here, we show that the cellular pattern of the OE
      is established by cellular rearrangements during development. In the OE, OCs
      express nectin-2 and N-cadherin, and SCs express nectin-2, nectin-3, E-cadherin, 
      and N-cadherin. Heterophilic trans-interaction between nectin-2 on OCs and
      nectin-3 on SCs preferentially recruits cadherin via alpha-catenin to heterotypic
      junctions, and the differential distributions of cadherins between junctions
      promote cellular intercalations, resulting in the formation of the mosaic
      pattern. These observations are confirmed by model cell systems, and various
      cellular patterns are generated by the combinatorial expression of nectins and
      cadherins. Collectively, the synergistic action of nectins and cadherins
      generates mosaic pattern, which cannot be achieved by a single mechanism.

TI  - Elevated p62/SQSTM1 determines the fate of autophagy-deficient neural stem cells 
      by increasing superoxide.
PG  - 545-60
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507023 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy plays important roles in many biological processes, but our
      understanding of the mechanisms regulating stem cells by autophagy is limited.
      Interpretations of earlier studies of autophagy using knockouts of single genes
      are confounded by accumulating evidence for other functions of many autophagy
      genes. Here, we show that, in contrast to Fip200 deletion, inhibition of
      autophagy by deletion of Atg5, Atg16L1, or Atg7 does not impair the maintenance
      and differentiation of postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs). Only Fip200 deletion, 
      but not Atg5, Atg16L1, or Atg7 deletion, caused p62/sequestome1 aggregates to
      accumulate in NSCs. Fip200 and p62 double conditional knockout mice demonstrated 
      that p62 aggregate formation triggers aberrant superoxide increases by impairing 
      superoxide dismutase functions. By comparing the inhibition of autophagy by
      deletion of Atg5, Atg16L1, or Atg7 with Fip200 deletion, we revealed a critical
      role of increased p62 in determining the fate of autophagy-deficient NSCs through
      intracellular superoxide control.

PG  - 515-29
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511029 [doi]
AB  - Septin complexes display remarkable plasticity in subunit composition, yet how a 
      new subunit assembled into higher-order structures confers different functions is
      not fully understood. Here, this question is addressed in budding yeast, where
      during meiosis Spr3 and Spr28 replace the mitotic septin subunits Cdc12 and Cdc11
      (and Shs1), respectively. In vitro, the sole stable complex that contains both
      meiosis-specific septins is a linear Spr28-Spr3-Cdc3-Cdc10-Cdc10-Cdc3-Spr3-Spr28 
      hetero-octamer. Only coexpressed Spr3 and Spr28 colocalize with Cdc3 and Cdc10 in
      mitotic cells, indicating that incorporation requires a Spr28-Spr3 protomer.
      Unlike their mitotic counterparts, Spr28-Spr3-capped rods are unable to form
      higher-order structures in solution but assemble to form long paired filaments on
      lipid monolayers containing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, mimicking
      presence of this phosphoinositide in the prospore membrane. Spr28 and Spr3 fail
      to rescue the lethality of a cdc11Delta cdc12Delta mutant, and Cdc11 and Cdc12
      fail to restore sporulation proficiency to spr3Delta/spr3Delta
      spr28Delta/spr28Delta diploids. Thus, specific meiotic and mitotic subunits endow
      septin complexes with functionally distinct properties.

TI  - ALIX and ESCRT-I/II function as parallel ESCRT-III recruiters in cytokinetic
      abscission.
PG  - 499-513
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507009 [doi]
AB  - Cytokinetic abscission, the final stage of cell division where the two daughter
      cells are separated, is mediated by the endosomal sorting complex required for
      transport (ESCRT) machinery. The ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4B is a key effector in
      abscission, whereas its paralogue, CHMP4C, is a component in the abscission
      checkpoint that delays abscission until chromatin is cleared from the
      intercellular bridge. How recruitment of these components is mediated during
      cytokinesis remains poorly understood, although the ESCRT-binding protein ALIX
      has been implicated. Here, we show that ESCRT-II and the ESCRT-II-binding
      ESCRT-III subunit CHMP6 cooperate with ESCRT-I to recruit CHMP4B, with ALIX
      providing a parallel recruitment arm. In contrast to CHMP4B, we find that
      recruitment of CHMP4C relies predominantly on ALIX. Accordingly, ALIX depletion
      leads to furrow regression in cells with chromosome bridges, a phenotype
      associated with abscission checkpoint signaling failure. Collectively, our work
      reveals a two-pronged recruitment of ESCRT-III to the cytokinetic bridge and
      implicates ALIX in abscission checkpoint signaling.

AB  - During cytokinetic abscission, the endosomal sorting complex required for
      transport (ESCRT) proteins are recruited to the midbody and direct the severing
      of the intercellular bridge. In this issue, Christ et al. (2016. J. Cell Biol.
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201507009) demonstrate that two separate but
      redundant pathways exist to recruit ESCRT-III proteins to the midbody.

TI  - Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission via MiD49/51 is essential for apoptotic
      cristae remodeling.
PG  - 531-44
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508099 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial fission facilitates cytochrome c release from the intracristae
      space into the cytoplasm during intrinsic apoptosis, although how the
      mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 and its mitochondrial receptors Mff, MiD49, and
      MiD51 are involved in this reaction remains elusive. Here, we analyzed the
      functional division of these receptors with their knockout (KO) cell lines. In
      marked contrast to Mff-KO cells, MiD49/MiD51-KO and Drp1-KO cells completely
      resisted cristae remodeling and cytochrome c release during apoptosis. This
      phenotype in MiD49/51-KO cells, but not Drp1-KO cells, was completely abolished
      by treatments disrupting cristae structure such as OPA1 depletion. Unexpectedly, 
      OPA1 oligomers generally thought to resist cytochrome c release by stabilizing
      the cristae structure were similarly disassembled in Drp1-KO and MiD49/51-KO
      cells, indicating that disassembly of OPA1 oligomers is not directly linked to
      cristae remodeling for cytochrome c release. Together, these results indicate
      that Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission through MiD49/MiD51 regulates cristae
      remodeling during intrinsic apoptosis.

TI  - NBR1 enables autophagy-dependent focal adhesion turnover.
PG  - 577-90
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201503075 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is a catabolic pathway involving the sequestration of cellular contents
      into a double-membrane vesicle, the autophagosome. Although recent studies have
      demonstrated that autophagy supports cell migration, the underlying mechanisms
      remain unknown. Using live-cell imaging, we uncover that autophagy promotes
      optimal migratory rate and facilitates the dynamic assembly and disassembly of
      cell-matrix focal adhesions (FAs), which is essential for efficient motility.
      Additionally, our studies reveal that autophagosomes associate with FAs primarily
      during disassembly, suggesting autophagy locally facilitates the destabilization 
      of cell-matrix contact sites. Furthermore, we identify the selective autophagy
      cargo receptor neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1) as a key mediator of autophagy-dependent 
      FA remodeling. NBR1 depletion impairs FA turnover and decreases targeting of
      autophagosomes to FAs, whereas ectopic expression of autophagy-competent, but not
      autophagy-defective, NBR1 enhances FA disassembly and reduces FA lifetime during 
      migration. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how autophagy promotes
      migration by revealing a requirement for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy in
      enabling FA disassembly in motile cells.

      during tissue rotation.
PG  - 591-603
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508081 [doi]
AB  - Directional cell movements during morphogenesis require the coordinated interplay
      between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton. The WAVE regulatory
      complex (WRC) is a conserved actin regulator. Here, we found that the atypical
      cadherin Fat2 recruits the WRC to basal membranes of tricellular contacts where a
      new type of planar-polarized whip-like actin protrusion is formed. Loss of either
      Fat2 function or its interaction with the WRC disrupts tricellular protrusions
      and results in the formation of nonpolarized filopodia. We provide further
      evidence for a molecular network in which the receptor tyrosine phosphatase Dlar 
      interacts with the WRC to couple the extracellular matrix, the membrane, and the 
      actin cytoskeleton during egg elongation. Our data uncover a mechanism by which
      polarity information can be transduced from a membrane receptor to a key actin
      regulator to control collective follicle cell migration during egg elongation.
      4D-live imaging of rotating MCF10A mammary acini further suggests an evolutionary
      conserved mechanism driving rotational motions in epithelial morphogenesis.

      type 3 models.
PG  - 465-80
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506025 [doi]
AB  - Different neurodegenerative diseases are caused by aberrant elongation of
      repeated glutamine sequences normally found in particular human proteins.
      Although the proteins involved are ubiquitously distributed in human tissues,
      toxicity targets only defined neuronal populations. Changes caused by an expanded
      polyglutamine protein are possibly influenced by endogenous cellular mechanisms, 
      which may be harnessed to produce neuroprotection. Here, we show that ataxin-3,
      the protein involved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as
      Machado-Joseph disease, causes dendritic and synapse loss in cultured neurons
      when expanded. We report that S12 of ataxin-3 is phosphorylated in neurons and
      that mutating this residue so as to mimic a constitutive phosphorylated state
      counters the neuromorphologic defects observed. In rats stereotaxically injected 
      with expanded ataxin-3-encoding lentiviral vectors, mutation of serine 12 reduces
      aggregation, neuronal loss, and synapse loss. Our results suggest that S12 plays 
      a role in the pathogenic pathways mediated by polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 and
      that phosphorylation of this residue protects against toxicity.

TI  - Neuroligin 1 regulates spines and synaptic plasticity via LIMK1/cofilin-mediated 
      actin reorganization.
PG  - 449-63
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201509023 [doi]
AB  - Neuroligin (NLG) 1 is important for synapse development and function, but the
      underlying mechanisms remain unclear. It is known that at least some aspects of
      NLG1 function are independent of the presynaptic neurexin, suggesting that the
      C-terminal domain (CTD) of NLG1 may be sufficient for synaptic regulation. In
      addition, NLG1 is subjected to activity-dependent proteolytic cleavage,
      generating a cytosolic CTD fragment, but the significance of this process remains
      unknown. In this study, we show that the CTD of NLG1 is sufficient to (a) enhance
      spine and synapse number, (b) modulate synaptic plasticity, and (c) exert these
      effects via its interaction with spine-associated Rap guanosine
      triphosphatase-activating protein and subsequent activation of LIM-domain protein
      kinase 1/cofilin-mediated actin reorganization. Our results provide a novel
      postsynaptic mechanism by which NLG1 regulates synapse development and function.

      lymphocytes.
PG  - 439-47
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506118 [doi]
AB  - Cytokine regulation of lymphocyte growth and proliferation is essential for
      matching nutrient consumption with cell state. Here, we examine how cellular
      biophysical changes that occur immediately after growth factor depletion promote 
      adaptation to reduced nutrient uptake. After growth factor withdrawal, nutrient
      uptake decreases, leading to apoptosis. Bcl-xL expression prevents cell death,
      with autophagy facilitating long-term cell survival. However, autophagy induction
      is slow relative to the reduction of nutrient uptake, suggesting that cells must 
      engage additional adaptive mechanisms to respond initially to growth factor
      depletion. We describe an acute biophysical response to growth factor withdrawal,
      characterized by a simultaneous decrease in cell volume and increase in cell
      density, which occurs before autophagy initiation and is observed in both FL5.12 
      Bcl-xL cells depleted of IL-3 and primary CD8(+) T cells depleted of IL-2 that
      are differentiating toward memory cells. The response reduces cell surface area
      to minimize energy expenditure while conserving biomass, suggesting that the
      biophysical properties of cells can be regulated to promote survival under
      conditions of nutrient stress.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507046 [doi]
AB  - Primary cilia protrude from the surface of quiescent cells and disassemble at
      cell cycle reentry. We previously showed that ciliary reassembly is suppressed by
      trichoplein-mediated Aurora A activation pathway in growing cells. Here, we
      report that Ndel1, a well-known modulator of dynein activity, localizes at the
      subdistal appendage of the mother centriole, which nucleates a primary cilium. In
      the presence of serum, Ndel1 depletion reduces trichoplein at the mother
      centriole and induces unscheduled primary cilia formation, which is reverted by
      forced trichoplein expression or coknockdown of KCTD17 (an E3 ligase component
      protein for trichoplein). Serum starvation induced transient Ndel1 degradation,
      subsequent to the disappearance of trichoplein at the mother centriole. Forced
      expression of Ndel1 suppressed trichoplein degradation and axonemal microtubule
      extension during ciliogenesis, similar to trichoplein induction or KCTD17
      knockdown. Most importantly, the proportion of ciliated and quiescent cells was
      increased in the kidney tubular epithelia of newborn Ndel1-hypomorphic mice.
      Thus, Ndel1 acts as a novel upstream regulator of the trichoplein-Aurora A
      pathway to inhibit primary cilia assembly.

TI  - MRN, CtIP, and BRCA1 mediate repair of topoisomerase II-DNA adducts.
PG  - 399-408
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201504005 [doi]
AB  - Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with complex ends poses a special
      challenge, as additional processing is required before DNA ligation. For example,
      protein-DNA adducts must be removed to allow repair by either nonhomologous end
      joining or homology-directed repair. Here, we investigated the processing of
      topoisomerase II (Top2)-DNA adducts induced by treatment with the
      chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Through biochemical analysis in Xenopus laevis 
      egg extracts, we establish that the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) complex, CtIP,
      and BRCA1 are required for both the removal of Top2-DNA adducts and the
      subsequent resection of Top2-adducted DSB ends. Moreover, the interaction between
      CtIP and BRCA1, although dispensable for resection of endonuclease-generated DSB 
      ends, is required for resection of Top2-adducted DSBs, as well as for cellular
      resistance to etoposide during genomic DNA replication.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201511036 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria are renowned for their central bioenergetic role in eukaryotic
      cells, where they act as powerhouses to generate adenosine triphosphate from
      oxidation of nutrients. At the same time, these organelles are highly dynamic and
      undergo fusion, fission, transport, and degradation. Each of these dynamic
      processes is critical for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population. Given
      the central metabolic function of mitochondria, it is not surprising that
      mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics reciprocally influence each other. We
      review the dynamic properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on how these
      processes respond to cellular signaling events and how they affect metabolism.

TI  - Coupling primary and stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in an in vitro model of
      cardiac cell therapy.
PG  - 389-97
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508026 [doi]
AB  - The efficacy of cardiac cell therapy depends on the integration of existing and
      newly formed cardiomyocytes. Here, we developed a minimal in vitro model of this 
      interface by engineering two cell microtissues (mutissues) containing mouse
      cardiomyocytes, representing spared myocardium after injury, and cardiomyocytes
      generated from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, to model newly
      formed cells. We demonstrated that weaker stem cell-derived myocytes coupled with
      stronger myocytes to support synchronous contraction, but this arrangement
      required focal adhesion-like structures near the cell-cell junction that degrade 
      force transmission between cells. Moreover, we developed a computational model of
      mutissue mechanics to demonstrate that a reduction in isometric tension is
      sufficient to impair force transmission across the cell-cell boundary. Together, 
      our in vitro and in silico results suggest that mechanotransductive mechanisms
      may contribute to the modest functional benefits observed in cell-therapy studies
      by regulating the amount of contractile force effectively transmitted at the
      junction between newly formed and spared myocytes.

      in cardiomyocytes.
PG  - 425-38
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507018 [doi]
AB  - Members of the desmosome protein family are integral components of the cardiac
      area composita, a mixed junctional complex responsible for electromechanical
      coupling between cardiomyocytes. In this study, we provide evidence that loss of 
      the desmosomal armadillo protein Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) in cardiomyocytes elevates 
      transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) signaling, which together coordinate a transcriptional program that
      results in increased expression of profibrotic genes. Importantly, we demonstrate
      that expression of Desmoplakin (DP) is lost upon PKP2 knockdown and that
      restoration of DP expression rescues the activation of this TGF-beta1/p38 MAPK
      transcriptional cascade. Tissues from PKP2 heterozygous and DP conditional
      knockout mouse models also exhibit elevated TGF-beta1/p38 MAPK signaling and
      induction of fibrotic gene expression in vivo. These data therefore identify PKP2
      and DP as central players in coordination of desmosome-dependent TGF-beta1/p38
      MAPK signaling in cardiomyocytes, pathways known to play a role in different
      types of cardiac disease, such as arrhythmogenic or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Modulation of FAK and Src adhesion signaling occurs independently of adhesion
      complex composition.
PG  - 349-64
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508080 [doi]
AB  - Integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) form mechanochemical connections between the
      extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton and mediate phenotypic responses via 
      posttranslational modifications. Here, we investigate the modularity and
      robustness of the IAC network to pharmacological perturbation of the key IAC
      signaling components focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src. FAK inhibition using
      AZ13256675 blocked FAK(Y397) phosphorylation but did not alter IAC composition,
      as reported by mass spectrometry. IAC composition was also insensitive to Src
      inhibition using AZD0530 alone or in combination with FAK inhibition. In
      contrast, kinase inhibition substantially reduced phosphorylation within IACs,
      cell migration and proliferation. Furthermore using fluorescence recovery after
      photobleaching, we found that FAK inhibition increased the exchange rate of a
      phosphotyrosine (pY) reporter (dSH2) at IACs. These data demonstrate that
      kinase-dependent signal propagation through IACs is independent of gross changes 
      in IAC composition. Together, these findings demonstrate a general separation
      between the composition of IACs and their ability to relay pY-dependent signals.

      proteins from the ER.
PG  - 335-48
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506141 [doi]
AB  - During de novo peroxisome biogenesis, importomer complex proteins sort via two
      preperoxisomal vesicles (ppVs). However, the sorting mechanisms segregating
      peroxisomal membrane proteins to the preperoxisomal endoplasmic reticulum (pER)
      and into ppVs are unknown. We report novel roles for Pex3 and Pex19 in
      intra-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sorting and budding of the RING-domain peroxins 
      (Pex2, Pex10, and Pex12). Pex19 bridged the interaction at the ER between Pex3
      and RING-domain proteins, resulting in a ternary complex that was critical for
      the intra-ER sorting and subsequent budding of the RING-domain peroxins. Although
      the docking subcomplex proteins (Pex13, Pex14, and Pex17) also required Pex19 for
      budding from the ER, they sorted to the pER independently of Pex3 and Pex19 and
      were spatially segregated from the RING-domain proteins. We also discovered a
      unique role for Pex3 in sorting Pex10 and Pex12, but with the docking subcomplex.
      Our study describes an intra-ER sorting process that regulates segregation,
      packaging, and budding of peroxisomal importomer subcomplexes, thereby preventing
      their premature assembly at the ER.

TI  - Unattached kinetochores rather than intrakinetochore tension arrest mitosis in
      taxol-treated cells.
PG  - 307-19
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201412139 [doi]
AB  - Kinetochores attach chromosomes to the spindle microtubules and signal the
      spindle assembly checkpoint to delay mitotic exit until all chromosomes are
      attached. Light microscopy approaches aimed to indirectly determine distances
      between various proteins within the kinetochore (termed Delta) suggest that
      kinetochores become stretched by spindle forces and compact elastically when the 
      force is suppressed. Low Delta is believed to arrest mitotic progression in
      taxol-treated cells. However, the structural basis of Delta remains unknown. By
      integrating same-kinetochore light microscopy and electron microscopy, we
      demonstrate that the value of Delta is affected by the variability in the shape
      and size of outer kinetochore domains. The outer kinetochore compacts when
      spindle forces are maximal during metaphase. When the forces are weakened by
      taxol treatment, the outer kinetochore expands radially and some kinetochores
      completely lose microtubule attachment, a condition known to arrest mitotic
      progression. These observations offer an alternative interpretation of
      intrakinetochore tension and question whether Delta plays a direct role in the
      control of mitotic progression.

TI  - EHBP1L1 coordinates Rab8 and Bin1 to regulate apical-directed transport in
      polarized epithelial cells.
PG  - 297-306
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508086 [doi]
AB  - The highly conserved Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab8 plays a role in
      exocytosis toward the polarized plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. In murine
      Rab8-deficient small intestine cells, apical proteins are missorted into
      lysosomes. In this study, we identified a novel Rab8-interacting protein complex 
      containing an EH domain-binding protein 1-like 1 (EHBP1L1), Bin1/amphiphysin II, 
      and dynamin. Biochemical analyses showed that EHBP1L1 directly bound to
      GTP-loaded Rab8 and Bin1. The spatial dependency of these complexes at the
      endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) was demonstrated through overexpression and
      knockdown experiments. EHBP1L1- or Bin1-depleted or dynamin-inhibited small
      intestine organoids significantly accumulated apical membrane proteins but not
      basolateral membrane proteins in lysosomes. Furthermore, in EHBP1L1-deficient
      mice, small intestine cells displayed truncated and sparse microvilli, suggesting
      that EHBP1L1 maintains the apical plasma membrane by regulating apical transport.
      In summary, our data demonstrate that EHBP1L1 links Rab8 and the Bin1-dynamin
      complex, which generates membrane curvature and excises the vesicle at the ERC
      for apical transport.

TI  - Dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton mediates receptor cross talk: An emerging
      concept in tuning receptor signaling.
PG  - 267-80
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201504137 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence implicates the actin cytoskeleton in the control of receptor
      signaling. This may be of particular importance in the context of immune
      receptors, such as the B cell receptor, where dysregulated signaling can result
      in autoimmunity and malignancy. Here, we discuss the role of the actin
      cytoskeleton in controlling receptor compartmentalization, dynamics, and
      clustering as a means to regulate receptor signaling through controlling the
      interactions with protein partners. We propose that the actin cytoskeleton is a
      point of integration for receptor cross talk through modulation of protein
      dynamics and clustering. We discuss the implication of this cross talk via the
      cytoskeleton for both ligand-induced and low-level constitutive (tonic) signaling
      necessary for immune cell survival.

TI  - Global reorganization of budding yeast chromosome conformation in different
      physiological conditions.
PG  - 321-34
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507069 [doi]
AB  - The organization of the genome is nonrandom and important for correct function.
      Specifically, the nuclear envelope plays a critical role in gene regulation. It
      generally constitutes a repressive environment, but several genes, including the 
      GAL locus in budding yeast, are recruited to the nuclear periphery on activation.
      Here, we combine imaging and computational modeling to ask how the association of
      a single gene locus with the nuclear envelope influences the surrounding
      chromosome architecture. Systematic analysis of an entire yeast chromosome
      establishes that peripheral recruitment of the GAL locus is part of a large-scale
      rearrangement that shifts many chromosomal regions closer to the nuclear
      envelope. This process is likely caused by the presence of several independent
      anchoring points. To identify novel factors required for peripheral anchoring, we
      performed a genome-wide screen and demonstrated that the histone
      acetyltransferase SAGA and the activity of histone deacetylases are needed for
      this extensive gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201512020 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic cells use microtubule-based intracellular transport for the delivery
      of many subcellular cargos, including organelles. The canonical view of organelle
      transport is that organelles directly recruit molecular motors via cargo-specific
      adaptors. In contrast with this view, we show here that peroxisomes move by
      hitchhiking on early endosomes, an organelle that directly recruits the transport
      machinery. Using the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans we found that
      hitchhiking is mediated by a novel endosome-associated linker protein, PxdA. PxdA
      is required for normal distribution and long-range movement of peroxisomes, but
      not early endosomes or nuclei. Using simultaneous time-lapse imaging, we find
      that early endosome-associated PxdA localizes to the leading edge of moving
      peroxisomes. We identify a coiled-coil region within PxdA that is necessary and
      sufficient for early endosome localization and peroxisome distribution and
      motility. These results present a new mechanism of microtubule-based organelle
      transport in which peroxisomes hitchhike on early endosomes and identify PxdA as 
      the novel linker protein required for this coupling.

TI  - TOPBP1 regulates RAD51 phosphorylation and chromatin loading and determines PARP 
      inhibitor sensitivity.
PG  - 281-8
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507042 [doi]
AB  - Topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein 1 (TOPBP1) participates in DNA replication
      and DNA damage response; however, its role in DNA repair and relevance for human 
      cancer remain unclear. Here, through an unbiased small interfering RNA screen, we
      identified and validated TOPBP1 as a novel determinant whose loss sensitized
      human cells to olaparib, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We show
      that TOPBP1 acts in homologous recombination (HR) repair, impacts olaparib
      response, and exhibits aberrant patterns in subsets of human ovarian carcinomas. 
      TOPBP1 depletion abrogated RAD51 loading to chromatin and formation of RAD51
      foci, but without affecting the upstream HR steps of DNA end resection and RPA
      loading. Furthermore, TOPBP1 BRCT domains 7/8 are essential for RAD51 foci
      formation. Mechanistically, TOPBP1 physically binds PLK1 and promotes PLK1
      kinase-mediated phosphorylation of RAD51 at serine 14, a modification required
      for RAD51 recruitment to chromatin. Overall, our results provide mechanistic
      insights into TOPBP1's role in HR, with potential clinical implications for
      cancer treatment.

AB  - The understanding of cytoskeleton dynamics has benefited from the capacity to
      generate fluorescent fiducial marks on cytoskeleton components. Here we show that
      light-induced imprinting of three-dimensional (3D) fluorescent speckles
      significantly improves speckle signal and contrast relative to classic (random)
      fluorescent speckle microscopy. We predict theoretically that speckle imprinting 
      using photobleaching is optimal when the laser energy and fluorophore
      responsivity are related by the golden ratio. This relation, which we confirm
      experimentally, translates into a 40% remaining signal after speckle imprinting
      and provides a rule of thumb in selecting the laser power required to optimally
      prepare the sample for imaging. This inducible speckle imaging (ISI) technique
      allows 3D speckle microscopy to be performed in readily available libraries of
      cell lines or primary tissues expressing fluorescent proteins and does not
      preclude conventional imaging before speckle imaging. As a proof of concept, we
      use ISI to measure metaphase spindle microtubule poleward flux in primary cells
      and explore a scaling relation connecting microtubule flux to metaphase duration.

      mechanical forces.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201505105 [doi]
AB  - Collective cell migration (CCM) is essential for organism development, wound
      healing, and metastatic transition, the primary cause of cancer-related death,
      and it involves cell-cell adhesion molecules of the cadherin family. Increased
      P-cadherin expression levels are correlated with tumor aggressiveness in
      carcinoma and aggressive sarcoma; however, how P-cadherin promotes tumor
      malignancy remains unknown. Here, using integrated cell biology and biophysical
      approaches, we determined that P-cadherin specifically induces polarization and
      CCM through an increase in the strength and anisotropy of mechanical forces. We
      show that this mechanical regulation is mediated by the P-cadherin/beta-PIX/Cdc42
      axis; P-cadherin specifically activates Cdc42 through beta-PIX, which is
      specifically recruited at cell-cell contacts upon CCM. This mechanism of cell
      polarization and migration is absent in cells expressing E- or R-cadherin. Thus, 
      we identify a specific role of P-cadherin through beta-PIX-mediated Cdc42
      activation in the regulation of cell polarity and force anisotropy that drives
      CCM.

TI  - Negative regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate levels in early-to-late
      endosome conversion.
PG  - 181-98
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506081 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) plays a central role in endosome
      fusion, recycling, sorting, and early-to-late endosome conversion, but the
      mechanisms that determine how the correct endosomal PtdIns3P level is achieved
      remain largely elusive. Here we identify two new factors, SORF-1 and SORF-2, as
      essential PtdIns3P regulators in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of sorf-1 or sorf-2
      leads to greatly elevated endosomal PtdIns3P, which drives excessive fusion of
      early endosomes. sorf-1 and sorf-2 function coordinately with Rab switching genes
      to inhibit synthesis of PtdIns3P, allowing its turnover for endosome conversion. 
      SORF-1 and SORF-2 act in a complex with BEC-1/Beclin1, and their loss causes
      elevated activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. In
      mammalian cells, inactivation of WDR91 and WDR81, the homologs of SORF-1 and
      SORF-2, induces Beclin1-dependent enlargement of PtdIns3P-enriched endosomes and 
      defective degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor. WDR91 and WDR81
      interact with Beclin1 and inhibit PI3K complex activity. These findings reveal a 
      conserved mechanism that controls appropriate PtdIns3P levels in early-to-late
      endosome conversion.

PG  - 167-80
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506130 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear pore complex (NPC) serves as both the unique gate between the nucleus
      and the cytoplasm and a major platform that coordinates nucleocytoplasmic
      exchanges, gene expression, and genome integrity. To understand how the NPC
      integrates these functional constraints, we dissected here the posttranslational 
      modifications of the nuclear basket protein Nup60 and analyzed how they intervene
      to control the plasticity of the NPC. Combined approaches highlight the role of
      monoubiquitylation in regulating the association dynamics of Nup60 and its
      partner, Nup2, with the NPC through an interaction with Nup84, a component of the
      Y complex. Although major nuclear transport routes are not regulated by Nup60
      modifications, monoubiquitylation of Nup60 is stimulated upon genotoxic stress
      and regulates the DNA-damage response and telomere repair. Together, these data
      reveal an original mechanism contributing to the plasticity of the NPC at a
      molecular-organization and functional level.

TI  - Loss of OMA1 delays neurodegeneration by preventing stress-induced OPA1
      processing in mitochondria.
PG  - 157-66
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507022 [doi]
AB  - Proteolytic cleavage of the dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatase OPA1 in
      mitochondria is emerging as a central regulatory hub that determines
      mitochondrial morphology under stress and in disease. Stress-induced OPA1
      processing by OMA1 triggersmitochondrial fragmentation, which is associated with 
      mitophagy and apoptosis in vitro. Here, we identify OMA1 as a critical regulator 
      of neuronal survival in vivo and demonstrate that stress-induced OPA1 processing 
      by OMA1 promotes neuronal death and neuroinflammatory responses. Using mice
      lacking prohibitin membrane scaffolds as a model of neurodegeneration, we
      demonstrate that additional ablation of Oma1 delays neuronal loss and prolongs
      lifespan. This is accompanied by the accumulation of fusion-active, long OPA1
      forms, which stabilize the mitochondrial genome but do not preserve mitochondrial
      cristae or respiratory chain supercomplex assembly in prohibitin-depleted
      neurons. Thus, long OPA1 forms can promote neuronal survival independently of
      cristae shape, whereas stress-induced OMA1 activation and OPA1 cleavage limit
      mitochondrial fusion and promote neuronal death.

TI  - Collective cell migration in development.
PG  - 143-55
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508047 [doi]
AB  - During embryonic development, tissues undergo major rearrangements that lead to
      germ layer positioning, patterning, and organ morphogenesis. Often these
      morphogenetic movements are accomplished by the coordinated and cooperative
      migration of the constituent cells, referred to as collective cell migration. The
      molecular and biomechanical mechanisms underlying collective migration of
      developing tissues have been investigated in a variety of models, including
      border cell migration, tracheal branching, blood vessel sprouting, and the
      migration of the lateral line primordium, neural crest cells, or head
      mesendoderm. Here we review recent advances in understanding collective migration
      in these developmental models, focusing on the interaction between cells and
      guidance cues presented by the microenvironment and on the role of cell-cell
      adhesion in mechanical and behavioral coupling of cells within the collective.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are often governed by the transcription
      factor Snail and entail the loss of apical junctions from epithelial cells. In
      this issue, Weng and Wieschaus (2016. J Cell Biol.
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508056) report that actomyosin contractility can
      strengthen junctions to override Snail-dependent junctional disassembly and
      postpone EMT during Drosophila melanogaster gastrulation.

TI  - Class III myosins shape the auditory hair bundles by limiting microvilli and
      stereocilia growth.
PG  - 231-44
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201509017 [doi]
AB  - The precise architecture of hair bundles, the arrays of mechanosensitive
      microvilli-like stereocilia crowning the auditory hair cells, is essential to
      hearing. Myosin IIIa, defective in the late-onset deafness form DFNB30, has been 
      proposed to transport espin-1 to the tips of stereocilia, thereby promoting their
      elongation. We show that Myo3a(-/-)Myo3b(-/-) mice lacking myosin IIIa and myosin
      IIIb are profoundly deaf, whereas Myo3a-cKO Myo3b(-/-) mice lacking myosin IIIb
      and losing myosin IIIa postnatally have normal hearing. Myo3a(-/-)Myo3b(-/-)
      cochlear hair bundles display robust mechanoelectrical transduction currents with
      normal kinetics but show severe embryonic abnormalities whose features rapidly
      change. These include abnormally tall and numerous microvilli or stereocilia,
      ungraded stereocilia bundles, and bundle rounding and closure. Surprisingly,
      espin-1 is properly targeted to Myo3a(-/-)Myo3b(-/-) stereocilia tips. Our
      results uncover the critical role that class III myosins play redundantly in
      hair-bundle morphogenesis; they unexpectedly limit the elongation of stereocilia 
      and of subsequently regressing microvilli, thus contributing to the early hair
      bundle shaping.

      Snail-dependent disassembly.
PG  - 219-29
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508056 [doi]
AB  - Although Snail is essential for disassembly of adherens junctions during
      epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), loss of adherens junctions in
      Drosophila melanogaster gastrula is delayed until mesoderm is internalized,
      despite the early expression of Snail in that primordium. By combining live
      imaging and quantitative image analysis, we track the behavior of E-cadherin-rich
      junction clusters, demonstrating that in the early stages of gastrulation most
      subapical clusters in mesoderm not only persist, but move apically and enhance in
      density and total intensity. All three phenomena depend on myosin II and are
      temporally correlated with the pulses of actomyosin accumulation that drive
      initial cell shape changes during gastrulation. When contractile myosin is
      absent, the normal Snail expression in mesoderm, or ectopic Snail expression in
      ectoderm, is sufficient to drive early disassembly of junctions. In both cases,
      junctional disassembly can be blocked by simultaneous induction of myosin
      contractility. Our findings provide in vivo evidence for mechanosensitivity of
      cell-cell junctions and imply that myosin-mediated tension can prevent
      Snail-driven EMT.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506018 [doi]
AB  - Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) control the cytoskeletal dynamics that
      power neurite outgrowth. This process consists of dynamic neurite initiation,
      elongation, retraction, and branching cycles that are likely to be regulated by
      specific spatiotemporal signaling networks, which cannot be resolved with static,
      steady-state assays. We present NeuriteTracker, a computer-vision approach to
      automatically segment and track neuronal morphodynamics in time-lapse datasets.
      Feature extraction then quantifies dynamic neurite outgrowth phenotypes. We
      identify a set of stereotypic neurite outgrowth morphodynamic behaviors in a
      cultured neuronal cell system. Systematic RNA interference perturbation of a Rho 
      GTPase interactome consisting of 219 proteins reveals a limited set of
      morphodynamic phenotypes. As proof of concept, we show that loss of function of
      two distinct RhoA-specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) leads to opposite
      neurite outgrowth phenotypes. Imaging of RhoA activation dynamics indicates that 
      both GAPs regulate different spatiotemporal Rho GTPase pools, with distinct
      functions. Our results provide a starting point to dissect spatiotemporal Rho
      GTPase signaling networks that regulate neurite outgrowth.

TI  - Zds1/Zds2-PP2ACdc55 complex specifies signaling output from Rho1 GTPase.
PG  - 51-61
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201508119 [doi]
AB  - Budding yeast Rho1 guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) plays an essential role in
      polarized cell growth by regulating cell wall glucan synthesis and actin
      organization. Upon cell wall damage, Rho1 blocks polarized cell growth and
      repairs the wounds by activating the cell wall integrity (CWI)
      Pkc1-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. A fundamental question is
      how active Rho1 promotes distinct signaling outputs under different conditions.
      Here we identified the Zds1/Zds2-protein phosphatase 2A(Cdc55) (PP2A(Cdc55))
      complex as a novel Rho1 effector that regulates Rho1 signaling specificity.
      Zds1/Zds2-PP2A(Cdc55) promotes polarized growth and cell wall synthesis by
      inhibiting Rho1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) Lrg1 but inhibits CWI pathway by 
      stabilizing another Rho1 GAP, Sac7, suggesting that active Rho1 is biased toward 
      cell growth over stress response. Conversely, upon cell wall damage, Pkc1-Mpk1
      activity inhibits cortical PP2A(Cdc55), ensuring that Rho1 preferentially
      activates the CWI pathway for cell wall repair. We propose that PP2A(Cdc55)
      specifies Rho1 signaling output and that reciprocal antagonism between
      Rho1-PP2A(Cdc55) and Rho1-Pkc1 explains how only one signaling pathway is
      robustly activated at a time.

TI  - Cortical PAR polarity proteins promote robust cytokinesis during asymmetric cell 
      division.
PG  - 39-49
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201510063 [doi]
AB  - Cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two, is thought to be
      fundamentally similar in most animal cell divisions and driven by the
      constriction of a contractile ring positioned and controlled solely by the
      mitotic spindle. During asymmetric cell divisions, the core polarity machinery
      (partitioning defective [PAR] proteins) controls the unequal inheritance of key
      cell fate determinants. Here, we show that in asymmetrically dividing
      Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the cortical PAR proteins (including the small
      guanosine triphosphatase CDC-42) have an active role in regulating recruitment of
      a critical component of the contractile ring, filamentous actin (F-actin). We
      found that the cortical PAR proteins are required for the retention of anillin
      and septin in the anterior pole, which are cytokinesis proteins that our genetic 
      data suggest act as inhibitors of F-actin at the contractile ring. Collectively, 
      our results suggest that the cortical PAR proteins coordinate the establishment
      of cell polarity with the physical process of cytokinesis during asymmetric cell 
      division to ensure the fidelity of daughter cell formation.

TI  - PML isoform II plays a critical role in nuclear lipid droplet formation.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201507122 [doi]
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) in the nucleus of hepatocyte-derived cell lines were found
      to be associated with premyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) and type 
      I nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR) or the extension of the inner nuclear membrane.
      Knockdown of PML isoform II (PML-II) caused a significant decrease in both
      nuclear LDs and type I NR, whereas overexpression of PML-II increased both.
      Notably, these effects were evident only in limited types of cells, in which a
      moderate number of nuclear LDs exist intrinsically, and PML-II was targeted not
      only at PML NBs, but also at the nuclear envelope, excluding lamins and SUN
      proteins. Knockdown of SUN proteins induced a significant increase in the type I 
      NR and nuclear LDs, but these effects were cancelled by simultaneous knockdown of
      PML-II. Nuclear LDs harbored diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 and
      CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha and incorporated newly synthesized 
      lipid esters. These results corroborated that PML-II plays a critical role in
      generating nuclear LDs in specific cell types.

AB  - Examples of associations between human disease and defects in pre-messenger RNA
      splicing/alternative splicing are accumulating. Although many alterations are
      caused by mutations in splicing signals or regulatory sequence elements, recent
      studies have noted the disruptive impact of mutated generic spliceosome
      components and splicing regulatory proteins. This review highlights recent
      progress in our understanding of how the altered splicing function of RNA-binding
      proteins contributes to myelodysplastic syndromes, cancer, and neuropathologies.

TI  - Synthetic matrices reveal contributions of ECM biophysical and biochemical
      properties to epithelial morphogenesis.
PG  - 113-24
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506055 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial cells cultured within collagen and laminin gels proliferate to form
      hollow and polarized spherical structures, recapitulating the formation of a
      rudimentary epithelial organ. However, the contributions of extracellular matrix 
      (ECM) biochemical and biophysical properties to morphogenesis are poorly
      understood because of uncontrolled presentation of multiple adhesive ligands,
      limited control over mechanical properties, and lot-to-lot compositional
      variability in these natural ECMs. We engineered synthetic ECM-mimetic hydrogels 
      with independent control over adhesive ligand density, mechanical properties, and
      proteolytic degradation to study the impact of ECM properties on epithelial
      morphogenesis. Normal cyst growth, polarization, and lumen formation were
      restricted to a narrow range of ECM elasticity, whereas abnormal morphogenesis
      was observed at lower and higher elastic moduli. Adhesive ligand density
      dramatically regulated apicobasal polarity and lumenogenesis independently of
      cell proliferation. Finally, a threshold level of ECM protease degradability was 
      required for apicobasal polarity and lumen formation. This synthetic ECM
      technology provides new insights into how cells transduce ECM properties into
      complex morphogenetic behaviors.

TI  - Cbx4 maintains the epithelial lineage identity and cell proliferation in the
      developing stratified epithelium.
PG  - 77-89
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201506065 [doi]
AB  - During development, multipotent progenitor cells establish lineage-specific
      programmers of gene activation and silencing underlying their differentiation
      into specialized cell types. We show that the Polycomb component Cbx4 serves as a
      critical determinant that maintains the epithelial identity in the developing
      epidermis by repressing nonepidermal gene expression programs. Cbx4 ablation in
      mice results in a marked decrease of the epidermal thickness and keratinocyte
      (KC) proliferation associated with activation of numerous neuronal genes and
      genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16/p19 and p57). Furthermore,
      the chromodomain- and SUMO E3 ligase-dependent Cbx4 activities differentially
      regulate proliferation, differentiation, and expression of nonepidermal genes in 
      KCs. Finally, Cbx4 expression in KCs is directly regulated by p63 transcription
      factor, whereas Cbx4 overexpression is capable of partially rescuing the effects 
      of p63 ablation on epidermal development. These data demonstrate that Cbx4 plays 
      a crucial role in the p63-regulated program of epidermal differentiation,
      maintaining the epithelial identity and proliferative activity in KCs via
      repression of the selected nonepidermal lineage and cell cycle inhibitor genes.

AB  - Cellular genomes are highly vulnerable to perturbations to chromosomal DNA
      replication. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the processivity factor
      for DNA replication, plays a central role as a platform for recruitment of genome
      surveillance and DNA repair factors to replication forks, allowing cells to
      mitigate the threats to genome stability posed by replication stress. We identify
      the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP as a new factor at active and stressed replication 
      forks that directly interacts with PCNA via a conserved PCNA-interacting peptide 
      (PIP) box motif. We show that TRAIP promotes ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling
      in human cells by facilitating the generation of RPA-bound single-stranded DNA
      regions upon replication stress in a manner that critically requires its E3
      ligase activity and is potentiated by the PIP box. Consequently, loss of TRAIP
      function leads to enhanced chromosomal instability and decreased cell survival
      after replication stress. These findings establish TRAIP as a PCNA-binding
      ubiquitin ligase with an important role in protecting genome integrity after
      obstacles to DNA replication.
