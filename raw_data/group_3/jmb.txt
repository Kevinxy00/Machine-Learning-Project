AB  - Numerous mutations in the corneal protein TGFBIp lead to opaque extracellular
      deposits and corneal dystrophies (CDs). Here we elucidate the molecular origins
      underlying TGFBIp's mutation-induced increase in aggregation propensity through
      comprehensive biophysical and bioinformatic analyses of mutations associated with
      every major subtype of TGFBIp-linked CDs including lattice corneal dystrophy
      (LCD) and three subtypes of granular corneal dystrophy (GCD 1-3). LCD mutations
      at buried positions in the C-terminal Fas1-4 domain lead to decreased stability. 
      GCD variants show biophysical profiles distinct from those of LCD mutations. GCD 
      1 and 3 mutations reduce solubility rather than stability. Half of the 50
      positions within Fas1-4 most sensitive to mutation are associated with at least
      one known disease-causing mutation, including 10 of the top 11 positions. Thus,
      TGFBIp aggregation is driven by mutations that despite their physico-chemical
      diversity target either the stability or solubility of Fas1-4 in predictable
      ways, suggesting straightforward general therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae monothiol glutaredoxin Grx3 plays a key role
      in cellular defense against oxidative stress and more importantly, cooperates
      with BolA-like iron repressor of activation protein Fra2 to regulate the
      localization of the iron-sensing transcription factor Aft2. The interplay among
      Grx3, Fra2 and Aft2 responsible for the regulation of iron homeostasis has not
      been clearly described. Here we solved the crystal structures of the Trx domain
      (Grx3(Trx)) and Grx domain (Grx3(Grx)) of Grx3 in addition to the solution
      structure of Fra2. Structural analyses and activity assays indicated that the Trx
      domain also contributes to the glutathione S-transferase activity of Grx3, via an
      inter-domain disulfide bond between Cys37 and Cys176. NMR titration and pull-down
      assays combined with surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that Fra2
      could form a noncovalent heterodimer with Grx3 via an interface between the
      helix-turn-helix motif of Fra2 and the C-terminal segment of Grx3(Grx), different
      from the previously identified covalent heterodimer mediated by Fe-S cluster.
      Comparative affinity assays indicated that the interaction between Fra2 and Aft2 
      is much stronger than that between Grx3 and Aft2, or Aft2 toward its target DNA. 
      These structural and biochemical analyses enabled us to propose a model how Grx3 
      executes multiple functions to coordinate the regulation of Aft2-controlled iron 
      metabolism.

AB  - Although many putative heme transporters have been discovered, it has been
      challenging to prove that these proteins are directly involved with heme
      trafficking in vivo and to identify their heme binding domains. The prokaryotic
      pathways for cytochrome c biogenesis, Systems I and II, transport heme from
      inside the cell to outside for stereochemical attachment to cytochrome c, making 
      them excellent models to study heme trafficking. System I is composed of eight
      integral membrane proteins (CcmA-H) and is proposed to transport heme via CcmC to
      an external "WWD" domain for presentation to the membrane-tethered heme
      chaperone, CcmE. Herein, we develop a new cysteine/heme crosslinking approach to 
      trap and map endogenous heme in CcmC (WWD domain) and CcmE (defining "2-vinyl"
      and "4-vinyl" pockets for heme). Crosslinking occurs when either of the two vinyl
      groups of heme localize near a thiol of an engineered cysteine residue. Double
      crosslinking, whereby both vinyls crosslink to two engineered cysteines,
      facilitated a more detailed structural mapping of the heme binding sites,
      including stereospecificity. Using heme crosslinking results, heme ligand
      identification, and genomic coevolution data, we model the structure of the
      CcmCDE complex, including the WWD heme binding domain. We conclude that CcmC
      trafficks heme via its WWD domain and propose the structural basis for
      stereochemical attachment of heme.

AB  - Bacteria resist phage infection using multiple strategies, including CRISPR-Cas
      and abortive infection (Abi) systems. Abi systems provide population-level
      protection from phage predation, via "altruistic" cell suicide. It has recently
      been shown that some Abi systems function via a toxin-antitoxin mechanism, such
      as the widespread AbiE family. The Streptococcus agalactiae AbiE system consists 
      of a bicistronic operon encoding the AbiEi antitoxin and AbiEii toxin, which
      function as a Type IV toxin-antitoxin system. Here we examine the AbiEi
      antitoxin, which belongs to a large family of transcriptional regulators with a
      conserved N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix domain. This winged helix-turn-helix
      is essential for transcriptional repression of the abiE operon. The function of
      the AbiEi C-terminal domain is poorly characterized, but it contributes to
      transcriptional repression and is sufficient for toxin neutralization. We
      demonstrate that a conserved charged surface on one face of the C-terminal domain
      assists sequence-specific DNA binding and negative autoregulation, without
      influencing antitoxicity. Furthermore, AbiEi binds cooperatively to two inverted 
      repeats within the abiE promoter and bends the DNA by 72 degrees . These findings
      demonstrate that the mechanism of DNA binding by the widespread family of AbiEi
      antitoxins and transcriptional regulators can contribute to negative
      autoregulation.

TI  - Lyar-Mediated Recruitment of Brd2 to the Chromatin Attenuates Nanog
      Downregulation Following Induction of Differentiation.

AB  - During development, cellular differentiation programs need tight regulation for
      proper display of the activity of multiple factors in time and space. Chromatin
      adaptors of the BET family (Brd2, Brd3, Brd4 and Brdt in vertebrates) are
      transcription co-regulators tightly associated with the progression of the cell
      cycle. A key question regarding their function is whether they work as part of
      the general transcription machinery or, on the contrary, they are precisely
      recruited to the chromatin through specific transcription factors. Here, we
      report the selective recruitment of Brd2 to the chromatin by the transcription
      factor Lyar. We show that Lyar downregulation results in Brd2 dissociation from a
      number of promoters studied. On the contrary, dissociation of BET proteins from
      the chromatin has no effect on Lyar occupancy. Under differentiation conditions, 
      the absence of Lyar leads to impaired downregulation of the pluripotency gene
      Nanog, with concomitant reduction in the upregulation of differentiation markers.
      Interestingly, following the induction of differentiation, Brd2 depletion
      exhibits the same effects as expressing a truncated Lyar molecule lacking the
      Brd2 interacting domain. Both approaches result in stronger Nanog repression,
      indicating that Lyar-mediated recruitment of Brd2 moderates Nanog downregulation 
      when differentiation is triggered. Moreover, expression of truncated Lyar leads
      to impaired differentiation and increased apoptosis. Thus, Lyar-mediated
      recruitment of Brd2 would participate in preserving a proper timing for Nanog
      silencing ensuring the appropriate establishment of the differentiation program.

TI  - Biophysical Analysis of Bacterial CTP Synthase Filaments Formed in the Presence
      of the Chemotherapeutic Metabolite Gemcitabine-5'-triphosphate.

AB  - While enzyme activity is often regulated by a combination of substrate/effector
      availability and quaternary structure, many cytosolic enzymes may be further
      regulated through oligomerization into filaments. Cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) 
      synthase (CTPS) forms such filaments-a process that is promoted by the product
      CTP. The CTP analog and active chemotherapeutic metabolite
      gemcitabine-5'-triphosphate (dF-dCTP) is a potent inhibitor of CTPS; however, its
      effect on the enzyme's ability to form filaments is unknown. Alongside electron
      microscopy studies, dynamic light scattering showed that dF-dCTP induces
      Escherichia coli CTPS (EcCTPS) to form filaments in solution with lengths >/=30
      nm in the presence of CTP or dF-dCTP. The substrate UTP blocks formation of
      filaments and effects their disassembly. EcCTPS variants were constructed to
      investigate the role of CTP-binding determinants in CTP- and dF-dCTP-dependent
      filament formation. Substitution of Glu 149 (i.e., E149D), which interacts with
      the ribose of CTP, caused reduced affinity for both CTP and dF-dCTP, and obviated
      filament formation. Phe 227 appears to interact with CTP through an edge-on
      interaction with the cytosine ring, yet the F227A and F227L variants bound CTP
      and dF-dCTP. F227A EcCTPS did not form filaments, while F227L EcCTPS formed
      shorter filaments in the presence of CTP or dF-dCTP. Hence, Phe 227 plays a role 
      in filament formation, although replacement by a bulky hydrophobic amino acid is 
      sufficient for limited filament formation. That dF-dCTP can induce filament
      formation highlights the fact that nucleotide analogs employed as
      chemotherapeutic agents may affect the filamentous states of enzymes and
      potentially alter their regulation in vivo.

      and Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase.

AB  - Among intrinsically disordered proteins, conditionally disordered proteins
      undergo dramatic structural disorder rearrangements upon environmental changes
      and/or post-translational modifications that directly modulate their function.
      Quantifying the dynamics of these fluctuating proteins is extremely challenging
      but paramount to understanding the regulation of their function. The chloroplast 
      protein CP12 is a model of such proteins and acts as a redox switch by
      formation/disruption of its two disulfide bridges. It regulates the Calvin cycle 
      by forming, in oxidized conditions, a supramolecular complex with
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and then phosphoribulokinase. In
      this complex, both enzymes are inactive. The highly dynamic nature of CP12 has so
      far hindered structural characterization explaining its mode of action. Thanks to
      a synergistic combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic
      resonance and circular dichroism that drove the molecular modeling of structural 
      ensembles, we deciphered the structural behavior of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
      oxidized CP12 alone and in the presence of GAPDH. Contrary to sequence-based
      structural predictions, the N-terminal region is unstable, oscillates at the ms
      timescale between helical and random conformations, and is connected through a
      disordered linker to its C-terminus, which forms a stable helical turn. Upon
      binding to GAPDH, oxidized CP12 undergoes an induced unfolding of its N-terminus.
      This phenomenon called cryptic disorder contributes to decrease the entropy cost 
      and explains CP12 unusual high affinity for its partners.

AB  - LNX1 (ligand of numb protein-X1) is a RING and PDZ domain-containing E3 ubiquitin
      ligase that ubiquitinates human c-Src kinase. Here, we report the identification 
      and structure of the ubiquitination domain of LNX1, the identification of
      Ubc13/Ube2V2 as a functional E2 in vitro, and the structural and functional
      studies of the Ubc13~Ub intermediate in complex with the ubiquitination domain of
      LNX1. The RING domain of LNX1 is embedded between two zinc-finger motifs
      (Zn-RING-Zn), both of which are crucial for its ubiquitination activity. In the
      heterodimeric complex, the ubiquitin of one monomer shares more buried surface
      area with LNX1 of the other monomer and these interactions are unique and
      essential for catalysis. This study reveals how the LNX1 RING domain is
      structurally and mechanistically dependent on other motifs for its E3 ligase
      activity, and describes how dimeric LNX1 recruits ubiquitin-loaded Ubc13 for Ub
      transfer via E3 ligase-mediated catalysis.

AB  - GlnPQ is an ATP-binding cassette importer with a unique domain organization and
      intricate transport behavior. The protein has two extracytoplamic
      substrate-binding domains (SBDs) per membrane subunit, each with different
      specificity for amino acids and different spacing to the translocator domain. We 
      determined the effect of the length and structure of the linkers, which connect
      the SBDs to each other and to the membrane-embedded translocator domain, on the
      transport by GlnPQ. We reveal that varying the linker length impacts transport in
      a dual manner that depends on the conformational dynamics of the SBD. Varying the
      linker length not only changes the time for the SBD to find the translocator
      (docking) but also changes the probability to release the substrate again, thus
      altering the transport efficiency. On the basis of the experimental data and
      mathematical modeling, we calculate the docking efficiency as function of linker 
      length and lifetime of the closed conformation. Importantly, not only linker
      length but also features in the sequence are important for efficient delivery of 
      substrate from SBD to the translocator. We show that the linkers provide a
      platform for SBD docking and are not merely flexible structures.

AB  - Anammox is a bacterial energy metabolic process that forms N2 gas from nitrite
      and ammonium ions. The enzymatic mechanisms of anammox have been gradually
      revealed; however, the electron transport chain in anammox bacteria remains
      poorly understood. In the present study, we purified and characterized two
      low-molecular-weight c-type cytochromes from an enriched culture of the anammox
      bacterium strain, KSU-1. Their genes, KSU1_B0428 and KSU1_C0855, were identified 
      in the KSU-1 genome, and their recombinant proteins were characterized.
      KSU1_B0428 is a typical c-type cytochrome with a His/Met coordinated heme, acting
      as an electron transfer protein. In contrast, KSU1_C0855 could not be assigned as
      a known cytochrome and its heme was suggested to have an uncommon axial ligand
      set. Crystal structural analyses of C0855 clearly showed that its heme iron is
      coordinated by His15 as a fifth ligand. Moreover, the sixth coordination site is 
      occupied by the aromatic ring of Tyr60, and an unassignable electron density that
      is inseparable with that of aromatic carbon of Tyr60 was found. The additional
      electron density was assigned to an O atom by molecular mass analyses. Therefore,
      Tyr60 would be chemically modified to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and bound to the
      Fe atom. We revealed that an anammox bacterium strain KSU-1 expresses a novel
      cytochrome c having an unprecedented His/3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine coordinating

TI  - The Cancer Mutation D83V Induces an alpha-Helix to beta-Strand Conformation
      Switch in MEF2B.

AB  - MEF2B is a major target of somatic mutations in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most of
      these mutations are non-synonymous substitutions of surface residues in the
      MADS-box/MEF2 domain. Among them, D83V is the most frequent mutation found in
      tumor cells. The link between this hotspot mutation and cancer is not well
      understood. Here we show that the D83V mutation induces a dramatic alpha-helix to
      beta-strand switch in the MEF2 domain. Located in an alpha-helix region rich in
      beta-branched residues, the D83V mutation not only removes the extensive helix
      stabilization interactions but also introduces an additional beta-branched
      residue that further shifts the conformation equilibrium from alpha-helix to
      beta-strand. Cross-database analyses of cancer mutations and chameleon sequences 
      revealed a number of well-known cancer targets harboring beta-strand favoring
      mutations in chameleon alpha-helices, suggesting a commonality of such
      conformational switch in certain cancers and a new factor to consider when
      stratifying the rapidly expanding cancer mutation data.

      Impact Experimental Fitness.

AB  - The fitness effects of synonymous mutations can provide insights into biological 
      and evolutionary mechanisms. We analyzed the experimental fitness effects of all 
      single-nucleotide mutations, including synonymous substitutions, at the beginning
      of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene. Many synonymous substitutions
      were deleterious both in bulk competition and for individually isolated clones.
      Investigating protein and RNA levels of a subset of individually expressed HA
      variants revealed that multiple biochemical properties contribute to the observed
      experimental fitness effects. Our results indicate that a structural element in
      the HA segment viral RNA may influence fitness. Examination of naturally evolved 
      sequences in human hosts indicates a preference for the unfolded state of this
      structural element compared to that found in swine hosts. Our overall results
      reveal that synonymous mutations may have greater fitness consequences than
      indicated by simple models of sequence conservation, and we discuss the
      implications of this finding for commonly used evolutionary tests and analyses.

AB  - Plasmid engineering and molecular cloning is a virtually ubiquitous tool in
      biology. Although various methods have been developed for ligating DNA molecules 
      or targeted mutagenesis of plasmids, each has its limitations. Many of the
      commonly used laboratory strategies are inefficient, while commercially available
      kits are quite costly and often specialized for highly specific circumstances.
      Here, we describe the SapI/AarI incision mediated plasmid editing (SIMPLE)
      method, which allows users to perform site-directed mutagenesis, deletions, and
      even short insertions into any plasmid in a single PCR reaction, using just one
      restriction enzyme. Additionally, the SIMPLE method can be adapted to insert any 
      sized DNA fragment into a vector using a two-step PCR approach, and can be used
      to ligate any number of DNA fragments with non-compatible ends in the specific
      order desired. The SIMPLE method provides researches an efficient and powerful
      tool with a broad range of applications for molecular cloning.

      disorder in membrane fission.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30175-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.024 [doi]
AB  - Cellular membranes must undergo remodeling to facilitate critical functions
      including membrane trafficking, organelle biogenesis, and cell division. An
      essential step in membrane remodeling is membrane fission, in which an initially 
      continuous membrane surface is divided into multiple, separate compartments. The 
      established view has been that membrane fission requires proteins with conserved 
      structural features such as helical scaffolds, hydrophobic insertions, and
      polymerized assemblies. In this review we discuss these structure-based fission
      mechanisms and highlight recent findings from several groups that support an
      alternative, structure-independent mechanism of membrane fission. This mechanism 
      relies on lateral collisions among crowded, membrane-bound proteins to generate
      sufficient steric pressure to drive membrane vesiculation. As a stochastic
      process, this mechanism contrasts with the paradigm that deterministic protein
      structures are required to drive fission, raising the prospect that many more
      proteins may participate in fission than previously thought. Paradoxically, our
      recent work suggests that intrinsically disordered domains may be among the most 
      potent drivers of membrane fission, owing to their large hydrodynamic radii and
      substantial chain entropy. This stochastic view of fission also suggests new
      roles for the structure-based fission proteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that
      in addition to driving fission directly, the canonical fission machines may
      facilitate the enrichment and organization of bulky disordered protein domains in
      order to promote membrane fission by locally amplifying protein crowding.

AB  - Soluble huntingtin exon 1 (Httex1) with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) engenders 
      neurotoxicity in Huntington's disease. To uncover the physical basis of this
      toxicity, we performed structural studies of soluble Httex1 for wild type and
      mutant polyQ lengths. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments show evidence for
      conformational rigidity across the polyQ region. In contrast, hydrogen-deuterium 
      exchange shows absence of backbone amide protection, suggesting negligible
      persistence of hydrogen bonds. The seemingly conflicting results are explained by
      all-atom simulations, which show that Httex1 adopts tadpole-like structures with 
      a globular head encompassing the N-terminal amphipathic and polyQ regions and the
      tail encompassing the C-terminal proline-rich region. The surface area of the
      globular domain increases monotonically with polyQ length. This stimulates sharp 
      increases in gain-of-function interactions in cells for expanded polyQ, and one
      of these interactions is with the stress-granule protein Fus. Our results
      highlight plausible connections between Httex1 structure and routes to
      neurotoxicity.

AB  - Mitochondrial respiration results in an electrochemical proton gradient, or
      protonmotive force (pmf), across the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM). The pmf
      is a form of potential energy consisting of charge (psim) and chemical (pH)
      components, that together drive ATP production. In a process called uncoupling,
      proton leak into the mitochondrial matrix independent of ATP production
      dissipates the pmf and energy is lost as heat. Other events can directly
      dissipate the pmf independent of ATP production as well, such as chemical
      exposure or mechanisms involving regulated mitochondrial membrane electrolyte
      transport. Uncoupling has defined roles in metabolic plasticity and can be linked
      through signal transduction to physiologic events. In the latter case, the pmf
      impacts mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Though capable of
      molecular damage, ROS also have signaling properties that depend on the timing,
      location, and quantity of their production. In this review we provide a general
      overview of mitochondrial ROS production, mechanisms of uncoupling, and how these
      work in tandem to affect physiology and pathologies, including: obesity,
      cardiovascular disease, and immunity. Overall, we highlight that isolated
      bioenergetic models-mitochondria and cells-only partially recapitulate the
      complex link between the pmf and ROS signaling that occurs in vivo.

TI  - Supramolecular assembly of human pulmonary surfactant protein SP-D.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30178-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.027 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a glycoprotein from the collectin family
      that is a component of the lung surfactant system. It exhibits host defense and
      immune regulatory functions in addition to contributing to the homeostasis of the
      surfactant pool within the alveolar airspaces. It is known that the SP-D monomer 
      forms trimers, which further associate into higher order oligomers. However, the 
      pathway and the interactions involved in the assembly of SP-D oligomers are not
      clearly understood. In the current study, a recombinant form of full-length human
      SP-D (rhSP-D) has been qualitatively and quantitatively studied by Atomic Force
      Microscopy (AFM) and electrophoresis, with the aim to understand the
      conformational diversity and the determinants defining the oligomerization of the
      protein. The rhSP-D preparation studied is a mixture of trimers, hexamers,
      dodecamers and higher order oligomeric species, with dodecamers accounting for
      more than 50% of the protein by mass. Similar structures were also found in hSP-D
      obtained from proteinosis patients, with the largest fuzzy-ball-like oligomers
      being more abundant in these samples. The proportion of dodecamer is increased
      under acidic conditions, accompanied by a conformational change into more compact
      configurations. Two hexamers appear to be the minimal necessary unit for
      dodecamer formation, with stabilization of the dodecamer occurring via
      non-covalent ionic and hydrophobic interactions between the individual N-terminal
      domains and the proximal area of the SP-D collagen stems.

AB  - Cancer cell lines (CCLs) play an important role in the initial stages of drug
      discovery allowing, among others, for the screening of drug candidates. As cancer
      cell line panels continue to grow in size and diversity, many polymorphisms in
      genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters and drug targets, as well 
      as disease-related genes have been linked to altered drug sensitivity. Yet,
      identifying the correlation between this variability and pharmacological
      responses remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of cancer biology and the 
      intricate interplay between cell lines and drug molecules. Here, we propose a
      network-based strategy that exploits information on gene expression and somatic
      mutations of CCLs to group cells according to their molecular similarity. We then
      identify genes that are characteristic of each cluster and correlate their status
      with drug response. We find that CCLs with similar characteristic active network 
      regions present specific responses to certain drugs, and identify a limited set
      of genes that might be directly involved in drug sensitivity or resistance.

TI  - ClusPro FMFT-SAXS: Ultra-fast filtering using Small Angle X-ray Scattering data
      in protein docking.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30142-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.010 [doi]
AB  - We have recently demonstrated that incorporation of SAXS-based filtering in our
      heavily used docking server ClusPro improves docking results. However, the
      filtering step is time consuming, since approximately 10(5) conformations have to
      be sequentially processed. At the same time we have demonstrated the possibility 
      of ultra-fast systematic energy evaluation for all rigid body orientations of two
      proteins, by sampling using Fast Manifold Fourier Transform (FMFT), if energies
      are represented as a combination of convolution-like expressions. Here we present
      a novel FMFT-based algorithm FMFT-SAXS for massive SAXS computation on multiple
      conformations of a protein complex. This algorithm exploits the convolutional
      form of SAXS calculation function. FMFT-SAXS allows computation of SAXS profiles 
      for millions of conformations in a matter of minutes, providing an opportunity to
      explore the whole conformational space of two interacting proteins. We
      demonstrate the application of the new FMFT-SAXS approach to significantly speed 
      up SAXS filtering step in our current docking protocol (1 to 2 orders of
      magnitude faster, running in several minutes on a modern 16-core CPU) without
      loss of accuracy. This is demonstrated on the benchmark set as well as on the
      experimental data. The new approach is available as a part of ClusPro server
      (https://beta.cluspro.org) and as an open source C library
      (https://bitbucket.org/abc-group/libfmftsaxs).

AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDPs and IDRs) lack well-defined
      tertiary structures, yet carry out various important cellular functions,
      especially those associated with cell signaling and regulation. In eukaryotes,
      IDPs and IDRs contain the preferred loci for both alternative splicing (AS) and
      many post-translational modifications (PTMs). Furthermore, AS and/or PTMs at
      these loci generally alter the signaling outcomes associated with these IDPs or
      IDRs, where the functional cooperation of these three features is named the
      IDP-AS-PTM toolkit. However, the prevalence of such functional modulations
      remains unknown. Also, the signal-altering mechanisms by which AS, and PTMs
      modulate function and the extent to which AS and PTMs collaborate in their
      signaling modulations have not been well defined for particular protein examples.
      Here we focus on three important signaling and regulatory IDR-containing protein 
      families in humans, namely G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are
      transmembrane proteins, the nuclear factors of activated T-cells (NFATs), which
      are transcription factors (TFs), and the Src family kinases (SFKs), which are
      signaling enzymes. The goal here is to determine how AS and PTMs individually
      alter the outcomes of the signaling carried out by the various IDRs and to
      determine whether AS and PTMs work together to bring about differential cellular 
      responses. We also present data indicating that a wide range of other signaling
      IDPs or IDRs undergo both AS- and PTM-based modifications, suggesting that they, 
      too, likely take advantage of signal outcome modulations that result from
      collaboration between these two events. Hence, we propose that the widespread
      cooperation of IDPs, AS and/or PTMs provides a IDP-AS-PTM toolkit and
      substantially contributes to the vast complexity of eukaryotic cell signaling
      systems.

TI  - CRISPys: Optimal sgRNA design for editing multiple members of a gene family using
      the CRISPR system.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30168-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in recent years has made eukaryotic
      genome editing, and specifically gene knockout for reverse genetics, a simple and
      effective task. The system is directed to a genomic target site by a programmed
      single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that base-pairs with it, subsequently leading to
      site-specific modifications. However, many gene families in eukaryotic genomes
      exhibit partially overlapping functions and, thus, the knockout of one gene might
      be concealed by the function of the other. In such cases, the reduced specificity
      of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which may lead to the modification of genomic sites
      that are not identical to the sgRNA, can be harnessed for the simultaneous
      knockout of multiple homologous genes. We introduce CRISPys, an algorithm for the
      optimal design of sgRNAs that would potentially target multiple members of a
      given gene family. CRISPys first clusters all the potential targets in the input 
      sequences into a hierarchical tree structure that specifies the similarity among 
      them. Then, sgRNAs are proposed in the internal nodes of the tree by embedding
      mismatches where needed, such that the efficiency to edit the induced targets is 
      maximized. We suggest several approaches for designing the optimal individual
      sgRNA and an approach to compute the optimal set of sgRNAs for cases when the
      experimental platform allows for more than one. The latter may optionally account
      for the homologous relationships among gene-family members. We further show that 
      CRISPys outperforms simpler alignment-based techniques by in-silico examination
      over all gene families in the Solanum lycopersicum genome.

AB  - Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been established as one of the central
      tools in the structural study of macromolecular complexes. Although intermediate-
      or low-resolution structural information through negative staining (NS) or
      cryo-EM analysis remains highly valuable, we lack general and efficient ways to
      achieve unambiguous subunit identification in these applications. Here, we took
      advantage of the extremely high affinity between a dodecapeptide "PA" tag and the
      NZ-1 antibody Fab fragment to develop an efficient "yeast inner-subunit PA-NZ-1
      labeling" (YISPANL) strategy that when combined with cryo-EM could precisely
      identify subunits in macromolecular complexes. Using this strategy combined with 
      cryo-EM 3D reconstruction, we were able to visualize the characteristic NZ-1 Fab 
      density attached to the PA tag inserted into a surface-exposed loop in the middle
      of the sequence of CCT6 subunit present in the S. cerevisiae group II chaperonin 
      TRiC/CCT. This procedure facilitated the unambiguous localization of CCT6 in the 
      TRiC complex. The PA tag was designed to contain only 12 amino acids and a tight 
      turn configuration; when inserted into a loop, it usually has a high chance of
      maintaining the epitope structure and low likelihood of perturbing the native
      structure and function of the target protein compared to other tagging systems.
      We also found the association between PA and NZ-1 can sustain the cryo freezing
      conditions, resulting in very high occupancy of the Fab in the final cryo-EM
      images. Our study demonstrated the robustness of this strategy combined with
      cryo-EM in efficient and accurate subunit identification in challenging
      multi-component complexes.

AB  - RNA activation (RNAa) is the process of enhancing selective gene expression at
      transcriptional level using double stranded RNAs, targeting gene promoter. These 
      RNA molecules are usually twenty-one nucleotides long and termed as small
      activating RNAs (saRNAs). They are involved in gene regulation, epigenetics
      gain-of-function studies and as have potential therapeutic application for
      various diseases especially cancer. RNAa is opposite to RNA interference (RNAi)
      in functionality however; both processes share some protein machinery. There are 
      many RNAi centered online resources but no one for saRNAs therefore, we developed
      "saRNAdb" database (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/sarna/). It contains 2150
      manually curated saRNA entries with detailed information about their nucleotide
      sequences, activities, corresponding target gene, promoter and other experimental
      data. Besides, saRNA-promoter binding location, predicted saRNA features, tools
      (off-target, map) and RNAa related proteins with their interacting partners are
      provided. saRNAdb is expected to assist in RNA research especially for nucleic
      acid based therapeutics development.

AB  - Phenol-soluble modulin alpha3 (PSMalpha3) is a functional amyloid secreted by the
      pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This 22-residue peptide serves as a
      key virulence determinant, toxic to human cells via the formation of unique
      cross-alpha amyloid-like fibrils. We demonstrate that bilayer vesicles
      accelerated PSMalpha3 fibril formation, and the fibrils, in turn, inserted deeply
      into bilayers mimicking mammalian cell membranes, accounting for PSMalpha3
      cellular toxicity. Importantly, a mere amphipathic helical conformation was not a
      sufficient determinant for membrane-activity of PSMalpha3, pointing to the
      functional role of cross-alpha fibrils. In contrast to deep insertion of
      PSMalpha3 into mammalian membrane bilayers, the peptide only interacted with the 
      surface of bilayers mimicking bacterial membranes, which might be related to its 
      lack of antibacterial activity. Together, our data provide mechanistic insight
      into species-specific toxicity of a key bacterial amyloid virulence factor via
      reciprocal interactions with membranes, and open new perspectives into
      amyloid-related cytotoxicity mediated by helical fibril structures.

AB  - RNase P catalyzes the removal of 5' leaders of tRNA precursors and its central
      catalytic RNA subunit is highly conserved across all domains of life. In
      eukaryotes, RNase P and RNase MRP, a closely related ribonucleoprotein enzyme,
      share several of the same protein subunits, contain a similar catalytic RNA core,
      and exhibit structural features that do not exist in their bacterial or archaeal 
      counterparts. A unique feature of eukaryotic RNase P/MRP is the presence of two
      relatively long and unpaired internal loops within the P3 region of their RNA
      subunit bound by a heterodimeric protein complex, Rpp20/Rpp25. Here we present a 
      crystal structure of the human Rpp20/Rpp25 heterodimer and we propose, using
      comparative structural analyses, that the evolutionary divergence of the
      single-stranded and helical nucleic acid binding specificities of eukaryotic
      Rpp20/Rpp25 and their related archaeal Alba chromatin protein dimers,
      respectively, originate primarily from quaternary level differences observed in
      their heterodimerization interface. Our work provides structural insights into
      how the archaeal Alba protein scaffold was adapted evolutionarily for
      incorporation into several functionally-independent eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein 
      complexes.

AB  - The main NFkappaB transcription factor family members RelA-p50 heterodimer and
      RelA homodimer have different biological functions and show different
      transcriptional activation profiles. To investigate whether the two family
      members adopt a similar conformation in their free states, we performed
      hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS), all-atom molecular
      dynamics (MD) simulations and stopped-flow binding kinetics experiments.
      Surprisingly, the N-terminal DNA binding domains adopt an open conformation in
      RelA-p50 but a closed conformation in RelA homodimer. Both HDXMS and MD
      simulations indicate the formation of an interface between the N-terminal DNA
      binding domains only in the RelA homodimer. Such an interface would be expected
      to impede DNA binding and stopped-flow binding kinetics show that association of 
      DNA is slower for the homodimer as compared to the heterodimer. Our results show 
      that the DNA-binding cavity in the RelA-p50 heterodimer is open for DNA binding
      whereas in the RelA homodimer, it is occluded.

AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is an evolutionary
      conserved pathway that senses signals from nutrients and growth factors to
      regulate cell growth, metabolism and survival. mTOR acts in two biochemically and
      functionally distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), which
      differ in terms of regulatory mechanisms, substrate specificity and functional
      outputs. While mTORC1 signaling has been extensively studied in islet/beta-cell
      biology, recent findings demonstrate a distinct role for mTORC2 in the regulation
      of pancreatic beta-cell function and mass. mTORC2, a key component of the growth 
      factor receptor signaling, is declined in beta cells under diabetogenic
      conditions and in pancreatic islets from patients with type 2 diabetes. beta
      cell-selective mTORC2 inactivation leads to glucose intolerance and acceleration 
      of diabetes as a result of reduced beta-cell mass, proliferation and impaired
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Thereby, many mTORC2 targets, such as AKT, 
      PKC, FOXO1, MST1 and cell cycle regulators, play an important role in beta-cell
      survival and function. This indicates mTORC2 as important pathway for the
      maintenance of beta-cell homeostasis, particularly to sustain proper beta-cell
      compensatory response in the presence of nutrient overload and metabolic demand. 
      This review summarizes recent emerging advances on the contribution of mTORC2 and
      its associated signaling on the regulation of glucose metabolism and functional
      beta-cell mass under physiological and pathophysiological conditions in type 2
      diabetes.

AB  - Protein aggregates result from altered structural conformations and they can
      perturb cellular homeostasis. Prevention mechanisms, which function against
      protein aggregation by modulatory processes, are diverse and redundant. In this
      study, we have characterized Huntingtin interacting protein K (HYPK) as a global 
      aggregation-regulatory protein. We report the mechanistic details of how HYPK's
      aggregation-prone regions allow it to sense and prevent other toxic protein's
      aggregation by forming unique annular-shaped sequestration complexes. Screenings 
      for interacting partners of different aggregation-prone proteins identify HYPK as
      a global interacting partner/regulator of Huntingtin97Qexon1,
      alpha-Synuclein-A53T and Superoxide dismutase1-G93A. C-terminal hydrophobic
      region in HYPK makes direct contacts with aggregates to initiate the formation of
      sequestration complexes. HYPK acts as aggregate sensor by existing in a seeded
      amyloid-like state which also favors its own concentration-dependent
      self-oligomerization. Oligomerization of HYPK leads to annular and
      non-fibrillar/amorphous aggregates. Two hydrophobic segments in the C-terminus of
      HYPK are responsible for its own aggregations. Self-association of HYPK follows
      seed nucleation, in which oligomeric HYPK seeds nucleate to annular structures.
      Annular oligomers of HYPK fuse with each other to form amorphous aggregates. HYPK
      shows differential interactions with aggregation-prone and non-aggregating
      proteins, as it preferentially binds to aggregation-prone proteins with higher
      affinity than native/non-aggregating proteins. This favors the formation of
      HYPK's sequestration complexes both in cytosol and in ribosome. Besides having
      aggregation-preventive property, HYPK also reduces the cellular level of toxic
      proteins. In vivo, HYPK sequestration complexes prevent the formation of toxic
      protein aggregates to physiologically show positive impact on cell survival and
      restoration of normal cell physiology.

AB  - Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is the primary generator of nitric oxide signals
      controlling diverse physiological processes such as neurotransmission and
      vasodilation. NOS activation is contingent on Ca(2+)/calmodulin binding at a
      linker between its oxygenase and reductase domains to induce large conformational
      changes that orchestrate inter-domain electron transfer. However, the structural 
      dynamics underlying activation of full-length NOS remain ambiguous. Employing
      hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we reveal mechanisms underlying
      neuronal NOS activation by calmodulin and regulation by phosphorylation. We
      demonstrate that calmodulin binding orders the junction between reductase and
      oxygenase domains, exposes the FMN subdomain, and elicits a more dynamic
      oxygenase active site. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation partially
      mimics calmodulin activation to modulate neuronal NOS activity via long-range
      allostery. Calmodulin binding and phosphorylation ultimately promote a more
      dynamic holoenzyme while coordinating inter-domain communication and electron
      transfer.

      melliloti: A Class I Sulfatase Specific for an Alkyl Sulfate Ester.

AB  - Hydrolysis of organic sulfate esters proceeds by two distinct mechanisms, water
      attacking at either sulfur (S-O bond cleavage) or carbon (C-O bond cleavage). In 
      primary and secondary alkyl sulfates, attack at carbon is favored, whereas in
      aromatic sulfates and sulfated sugars, attack at sulfur is preferred. This
      mechanistic distinction is mirrored in the classification of enzymes that
      catalyze sulfate ester hydrolysis: arylsulfatases (ASs) catalyze S-O cleavage in 
      sulfate sugars and arylsulfates, and alkyl sulfatases break the C-O bond of alkyl
      sulfates. Sinorhizobium meliloti choline sulfatase (SmCS) efficiently catalyzes
      the hydrolysis of alkyl sulfate choline-O-sulfate (kcat/KM=4.8x10(3)s(-1)M(-1))
      as well as arylsulfate 4-nitrophenyl sulfate (kcat/KM=12s(-1)M(-1)). Its 2.8-A
      resolution X-ray structure shows a buried, largely hydrophobic active site in
      which a conserved glutamate (Glu386) plays a role in recognition of the
      quaternary ammonium group of the choline substrate. SmCS structurally resembles
      members of the alkaline phosphatase superfamily, being most closely related to
      dimeric ASs and tetrameric phosphonate monoester hydrolases. Although >70% of the
      amino acids between protomers align structurally (RMSDs 1.79-1.99A), the
      oligomeric structures show distinctly different packing and protomer-protomer
      interfaces. The latter also play an important role in active site formation.
      Mutagenesis of the conserved active site residues typical for ASs,
      H2(18)O-labeling studies and the observation of catalytically promiscuous
      behavior toward phosphoesters confirm the close relation to alkaline phosphatase 
      superfamily members and suggest that SmCS is an AS that catalyzes S-O cleavage in
      alkyl sulfate esters with extreme catalytic proficiency.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunctions are a known pathogenetic mechanism of a number of
      neurological and psychiatric disorders. At the same time, mutations in genes
      encoding for components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain cause
      mitochondrial diseases, which commonly exhibit neurological symptoms.
      Mitochondria are therefore critical for the functionality of the human nervous
      system. The importance of mitochondria stems from their key roles in cellular
      metabolism, calcium handling, redox and protein homeostasis, and overall cellular
      homeostasis through their dynamic network. Here, we describe how the use of
      pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may help in addressing the physiological and
      pathological relevance of mitochondria for the human nervous system. PSCs allow
      the generation of patient-derived neurons and glia and the identification of
      gene-specific and mutation-specific cellular phenotypes via genome engineering
      approaches. We discuss the recent advances in PSC-based modeling of brain
      diseases and the current challenges of the field. We anticipate that the careful 
      use of PSCs will improve our understanding of the impact of mitochondria in
      neurological and psychiatric disorders and the search for effective therapeutic
      avenues.

AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a multiprotein complex used by bacteria to
      deliver effectors into target cells. The T6SS comprises a bacteriophage-like
      contractile tail structure anchored to the cell envelope by a membrane complex
      constituted of the TssJ outer-membrane lipoprotein and the TssL and TssM
      inner-membrane proteins. TssJ establishes contact with the periplasmic domain of 
      TssM whereas the transmembrane segments of TssM and its cytoplasmic domain
      interact with TssL. TssL protrudes in the cytoplasm but is anchored by a
      C-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH). Here, we show that TssL TMH dimerization is
      required for the stability of the protein and for T6SS function. Using the TOXCAT
      assay and point mutations of the 23 residues of the TssL TMH, we identified
      Thr194 and Trp199 as necessary for TssL TMH dimerization. NMR hydrogen-deuterium 
      exchange experiments demonstrated the existence of a dimer with the presence of
      Trp185 and Trp199 at the interface. A structural model based on molecular dynamic
      simulations shows that TssL TMH dimer formation involves pi-pi interactions
      resulting from the packing of the two Trp199 rings at the C-terminus and of the
      six aromatic rings of Tyr184, Trp185 and Trp188 at the N-terminus of the TMH.

AB  - Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a global public health concern and is
      distinct from other flaviviruses in many aspects, for example, causing
      transplacental infection, fetal abnormalities and vector-independent transmission
      through body fluids in humans. The capsid (C) protein is a multifunctional
      protein, since it binds to viral RNA in the process of nucleocapsid assembly and 
      plays important roles in virus infection processes by interacting with cellular
      proteins, modulating cellular metabolism, apoptosis and immune response. Here we 
      solved the crystal structure of ZIKV C protein at a resolution of 1.9A. The ZIKV 
      C protein structure contains four alpha helices with a long pre-alpha1 loop and
      forms dimers. The unique long pre-alpha1 loop in ZIKV C contributes to the
      tighter association of dimeric assembly and renders a divergent hydrophobic
      feature at the lipid bilayer interface in comparison with the known C structures 
      of West Nile and dengue viruses. We reported the interaction between the ZIKV C
      protein and lipid droplets through confocal microscopy analysis. Substitutions of
      key amino acids in the pre-alpha1 loop of ZIKV C disrupted the interaction with
      lipid droplets, indicating that the loop is critical for membrane association. We
      also recognized that ZIKV C protein possesses broad binding capability to
      different nucleotide types, including single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs or
      DNAs. Furthermore, the highly positively charged interface, mainly formed by
      alpha4 helix, is proposed to be responsible for nucleotide binding. These
      findings will greatly enhance our understanding of ZIKV C protein, providing
      information for anti-ZIKV drug design targeting the C protein.

TI  - Noncritical Signaling Role of a Kinase-Receptor Interaction Surface in the
      Escherichia coli Chemosensory Core Complex.

AB  - In Escherichia coli chemosensory arrays, transmembrane receptors, a histidine
      autokinase CheA, and a scaffolding protein CheW interact to form an extended
      hexagonal lattice of signaling complexes. One interaction, previously assigned a 
      crucial signaling role, occurs between chemoreceptors and the CheW-binding P5
      domain of CheA. Structural studies showed a receptor helix fitting into a
      hydrophobic cleft at the boundary between P5 subdomains. Our work aimed to
      elucidate the in vivo roles of the receptor-P5 interface, employing as a model
      the interaction between E. coli CheA and Tsr, the serine chemoreceptor.
      Crosslinking assays confirmed P5 and Tsr contacts in vivo and their strict
      dependence on CheW. Moreover, the P5 domain only mediated CheA recruitment to
      polar receptor clusters if CheW was also present. Amino acid replacements at
      CheA.P5 cleft residues reduced CheA kinase activity, lowered serine response
      cooperativity, and partially impaired chemotaxis. Pseudoreversion studies
      identified suppressors of P5 cleft defects at other P5 groove residues or at
      surface-exposed residues in P5 subdomain 1, which interacts with CheW in
      signaling complexes. Our results indicate that a high-affinity P5-receptor
      binding interaction is not essential for core complex function. Rather, P5 groove
      residues are probably required for proper cleft structure and/or dynamic
      behavior, which likely impact conformational communication between P5 subdomains 
      and the strong binding interaction with CheW that is necessary for kinase
      activation. We propose a model for signal transmission in chemotaxis signaling
      complexes in which the CheW-receptor interface plays the key role in conveying
      signaling-related conformational changes from receptors to the CheA kinase.

TI  - Network Analysis of UBE3A/E6AP-Associated Proteins Provides Connections to
      Several Distinct Cellular Processes.

AB  - Perturbations in activity and dosage of the UBE3A ubiquitin-ligase have been
      linked to Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorders. UBE3A was initially
      identified as the cellular protein hijacked by the human papillomavirus E6
      protein to mediate the ubiquitylation of p53, a function critical to the
      oncogenic potential of these viruses. Although a number of substrates have been
      identified, the normal cellular functions and pathways affected by UBE3A are
      largely unknown. Previously, we showed that UBE3A associates with HERC2, NEURL4, 
      and MAPK6/ERK3 in a high-molecular-weight complex of unknown function that we
      refer to as the HUN complex (HERC2, UBE3A, and NEURL4). In this study, the
      combination of two complementary proteomic approaches with a rigorous network
      analysis revealed cellular functions and pathways in which UBE3A and the HUN
      complex are involved. In addition to finding new UBE3A-associated proteins, such 
      as MCM6, SUGT1, EIF3C, and ASPP2, network analysis revealed that UBE3A-associated
      proteins are connected to several fundamental cellular processes including
      translation, DNA replication, intracellular trafficking, and centrosome
      regulation. Our analysis suggests that UBE3A could be involved in the control
      and/or integration of these cellular processes, in some cases as a component of
      the HUN complex, and also provides evidence for crosstalk between the HUN complex
      and CAMKII interaction networks. This study contributes to a deeper understanding
      of the cellular functions of UBE3A and its potential role in pathways that may be
      affected in Angelman syndrome, UBE3A-associated autism spectrum disorders, and
      human papillomavirus-associated cancers.

AB  - Central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the assembly of monomeric
      amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) into oligomers and fibers. The most abundant protein
      in the blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid is human serum albumin. Albumin can
      bind to Abeta and is capable of inhibiting the fibrillization of Abeta at
      physiological (muM) concentrations. The ability of albumin to bind Abeta has
      recently been exploited in a phase II clinical trial, which showed a reduction in
      cognitive decline in AD patients undergoing albumin-plasma exchange. Here we
      explore the equilibrium between Abeta monomer, oligomer and fiber in the presence
      of albumin. Using transmission electron microscopy and thioflavin-T fluorescent
      dye, we have shown that albumin traps Abeta as oligomers, 9 nm in diameter. We
      show that albumin-trapped Abeta oligomeric assemblies are not capable of forming 
      ion channels, which suggests a mechanism by which albumin is protective in
      Abeta-exposed neuronal cells. In vivo albumin binds a variety of endogenous and
      therapeutic exogenous hydrophobic molecules, including cholesterol, fatty acids
      and warfarin. We show that these molecules bind to albumin and suppress its
      ability to inhibit Abeta fiber formation. The interplay between Abeta, albumin
      and endogenous hydrophobic molecules impacts Abeta assembly; thus, changes in
      cholesterol and fatty acid levels in vivo may impact Abeta fibrillization, by
      altering the capacity of albumin to bind Abeta. These observations are
      particularly intriguing given that high cholesterol or fatty acid diets are
      well-established risk factors for late-onset AD.

AB  - Huntingtin (HTT) fragments with extended polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts
      self-assemble into amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. Elucidating the fibril
      formation mechanism is critical for understanding Huntington's disease pathology 
      and for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we performed systematic
      experimental and theoretical studies to examine the self-assembly of an
      aggregation-prone N-terminal HTT exon-1 fragment with 49 glutamines (Ex1Q49).
      Using high resolution imaging techniques such as electron microscopy and atomic
      force microscopy, we show that Ex1Q49 fragments in cell-free assays spontaneously
      convert into large, highly complex bundles of amyloid fibrils with multiple ends 
      and fibril branching points. Furthermore, we present experimental evidence that
      two nucleation mechanisms control spontaneous Ex1Q49 fibrillogenesis: (1) a
      relatively slow primary fibril-independent nucleation process, which involves the
      spontaneous formation of aggregation-competent fibrillary structures, and (2) a
      fast secondary fibril-dependent nucleation process, which involves nucleated
      branching and promotes the rapid assembly of highly complex fibril bundles with
      multiple ends. The proposed aggregation mechanism is supported by studies with
      the small molecule O4, which perturbs early events in the aggregation cascade and
      delays Ex1Q49 fibril assembly, comprehensive mathematical and computational
      modelling studies, and seeding experiments with small, preformed fibrillar Ex1Q49
      aggregates that promote the assembly of amyloid fibrils. Together, our results
      suggest that nucleated branching in vitro plays a critical role in the formation 
      of complex fibrillar HTT exon-1 aggregates with multiple ends.

TI  - Some surprising implications of NMR-directed simulations of substrate recognition

AB  - Cytochrome P450cam (CYP101A1) catalyzes the stereospecific 5-exo hydroxylation of
      d-camphor by molecular oxygen. Previously, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs)
      measured for backbone amide (1)H-(15)N correlations in both substrate-free and
      bound forms of CYP101A1 were used as restraints in soft annealing molecular
      dynamics (MD) simulations in order to identify average conformations of the
      enzyme with and without substrate bound. Multiple substrate-dependent
      conformational changes remote from the enzyme active site were identified, and
      site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays confirmed the importance of these
      changes in substrate recognition. The current work makes use of perturbation
      response scanning (PRS) and umbrella sampling MD of the RDC-derived CYP101A1
      structures to probe the roles of remote structural features in enforcing the
      regio- and stereospecific nature of the hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by
      CYP101A1. An improper dihedral angle Psi was defined and used to maintain
      substrate orientation in the CYP101A1 active site, and it was observed that
      different values of Psi result in different PRS response maps. Umbrella sampling 
      methods show that the free energy of the system is sensitive to Psi, and bound
      substrate forms an important mechanical link in the transmission of mechanical
      coupling through the enzyme structure. Finally, a qualitative approach to
      interpreting PRS maps in terms of the roles of secondary structural features is
      proposed.

TI  - A structural ensemble modulation mechanism of small molecule binding to
      disordered proteins.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30162-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.015 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in investigating whether 
      disordered proteins can be targeted for clinical purposes using small molecules
      (Metallo, 2010; Dunker and Uversky, 2010; Heller et al., 2015, 2017a; Michel and 
      Cuchillo, 2012; Zhu et al., 2013; Ban et al., 2017; Csizmok et al., 2016 [1-8]). 
      While small molecule binding to disordered proteins can be seen as unorthodox,
      examples of this phenomenon have been reported. In order to rationalize these
      observations, a variety of models are emerging, sometimes in apparent
      contradiction. Here, we offer a 'structural ensemble modulation' view as an
      attempt to clarify the language, organize concepts, and facilitate the comparison
      of different studies. In doing so, we hope to promote and accelerate the
      understanding of the general principles underlying this phenomenon towards the
      development of novel therapeutic compounds targeting disordered proteins, which
      are prevalent in a wide range of human diseases (Metallo, 2010; Dunker and
      Uversky, 2010; Heller et al., 2015, 2017a; Michel and Cuchillo, 2012; Zhu et al.,
      2013; Ban et al., 2017; Csizmok et al., 2016 [1-8]).

      binding by non-Ig-based antibodies.

AB  - Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) are unconventional adaptive immune receptors
      relatively recently discovered in the phylogenetically ancient jawless
      vertebrates, lamprey and hagfish. VLRs bind antigens using a leucine-rich repeat 
      (LRR) fold and are the only known adaptive immune receptors that do not utilize
      an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold for antigen recognition. While Ig-antibodies have
      been studied extensively, there are comparatively few studies on antigen
      recognition by VLRs, particularly for protein antigens. Here we report isolation,
      functional and structural characterization of three VLRs that bind the protein
      toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) from zebrafish. Two of the VLRs block binding of TLR5
      to its cognate ligand flagellin in functional assays using reporter cells.
      Co-crystal structures revealed that these VLRs bind to two different epitopes on 
      TLR5, both of which include regions involved in flagellin binding. Our work here 
      demonstrates that the lamprey adaptive immune system can be used to generate high
      affinity VLR clones that recognize different epitopes and differentially impact
      natural ligand binding to a protein antigen.

TI  - The adaptor protein ENY2 is a component of the deubiquitination module of the
      Arabidopsis SAGA transcriptional co-activator complex but not of the TREX-2
      complex.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30165-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.018 [doi]
AB  - The conserved nuclear protein ENY2 (Sus1 in yeast) is involved in coupling
      transcription and mRNA export in yeast and metazoa, as it is a component both of 
      the transcriptional co-activator complex SAGA and of the mRNA export complex
      TREX-2. Arabidopsis thaliana ENY2 is widely expressed in the plant and it
      localises to the nucleoplasm, but unlike its yeast/metazoan orthologues it is not
      enriched in the nuclear envelope. Affinity purification of ENY2 in combination
      with mass spectrometry revealed that it co-purified with SAGA components, but not
      with the nuclear pore-associated TREX-2. In addition, further targeted proteomics
      analyses by reciprocal tagging established the composition of the Arabidopsis
      SAGA complex consisting of the four modules HATm, SPTm, TAFm and DUBm, and that
      several SAGA subunits occur in alternative variants. While the HATm, SPTm and
      TAFm robustly co-purified with each other, the de-ubiquitination module (DUBm)
      appears to associate with the other SAGA modules more weakly/dynamically.
      Consistent with a homology model of the Arabidopsis DUBm the SGF11 protein
      interacts directly with ENY2 and UBP22. Plants depleted in the DUBm components,
      SGF11 or ENY2, are phenotypically only mildly affected, but they contain
      increased levels of ubiquitinated histone H2B, indicating that the SAGA-DUBm has 
      histone deubiquitination activity in plants. In addition to transcription-related
      proteins (i.e. transcript elongation factors, Mediator), many splicing factors
      were found to associate with SAGA, linking the SAGA complex and ongoing
      transcription with mRNA processing.

AB  - Tumor metastasis is responsible for ~90% of all cancer deaths. One of the key
      steps of tumor metastasis is tumor cell migration and invasion. Filopodia are
      cell surface extensions that are critical for tumor cell migration. Fascin
      protein is the main actin-bundling protein in filopodia. Small-molecule fascin
      inhibitors block tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Here we present 
      the structural basis for the mechanism of action of these small-molecule fascin
      inhibitors. X-ray crystal structural analysis of a complex of fascin and a fascin
      inhibitor shows that binding of the fascin inhibitor to the hydrophobic cleft
      between the domains 1 and 2 of fascin induces a ~35(o) rotation of domain 1,
      leading to the distortion of both the actin-binding sites 1 and 2 on fascin.
      Furthermore, the crystal structures of an inhibitor alone indicate that the
      conformations of the small-molecule inhibitors are dynamic. Mutations of the
      inhibitor-interacting residues decrease the sensitivity of fascin to the
      inhibitors. Our studies provide structural insights into the molecular mechanism 
      of fascin protein function as well as the action of small-molecule fascin
      inhibitors.

AB  - In this study, we have used the coarse-grained model developed for the
      intrinsically disordered saliva protein (IDP) Histatin 5, on an experimental
      selection of monomeric IDPs, and we show that the model is generally applicable
      when electrostatic interactions dominate the intra-molecular interactions.
      Experimental and theoretically calculated small-angle X-ray scattering data are
      presented in the form of Kratky plots, and discussions are made with respect to
      polymer theory and the self-avoiding walk model. Furthermore, the impact of
      electrostatic interactions is shown and related to estimations of the
      conformational ensembles obtained from computer simulations and
      "Flexible-meccano." Special attention is given to the form factor and how it is
      affected by the salt concentration, as well as the approximation of using the
      form factor obtained under physiological conditions to obtain the structure
      factor.

AB  - Guinier analysis allows model-free determination of the radius of gyration (Rg)
      of a biomolecule from X-ray or neutron scattering data, in the limit of very
      small scattering angles. Its range of validity is well understood for globular
      proteins, but is known to be more restricted for unfolded or intrinsically
      disordered proteins (IDPs). We have used ensembles of disordered structures from 
      molecular dynamics simulations to investigate which structural properties cause
      deviations from the Guinier approximation at small scattering angles. We find
      that the deviation from the Guinier approximation is correlated with the polymer 
      scaling exponent nu describing the unfolded ensemble. We therefore introduce an
      empirical, nu-dependent, higher-order correction term, to augment the standard
      Guinier analysis. We test the new fitting scheme using all-atom simulation data
      for several IDPs and experimental data for both an IDP and a destabilized mutant 
      of a folded protein. In all cases tested, we achieve an accuracy of the inferred 
      Rg within approximately 3% of the true Rg. The method is straightforward to
      implement and extends the range of validity to a maximum qRg of approximately 2
      versus approximately 1.1 for Guinier analysis. Compared with the Guinier or Debye
      approaches, our method allows data from wider angles with lower noise to be used 
      to analyze scattering data accurately. In addition to Rg, our fitting scheme also
      yields estimates of the scaling exponent nu in excellent agreement with the
      reference nu determined from the underlying molecular ensemble.

TI  - The Xenobiotic Extrusion Mechanism of the MATE Transporter NorM_PS from
      Pseudomonas stutzeri.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.012 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) in bacterial pathogens has become a severe threat to
      public health. Membrane transporters of the multidrug and toxic compound
      extrusion (MATE) family contribute critically to MDR, making them promising drug 
      targets. Despite recent advances, structures in different conformations and the
      mechanistic details of their antiport cycle are still elusive. Here we studied
      NorM_PS, a representative MATE transporter from Pseudomonas stutzeri, using
      biochemical assays in combination with hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass
      spectrometry. Our results confirm that the antiport is proton dependent and
      electroneutral with a stoichiometry of two protons per one doubly positively
      charged substrate. We investigated the conformational dynamics upon substrate
      binding, and our hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry analysis revealed 
      an occlusion in the proposed binding site as well as a closure of the cytoplasmic
      cavity and formation of a periplasmic cavity. Together with the results of
      selected variants (D38N, D373N and Q376A), we propose a six-step rocker-switch
      model for NorM_PS, which also increases our understanding of related MATE
      transporters and may help to fight the burden of MDR.

AB  - Activation of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) stimulates cell division and
      tumour growth by modulating the expression of ERalpha target genes. This
      activation involves the recruitment of specific proteins with activities that are
      still not fully understood. Timeless, the human homologue of the Drosophila gene 
      involved in circadian rhythm, was previously shown to be a strong predictor of
      tamoxifen relapse, and is involved in genomic stability and cell cycle control.
      In this study, we investigated the interplay between Timeless and ERalpha, and
      showed that human Timeless is an ERalpha coactivator. Timeless binds to ERalpha
      and enhances its transcriptional activity. Overexpressing Timeless increases
      PARP1 expression, enhances ERalpha-induced gene regulation through the proximal
      LXXLL motif on Timeless protein and ERalpha PARylation. Finally, Timeless is
      recruited with ERalpha on the GREB1 and cMyc promoters. These data, the first to 
      link Timeless to steroid hormone function, provide a mechanistic basis for its
      clinical association with tamoxifen resistance. Thus, our results identify
      Timeless as another key regulator of ERalpha in controlling ERalpha
      transactivation.

AB  - The isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine is the most common type of RNA
      modification found in RNAs across all domains of life and is performed by
      RNA-dependent and RNA-independent enzymes. The Escherichia coli pseudouridine
      synthase RluE acts as a stand-alone, highly specific enzyme forming the
      universally conserved pseudouridine at position 2457, located in helix 89 (H89)
      of the 23S rRNA in the peptidyltransferase center. Here, we conduct a detailed
      structure-function analysis to determine the structural elements both in RluE and
      in 23S rRNA required for RNA-protein interaction and pseudouridine formation. We 
      determined that RluE recognizes a large part of 23S rRNA comprising both H89 and 
      the single-stranded flanking regions which explains the high substrate
      specificity of RluE. Within RluE, the target RNA is recognized through
      sequence-specific contacts with loop L7-8 as well as interactions with loop L1-2 
      and the flexible N-terminal region. We demonstrate that RluE is a faster
      pseudouridine synthase than other enzymes which likely enables it to act in the
      early stages of ribosome formation. In summary, our biochemical characterization 
      of RluE provides detailed insight into the molecular mechanism of RluE forming a 
      highly conserved pseudouridine during ribosome biogenesis.

AB  - The rise of drug-resistant bacterial infections coupled with decreasing
      antibiotic efficacy poses a significant challenge to global health care.
      Acinetobacter baumannii is an insidious, emerging bacterial pathogen responsible 
      for severe nosocomial infections aided by its ability to form biofilms. The
      response regulator BfmR, from the BfmR/S two-component system, is the master
      regulator of biofilm initiation in A. baumannii and is a tractable therapeutic
      target. Here we present the structure of A. baumannii BfmR using a hybrid
      approach combining X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy, chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling. We
      also show that BfmR binds the previously proposed bfmRS promoter sequence with
      moderate affinity. While BfmR shares many traits with other OmpR/PhoB family
      response regulators, some unusual properties were observed. Most importantly, we 
      observe that when phosphorylated, BfmR binds this promoter sequence with a lower 
      affinity than when not phosphorylated. All other OmpR/PhoB family members studied
      to date show an increase in DNA-binding affinity upon phosphorylation.
      Understanding the structural and biochemical mechanisms of BfmR will aid in the
      development of new antimicrobial therapies.

AB  - Solute transport via ATP binding cassette (ABC) importers involves
      receptor-mediated substrate binding, which is followed by ATP-driven
      translocation of the substrate across the membrane. How these steps are exactly
      initiated and coupled, and how much ATP it takes to complete a full transport
      cycle, are subject of debate. Here, we reconstitute the ABC importer GlnPQ in
      nanodiscs and in proteoliposomes and determine substrate-(in)dependent ATP
      hydrolysis and transmembrane transport. We determined the conformational states
      of the substrate-binding domains (SBDs) by single-molecule Forster resonance
      energy transfer measurements. We find that the basal ATPase activity (ATP
      hydrolysis in the absence of substrate) is mainly caused by the docking of the
      closed-unliganded state of the SBDs onto the transporter domain of GlnPQ and
      that, unlike glutamine, arginine binds both SBDs but does not trigger their
      closing. Furthermore, comparison of the ATPase activity in nanodiscs with
      glutamine transport in proteoliposomes shows that the stoichiometry of ATP per
      substrate is close to two. These findings help understand the mechanism of
      transport and the energy coupling efficiency in ABC transporters with covalently 
      linked SBDs, which may aid our understanding of Type I ABC importers in general.

AB  - RNA transcription of mononegavirales decreases gradually from the 3' leader
      promoter toward the 5' end of the genome, due to a decay in polymerase
      processivity. In the respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus, the M2-1
      protein ensures transcription anti-termination. Despite being a homotetramer,
      respiratory syncytial virus M2-1 binds two molecules of RNA of 13mer or longer
      per tetramer, and temperature-sensitive secondary structure in the RNA ligand is 
      unfolded by stoichiometric interaction with M2-1. Fine quantitative analysis
      shows positive cooperativity, indicative of conformational asymmetry in the
      tetramer. RNA binds to M2-1 through a fast bimolecular association followed by
      slow rearrangements corresponding to an induced-fit mechanism, providing a
      sequential description of the time events of cooperativity. The first binding
      event of half of the RNA molecule to one of the sites increases the affinity of
      the second binding event on the adjacent contacting protomer by 15-fold, product 
      of increased effective concentration caused by the entropic link. This mechanism 
      allows for high-affinity binding with an otherwise relaxed sequence specificity, 
      and instead suggests a yet undefined structural recognition signature in the RNA 
      for modulating gene transcription. This work provides a basis for an essential
      event for understanding transcription antitermination in pneumoviruses and its
      counterpart Ebola virus VP30.

AB  - Na(+)/H(+) antiporters have a crucial role in pH and Na(+) homeostasis in cells. 
      The crystal structure of NhaA, the main antiporter of Escherichia coli, has
      provided general insights into antiporter mechanisms and revealed a previously
      unknown structural fold, which has since been identified in several secondary
      active transporters. This unique structural fold is very delicately
      electrostatically balanced. Asp133 and Lys 300 have been ascribed essential roles
      in this balance and, more generally, in the structure and function of the
      antiporter. In this work, we show the multiple roles of Asp133 in NhaA: (i) The
      residue's negative charge is critical for the stability of the NhaA structure.
      (ii) Its main chain is part of the active site. (iii) Its side chain functions as
      an alkaline-pH-dependent gate, changing the protein's conformation from an
      inward-facing conformation at acidic pH to an outward-open conformation at
      alkaline pH, opening the periplasm funnel. On the basis of the experimental data,
      we propose a tentative mechanism integrating the structural and functional roles 
      of Asp133.

AB  - Tyrosine kinases are enzymes playing a critical role in cellular signaling.
      Molecular dynamics umbrella sampling potential of mean force computations are
      used to quantify the impact of activating and inactivating mutations of c-Src
      kinase. The potential of mean force computations predict that a specific double
      mutant can stabilize c-Src kinase into an active-like conformation while
      disabling the binding of ATP in the catalytic active site. The active-like
      conformational equilibrium of this catalytically dead kinase is affected by a
      hydrophobic unit that connects to the hydrophobic spine network via the C-helix. 
      The alphaC-helix plays a crucial role in integrating the hydrophobic residues,
      making it a hub for allosteric regulation of kinase activity and the active
      conformation. The computational free-energy landscapes reported here illustrate
      novel design principles focusing on the important role of the hydrophobic spines.
      The relative stability of the spines could be exploited in future efforts to
      artificially engineer active-like but catalytically dead forms of protein
      kinases.

AB  - Antibiotic chloramphenicol (CHL) binds with a moderate affinity at the peptidyl
      transferase center of the bacterial ribosome and inhibits peptide bond formation.
      As an approach for modifying and potentially improving properties of this
      inhibitor, we explored ribosome binding and inhibitory activity of a number of
      amino acid analogs of CHL. The L-histidyl analog binds to the ribosome with the
      affinity exceeding that of CHL by 10 fold. Several of the newly synthesized
      analogs were able to inhibit protein synthesis and exhibited the mode of action
      that was distinct from the action of CHL. However, the inhibitory properties of
      the semi-synthetic CHL analogs did not correlate with their affinity and in
      general, the amino acid analogs of CHL were less active inhibitors of translation
      in comparison with the original antibiotic. The X-ray crystal structures of the
      Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome in complex with three semi-synthetic analogs
      showed that CHL derivatives bind at the peptidyl transferase center, where the
      aminoacyl moiety of the tested compounds established idiosyncratic interactions
      with rRNA. Although still fairly inefficient inhibitors of translation, the
      synthesized compounds represent promising chemical scaffolds that target the
      peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome and potentially are suitable for
      further exploration.

AB  - p27 mediates cell cycle arrest by binding to and inhibiting cyclin-dependent
      kinase/cyclin complexes, but p27 can also contribute to pro-oncogenic signaling
      upon mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic p27 stimulates cell migration 
      by associating with RhoA and interfering with the exchange of GDP from RhoA
      stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. We used biophysical methods to
      show that the N-terminus of p27 directly interacts with RhoA in vitro. The
      affinity of p27 for RhoA is low, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of
      hundreds of micromolar; however, at high concentrations, p27 interfered with
      guanine nucleotide exchange factor-mediated nucleotide exchange from RhoA. We
      also show that promotion of cell migration in scratch wound cell healing assays
      requires full-length p27 despite the C-terminus being dispensable for the direct 
      interaction between p27 and RhoA in vitro. These results suggest that there may
      be an unidentified factor(s) that associates with the C-terminus of p27 to
      enhance its interactions with RhoA and promote cell migration.

AB  - The CTCF protein has emerged as a key architectural protein involved in genome
      organization. Although hypothesized to initiate DNA looping, direct evidence of
      CTCF-induced DNA loop formation is still missing. Several studies have shown that
      the 11 zinc finger (11 ZF) domain of CTCF is actively involved in DNA binding. We
      here use atomic force microscopy to examine the effect of the 11 ZF domain
      comprising residues 266-579 (11 ZF CTCF) and the 3 ZF domain comprising residues 
      402-494 (6-8 ZF CTCF) of human CTCF on the DNA morphology. Our results show that 
      both domains alter the DNA architecture from the relaxed morphology observed in
      control DNA samples to compact circular complexes, meshes, and networks, offering
      important insights into the multivalent character of the 11 ZF CTCF domain.
      Atomic force microscopy images reveal quasi-circular DNA/CTCF complexes, which
      are destabilized upon replacing the 11 ZF CTCF by the 6-8 ZF CTCF domain,
      highlighting the role of the 11 ZF motif in loop formation. Intriguingly, the
      formation of circular DNA/CTCF complexes is dominated by non-specific binding,
      whereby contour length and height profiles suggest a single DNA molecule twice
      wrapped around the protein.

AB  - Importin4 transports histone H3/H4 in complex with Asf1a to the nucleus for
      chromatin assembly. Importin4 recognizes the nuclear localization sequence
      located at the N-terminal tail of histones. Here, we analyzed the structures and 
      interactions of human Importin4, histones and Asf1a by cross-linking mass
      spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, negative-stain electron microscopy,
      small-angle X-ray scattering and integrative modeling. The cross-linking mass
      spectrometry data showed that the C-terminal region of Importin4 was extensively 
      cross-linked with the histone H3 tail. We determined the crystal structure of the
      C-terminal region of Importin4 bound to the histone H3 peptide, thus revealing
      that the acidic patch in Importin4 accommodates the histone H3 tail, and that
      histone H3 Lys14 contributes to the interaction with Importin4. In addition, we
      show that Asf1a modulates the binding of histone H3/H4 to Importin4. Furthermore,
      the molecular architecture of the Importin4_histone H3/H4_Asf1a complex was
      produced through an integrative modeling approach. Overall, this work provides
      structural insights into how Importin4 recognizes histones and their chaperone
      complex.

AB  - Titin-like kinases are muscle-specific kinases that regulate mechanical sensing
      in the sarcomere. Twitchin kinase (TwcK) is the best-characterized member of this
      family, both structurally and enzymatically. TwcK activity is auto-inhibited by a
      dual intrasteric mechanism, in which N- and C-terminal tail extensions wrap
      around the kinase domain, blocking the hinge region, the ATP binding pocket and
      the peptide substrate binding groove. Physiologically, kinase activation is
      thought to occur by a stretch-induced displacement of the inhibitory tails from
      the kinase domain. Here, we now show that TwcK inhibits its catalysis even in the
      absence of regulatory tails, by undergoing auto-phosphorylation at
      mechanistically important elements of the kinase fold. Using mass spectrometry,
      site-directed mutagenesis and catalytic assays on recombinant samples, we
      identify residues T212, T301, T316 and T401 as primary auto-phosphorylation sites
      in TwcK in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that residue T316, located 
      in the peptide substrate binding P+1 loop, is the dominantly regulatory site in
      TwcK. Based on these findings, we conclude that TwcK is regulated through a
      triple-inhibitory mechanism consisting of phosphorylation and intrasteric
      blockage, which is responsive not only to mechanical cues but also to biochemical
      modulation. This implies that mechanically stretched conformations of TwcK do not
      necessarily correspond to catalytically active states, as previously postulated. 
      This further suggests a phosphorylation-dependent desensitization of the
      TwcK-mediated mechanoresponse of the sarcomere in vivo.

TI  - On the Calculation of SAXS Profiles of Folded and Intrinsically Disordered
      Proteins from Computer Simulations.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30123-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.002 [doi]
AB  - Solution techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) play a central
      role in structural studies of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs); yet, due 
      to low resolution, it is generally necessary to combine SAXS with additional
      experimental sources of data and to use molecular simulations. Computational
      methods for the calculation of theoretical SAXS intensity profiles can be
      separated into two groups, depending on whether the solvent is modeled implicitly
      as continuous electron density or considered explicitly. The former offers
      reduced computational cost but requires the definition of a number of free
      parameters to account for, for example, the excess density of the solvation
      layer. Overfitting can thus be an issue, particularly when the structural
      ensemble is unknown. Here, we investigate and show how small variations of the
      contrast of the hydration shell, deltarho, severely affect the outcome, analysis 
      and interpretation of computed SAXS profiles for folded and disordered proteins. 
      For both the folded and disordered proteins studied here, using a default
      deltarho may, in some cases, result in the calculation of non-representative SAXS
      profiles, leading to an overestimation of their size and a misinterpretation of
      their structural nature. The solvation layer of the different IDP simulations
      also impacts their size estimates differently, depending on the protein force
      field used. The same is not true for the folded protein simulations, suggesting
      differences in the solvation of the two classes of proteins, and indicating that 
      different force fields optimized for IDPs may cause expansion of the polypeptide 
      chain through different physical mechanisms.

TI  - High-Pressure NMR and SAXS Reveals How Capping Modulates Folding Cooperativity of
      the pp32 Leucine-rich Repeat Protein.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.005 [doi]
AB  - Many repeat proteins contain capping motifs, which serve to shield the
      hydrophobic core from solvent and maintain structural integrity. While the role
      of capping motifs in enhancing the stability and structural integrity of repeat
      proteins is well documented, their contribution to folding cooperativity is not. 
      Here we examined the role of capping motifs in defining the folding cooperativity
      of the leucine-rich repeat protein, pp32, by monitoring the pressure- and
      urea-induced unfolding of an N-terminal capping motif (N-cap) deletion mutant,
      pp32-N-cap, and a C-terminal capping motif destabilization mutant
      pp32-Y131F/D146L, using residue-specific NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering.
      Destabilization of the C-terminal capping motif resulted in higher cooperativity 
      for the unfolding transition compared to wild-type pp32, as these mutations
      render the stability of the C-terminus similar to that of the rest of the
      protein. In contrast, deletion of the N-cap led to strong deviation from
      two-state unfolding. In both urea- and pressure-induced unfolding, residues in
      repeats 1-3 of pp32-DeltaN-cap lost their native structure first, while the
      C-terminal half was more stable. The residue-specific free energy changes in all 
      regions of pp32-DeltaN-cap were larger in urea compared to high pressure,
      indicating a less cooperative destabilization by pressure. Moreover, in contrast 
      to complete structural disruption of pp32-DeltaN-cap at high urea concentration, 
      its pressure unfolded state remained compact. The contrasting effects of the
      capping motifs on folding cooperativity arise from the differential local
      stabilities of pp32, whereas the contrasting effects of pressure and urea on the 
      pp32-DeltaN-cap variant arise from their distinct mechanisms of action.

TI  - MetaGO: Predicting Gene Ontology of Non-homologous Proteins Through
      Low-Resolution Protein Structure Prediction and Protein-Protein Network Mapping.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.004 [doi]
AB  - Homology-based transferal remains the major approach to computational protein
      function annotations, but it becomes increasingly unreliable when the sequence
      identity between query and template decreases below 30%. We propose a novel
      pipeline, MetaGO, to deduce Gene Ontology attributes of proteins by combining
      sequence homology-based annotation with low-resolution structure prediction and
      comparison, and partner's homology-based protein-protein network mapping. The
      pipeline was tested on a large-scale set of 1000 non-redundant proteins from the 
      CAFA3 experiment. Under the stringent benchmark conditions where templates with
      >30% sequence identity to the query are excluded, MetaGO achieves average
      F-measures of 0.487, 0.408, and 0.598, for Molecular Function, Biological
      Process, and Cellular Component, respectively, which are significantly higher
      than those achieved by other state-of-the-art function annotations methods.
      Detailed data analysis shows that the major advantage of the MetaGO lies in the
      new functional homolog detections from partner's homology-based network mapping
      and structure-based local and global structure alignments, the confidence scores 
      of which can be optimally combined through logistic regression. These data
      demonstrate the power of using a hybrid model incorporating protein structure and
      interaction networks to deduce new functional insights beyond traditional
      sequence homology-based referrals, especially for proteins that lack homologous
      function templates. The MetaGO pipeline is available at
      http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/MetaGO/.

TI  - Shikimate Induced Transcriptional Activation of Protocatechuate Biosynthesis
      Genes by QuiR, a LysR-Type Transcriptional Regulator, in Listeria monocytogenes.
LID - S0022-2836(18)30125-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.003 [doi]
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a common foodborne bacterial pathogen that contaminates
      plant and animal consumable products. The persistent nature of L. monocytogenes
      is associated with millions of dollars in food recalls annually. Here, we
      describe the role of shikimate in directly modulating the expression of genes
      encoding enzymes for the conversion of quinate and shikimate metabolites to
      protocatechuate. In L. monocytogenes, these genes are found within two operons,
      named qui1 and qui2. In addition, a gene named quiR, encoding a LysR-Type
      Transcriptional Regulator (QuiR), is located immediately upstream of the qui1
      operon. Transcriptional lacZ-promoter fusion experiments show that QuiR induces
      gene expression of both qui1 and qui2 operons in the presence of shikimate.
      Furthermore, co-crystallization of the QuiR effector binding domain in complex
      with shikimate provides insights into the mechanism of activation of this
      regulator. Together these data show that upon shikimate accumulation, QuiR
      activates the transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in shikimate and
      quinate utilization for the production of protocatechuate. Furthermore, the
      accumulation of protocatechuate leads to the inhibition of Listeria growth. Since
      protocatechuate is not known to be utilized by Listeria, its role is distinct
      from those established in other bacteria.

AB  - Secondary multidrug (Mdr) transporters utilize ion concentration gradients to
      actively remove antibiotics and other toxic compounds from cells. The model Mdr
      transporter MdfA from Escherichia coli exchanges dissimilar drugs for protons.
      The transporter should open at the cytoplasmic side to enable access of drugs
      into the Mdr recognition pocket. Here we show that the cytoplasmic rim around the
      Mdr recognition pocket represents a previously overlooked important regulatory
      determinant in MdfA. We demonstrate that increasing the positive charge of the
      electrically asymmetric rim dramatically inhibits MdfA activity and sometimes
      even leads to influx of planar, positively charged compounds, resulting in drug
      sensitivity. Our results suggest that unlike the mutants with the electrically
      modified rim, the membrane-embedded wild-type MdfA exhibits a significant
      probability of an inward-closed conformation, which is further increased by drug 
      binding. Since MdfA binds drugs from its inward-facing environment, these results
      are intriguing and raise the possibility that the transporter has a sensitive,
      drug-induced conformational switch, which favors an inward-closed state.

AB  - Cell signaling depends on spatiotemporally regulated molecular interactions.
      Although the movements of signaling proteins have been analyzed with various
      technologies, how spatial dynamics influence the molecular interactions that
      transduce signals is unclear. Here, we developed a single-molecule method to
      analyze the spatiotemporal coupling between motility, clustering, and signaling. 
      The analysis was performed with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
      which triggers signaling through its dimerization and phosphorylation after
      association with EGF. Our results show that the few EGFRs isolated in membrane
      subdomains were released by an EGF-dependent increase in their diffusion area,
      facilitating molecular associations and producing immobile clusters. Using a
      two-color single-molecule analysis, we found that the EGF-induced state
      transition alters the properties of the immobile clusters, allowing them to
      interact for extended periods with the cytoplasmic protein, GRB2. Our study
      reveals a novel correlation between this molecular interaction and its mesoscale 
      dynamics, providing the initial signaling node.

AB  - The Pup-proteasome system (PPS) is a prokaryotic tagging and degradation system
      analogous in function to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Like ubiquitin,
      Pup is conjugated to proteins, tagging them for proteasomal degradation. However,
      in the PPS, a single Pup-ligase, PafA, conjugates Pup to a wide variety of
      proteins. PafA couples ATP hydrolysis to formation of an isopeptide bond between 
      Pup and a protein lysine via a mechanism similar to that used by glutamine
      synthetase (GS) to generate glutamine from ammonia and glutamate. GS can also
      transfer the glutamyl moiety from glutamine to a hydroxyl amine in an
      ATP-independent manner. Recently, the ability of PafA to transfer Pup from one
      protein to another was demonstrated. Here, we report that such PafA activity
      mechanistically resembles the transferase activity of GS. Both PafA and GS
      transferase activities are ATP-independent and proceed in two catalytic steps. In
      the first step catalyzed by PafA, an inorganic phosphate is used by the enzyme to
      depupylate a Pup donor, while forming an acyl phosphate Pup intermediate. The
      second step consists of Pup conjugation to the new protein, alongside the release
      of an inorganic phosphate. Detailed experimental analysis, combined with kinetic 
      modeling of PafA transferase activity, allowed us to correctly predict the
      kinetics and magnitude of Pup transfer between two targets, and analyze the
      effects of their affinity to PafA on the efficiency of transfer. By deciphering
      the mechanism of the PafA transferase reaction in kinetic detail, this work
      provides in-depth mechanistic understanding of PafA, a key PPS enzyme.

AB  - Alterations of both ecology and functions of gut microbiota are conspicuous
      traits of several inflammatory pathologies, notably metabolic diseases such as
      obesity and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the proliferation of enterobacteria,
      subdominant members of the intestinal microbial ecosystem, has been shown to be
      favored by Western diet, the strongest inducer of both metabolic diseases and gut
      microbiota dysbiosis. The inner interdependence between the host and the gut
      microbiota is based on a plethora of molecular mechanisms by which host and
      intestinal microbes modify each other. Among these mechanisms are as follows: (i)
      the well-known metabolic impact of short chain fatty acids, produced by microbial
      fermentation of complex carbohydrates from plants; (ii) a mutual modulation of
      miRNAs expression, both on the eukaryotic (host) and prokaryotic (gut microbes)
      side; (iii) the production by enterobacteria of virulence factors such as the
      genotoxin colibactin, shown to alter the integrity of host genome and induce a
      senescence-like phenotype in vitro; (iv) the microbial excretion of
      outer-membrane vesicles, which, in addition to other functions, may act as a
      carrier for multiple molecules such as toxins to be delivered to target cells. In
      this review, I describe the major molecular mechanisms by which gut microbes
      exert their metabolic impact at a multi-organ level (the gut barrier being in the
      front line) and support the emerging triad of metabolic diseases, gut microbiota 
      dysbiosis and enterobacteria infections.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of inhibitors of translation termination may inform 
      development of new antibacterials and therapeutics for premature termination
      diseases. We report the crystal structure of the potent termination inhibitor
      blasticidin S bound to the ribosomal 70S*release factor 1 (RF1) termination
      complex. Blasticidin S shifts the catalytic domain 3 of RF1 and restructures the 
      peptidyl transferase center. Universally conserved uridine 2585 in the peptidyl
      transferase center occludes the catalytic backbone of the GGQ motif of RF1,
      explaining the structural mechanism of inhibition. Rearrangement of domain 3
      relative to the codon-recognition domain 2 provides insight into the dynamics of 
      RF1 implicated in termination accuracy.

AB  - RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires four 
      separate factors that recruit Pol I to the promoter to form a pre-initiation
      complex. Upstream Activating Factor (UAF) is one of two multi-subunit complexes
      that regulate pre-initiation complex formation by binding to the ribosomal DNA
      promoter and by stimulating recruitment of downstream Pol I factors. UAF is
      composed of Rrn9, Rrn5, Rrn10, Uaf30, and histones H3 and H4. We developed a
      recombinant Escherichia coli-based system to coexpress and purify
      transcriptionally active UAF complex and to investigate the importance of each
      subunit in complex formation. We found that no single subunit is required for UAF
      assembly, including histones H3 and H4. We also demonstrate that histone H3 is
      able to interact with each UAF-specific subunit, and show that there are at least
      two copies of histone H3 and one copy of H4 present in the complex. Together, our
      results provide a new model suggesting that UAF contains a hybrid H3-H4
      tetramer-like subcomplex.

AB  - The 20S proteasome is a key player in eukaryotic and archaeal protein
      degradation, but its progenitor in eubacteria is unknown. Recently, the ancestral
      beta-subunit protein (Anbu) was predicted to be the evolutionary precursor of the
      proteasome. We crystallized Anbu from Hyphomicrobium sp. strain MC1 in four
      different space groups and solved the structures by SAD-phasing and Patterson
      search calculation techniques. Our data reveal that Anbu adopts the classical
      fold of Ntn-hydrolases, but its oligomeric state differs from that of
      barrel-shaped proteases. In contrast to their typical architecture, the Anbu
      protomer is a tightly interacting dimer that can assemble into a helical
      superstructure. Although Anbu features a catalytic triad of Thr1O(gamma),
      Asp17O(delta1) and Lys32N(epsilon), it is unable to hydrolyze standard protease
      substrates. The lack of activity might be caused by the incapacity of Thr1NH2 to 
      function as a Bronsted acid during substrate cleavage due to its missing
      activation via hydrogen bonding. Altogether, we demonstrate that the topology of 
      the proteasomal fold is conserved in Anbu, but whether it acts as a protease
      still needs to be clarified.

AB  - Influenza viral entry into the host cell cytoplasm is accomplished by a process
      of membrane fusion mediated by the viral hemagglutinin protein. Hemagglutinin
      acts in a pH-triggered fashion, inserting a short fusion peptide into the host
      membrane followed by refolding of a coiled-coil structure to draw the viral
      envelope and host membranes together. Mutations to this fusion peptide provide an
      important window into viral fusion mechanisms and protein-membrane interactions. 
      Here, we show that a well-described fusion peptide mutant, G1S, has a phenotype
      that depends strongly on the viral membrane context. The G1S mutant is well known
      to cause a "hemifusion" phenotype based on experiments in transfected cells,
      where cells expressing G1S hemagglutinin can undergo lipid mixing in a
      pH-triggered fashion similar to virus but will not support fusion pores. We
      compare fusion by the G1S hemagglutinin mutant expressed either in cells or in
      influenza virions and show that this hemifusion phenotype occurs in transfected
      cells but that native virions are able to support full fusion, albeit at a slower
      rate and 10-100x reduced infectious titer. We explain this with a quantitative
      model where the G1S mutant, instead of causing an absolute block of fusion,
      alters the protein stoichiometry required for fusion. This change slightly slows 
      fusion at high hemagglutinin density, as on the viral surface, but at lower
      hemagglutinin density produces a hemifusion phenotype. The quantitative model
      thus reproduces the observed virus-cell and cell-cell fusion phenotypes, yielding
      a unified explanation where membrane context can control the observed viral
      fusion phenotype.

AB  - The molecular basis of polyspecificity of Mdr1p, a major drug/H(+) antiporter of 
      Candida albicans, is not elucidated. We have probed the nature of the
      drug-binding pocket by performing systematic mutagenesis of the 12 transmembrane 
      segments. Replacement of the 252 amino acid residues with alanine or glycine
      yielded 2/3 neutral mutations while 1/3 led to the complete or selective loss of 
      resistance to drugs or substrates transported by the pump. Using the GlpT-based
      3D-model of Mdr1p, we roughly categorized these critical residues depending on
      their type and localization, 1 degrees / main structural impact ("S" group), 2
      degrees / exposure to the lipid interface ("L" group), 3 degrees / buried but not
      facing the main central pocket, inferred as critical for the overall H(+)/drug
      antiport mechanism ("M" group) and finally 4 degrees / buried and facing the main
      central pocket ("B" group). Among "B" category, 13 residues were essential for
      the large majority of drugs/substrates, while 5 residues were much
      substrate-specific, suggesting a role in governing polyspecificity (P group). 3D 
      superposition of the substrate-specific MFS Glut1 and XylE with the MDR
      substrate-polyspecific MdfA and Mdr1p revealed that the B group forms a common
      substrate interaction core while the P group is only found in the 2 MDR MFS
      transporters, distributed into 3 areas around the B core. This specific pattern
      has let us to propose that the structural basis for polyspecificity of MDR MFS
      transporters is the extended capacity brought by residues located at the
      periphery of a binding core to accomodate compounds differing in size and type.

AB  - Enveloped viruses enter cells by using their fusion proteins to merge the virus
      lipid envelope and the cell membrane. While crystal structures of the
      water-soluble ectodomains of many viral fusion proteins have been determined, the
      structure and assembly of the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) remains
      poorly understood. Here we use solid-state NMR to determine the backbone
      conformation and oligomeric structure of the TMD of the parainfluenza virus 5
      fusion protein. (13)C chemical shifts indicate that the central leucine-rich
      segment of the TMD is alpha-helical in POPC/cholesterol membranes and POPE
      membranes, while the Ile- and Val-rich termini shift to the beta-strand
      conformation in the POPE membrane. Importantly, lipid mixing assays indicate that
      the TMD is more fusogenic in the POPE membrane than in the POPC/cholesterol
      membrane, indicating that the beta-strand conformation is important for fusion by
      inducing membrane curvature. Incorporation of para-fluorinated Phe at three
      positions of the alpha-helical core allowed us to measure interhelical distances 
      using (19)F spin diffusion NMR. The data indicate that, at peptide:lipid molar
      ratios of ~1:15, the TMD forms a trimeric helical bundle with inter-helical
      distances of 8.2-8.4A for L493F and L504F and 10.5A for L500F. These data provide
      high-resolution evidence of trimer formation of a viral fusion protein TMD in
      phospholipid bilayers, and indicate that the parainfluenza virus 5 fusion protein
      TMD harbors two functions: the central alpha-helical core is the trimerization
      unit of the protein, while the two termini are responsible for inducing membrane 
      curvature by transitioning to a beta-sheet conformation.

AB  - Pin1 is a two-domain human protein that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of 
      phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro (pS/T-P) motifs in numerous cell-cycle regulatory proteins.
      These pS/T-P motifs bind to Pin1's peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain in a
      catalytic pocket, between an extended catalytic loop and the PPIase domain core. 
      Previous studies showed that post-translational phosphorylation of S71 in the
      catalytic loop decreases substrate binding affinity and isomerase activity. To
      define the origins for these effects, we investigated a phosphomimetic Pin1
      mutant, S71E-Pin1, using solution NMR. We find that S71E perturbs not only its
      host loop but also the nearby PPIase core. The perturbations identify a local
      network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that is more extended than previously 
      thought, and includes interactions between the catalytic loop and the
      alpha2/alpha3 turn in the PPIase core. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics
      simulations and phylogenetic analysis suggest that these interactions act as
      conserved "latches" between the loop and PPIase core that enhance binding of
      phosphorylated substrates, as they are absent in PPIases lacking pS/T-P
      specificity. Our results suggest that S71 is a hub residue within an
      electrostatic network primed for phosphorylation, and may illustrate a common
      mechanism of phosphorylation-mediated allostery.

AB  - The function of ubiquitous 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs) can be converted
      alternatively from peroxidases to molecular chaperones. This conversion has been 
      reported to occur by the formation of high-molecular-weight (HMW) complexes upon 
      overoxidation of or ATP/ADP binding to 2-Cys Prxs, but its mechanism is not well 
      understood. Here, we show that upon binding to phosphatidylserine or
      phosphatidylglycerol dimeric human 2-Cys PrxII (hPrxII) is assembled to
      trefoil-shaped small oligomers (possibly hexamers) with full chaperone and null
      peroxidase activities. Spherical HMW complexes are formed, only when
      phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol is bound to overoxidized or
      ATP/ADP-bound hPrxII. The spherical HMW complexes are lipid vesicles covered with
      trefoil-shaped oligomers arranged in a hexagonal lattice pattern. Thus, these
      lipids with a net negative charge, which can be supplied by increased membrane
      trafficking under oxidative stress, are essential for the structural and
      functional switch of hPrxII and possibly most 2-Cys Prxs.

AB  - Architectural DNA-binding proteins function to regulate diverse DNA reactions and
      have the defining property of significantly changing DNA conformation. Although
      the 1D movement along DNA by other types of DNA-binding proteins has been
      visualized, the mobility of architectural DNA-binding proteins on DNA remains
      unknown. Here, we applied single-molecule fluorescence imaging on arrays of
      extended DNA molecules to probe the binding dynamics of three structurally
      distinct architectural DNA-binding proteins: Nhp6A, HU, and Fis. Each of these
      proteins was observed to move along DNA, and the salt concentration independence 
      of the 1D diffusion implies sliding with continuous contact to DNA. Nhp6A and HU 
      exhibit a single sliding mode, whereas Fis exhibits two sliding modes. Based on
      comparison of the diffusion coefficients and sizes of many DNA binding proteins, 
      the architectural proteins are categorized into a new group distinguished by an
      unusually high free-energy barrier for 1D diffusion. The higher free-energy
      barrier for 1D diffusion by architectural proteins can be attributed to the large
      DNA conformational changes that accompany binding and impede rotation-coupled
      movement along the DNA grooves.

TI  - Tryptophan-Mediated Interactions between Tristetraprolin and the CNOT9 Subunit
      Are Required for CCR4-NOT Deadenylase Complex Recruitment.

AB  - The zinc-finger protein tristetraprolin (TTP) binds to AU-rich elements present
      in the 3' untranslated regions of transcripts that mainly encode proteins of the 
      inflammatory response. TTP-bound mRNAs are targeted for destruction via
      recruitment of the eight-subunit deadenylase complex "carbon catabolite repressor
      protein 4 (CCR4)-negative on TATA-less (NOT)," which catalyzes the removal of
      mRNA poly-(A) tails, the first obligatory step in mRNA decay. Here we show that a
      novel interaction between TTP and the CCR4-NOT subunit, CNOT9, is required for
      recruitment of the deadenylase complex. In addition to CNOT1, CNOT9 is now
      included in the identified CCR4-NOT subunits shown to interact with TTP. We find 
      that both the N- and C-terminal domains of TTP are involved in an interaction
      with CNOT9. Through a combination of SPOT peptide array, site-directed
      mutagenesis, and bio-layer interferometry, we identified several conserved
      tryptophan residues in TTP that serve as major sites of interaction with two
      tryptophan-binding pockets of CNOT9, previously found to interact with another
      modulator GW182. We further demonstrate that these interactions are also required
      for recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex and TTP-directed decay of an mRNA
      containing an AU-rich element in its 3'-untranslated region. Together the results
      reveal new molecular details for the TTP-CNOT interaction that shape an emerging 
      mechanism whereby TTP targets inflammatory mRNAs for deadenylation and decay.

AB  - Microfluidics has the potential to transform experimental approaches across the
      life sciences. In this review, we discuss recent advances enabled by the
      development and application of microfluidic approaches to protein biophysics. We 
      focus on areas where key fundamental features of microfluidics open up new
      possibilities and present advantages beyond low volumes and short time-scale
      analysis, conventionally provided by microfluidics. We discuss the two most
      commonly used forms of microfluidic technology, single-phase laminar flow and
      multiphase microfluidics. We explore how the understanding and control of the
      characteristic physical features of the microfluidic regime, the integration of
      microfluidics with orthogonal systems and the generation of well-defined
      microenvironments can be used to develop novel devices and methods in protein
      biophysics for sample manipulation, functional and structural studies, detection 
      and material processing.

      (pseudo)symmetric multimers.

AB  - Ancestral beta-subunit (Anbu) is homologous to HslV and 20S proteasomes. Based on
      its phylogenetic distribution and sequence clustering, Anbu has been proposed as 
      the "ancestral" form of proteasomes. Here, we report biochemical data,
      small-angle X-ray scattering results, negative-stain electron microscopy
      micrographs and a crystal structure of the Anbu particle from Yersinia bercovieri
      (YbAnbu). All data are consistent with YbAnbu forming defined 12-14 subunit
      multimers that differ in shape from both HslV and 20S proteasomes. The crystal
      structure reveals that YbAnbu subunits form tight dimers, held together in part
      by the Anbu specific C-terminal helices. These dimers ("protomers") further
      assemble into a low-rise left-handed staircase. The lock-washer shape of YbAnbu
      is consistent with the presence of defined multimers, X-ray diffraction data in
      solution and negative-stain electron microscopy images. The presented structure
      suggests a possible evolutionary pathway from helical filaments to highly
      symmetric or pseudosymmetric multimer structures. YbAnbu subunits have the
      Ntn-hydrolase fold, a putative S1 pocket and conserved candidate catalytic
      residues Thr1, Asp17 and Lys32(33). Nevertheless, we did not detect any YbAnbu
      peptidase or amidase activity. However, we could document orthophosphate
      production from ATP catalyzed by the ATP-grasp protein encoded in the Y.

AB  - Cellular organisms in different domains of life employ structurally unrelated,
      non-homologous DNA primases for synthesis of a primer for DNA replication.
      Archaea and eukaryotes encode enzymes of the archaeo-eukaryotic primase (AEP)
      superfamily, whereas bacteria uniformly use primases of the DnaG family. However,
      AEP genes are widespread in bacterial genomes raising questions regarding their
      provenance and function. Here, using an archaeal primase-polymerase PolpTN2
      encoded by pTN2 plasmid as a seed for sequence similarity searches, we recovered 
      over 800 AEP homologs from bacteria belonging to 12 highly diverse phyla. These
      sequences formed a supergroup, PrimPol-PV1, and could be classified into five
      novel AEP families which are characterized by a conserved motif containing an
      arginine residue likely to be involved in nucleotide binding. Functional assays
      confirm the essentiality of this motif for catalytic activity of the PolpTN2
      primase-polymerase. Further analyses showed that bacterial AEPs display a range
      of domain organizations and uncovered several candidates for novel families of
      helicases. Furthermore, sequence and structure comparisons suggest that PriCT-1
      and PriCT-2 domains frequently fused to the AEP domains are related to each other
      as well as to the non-catalytic, large subunit of archaeal and eukaryotic
      primases, and to the recently discovered PriX subunit of archaeal primases.
      Finally, genomic neighborhood analysis indicates that the identified AEPs encoded
      in bacterial genomes are nearly exclusively associated with highly diverse
      integrated mobile genetic elements, including integrative conjugative plasmids
      and prophages.

TI  - Fuzziness in Protein Interactions-A Historical Perspective.

AB  - The proposal that coupled folding to binding is not an obligatory mechanism for
      intrinsically disordered (ID) proteins was put forward 10 years ago. The notion
      of fuzziness implies that conformational heterogeneity can be maintained upon
      interactions of ID proteins, which has a functional impact either on regulated
      assembly or activity of the corresponding complexes. Here I review how the
      concept has evolved in the past decade, via increasing experimental data
      providing insights into the mechanisms, pathways and regulatory modes. The
      effects of structural diversity and transient contacts on protein assemblies have
      been collected and systematically analyzed (Fuzzy Complexes Database,

AB  - Single-molecule fluorescence has the unique ability to quantify small oligomers
      and track conformational changes at a single-protein level. Here we tackled one
      of the most extreme protein behaviors, found recently in an inflammation pathway.
      Upon danger recognition in the cytosol, NLRP3 recruits its signaling adaptor,
      ASC. ASC start polymerizing in a prion-like manner and the system goes in
      "overdrive" by producing a single micron-sized "speck." By precisely controlling 
      protein expression levels in an in vitro translation system, we could trigger the
      polymerization of ASC and mimic formation of specks in the absence of
      inflammasome nucleators. We utilized single-molecule spectroscopy to fully
      characterize prion-like behaviors and self-propagation of ASC fibrils. We next
      used our controlled system to monitor the conformational changes of ASC upon
      fibrillation. Indeed, ASC consists of a PYD and CARD domains, separated by a
      flexible linker. Individually, both domains have been found to form fibrils, but 
      the structure of the polymers formed by the full-length ASC proteins remains
      elusive. For the first time, using single-molecule Forster resonance energy
      transfer, we studied the relative positions of the CARD and PYD domains of
      full-length ASC. An unexpectedly large conformational change occurred upon ASC
      fibrillation, suggesting that the CARD domain folds back onto the PYD domain.
      However, contradicting current models, the "prion-like" conformer was not
      initiated by binding of ASC to the NLRP3 platform. Rather, using a new method,
      hybrid between Photon Counting Histogram and Number and Brightness analysis, we
      showed that NLRP3 forms hexamers with self-binding affinities around 300nM.
      Overall our data suggest a new mechanism, where NLRP3 can initiate ASC
      polymerization simply by increasing the local concentration of ASC above a
      supercritical level.

AB  - Proteins fold on timescales from hours to microseconds. In addition to protein
      size, sequence, and topology, the environment represents an equally important
      factor in determining folding speed. This is particularly relevant for proteins
      that require a lipid membrane or a membrane mimic to fold. However, only little
      is known about how properties of such a hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface
      modulate the folding landscape of membrane-interacting proteins. Here, we studied
      the influence of different membrane-mimetic micellar environments on the folding 
      and unfolding kinetics of the helical-bundle protein Mistic. Devising a
      single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy approach, we extracted folding and
      unfolding rates under equilibrium conditions and dissected the contributions from
      different detergent moieties to the free-energy landscape. While both polar and
      nonpolar moieties contribute to stability, they exert differential effects on the
      free-energy barrier: Hydrophobic burial stabilizes the folded state but not the
      transition state in reference to a purely aqueous environment; by contrast,
      zwitterionic headgroup moieties stabilize the folded state and, additionally,
      lower the free-energy barrier to accelerate the folding of Mistic to achieve
      ultrafast folding times down to 35mus.

AB  - Living cells contain diverse biopolymers, creating a heterogeneous crowding
      environment, the impact of which on RNA folding is poorly understood. Here, we
      have used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor
      tertiary structure formation of the hairpin ribozyme as a model to probe the
      effects of polyethylene glycol and yeast cell extract as crowding agents. As
      expected, polyethylene glycol stabilizes the docked, catalytically active state
      of the ribozyme, in part through excluded volume effects; unexpectedly, we found 
      evidence that it additionally displays soft, non-specific interactions with the
      ribozyme. Yeast extract has a profound effect on folding at protein
      concentrations 1000-fold lower than found intracellularly, suggesting the
      dominance of specific interactions over volume exclusion. Gel shift assays and
      affinity pull-down followed by mass spectrometry identified numerous
      non-canonical RNA-binding proteins that stabilize ribozyme folding; the apparent 
      chaperoning activity of these ubiquitous proteins significantly compensates for
      the low-counterion environment of the cell.

AB  - In yeast, the U2 small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA) component of the
      spliceosome is targeted for additional post-transcriptional modifications in
      response to cellular stress. Uridines 56 and 93 are both modified to
      pseudouridines (Psi) during nutrient deprivation, while U56 is also
      pseudouridylated during heat shock. Both positions are located within stem II,
      which must toggle between two mutually exclusive structures during splicing. Stem
      IIa forms during spliceosome assembly, and stem IIc forms during the catalytic
      steps. We have studied how uridine 56 and 93 pseudouridylation impacts
      conformational switching of stem II. Using single-molecule Forster resonance
      energy transfer, we show that Psi56 dampens conformational dynamics of stem II
      and stabilizes stem IIc. In contrast, Psi93 increases dynamics of non-stem IIc
      conformations. Pseudouridylation impacts conformational switching of stem II by
      Mg(2+) or the U2 protein Cus2; however, when Mg(2+) and Cus2 are used in
      combination, the impacts of pseudouridylation can be suppressed. These results
      show that stress-induced post-transcriptional modification of U56 and U93 alters 
      snRNA conformational dynamics by distinct mechanisms and that protein and metal
      cofactors of the spliceosome alter how snRNAs respond to these modifications.

      N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins into a
      parallel four-helix bundle to drive membrane fusion. SNARE assembly occurs by
      stepwise zippering of the vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE) onto a binary SNARE 
      complex on the target plasma membrane (t-SNARE). Zippering begins with slow
      N-terminal association followed by rapid C-terminal zippering, which serves as a 
      power stroke to drive membrane fusion. SNARE mutations have been associated with 
      numerous diseases, especially neurological disorders. It remains unclear how
      these mutations affect SNARE zippering, partly due to difficulties to quantify
      the energetics and kinetics of SNARE assembly. Here, we used single-molecule
      optical tweezers to measure the assembly energy and kinetics of SNARE complexes
      containing single mutations I67T/N in neuronal SNARE synaptosomal-associated
      protein of 25kDa (SNAP-25B), which disrupt neurotransmitter release and have been
      implicated in neurological disorders. We found that both mutations significantly 
      reduced the energy of C-terminal zippering by ~10 kBT, but did not affect
      N-terminal assembly. In addition, we observed that both mutations lead to
      unfolding of the C-terminal region in the t-SNARE complex. Our findings suggest
      that both SNAP-25B mutations impair synaptic exocytosis by destabilizing SNARE
      assembly, rather than stabilizing SNARE assembly as previously proposed.
      Therefore, our measurements provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the 
      disease caused by SNARE mutations.

AB  - Proteins, which behave as random coils in high denaturant concentrations undergo 
      collapse transition similar to polymers on denaturant dilution. We study collapse
      in the denatured ensemble of single-chain monellin (MNEI) using a coarse-grained 
      protein model and molecular dynamics simulations. The model is validated by
      quantitatively comparing the computed guanidinium chloride and pH-dependent
      thermodynamic properties of MNEI folding with the experiments. The computed
      properties such as the fraction of the protein in the folded state and radius of 
      gyration (Rg) as function of [GuHCl] are in good agreement with the experiments. 
      The folded state of MNEI is destabilized with an increase in pH due to the
      deprotonation of the residues Glu24 and Cys42. On decreasing [GuHCl], the protein
      in the unfolded ensemble showed specific compaction. The Rg of the protein
      decreased steadily with [GuHCl] dilution due to increase in the number of native 
      contacts in all the secondary structural elements present in the protein. MNEI
      folding kinetics is complex with multiple folding pathways and transiently stable
      intermediates are populated in these pathways. In strong stabilizing conditions, 
      the protein in the unfolded ensemble showed transition to a more compact unfolded
      state where Rg decreased by approximately 17% due to the formation of specific
      native contacts in the protein. The intermediate populated in the dominant MNEI
      folding pathway satisfies the structural features of the dry molten globule
      inferred from experiments.

AB  - Chaperones assist in protein folding, but what this common phrase means in
      concrete terms has remained surprisingly poorly understood. We can readily
      measure chaperone binding to unfolded proteins, but how they bind and affect
      proteins along folding trajectories has remained obscure. Here we review recent
      efforts by our labs and others that are beginning to pry into this issue, with a 
      focus on the chaperones trigger factor and Hsp70. Single-molecule methods are
      central, as they allow the stepwise process of folding to be followed directly.
      First results have already revealed contrasts with long-standing paradigms:
      rather than acting only "early" by stabilizing unfolded chain segments, these
      chaperones can bind and stabilize partially folded structures as they grow to
      their native state. The findings suggest a fundamental redefinition of the
      protein folding problem and a more extensive functional repertoire of chaperones 
      than previously assumed.

      Unfolding: The Effect of Force, Temperature, and Urea.

AB  - While it is widely appreciated that the denatured state of a protein is a
      heterogeneous conformational ensemble, there is still debate over how this
      ensemble changes with environmental conditions. Here, we use single-molecule
      chemo-mechanical unfolding, which combines force and urea using the optical
      tweezers, together with traditional protein unfolding studies to explore how
      perturbants commonly used to unfold proteins (urea, force, and temperature)
      affect the denatured-state ensemble. We compare the urea m-values, which report
      on the change in solvent accessible surface area for unfolding, to probe the
      denatured state as a function of force, temperature, and urea. We find that while
      the urea- and force-induced denatured states expose similar amounts of surface
      area, the denatured state at high temperature and low urea concentration is more 
      compact. To disentangle these two effects, we use destabilizing mutations that
      shift the Tm and Cm. We find that the compaction of the denatured state is
      related to changing temperature as the different variants of acyl-coenzyme A
      binding protein have similar m-values when they are at the same temperature but
      different urea concentration. These results have important implications for
      protein folding and stability under different environmental conditions.

AB  - HIV-1 requires a specialized nuclear export pathway to transport unspliced and
      partially spliced viral transcripts to the cytoplasm. Central to this pathway is 
      the viral protein Rev, which binds to the Rev response element in stem IIB
      located on unspliced viral transcripts and subsequently oligomerizes in a
      cooperative manner. Previous work identified a number of cellular DEAD-box
      helicases as in vivo binding partners of Rev, and siRNA experiments indicated a
      functional role for many in the HIV replication cycle. Two DEAD-box proteins,
      DDX1 and DDX3, had previously been shown to play a role in HIV pathogenesis. In
      this study, another protein identified in that screen, DDX21, is tested for
      protein and RNA binding and subsequent enzymatic activities in the context of the
      Rev/RRE pathway. We found that DDX21 can bind to the RRE with high affinity, and 
      this binding stimulates ATPase activity with an enzymatic efficiency similar to
      DDX1. Furthermore, DDX21 is both an ATP-dependent and ATP-independent helicase,
      and both ATPase and ATP-dependent helicase activities are inhibited by Rev in a
      dose-dependent manner, although ATP-independent helicase activity is not. A
      conserved binding interaction between DDX protein's DEAD domain and Rev was
      identified, with Rev's nuclear diffusion inhibitory signal motif playing a
      significant role in binding. Finally, DDX21 was shown to enhance Rev binding to
      the RRE in a manner similar to that previously described for DDX1, although DDX3 
      does not. These data indicate that DDX1 and DDX21 have similar biochemical
      activities with regard to the Rev/RRE system, while DDX3 differs.

AB  - The transition path is a tiny fraction of a molecular trajectory during which the
      free-energy barrier is crossed. It is a single-molecule property and contains all
      mechanistic information of folding processes of biomolecules such as proteins and
      nucleic acids. However, the transition path has been difficult to probe because
      it is short and rarely visited when transitions actually occur. Recent technical 
      advances in single-molecule spectroscopy have made it possible to directly probe 
      transition paths, which has opened up new theoretical and experimental approaches
      to investigating folding mechanisms. This article reviews recent single-molecule 
      fluorescence and force spectroscopic measurements of transition path times and
      their connection to both theory and simulations.

AB  - Protein folding is a fundamental life process with many implications throughout
      biology and medicine. Consequently, there have been enormous efforts to
      understand how proteins fold. Almost all of this effort has focused on
      water-soluble proteins, however, leaving membrane proteins largely wandering in
      the wilderness. The neglect has occurred not because membrane proteins are
      unimportant but rather because they present many theoretical and technical
      complications. Indeed, quantitative membrane protein folding studies are
      generally restricted to a handful of well-behaved proteins. Single-molecule
      methods may greatly alter this picture, however, because the ability to work at
      or near infinite dilution removes aggregation problems, one of the main technical
      challenges of membrane protein folding studies.

AB  - The Scribble cell polarity module, comprising Scribbled (Scrib), Discs-large
      (Dlg) and Lethal-2-giant larvae (Lgl), has a tumor suppressive role in mammalian 
      epithelial cancers. The Scribble module proteins play key functions in the
      establishment and maintenance of different modes of cell polarity, as well as in 
      the control of tissue growth, differentiation and directed cell migration, and
      therefore are major regulators of tissue development and homeostasis. Whilst
      molecular details are known regarding the roles of Scribble module proteins in
      cell polarity regulation, their precise mode of action in the regulation of other
      key cellular processes remains enigmatic. An accumulating body of evidence
      indicates that Scribble module proteins play scaffolding roles in the control of 
      various signaling pathways, which are linked to the control of tissue growth,
      differentiation and cell migration. Multiple Scrib, Dlg and Lgl interacting
      proteins have been discovered, which are involved in diverse processes, however
      many function in the regulation of cellular signaling. Herein, we review the
      components of the Scrib, Dlg and Lgl protein interactomes, and focus on the
      mechanism by which they regulate cellular signaling pathways in metazoans, and
      how their disruption leads to cancer.

AB  - R-loops, which result from the formation of stable DNA:RNA hybrids, can both
      threaten genome integrity and act as physiological regulators of gene expression 
      and chromatin patterning. To characterize R-loops in fission yeast, we used the
      S9.6 antibody-based DRIPc-seq method to sequence the RNA strand of R-loops and
      obtain strand-specific R-loop maps at near nucleotide resolution. Surprisingly,
      preliminary DRIPc-seq experiments identified mostly RNase H-resistant but
      exosome-sensitive RNAs that mapped to both DNA strands and resembled RNA:RNA
      hybrids (dsRNAs), suggesting that dsRNAs form widely in fission yeast. We
      confirmed in vitro that S9.6 can immuno-precipitate dsRNAs and provide evidence
      that dsRNAs can interfere with its binding to R-loops. dsRNA elimination by RNase
      III treatment prior to DRIPc-seq allowed the genome-wide and strand-specific
      identification of genuine R-loops that responded in vivo to RNase H levels and
      displayed classical features associated with R-loop formation. We also found that
      most transcripts whose levels were altered by in vivo manipulation of RNase H
      levels did not form detectable R-loops, suggesting that prolonged manipulation of
      R-loop levels could indirectly alter the transcriptome. We discuss the
      implications of our work in the design of experimental strategies to probe R-loop
      functions.

AB  - Methyl-CpG binding proteins play an essential role in translating DNA methylation
      marks into a downstream transcriptional response, which has implications for both
      normal cell function as well as disease. Although for many of these proteins, a
      detailed mechanistic understanding for how this cellular process is mediated
      remains to be determined. ZBTB38 is an under-characterized member of the zinc
      finger (ZF) family of methyl-CpG binding proteins. Functional knowledge has been 
      gained for its conserved methylated DNA binding N-terminal ZF region; however, a 
      specific role for the C-terminal set of five ZFs remains to be elucidated. Here
      we demonstrate for the first time that a subset of the C-terminal ZBTB38 ZFs
      exhibit high-affinity DNA interactions and that preferential targeting of the
      consensus DNA site is methyl specific. Utilizing a hybrid approach, a model for
      the C-terminal ZBTB38 ZFs in complex with its cognate DNA target is proposed,
      providing insight into a possible novel mode of methylated DNA recognition.
      Furthermore, it is shown that the C-terminal ZFs of ZBTB38 can directly occupy
      promoters harboring the newly identified sequence motif in cell in a
      methyl-dependent manner and, depending on the gene context, contribute to
      modulating transcriptional response. Combined, these findings provide evidence
      for a key and novel physiological function for the C-terminal ZF domain of
      ZBTB38.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies constitute one of the largest groups of drugs to treat
      cancers and immune disorders, and are guiding the design of vaccines against
      infectious diseases. Fragments antigen-binding (Fabs) have been preferred over
      monoclonal antibodies for the structural characterization of antibody-antigen
      complexes due to their relatively low flexibility. Nonetheless, Fabs often remain
      challenging to crystallize because of the surface characteristics of
      complementary determining regions and the residual flexibility in the hinge
      region between the variable and constant domains. Here, we used a variable
      heavy-chain (VHH) domain specific for the human kappa light chain to assist in
      the structure determination of three therapeutic Fabs that were recalcitrant to
      crystallization on their own. We show that this ligand alters the surface
      properties of the antibody-ligand complex and lowers its aggregation temperature 
      to favor crystallization. The VHH crystallization chaperone also restricts the
      flexible hinge of Fabs to a narrow range of angles, and so independently of the
      variable region. Our findings contribute a valuable approach to antibody
      structure determination and provide biophysical insight into the principles that 
      govern the crystallization of macromolecules.

AB  - Antibody Fab fragments have been exploited with significant success to facilitate
      the structure determination of challenging macromolecules as crystallization
      chaperones and as molecular fiducial marks for single particle cryo-electron
      microscopy approaches. However, the inherent flexibility of the "elbow" regions, 
      which link the constant and variable domains of the Fab, can introduce disorder
      and thus diminish their effectiveness. We have developed a phage display
      engineering strategy to generate synthetic Fab variants that significantly
      reduces elbow flexibility, while maintaining their high affinity and stability.
      This strategy was validated using previously recalcitrant Fab-antigen complexes
      where introduction of an engineered elbow region enhanced crystallization and
      diffraction resolution. Furthermore, incorporation of the mutations appears to be
      generally portable to other synthetic antibodies and may serve as a universal

AB  - The 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs is the primary regulatory region that
      mediates post-transcriptional control by microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins in
      the cytoplasm. Aside from individual sequence-specific binding and regulation,
      examples of interaction between these factors at particular 3' UTR sites have
      emerged. However, the whole picture of such higher-order regulatory modules
      across the transcriptome is lacking. Here, we investigate the interactions
      between HuR, a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein, and Ago2, a core effector of the
      miRNA pathway, at the transcriptome-wide level. Using HITS-CLIP, we map HuR and
      miRNA binding sites on human 3' UTRs and assess their co-occurrence. In addition,
      we demonstrate global effects of HuR knockdown on Ago2 occupancy, suggesting a
      co-regulatory relationship. Focusing on sites of Ago2-HuR overlap, 13 candidates 
      were screened in luciferase reporter assays. Eleven sites showed miRNA-dependent 
      repression, as confirmed in Dicer-null cells. To test for HuR's role in
      co-regulation, we measured the reporters in HuR KO cells. Three of the miRNA
      sites demonstrated altered activities, indicating that HuR has an effect on miRNA
      repression at those sites. Our study presents an efficient search and validation 
      system for studying miRNA-HuR interactions, which expands our understanding of
      the combinatorial post-transcriptional control of gene expression at the 3' UTR.

AB  - Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains mediate protein-membrane interactions by binding
      to phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) molecules. The structural and energetic
      basis of selective PH-PIP interactions is central to understanding many cellular 
      processes, yet the molecular complexities of the PH-PIP interactions are largely 
      unknown. Molecular dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained model enables
      estimation of free-energy landscapes for the interactions of 12 different PH
      domains with membranes containing PIP2 or PIP3, allowing us to obtain a detailed 
      molecular energetic understanding of the complexities of the interactions of the 
      PH domains with PIP molecules in membranes. Distinct binding modes, corresponding
      to different distributions of cationic residues on the PH domain, were observed, 
      involving PIP interactions at either the "canonical" (C) and/or "alternate" (A)
      sites. PH domains can be grouped by the relative strength of their C- and A-site 
      interactions, revealing that a higher affinity correlates with increased C-site
      interactions. These simulations demonstrate that simultaneous binding of multiple
      PIP molecules by PH domains contributes to high-affinity membrane interactions,
      informing our understanding of membrane recognition by PH domains in vivo.

AB  - The HIV-1 accessory protein Nef controls multiple aspects of the viral life cycle
      and host immune response, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Previous
      X-ray crystal structures of Nef in complex with key host cell binding partners
      have shed light on protein-protein interactions critical to Nef function. Crystal
      structures of Nef in complex with either the SH3 or tandem SH3-SH2 domains of
      Src-family kinases reveal distinct dimer conformations of Nef. However, the
      existence of these Nef dimer complexes in solution has not been established. Here
      we used hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HX MS) to compare the solution
      conformation of Nef alone and in complexes with the SH3 or the SH3-SH2 domains of
      the Src-family kinase Hck. HX MS revealed that interaction with the Hck SH3 or
      tandem SH3-SH2 domains induces protection of the Nef alphaB-helix from deuterium 
      uptake, consistent with a role for alphaB in dimer formation. HX MS analysis of a
      Nef mutant (position Asp123, a site buried in the Nef:SH3 dimer but surface
      exposed in the Nef:SH3-SH2 complex), showed a Hck-induced conformational change
      in Nef relative to wild-type Nef. These results support a model in which
      Src-family kinase binding induces conformational changes in Nef to expose
      residues critical for interaction with the mu1 subunit of adaptor protein 1 and
      the major histocompatibility complex-1 tail, and subsequent major
      histocompatibility complex-1 downregulation and immune escape of HIV-infected
      cells required for functional interactions with downstream binding partners.

AB  - Tail-anchored membrane proteins (TAMPs) are relatively simple membrane proteins
      characterized by a single transmembrane domain (TMD) at their C-terminus.
      Consequently, the hydrophobic TMD, which acts as a subcellular targeting signal, 
      emerges from the ribosome only after termination of translation precluding
      canonical co-translational targeting and membrane insertion. In contrast to the
      well-studied eukaryotic TAMPs, surprisingly little is known about the cellular
      components that facilitate the biogenesis of bacterial TAMPs. In this study, we
      identify DjlC and Flk as bona fide Escherichia coli TAMPs and show that their
      TMDs are necessary and sufficient for authentic membrane targeting of the
      fluorescent reporter mNeonGreen. Using strains conditional for the expression of 
      known E. coli membrane targeting and insertion factors, we demonstrate that the
      signal recognition particle (SRP), its receptor FtsY, the chaperone DnaK and
      insertase YidC are each required for efficient membrane localization of both
      TAMPs. A close association between the TMD of DjlC and Flk with both the Ffh
      subunit of SRP and YidC was confirmed by site-directed in vivo
      photo-crosslinking. In addition, our data suggest that the hydrophobicity of the 
      TMD correlates with the dependency on SRP for efficient targeting.

AB  - Atg8 is a unique ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently conjugated with a
      phosphatidylethanolamine through reactions similar to ubiquitination and plays
      essential roles in autophagy. Atg7 is the E1 enzyme for Atg8, and it activates
      the C-terminal Gly116 of Atg8 using ATP. Here, we report the crystal structure of
      Atg8 bound to the C-terminal domain of Atg7 in an unprecedented mode. Atg8
      neither contacts with the central beta-sheet nor binds to the catalytic site of
      Atg7, both of which were observed in previously reported Atg7-Atg8 structures.
      Instead, Atg8 binds to the C-terminal alpha-helix and crossover loop, thereby
      changing the autoinhibited conformation of the crossover loop observed in the
      free Atg7 structure into a short helix and a disordered loop. Mutational analyses
      suggested that this interaction mode is important for the activation reaction. We
      propose that Atg7 recognizes Atg8 through multiple steps, which would be
      necessary to induce a conformational change in Atg7 that is optimal for the
      activation reaction.

AB  - Genetic polymorphisms in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene have been
      strongly associated with obesity in humans. The cellular level of FTO is tightly 
      regulated, with alterations in its expression influencing energy metabolism, food
      intake and body weight. Although the proteasome system is involved, the cellular 
      mechanism underlying FTO protein turnover remains unknown. Here, we report that
      FTO undergoes post-translational ubiquitination on Lys-216. Knock-in HeLa cells
      harboring the ubiquitin-deficient K216R mutation displayed a slower rate of FTO
      turnover, resulting in an increase in the level of FTO as well as enhanced
      phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 kinase. Surprisingly, we also found that
      K216R mutation reduced the level of nuclear FTO and completely abolished the
      nuclear translocation of FTO in response to amino acid starvation. Collectively, 
      our results reveal the functional importance of ubiquitination in controlling FTO
      expression and localization, which may be crucial for determining body mass and
      composition.

      TssB Tail Sheath Subunit.

AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a specialized macromolecular complex
      dedicated to the delivery of protein effectors into both eukaryotic and bacterial
      cells. The general mechanism of action of the T6SS is similar to the injection of
      DNA by contractile bacteriophages. The cytoplasmic portion of the T6SS is
      evolutionarily, structurally and functionally related to the phage tail complex. 
      It is composed of an inner tube made of stacked Hcp hexameric rings, engulfed
      within a sheath and built on a baseplate. This sheath undergoes cycles of
      extension and contraction, and the current model proposes that the sheath
      contraction propels the inner tube toward the target cell for effector delivery. 
      The sheath comprises two subunits: TssB and TssC that polymerize under an
      extended conformation. Here, we show that isolated TssB forms trimers, and we
      report the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of TssB. This fragment
      comprises a long helix followed by a helical hairpin that presents
      surface-exposed charged residues. Site-directed mutagenesis coupled to functional
      assay further showed that these charges are required for proper assembly of the
      sheath. Positioning of these residues in the extended T6SS sheath structure
      suggests that they may mediate contacts with the baseplate.

AB  - Proteolysis plays an important role in mitochondrial biogenesis, from the
      processing of newly imported precursor proteins to the degradation of
      mitochondrial targeting peptides. Disruption of peptide degradation activity in
      yeast, plant and mammalian mitochondria is known to have deleterious consequences
      for organism physiology, highlighting the important role of mitochondrial
      peptidases. In the present work, we show that the human mitochondrial peptidase
      neurolysin (hNLN) can degrade mitochondrial presequence peptides as well as other
      fragments up to 19 amino acids long. The crystal structure of hNLN(E475Q) in
      complex with the products of neurotensin cleavage at 2.7A revealed a closed
      conformation with an internal cavity that restricts substrate length and
      highlighted the mechanism of enzyme opening/closing that is necessary for
      substrate binding and catalytic activity. Analysis of peptide degradation in
      vitro showed that hNLN cooperates with presequence protease (PreP or PITRM1) in
      the degradation of long targeting peptides and amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta1-40,
      associated with Alzheimer disease, particularly cleaving the hydrophobic fragment
      Abeta35-40. These findings suggest that a network of proteases may be required
      for complete degradation of peptides localized in mitochondria.

AB  - NLRP3 is the most studied inflammasome sensor due to its crucial involvement in
      sterile and infection-triggered inflammation. Although its molecular mode of
      activation remains to be defined, it is well established that low intracellular
      potassium concentrations result in its activation. This functionality allows the 
      classical NLRP3 pathway to serve as a highly sensitive, but non-specific
      surveillance mechanism responding to any type of perturbation that breaches
      plasma membrane integrity and the associated potassium gradient across the
      membrane. Here, we review our current knowledge on potassium efflux-dependent
      NLRP3 activation, with a special focus on how major cell death programs are
      rendered pro-inflammatory by secondary NLRP3 activation. Apart from the
      "alternative inflammasome" as the major exception to the rule, this connection
      explains the fundamental importance of NLRP3 in cell death-associated
      inflammation and firmly establishes NLRP3 as a principal surveillance mechanism

AB  - Autophagy and inflammasome complex assembly are physiological processes that
      control homeostasis, inflammation, and immunity. Autophagy is a ubiquitous
      pathway that degrades cytosolic macromolecules or organelles, as well as
      intracellular pathogens. Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that assemble 
      in the cytosol of cells upon detection of pathogen- or danger-associated
      molecular patterns. A critical outcome of inflammasome assembly is the activation
      of the cysteine protease caspase-1, which activates the pro-inflammatory cytokine
      precursors pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18. Studies on chronic inflammatory diseases, 
      heart diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis revealed that
      autophagy and inflammasomes intersect and regulate each other. In the context of 
      infectious diseases, however, less is known about the interplay between autophagy
      and inflammasome assembly, although it is becoming evident that pathogens have
      evolved multiple strategies to inhibit and/or subvert these pathways and to take 
      advantage of their intricate crosstalk. An improved appreciation of these
      pathways and their subversion by diverse pathogens is expected to help in the
      design of anti-infective therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Canonical inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that can activate both
      caspase-1 and caspase-8. Caspase-1 drives rapid lysis of cells by pyroptosis and 
      maturation of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. In caspase-1-deficient cells,
      inflammasome formation still leads to caspase-3 activation and slower apoptotic
      death, dependent on caspase-8 as an apical caspase. A role for caspase-8 directly
      upstream of caspase-1 has also been suggested, but here we show that
      caspase-8-deficient macrophages have no defect in AIM2 inflammasome-mediated
      caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis, and IL-1beta cleavage. In investigating the
      inflammasome-induced apoptotic pathway, we previously demonstrated that activated
      caspase-8 is essential for caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis in
      caspase-1-deficient cells. However, here we found that AIM2
      inflammasome-initiated caspase-3 cleavage was maintained in Ripk3(-/-)Casp8(-/-) 
      macrophages. Gene knockdown showed that caspase-1 was required for the caspase-3 
      cleavage. Thus inflammasomes activate a network of caspases that can promote both
      pyroptotic and apoptotic cell death. In cells where rapid pyroptosis is blocked, 
      delayed inflammasome-dependent cell death could still occur due to both
      caspase-1- and caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. Initiation of redundant cell death 
      pathways is likely to be a strategy for coping with pathogen interference in
      death processes.

AB  - Sensing and responding to pathogens and tissue damage is a core mechanism of
      innate immune host defense, and inflammasomes represent a central cytosolic
      pattern recognition receptor pathway leading to the generation of the
      pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and interleukin-18 and pyroptotic
      cell death that causes the subsequent release of danger signals to propagate and 
      perpetuate inflammatory responses. While inflammasome activation is essential for
      host defense, deregulated inflammasome responses and excessive release of
      inflammatory cytokines and danger signals are linked to an increasing spectrum of
      inflammatory diseases. In this review, we will discuss recent developments in
      elucidating the role of PYRIN domain-only proteins (POPs) and the related
      CARD-only proteins (COPs) in regulating inflammasome responses and their impact
      on inflammatory disease.

AB  - Inflammasomes are cytosolic multi-molecular complexes that sense intracellular
      microbial danger signals and metabolic perturbations. Inflammasome activation
      leads to the activation of caspase-1 and the release of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 accompanied by cell death. An inflammasome-based
      surveillance machinery for Gram-negative bacterial infections has been recently
      discovered. This noncanonical inflammasome relies on sensing the cytosolic
      presence of lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria via inflammatory
      caspases such as caspase-4, -5, and -11. This review discusses the recent
      findings related to the mechanism of activation of the noncanonical inflammasome 
      and its biological functions.

AB  - An immune response consists of a finely orchestrated interplay between initial
      recognition of potential microbial threats by the innate immune system and
      subsequent licensed adaptive immune neutralization. The initial recognition
      integrates environmental cues derived from pathogen-associated molecular patterns
      and cell-intrinsic damage-associated molecular patterns to contextualize the
      insult and inform a tailored adaptive response via T and B lymphocytes. While
      there are much data to support the role of transcriptional responses downstream
      of pattern recognition receptors in informing the adaptive immune response,
      markedly less attention has been paid to the role of post-translational responses
      to pathogen-associated molecular pattern and damage-associated molecular pattern 
      recognition by the innate immune system, and how this may influence adaptive
      immunity. A well-characterized post-translational consequence of pattern
      recognition receptor signaling is the assembly of a multimeric signaling
      platform, termed the inflammasome, by members of the nucleotide-binding
      oligomerization domain (Nod), leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs),
      and pyrin and HIN domain (PYHIN) families. Inflammasomes assemble in response to 
      cytosolic perturbations, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant ion
      fluxes in the case of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome or the presence of
      bacterial lipopolysaccharides in the case of the non-canonical inflammasome.
      Assembly of the inflammasome allows for the cleavage and activation of
      inflammatory caspases. These activated inflammatory caspases in turn cleave
      pro-form inflammatory cytokines into their mature bioactive species and lead to
      unconventional protein secretion and lytic cell death. In this review, we discuss
      evidence for inflammasome-mediated instruction and contextualization of
      infectious and sterile agents to the adaptive immune system.

AB  - NLRP1 was the first NOD-like receptor described to form an inflammasome,
      recruiting ASC to activate caspase-1, which processes interleukin-1beta and
      interleukin-18 to their active form. A wealth of new genetic information has now 
      redefined our understanding of this innate immune sensor. Specifically, rare
      loss-of-function variants in the N-terminal pyrin domain indicate that this part 
      of NLRP1 is autoinhibitory and normally acts to prevent a familial
      autoinflammatory skin disease associated with cancer. In the absence of a ligand 
      to trigger human NLRP1, these mutations have now confirmed the requirement of
      NLRP1 autolytic cleavage within the FIIND domain, which had previously been
      implicated in NLRP1 activation. Autolytic cleavage generates a C-terminal
      fragment of NLRP1 containing the CARD domain which then forms an ASC-dependent
      inflammasome. The CARD domain as an inflammasome linker is consistent with the
      observation that under some conditions, particularly for mouse NLRP1, caspase-1
      can be engaged directly, and although it is no longer processed, it is still
      capable of producing mature IL-1beta. Additional rare variants in a linker region
      between the LRR and FIIND domains of NLRP1 also cause autoinflammatory disease in
      both humans and mice. This new genetic information is likely to provide for more 
      mechanistic insight in the years to come, contributing to our understanding of
      how NLRP1 functions as an innate immune sensor of infection and predisposes to
      autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases.

AB  - Inflammasome signaling impinges on the activation of inflammatory caspases (i.e.,
      caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/11) and endows host cells with a sentinel system to
      sense microbial intrusion and thereby initiate appropriate immune responses.
      Lately, it has become evident that mammalian inflammasome-dependent responses to 
      infection are not confined solely to cells of hematopoietic origin. Epithelial
      cells that line the body's mucosal surfaces use inflammasome signaling to sense
      and counteract pathogenic microorganisms that compromise barrier integrity. Many 
      of the molecular mechanisms of epithelial inflammasome signaling remain
      unexplored. However, it now seems clear that epithelial inflammasome activation
      has a profound impact both on the infected cell itself and on its ability to
      communicate with other cell types of the mucosa. Here, we summarize current
      knowledge regarding the output of epithelial inflammasome activation during
      bacterial infection. Well-established downstream effects include epithelial cell 
      death, release of soluble mediators, and subsequent recruitment of effector cell 
      types, including NK cells, mast cells, and neutrophils, to sites of mucosal
      infection. We discuss the implications of recent findings for antibacterial
      defense in the mucosa and sketch out areas for future exploration.

AB  - The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cytidine deaminase APOBEC3F (A3F) deaminates
      cytosine (C) to uracil (U) and is a known restriction factor of HIV-1. Its
      C-terminal catalytic domain (CD2) alone is capable of binding single-stranded
      nucleic acids and is important for deamination. However, little is known about
      how the CD2 interacts with ssDNA. Here we report a crystal structure of A3F-CD2
      in complex with a 10-nucleotide ssDNA composed of poly-thymine, which reveals a
      novel positively charged nucleic acid binding site distal to the active center
      that plays a key role in substrate DNA binding and catalytic activity. Lysine and
      tyrosine residues within this binding site interact with the ssDNA, and mutating 
      these residues dramatically impairs both ssDNA binding and catalytic activity.
      This binding site is not conserved in APOBEC3G (A3G), which may explain
      differences in ssDNA-binding characteristics between A3F-CD2 and A3G-CD2. In
      addition, we observed an alternative Zn-coordination conformation around the
      active center. These findings reveal the structural relationships between nucleic
      acid interactions and catalytic activity of A3F.

AB  - Successful antibody development requires both functional binding and desirable
      biophysical characteristics. In the current study, we analyze the causes of one
      hurdle to clinical development, off-target reactivity, or nonspecificity. We used
      a high-throughput nonspecificity assay to isolate panels of nonspecific
      antibodies from two synthetic single-chain variable fragment libraries expressed 
      on the surface of yeast, identifying both individual amino acids and motifs
      within the complementarity-determining regions which contribute to the phenotype.
      We find enrichment of glycine, valine, and arginine as both individual amino
      acids and as a part of motifs, and additionally enrichment of motifs containing
      tryptophan. Insertion of any of these motifs into the complementarity-determining
      region H3 of a "clean" antibody increased its nonspecificity, with greatest
      increases in antibodies containing Trp or Val motifs. We next applied these rules
      to the creation of a synthetic diversity library based on natural frameworks with
      significantly decreased incorporation of such motifs and demonstrated its ability
      to isolate binders to a wide panel of antigens. This work both provides a greater
      understanding of the drivers of nonspecificity and provides design rules to
      increase efficiency in the isolation of antibodies with drug-like properties.

AB  - Protein methylation is one of the major post-translational modifications (PTMs)
      in the cell. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, over 20 protein methyltransferases
      (MTases) and their respective substrates have been identified. However, the way
      in which these MTases are modified and potentially subject to regulation remains 
      poorly understood. Here, we investigated six overexpressed S. cerevisiae protein 
      MTases (Rkm1, Rkm4, Efm4, Efm7, Set5 and Hmt1) to identify PTMs of potential
      functional relevance. We identified 48 PTM sites across the six MTases, including
      phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation. Forty-two sites are novel. We
      contextualized the PTM sites in structural models of the MTases and revealed that
      many fell in catalytic pockets or enzyme-substrate interfaces. These may regulate
      MTase activity. Finally, we compared PTMs on Hmt1 with those on its human
      homologs PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1, PRMT6 and PRMT8. This revealed that several PTMs
      are conserved from yeast to human, whereas others are only found in Hmt1. The
      mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange
      Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier
      PXD006767.

      networks that govern vital cellular processes. Thousands of 14-3-3 partners have 
      been either experimentally identified or predicted, but the spatiotemporal
      hierarchy of the processes based on 14-3-3 interactions is not clearly
      understood. This is exacerbated by the lack of available structural information
      on full regulatory complexes involving 14-3-3, which resist high-resolution
      structural studies due to the presence of intrinsically disordered regions.
      Although deducing three-dimensional structures is of particular urgency,
      structural advances are lagging behind the rate at which novel 14-3-3 partners
      are discovered. Here I attempted to critically review the current state of the
      field and in particular to dissect the unknowns, focusing on questions that could
      help in moving the frontiers forward.

AB  - Bacteriophage lambda of Escherichia coli has two alternative life cycles after
      infection-host survival with lysogen formation, or host lysis and phage
      production. In a lysogen, CI represses the two lytic promoters, pR and pL, and
      activates its own transcription from the auto-regulated pRM promoter. During
      induction from the lysogenic to lytic state, CI is inactivated, and the two lytic
      promoters are de-repressed allowing for expression of Cro from pR. Cro is known
      to repress transcription of CI from pRM to prevent lysogeny. We show here that
      when Cro and CI are both present but at low levels, the low level of Cro
      initially stimulates the lytic promoters while CI repressor is still present,
      stimulating the level of Cro to a concentration required for pRM repression. Cro 
      has no stimulatory effect without the presence of CI. We propose that this early 
      auto-activating role of Cro at lower concentrations is essential in the
      developmental switch to lytic growth, whereas pRM repression by Cro at relatively
      higher concentrations avoids restoring lysogeny.

AB  - RRM, or RNA-recognition motif, domains are the largest class of single-stranded
      RNA binding domains in the human proteome and play important roles in RNA
      processing, splicing, export, stability, packaging, and degradation. Using a
      current database of post-translational modifications (PTMs), ProteomeScout, we
      found that RRM domains are also one of the most heavily modified domains in the
      human proteome. Here, we present two interesting findings about RRM domain
      modifications, found by mapping known PTMs onto RRM domain alignments and
      structures. First, we find significant overlap of ubiquitination and acetylation 
      within RRM domains, suggesting the possibility for ubiquitination-acetylation
      crosstalk. Additionally, an analysis of quantitative study of ubiquitination
      changes in response to proteasome inhibition highlights the uniqueness of RRM
      domain ubiquitination - RRM domain ubiquitination decreases in response to
      proteasome inhibition, whereas the majority of sites increase. Second, we found
      conservation of tyrosine phosphorylation within the RNP1 and RNP2 consensus
      sequences, which coordinate RNA binding - suggesting a possible role for
      regulation of RNA binding by tyrosine kinase signaling. These observations
      suggest there are unique regulatory mechanisms of RRM function that have yet to
      be uncovered and that the RRM domain represents a model system for further
      studies on understanding PTM crosstalk.

AB  - The main family of serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinases present in eukarya
      was defined and described by Hanks et al. in 1988 (Science, 241, 42-52). It was
      initially believed that these kinases do not exist in bacteria, but extensive
      genome sequencing revealed their existence in many bacteria. For historical
      reasons, the term "eukaryotic-type kinases" propagated in the literature to
      describe bacterial members of this protein family. Here, we argue that this term 
      should be abandoned as a misnomer, and we provide several lines of evidence to
      support this claim. Our comprehensive phylostratigraphic analysis suggests that
      Hanks-type kinases present in eukarya, bacteria and archaea all share a common
      evolutionary origin in the lineage leading to the last universal common ancestor 
      (LUCA). We found no evidence to suggest substantial horizontal transfer of genes 
      encoding Hanks-type kinases from eukarya to bacteria. Moreover, our systematic
      structural comparison suggests that bacterial Hanks-type kinases resemble their
      eukaryal counterparts very closely, while their structures appear to be
      dissimilar from other kinase families of bacterial origin. This indicates that a 
      convergent evolution scenario, by which bacterial kinases could have evolved a
      kinase domain similar to that of eukaryal Hanks-type kinases, is not very likely.
      Overall, our results strongly support a monophyletic origin of all Hanks-type
      kinases, and we therefore propose that this term should be adopted as a universal
      name for this protein family.

AB  - HdeA is a periplasmic chaperone that is rapidly activated upon shifting the pH to
      acidic conditions. This activation is thought to involve monomerization of HdeA. 
      There is evidence that monomerization and partial unfolding allow the chaperone
      to bind to proteins denatured by low pH, thereby protecting them from
      aggregation. We analyzed the acid-induced unfolding of HdeA using NMR
      spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements, and obtained experimental evidence
      suggesting a complex mechanism in HdeA's acid-induced unfolding pathway, as
      previously postulated from molecular dynamics simulations. Counterintuitively,
      dissociation constant measurements show a stabilization of the HdeA dimer upon
      exposure to mildly acidic conditions. We provide experimental evidence that
      protonation of Glu37, a glutamate residue embedded in a hydrophobic pocket of
      HdeA, is important in controlling HdeA stabilization and thus the acid activation
      of this chaperone. Our data also reveal a sharp transition from folded dimer to
      unfolded monomer between pH3 and pH 2, and suggest the existence of a
      low-populated, partially folded intermediate that could assist in chaperone
      activation or function. Overall, this study provides a detailed experimental
      investigation into the mechanism by which HdeA unfolds and activates.

AB  - Discs large (DLG) MAGUKs are abundantly expressed in glutamatergic synapses,
      crucial for synaptic transmission, and plasticity by anchoring various
      postsynaptic components including glutamate receptors, downstream scaffold
      proteins and signaling enzymes. Different DLG members have shared structures and 
      functions, but also contain unique features. How DLG family proteins function
      individually and cooperatively is largely unknown. Here, we report that PSD-95
      PDZ3 directly couples with SH3-GK tandem in a PDZ ligand binding-dependent
      manner, and the coupling can promote PSD-95 dimerization and multimerization.
      Aided by sortase-mediated protein ligation and selectively labeling, we
      elucidated the PDZ3/SH3-GK conformational coupling mechanism using NMR
      spectroscopy. We further demonstrated that PSD-93, but not SAP102, can also
      undergo PDZ3 ligand binding-induced conformational coupling with SH3-GK and form 
      homo-oligomers. Interestingly, PSD-95 and PSD-93 can also form ligand
      binding-induced hetero-oligomers, suggesting a cooperative assembly mechanism for
      the mega-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor synaptic signaling complex. Finally, we
      provide evidence showing that ligand binding-induced conformational coupling
      between PDZ and SH3-GK is a common feature for other MAGUKs including CASK and
      PALS1.

AB  - We engineered nucleosome core particles (NCPs) with two site-specific cysteine
      crosslinks that increase the stability of the particle. The first disulfide was
      introduced between the two copies of H2A via an H2A-N38C point mutation,
      effectively crosslinking the two H2A/H2B heterodimers together to stabilize the
      histone octamer against H2A/H2B dimer dissociation. The second crosslink was
      engineered between an R40C point mutation on the N-terminal tail of H3 and the
      NCP DNA ends by the introduction of a convertible nucleotide. This crosslink
      maintains the nucleosome DNA in a fixed translational setting relative to the
      histone octamer and prevents dilution-driven dissociation. The X-ray crystal
      structures of NCPs containing the disulfides in isolation and in combination were
      determined. Both disulfides stabilize the structure of the NCP without disturbing
      the overall structure. Nucleosomes containing these modifications will be
      advantageous for biochemical and structural studies as a consequence of their
      greater resistance to dissociation during high dilution in purification, elevated
      salt for crystallization and vitrification for cryogenic electron microscopy.

AB  - The intrinsic editing capacities of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensure a
      high-fidelity translation of the amino acids that possess effective non-cognate
      aminoacylation surrogates. The dominant error-correction pathway comprises
      deacylation of misaminoacylated tRNA within the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase editing
      site. To assess the origin of specificity of Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA
      synthetase (LeuRS) against the cognate aminoacylation product in editing, we
      followed binding and catalysis independently using cognate leucyl- and
      non-cognate norvalyl-tRNA(Leu) and their non-hydrolyzable analogues. We found
      that the amino acid part (leucine versus norvaline) of (mis)aminoacyl-tRNAs can
      contribute approximately 10-fold to ground-state discrimination at the editing
      site. In sharp contrast, the rate of deacylation of leucyl- and
      norvalyl-tRNA(Leu) differed by about 10(4)-fold. We further established the
      critical role for the A76 3'-OH group of the tRNA(Leu) in post-transfer editing, 
      which supports the substrate-assisted deacylation mechanism. Interestingly, the
      abrogation of the LeuRS specificity determinant threonine 252 did not improve the
      affinity of the editing site for the cognate leucine as expected, but instead
      substantially enhanced the rate of leucyl-tRNA(Leu) hydrolysis. In line with
      that, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the wild-type enzyme, but not 
      the T252A mutant, enforced leucine to adopt the side-chain conformation that
      promotes the steric exclusion of a putative catalytic water. Our data
      demonstrated that the LeuRS editing site exhibits amino acid specificity of
      kinetic origin, arguing against the anticipated prominent role of steric
      exclusion in the rejection of leucine. This feature distinguishes editing from
      the synthetic site, which relies on ground-state discrimination in amino acid
      selection.

AB  - Interactions between proteins are an essential part of biology, and the desire to
      identify these interactions has led to the development of numerous technologies
      to systematically map protein-protein interactions at a large scale. As in most
      cellular processes, protein interactions are central to the control of cell
      polarity, and a full understanding of polarity will require comprehensive
      knowledge of the protein interactions involved. At its core, cell polarity is
      established through carefully regulated mutually inhibitory interactions between 
      several groups of cortical proteins. While several interactions have been
      identified, the dynamics and molecular mechanisms that control these interactions
      are not well understood. Cell polarity also needs to be integrated with cellular 
      processes including junction formation, cytoskeletal organization, organelle
      positioning, protein trafficking, and functional specialization of membrane
      domains. Moreover, polarized cells need to respond to external cues that
      coordinate polarity at the tissue level. Identifying the protein-protein
      interactions responsible for integrating polarity with all of these processes
      remains a major challenge, in part because the mechanisms of polarity control
      vary in different contexts and with developmental times. Because of their
      unbiased nature, systematic large-scale protein-protein interaction mapping
      approaches can be particularly helpful to identify such mechanisms. Here, we
      discuss methods commonly used to generate proteome-wide interactome maps, with an
      emphasis on advances in our understanding of cell polarity that have been
      achieved through application of such methods.

AB  - A fully quantitative theory connecting protein conformation and optical
      spectroscopy would facilitate deeper insights into biophysical and simulation
      studies of protein dynamics and folding. The web server DichroCalc
      (http://comp.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/dichrocalc) allows one to compute from first
      principles the electronic circular dichroism spectrum of a (modeled or
      experimental) protein structure or ensemble of structures. The regular,
      repeating, chiral nature of secondary structure elements leads to intense bands
      in the far-ultraviolet (UV). The near-UV bands are much weaker and have been
      challenging to compute theoretically. We report some advances in the accuracy of 
      calculations in the near-UV, realized through the consideration of the
      vibrational structure of the electronic transitions of aromatic side chains. The 
      improvements have been assessed over a set of diverse proteins. We illustrate
      them using bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and present a new, detailed
      analysis of the interactions which are most important in determining the near-UV 
      circular dichroism spectrum.

AB  - The MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de) is a free,
      one-stop web service for protein bioinformatic analysis. It currently offers 34
      interconnected external and in-house tools, whose functionality covers sequence
      similarity searching, alignment construction, detection of sequence features,
      structure prediction, and sequence classification. This breadth has made the
      Toolkit an important resource for experimental biology and for teaching
      bioinformatic inquiry. Recently, we replaced the first version of the Toolkit,
      which was released in 2005 and had served around 2.5 million queries, with an
      entirely new version, focusing on improved features for the comprehensive
      analysis of proteins, as well as on promoting teaching. For instance, our popular
      remote homology detection server, HHpred, now allows pairwise comparison of two
      sequences or alignments and offers additional profile HMMs for several model
      organisms and domain databases. Here, we introduce the new version of our Toolkit
      and its application to the analysis of proteins.

TI  - eRepo-ORP: Exploring the Opportunity Space to Combat Orphan Diseases with
      Existing Drugs.

AB  - About 7000 rare, or orphan, diseases affect more than 350 million people
      worldwide. Although these conditions collectively pose significant health care
      problems, drug companies seldom develop drugs for orphan diseases due to
      extremely limited individual markets. Consequently, developing new treatments for
      often life-threatening orphan diseases is primarily contingent on financial
      incentives from governments, special research grants, and private philanthropy.
      Computer-aided drug repositioning is a cheaper and faster alternative to
      traditional drug discovery offering a promising venue for orphan drug research.
      Here, we present eRepo-ORP, a comprehensive resource constructed by a large-scale
      repositioning of existing drugs to orphan diseases with a collection of
      structural bioinformatics tools, including eThread, eFindSite, and eMatchSite.
      Specifically, a systematic exploration of 320,856 possible links between known
      drugs in DrugBank and orphan proteins obtained from Orphanet reveals as many as
      18,145 candidates for repurposing. In order to illustrate how potential
      therapeutics for rare diseases can be identified with eRepo-ORP, we discuss the
      repositioning of a kinase inhibitor for Ras-associated autoimmune
      leukoproliferative disease. The eRepo-ORP data set is available through the Open 
      Science Framework at https://osf.io/qdjup/.

AB  - The NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) is the scaffolding subunit of the
      inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) holocomplex and is required for the activation
      of the catalytic IKK subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, during the canonical
      inflammatory response. Although structures of shorter constructs of NEMO have
      been solved, efforts to elucidate the full-length structure of NEMO have proved
      difficult due to its apparent high conformational plasticity. To better
      characterize the gross dimensions of full-length NEMO, we employed in-line size
      exclusion chromatography-small-angle X-ray scattering. We show that NEMO adopts a
      more compact conformation (Dmax=320A) than predicted for a fully extended
      coiled-coil structure (>500A). In addition, we map a region of NEMO (residues
      112-150) in its coiled-coil 1 domain that impedes the binding of linear
      (M1-linked) di-ubiquitin to its coiled-coil 2-leucine zipper ubiquitin binding
      domain. This ubiquitin binding inhibition can be overcome by a longer chain of
      linear, but not K63-linked polyubiquitin. Collectively, these observations
      suggest that NEMO may be auto-inhibited in the resting state by intramolecular
      interactions and that during signaling, NEMO may be allosterically activated by
      binding to long M1-linked polyubiquitin chains.

AB  - The ability of ubiquitin to function in a wide range of cellular processes is
      ascribed to its capacity to cause a diverse spectrum of modifications. While a
      target protein can be modified with monoubiquitin, it can also be modified with
      ubiquitin chains. The latter include seven types of homotypic chains as well as
      mixed ubiquitin chains. In a mixed chain, not all the isopeptide bonds are
      restricted to a specific lysine of ubiquitin, resulting in a chain possessing
      more than one type of linkage. While structural characterization of homotypic
      chains has been well elucidated, less is known about mixed chains. Here we
      present the crystal structure of a mixed tri-ubiquitin chain at 3.1-A resolution.
      In the structure, the proximal ubiquitin is connected to the middle ubiquitin via
      K48 and these two ubiquitins adopt a compact structure as observed in K48
      di-ubiquitin. The middle ubiquitin links to the distal ubiquitin via its K63 and 
      these ubiquitins adopt two conformations, suggesting a flexible structure. Using 
      small-angle X-ray scattering, we unexpectedly found differences between the
      conformational ensembles of the above tri-ubiquitin chains and chains possessing 
      the same linkages but in the reverse order. In addition, cleavage of the K48
      linkage by DUB is faster if this linkage is at the distal end. Taken together,
      our results suggest that in mixed chains, not only the type of the linkages but
      also their sequence determine the structural and functional properties of the
      chain.

TI  - Mechanistic Insights into Dimethylsulfoniopropionate Lyase DddY, a New Member of 
      the Cupin Superfamily.

AB  - The marine osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is one of Earth's most
      abundant organosulfur molecules. Bacterial DMSP lyases cleave DMSP, producing
      acrylate and dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a climate-active gas with roles in global
      sulfur cycling and atmospheric chemistry. DddY is the only known periplasmic DMSP
      lyase and is present in beta-, gamma-, delta- and epsilon-proteobacteria. Unlike 
      other known DMSP lyases, DddY has not been classified into a protein superfamily,
      and its structure and catalytic mechanism are unknown. Here, we determined the
      crystal structure of DddY from the gamma-proteobacterium Acinetobacter bereziniae
      originally isolated from human clinical specimens. This structure revealed that
      DddY contains a cap domain and a catalytic domain with a Zn(2+) bound at its
      active site. We also observed that the DddY catalytic domain adopts a typical
      beta-barrel fold and contains two conserved cupin motifs. Therefore, we concluded
      that DddY should belong to the cupin superfamily. Using structural and mutational
      analyses, we identified key residues involved in Zn(2+) coordination, DMSP
      binding and the catalysis of DMSP cleavage, enabling elucidation of the catalytic
      mechanism, in which the residue Tyr271 of DddY acts as a general base to attack
      DMSP. Moreover, sequence analysis suggested that this proposed mechanism is
      common to DddY proteins from beta-, gamma-, delta- and epsilon-proteobacteria.
      The DddY structure and proposed catalytic mechanism provide a better
      understanding of how DMSP is catabolized to generate the important climate-active
      gas DMS.

AB  - There is a strong correlation between some pathogens and certain cancer types.
      One example is Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer. Exactly how they
      contribute to host tumorigenesis is, however, a mystery. Pathogens often interact
      with the host through proteins. To subvert defense, they may mimic host proteins 
      at the sequence, structure, motif, or interface levels. Interface similarity
      permits pathogen proteins to compete with those of the host for a target protein 
      and thereby alter the host signaling. Detection of host-pathogen interactions
      (HPIs) and mapping the re-wired superorganism HPI network-with structural
      details-can provide unprecedented clues to the underlying mechanisms and help
      therapeutics. Here, we describe the first computational approach exploiting
      solely interface mimicry to model potential HPIs. Interface mimicry can identify 
      more HPIs than sequence or complete structural similarity since it appears more
      common than the other mimicry types. We illustrate the usefulness of this concept
      by modeling HPIs of H. pylori to understand how they modulate host immunity,
      persist lifelong, and contribute to tumorigenesis. H. pylori proteins interfere
      with multiple host pathways as they target several host hub proteins. Our results
      help illuminate the structural basis of resistance to apoptosis, immune evasion, 
      and loss of cell junctions seen in H. pylori-infected host cells.

AB  - Heterotrimeric G-proteins are essential cellular signal transducers. One of the
      G-proteins, Galpha13, is critical for actin cytoskeletal reorganization, cell
      migration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Previously, we have shown that
      Galpha13 is essential for both G-protein-coupled receptor and receptor tyrosine
      kinase-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization such as dynamic dorsal ruffle
      turnover and cell migration. However, the mechanism by which Galpha13 signals to 
      actin cytoskeletal reorganization is not completely understood. Here we show that
      Galpha13 directly interacts with Abl tyrosine kinase, which is a critical
      regulator of actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is critical for
      Galpha13-induced dorsal ruffle turnover, endothelial cell remodeling, and cell
      migration. Our data uncover a new molecular signaling pathway by which Galpha13
      controls actin cytoskeletal reorganization.

      Microscopy.

AB  - M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (M-PLA2R) is a member of the mannose receptor
      family and known as the receptor of secretory phospholipase A2s. It has also been
      identified as the major autoantigen of idiopathic membranous nephropathy, one of 
      the most common causes for nephrotic syndrome in adults. Here we determine the
      structure of human M-PLA2R ectodomain by cryo-electron microscopy. The results
      show that the ectodomain has high internal flexibility and forms a compact
      dual-ring-shaped conformation at acidic pH and adopts extended conformations at
      basic pH. The inter-domain interactions of human M-PLA2R are explored by the
      binding studies with individual domains, showing the mechanism of the
      conformational change. In addition, the biochemical data suggest that mouse
      M-PLA2R recognizes mouse secretory phospholipase A2-G1B only at physiological or 
      basic pH, rather than at acidic pH. These results suggest that the pH-dependent
      conformational change might play important roles in the functional activities of 
      M-PLA2R such as ligand binding and release, and may also be relevant to the
      immunogenicity in membranous nephropathy.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major infectious disease threat and include the
      pathogenic human pathogens of zoonotic origin: severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Entry of CoVs
      into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein, which is structurally
      categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, within the same group as influenza
      virus and HIV. However, S proteins have two distinct cleavage sites that can be
      activated by a much wider range of proteases. The exact location of the CoV
      fusion peptide (FP) has been disputed. However, most evidence suggests that the
      domain immediately downstream of the S2' cleavage site is the FP (amino acids
      798-818 SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFMKQY for SARS-CoV, FP1). In our previous electron spin 
      resonance spectroscopic studies, the membrane-ordering effect of influenza virus,
      HIV, and Dengue virus FPs has been consistently observed. In this study, we used 
      this effect as a criterion to identify and characterize the bona fide SARS-CoV
      FP. Our results indicate that both FP1 and the region immediately downstream
      (amino acids 816-835 KQYGECLGDINARDLICAQKF, FP2) induce significant membrane
      ordering. Furthermore, their effects are calcium dependent, which is consistent
      with in vivo data showing that calcium is required for SARS-CoV S-mediated
      fusion. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed a direct interaction between
      calcium cations and both FPs. This Ca(2+)-dependency membrane ordering was not
      observed with influenza FP, indicating that the CoV FP exhibits a mechanistically
      different behavior. Membrane-ordering effects are greater and penetrate deeper
      into membranes when FP1 and FP2 act in a concerted manner, suggesting that they
      form an extended fusion "platform."

AB  - Ubiquitination is a multifunctional posttranslational modification controlling
      the activity, subcellular localization and stability of proteins. The E3
      ubiquitin ligase ubiquitin-like PHD and RING finger domain-containing protein 1
      (UHRF1) is an essential epigenetic factor that recognizes repressive histone
      marks as well as hemi-methylated DNA and recruits DNA methyltransferase 1. To
      explore enzymatic functions of UHRF1 beyond epigenetic regulation, we conducted a
      comprehensive screen in mouse embryonic stem cells to identify novel
      ubiquitination targets of UHRF1 and its paralogue UHRF2. We found differentially 
      ubiquitinated peptides associated with a variety of biological processes such as 
      transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response. Most prominently, we
      identified PCNA-associated factor 15 (PAF15; also known as Pclaf, Ns5atp9,
      KIAA0101 and OEATC-1) as a specific ubiquitination target of UHRF1. Although the 
      function of PAF15 ubiquitination in translesion DNA synthesis is well
      characterized, the respective E3 ligase had been unknown. We could show that
      UHRF1 ubiquitinates PAF15 at Lys 15 and Lys 24 and promotes its binding to PCNA
      during late S-phase. In summary, we identified novel ubiquitination targets that 
      link UHRF1 to transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response.

AB  - Inteins are mobile genetic elements that are spliced out of proteins after
      translation. Some inteins contain a homing endonuclease (HEN) responsible for
      their propagation. Hedgehog/INTein (HINT) domains catalyzing protein splicing and
      their nested HEN domains are thought to be functionally independent because of
      the existence of functional mini-inteins without HEN domains. Despite the lack of
      obvious mutualism between HEN and HINT domains, HEN domains are persistently
      found at one specific site in inteins, indicating their potential functional role
      in protein splicing. Here we report crystal structures of inactive and active
      mini-inteins derived from inteins residing in the transcription factor IIB of
      Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanocaldococcus vulcanius, revealing a novel
      modified HINT fold that might provide new insights into the mutualism between the
      HEN and HINT domains. We propose an evolutionary model of inteins and a
      functional role of HEN domains in inteins.

AB  - The highly fine-tuned dynamics of cell cycle gene expression have been intensely 
      studied for several decades. However, some previous observations may be difficult
      to fully decouple from artifacts induced by traditional cell synchronization
      procedures. In addition, bulk cell measurements may have disguised intricate
      details. Here, we address this by sorting and transcriptomic sequencing of single
      cells progressing through the cell cycle without prior synchronization. Genes and
      pathways with known cell cycle roles are confirmed, associated regulatory
      sequence motifs are determined, and we also establish ties between other
      biological processes and the unsynchronized cell cycle. Importantly, we find the 
      G1 phase to be surprisingly heterogeneous, with transcriptionally distinct early 
      and late time points. We additionally note that mRNAs accumulate to reach maximum
      total levels at mitosis and find that stable transcripts show reduced
      cell-to-cell variability, consistent with the transcriptional burst model of gene
      expression. Our study provides the first detailed transcriptional profiling of an
      unsynchronized human cell cycle.

AB  - Although some naturally occurring polyphenols have been found to inhibit amyloid 
      beta (Abeta) fibril formation and reduce neuron cell toxicity in vitro, their
      exact inhibitory mechanism is unknown. In this work, discontinuous molecular
      dynamics combined with the PRIME20 force field and a newly built inhibitor model 
      are performed to examine the effect of vanillin, resveratrol, curcumin, and
      epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the aggregation of Abeta(17-36) peptides.
      Four sets of peptide/inhibitor simulations are performed in which inhibitors (1) 
      bind to Abeta(17-36) monomer (2) interfere with Abeta(17-36) oligomerization (3) 
      disrupt a pre-formed Abeta(17-36) protofilament, and (4) prevent the growth of
      Abeta(17-36) protofilament. The single-ring compound, vanillin, slightly slows
      down but cannot inhibit the formation of a U-shaped Abeta(17-36) protofilament.
      The multiple-ring compounds, EGCG, resveratrol, and curcumin, redirect
      Abeta(17-36) from a fibrillar aggregate to an unstructured oligomer. The three
      aromatic groups of the EGCG molecule are in a stereo (nonplanar) configuration,
      helping it contact the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions of the peptide.
      Resveratrol and curcumin bind only to the hydrophobic residues near peptide
      termini. The rank order of inhibitory effectiveness of Abeta(17-36) aggregation
      is as follows: EGCG > resveratrol > curcumin > vanillin, consistent with
      experimental findings on inhibiting full-length Abeta fibrillation. Furthermore, 
      we learn that the inhibition effect of EGCG is specific to the peptide sequence, 
      while those of resveratrol and curcumin are non-specific in that they stem from
      strong interference with hydrophobic side-chain association, regardless of the
      residues' location and peptide sequence. Our studies provide molecular-level
      insights into how polyphenols inhibit Abeta fibril formation, knowledge that
      could be useful for designing amyloid inhibitors.

AB  - The functionally important switch loop of the trimeric multidrug transporter AcrB
      separates the access and deep drug binding pockets in every protomer. This loop, 
      comprising 11-amino-acid residues, has been shown to be crucial for substrate
      transport, as drugs have to travel past the loop to reach the deep binding pocket
      and from there are transported outside the cell via the connected AcrA and TolC
      channels. It contains four symmetrically arranged glycine residues suggesting
      that flexibility is a key feature for pump activity. Upon combinatorial
      substitution of these glycine residues to proline, functional and structural
      asymmetry was observed. Proline substitutions on the PC1-proximal side completely
      abolished transport and reduced backbone flexibility of the switch loop, which
      adopted a conformation restricting the pathway toward the deep binding pocket.
      Two phenylalanine residues located adjacent to the substitution sensitive glycine
      residues play a role in blocking the pathway upon rigidification of the loop,
      since the removal of the phenyl rings from the rigid loop restores drug transport
      activity.

AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) recognize their partners through
      molecular recognition elements (MoREs). The MoRE of the C-terminal intrinsically 
      disordered domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein (NTAIL) is partly
      pre-configured as an alpha-helix in the free form and undergoes alpha-helical
      folding upon binding to the X domain (XD) of the viral phosphoprotein. Beyond XD,
      NTAIL also binds the major inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70). So far, no
      structural information is available for the NTAIL/hsp70 complex. Using mutational
      studies combined with a protein complementation assay based on green fluorescent 
      protein reconstitution, we have investigated both NTAIL/XD and NTAIL/hsp70
      interactions. Although the same NTAIL region binds the two partners, the binding 
      mechanisms are different. Hsp70 binding is much more tolerant of MoRE
      substitutions than XD, and the majority of substitutions lead to an increased
      NTAIL/hsp70 interaction strength. Furthermore, while an increased and a decreased
      alpha-helicity of the MoRE lead to enhanced and reduced interaction strength with
      XD, respectively, the impact on hsp70 binding is negligible, suggesting that the 
      MoRE does not adopt an alpha-helical conformation once bound to hsp70. Here, by
      showing that the alpha-helical conformation sampled by the free form of the MoRE 
      does not systematically commit it to adopt an alpha-helical conformation in the
      bound form, we provide an example of partner-mediated polymorphism of an IDP and 
      of the relative insensitiveness of the bound structure to the pre-recognition
      state. The present results therefore contribute to shed light on the molecular
      mechanisms by which IDPs recognize different partners.

AB  - The Escherichia coli holo-(acyl carrier protein) synthase (ACPS) catalyzes the
      coenzyme A-dependent activation of apo-ACPP to generate holo-(acyl carrier
      protein) (holo-ACPP) in an early step of fatty acid biosynthesis. E. coli ACPS is
      sufficiently different from the human fatty acid synthase to justify the
      development of novel ACPS-targeting antibiotics. Models of E. coli ACPS in
      unliganded and holo-ACPP-bound forms solved by X-ray crystallography to 2.05and
      4.10A, respectively, revealed that ACPS bound three product holo-ACPP molecules
      to form a 3:3 hexamer. Solution NMR spectroscopy experiments validated the ACPS
      binding interface on holo-ACPP using chemical shift perturbations and by
      determining the relative orientation of holo-ACPP to ACPS by fitting residual
      dipolar couplings. The binding interface is organized to arrange contacts between
      positively charged ACPS residues and the holo-ACPP phosphopantetheine moiety,
      indicating product contains more stabilizing interactions than expected in the
      enzyme:substrate complex. Indeed, holo-ACPP bound the enzyme with greater
      affinity than the substrate, apo-ACPP, and with negative cooperativity. The first
      equivalent of holo-ACPP bound with a KD=62+/-13nM, followed by the binding of two
      more equivalents of holo-ACPP with KD=1.2+/-0.2muM. Cooperativity was not
      observed for apo-ACPP which bound with KD=2.4+/-0.1muM. Strong product binding
      and high levels of holo-ACPP in the cell identify a potential regulatory role of 
      ACPS in fatty acid biosynthesis.

AB  - Sox2 and Pax6 co-regulate genes in neural lineages and the lens by forming a
      ternary complex likely facilitated allosterically through DNA. We used the
      quantitative and scalable cooperativity-by-sequencing (Coop-seq) approach to
      interrogate Sox2/Pax6 dimerization on a DNA library where five positions of the
      Pax6 half-site were randomized yielding 1024 cooperativity factors. Consensus
      positions normally required for the high-affinity DNA binding by Pax6 need to be 
      mutated for effective dimerization with Sox2. Out of the five randomized bases, a
      5' thymidine is present in most of the top ranking elements. However, this
      thymidine maps to a region outside of the Pax half site and is not expected to
      directly interact with Pax6 in known binding modes suggesting structural
      reconfigurations. Re-analysis of ChIP-seq data identified several genomic regions
      where the cooperativity promoting sequence pattern is co-bound by Sox2 and Pax6. 
      A highly conserved Sox2/Pax6 bound site near the Sprouty2 locus was verified to
      promote cooperative dimerization designating Sprouty2 as a potential target
      reliant on Sox2/Pax6 cooperativity in several neural cell types. Collectively,
      the functional interplay of Sox2 and Pax6 demands the relaxation of high-affinity
      binding sites and is enabled by alternative DNA sequences. We conclude that this 
      binding mode evolved to warrant that a subset of target genes is only regulated
      in the presence of suitable partner factors.

AB  - DDX3X is a conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase involved in translation initiation and
      other processes of RNA metabolism. Mutations in human DDX3X and deregulation of
      its expression are linked to tumorigenesis and intellectual disability. The
      protein is also targeted by diverse viruses. Previous studies demonstrated
      helicase and NTPase activities for DDX3X, but important biochemical features of
      the enzyme remain unclear. Here, we systematically characterize enzymatic
      activities of human DDX3X and compare these to its closely related Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae ortholog Ded1p. We show that DDX3X, like Ded1p, utilizes exclusively
      adenosine triphosphates to unwind helices, oligomerizes to function as efficient 
      RNA helicase, and does not unwind DNA duplexes. The ATPase activity of DDX3X is
      markedly stimulated by RNA and weaker by DNA, although DNA binds to the enzyme.
      For RNA unwinding, DDX3X shows a greater preference than Ded1p for substrates
      with unpaired regions 3' to the duplex over those with 5' unpaired regions. DDX3X
      separates longer RNA duplexes faster than Ded1p and is less potent than Ded1p in 
      facilitating strand annealing. Our results reveal that the biochemical activities
      of human DDX3X are typical for DEAD-box RNA helicases, but diverge quantitatively
      from its highly similar S. cerevisiae ortholog Ded1p.

AB  - Peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) traffic to peroxisomes by two mechanisms:
      direct insertion from the cytosol into the peroxisomal membrane and indirect
      trafficking to peroxisomes via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In mammals and
      yeast, several PMPs traffic via the ER in a Pex3- and Pex19-dependent manner. In 
      Komagataella phaffii (formerly called Pichia pastoris) specifically, the indirect
      traffic of Pex2, but not of Pex11 or Pex17, depends on Pex3, but all PMPs tested 
      for indirect trafficking require Pex19. In mammals, the indirect traffic of PMPs 
      also requires PEX16, a protein that is absent in most yeast species. In this
      study, we isolated PEX36, a new gene in K. phaffii, which encodes a PMP. Pex36 is
      required for cell growth in conditions that require peroxisomes for the
      metabolism of certain carbon sources. This growth defect in cells lacking Pex36
      can be rescued by the expression of human PEX16, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex34, 
      or by overexpression of the endogenous K. phaffii Pex25. Pex36 is not an
      essential protein for peroxisome proliferation, but in the absence of the
      functionally redundant protein, Pex25, it becomes essential and less than 20% of 
      these cells show import-incompetent, peroxisome-like structures (peroxisome
      remnants). In the absence of both proteins, peroxisome biogenesis and the
      intra-ER sorting of Pex2 and Pex11C are seriously impaired, likely by affecting
      Pex3 and Pex19 function.

      Supercoiling by Gyrase.

AB  - Topoisomerases catalyze the relaxation, supercoiling, catenation, and
      decatenation of DNA. Gyrase is a bacterial topoisomerase that introduces negative
      supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. The enzyme consists of two GyrB
      subunits, containing the ATPase domains, and two GyrA subunits. Nucleotide
      binding to gyrase B GyrB causes closing of the N-gate in gyrase, which orients
      bound DNA for supercoiling. N-gate re-opening after ATP hydrolysis, at the end of
      the supercoiling reaction, resets the enzyme for subsequent catalytic cycles.
      Gyrase binds and hydrolyzes two ATP molecules per catalytic cycle. Here, we
      dissect the role of these two binding and hydrolysis events using gyrase with one
      ATP-binding- and hydrolysis-deficient subunit, or with one binding-competent, but
      hydrolysis-deficient ATPase domain. We show that binding of a single ATP molecule
      induces N-gate closure. Gyrase that can only bind and hydrolyze a single ATP
      undergoes opening and closing of the N-gate in synchrony with ATP hydrolysis, and
      promotes DNA supercoiling under catalytic conditions. In contrast, gyrase that
      can bind two ATP molecules, but hydrolyzes only one, only supercoils DNA under
      stoichiometric conditions. Here, ATP bound to the hydrolysis-deficient subunit
      keeps the N-gate closed after hydrolysis of the other ATP and prevents further
      turnovers. Gyrase with only one functional ATPase domain hydrolyzes ATP with a
      similar rate to wild-type, but its supercoiling efficiency is reduced. Binding
      and hydrolysis of the second ATP may thus ensure efficient coupling of the
      nucleotide cycle with the supercoiling reaction by stabilizing the closed N-gate 
      and by acting as a timer for N-gate re-opening.

AB  - In bacteria, trans-translation is the main quality control mechanism for rescuing
      ribosomes arrested during translation. This key process is universally conserved 
      and plays a critical role in the viability and virulence of many pathogens. We
      developed a reliable in vivo double-fluorescence reporter system for the
      simultaneous quantification of both trans-translation and the associated
      proteolysis activities in bacteria. The assay was validated using mutant bacteria
      lacking tmRNA, SmpB, and the ClpP protease. Both antisense tmRNA-binding RNA and 
      a peptide mimicking the SmpB C-terminal tail proved to be potent inhibitors of
      trans-translation in vivo. The double-fluorescent reporter was also tested with
      KKL-35, an oxadiazole derivative that is supposed to be a promising
      trans-translation inhibitor, and it surprisingly turns out that trans-translation
      is not the only target of KKL-35 in vivo.

AB  - Robo receptors play pivotal roles in axonal guidance as well as in neurogenesis, 
      angiogenesis, cell migration, and cancer progression and invasiveness. They are
      considered to be attractive drug targets for the treatment of cancer, ocular
      neovascular disorders, chronic kidney diseases, and more. Despite their great
      importance, the mechanisms by which Robo receptors switch from their "off" to
      "on" states remain obscure. One possibility involves a monomer-to-dimer or
      dimer-to-monomer transition that facilitates the recruitment and activation of
      enzymatic effectors to instigate intracellular signaling. However, it is not
      known which domains mediate Robo dimerization, or the structural properties of
      the dimeric interactions. Here, we identify the extracellular Ig4 (D4) as a Robo 
      dimerization domain. We have determined the crystal structure of the tandem Ig4-5
      domains (D4-5) of human Robo2 and found that a hydrophobic surface on D4 mediates
      close homotypic contacts with a reciprocal D4. Analytical ultracentrifugation
      measurements of intact and mutated D4-5 shows that dimerization through the D4
      interface is specific and has a dimerization dissociation constant of 16.9muM in 
      solution. Direct fluorescence resonance energy transfer dimerization measurements
      in HEK293 cells corroborate the dimerization of transmembrane hRobo2 through D4, 
      and a functional COS-7 cell collapse assay links D4-mediated dimerization with
      Robo intracellular signaling. The high level of conservation in the D4
      dimerization interface throughout all Robo orthologs and paralogs implies that
      D4-mediated dimerization is a central hallmark in Robo activation and signaling.

AB  - Coarse-grained models represent attractive approaches to analyze and simulate
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, for example, for structure prediction and
      design, as they simplify the RNA structure to reduce the conformational search
      space. Our structure prediction protocol RAGTOP (RNA-As-Graphs Topology
      Prediction) represents RNA structures as tree graphs and samples graph topologies
      to produce candidate graphs. However, for a more detailed study and analysis,
      construction of atomic from coarse-grained models is required. Here we present
      our graph-based fragment assembly algorithm (F-RAG) to convert candidate
      three-dimensional (3D) tree graph models, produced by RAGTOP into atomic
      structures. We use our related RAG-3D utilities to partition graphs into
      subgraphs and search for structurally similar atomic fragments in a data set of
      RNA 3D structures. The fragments are edited and superimposed using common
      residues, full atomic models are scored using RAGTOP's knowledge-based potential,
      and geometries of top scoring models is optimized. To evaluate our models, we
      assess all-atom RMSDs and Interaction Network Fidelity (a measure of residue
      interactions) with respect to experimentally solved structures and compare our
      results to other fragment assembly programs. For a set of 50 RNA structures, we
      obtain atomic models with reasonable geometries and interactions, particularly

AB  - Microtubules are highly dynamic tubulin polymers that are required for a variety 
      of cellular functions. Despite the importance of a cellular population of tubulin
      dimers, we have incomplete information about the mechanisms involved in the
      biogenesis of alphabeta-tubulin heterodimers. In addition to prefoldin and the
      TCP-1 Ring Complex, five tubulin-specific chaperones, termed cofactors A-E
      (TBCA-E), and GTP are required for the folding of alpha- and beta-tubulin
      subunits and assembly into heterodimers. We recently described the purification
      of a novel trimer, TBCD*ARL2*beta-tubulin. Here, we employed hydrogen/deuterium
      exchange coupled with mass spectrometry to explore the dynamics of each of the
      proteins in the trimer. Addition of guanine nucleotides resulted in changes in
      the solvent accessibility of regions of each protein that led to predictions
      about each's role in tubulin folding. Initial testing of that model confirmed
      that it is ARL2, and not beta-tubulin, that exchanges GTP in the trimer.
      Comparisons of the dynamics of ARL2 monomer to ARL2 in the trimer suggested that 
      its protein interactions were comparable to those of a canonical GTPase with an
      effector. This was supported by the use of nucleotide-binding assays that
      revealed an increase in the affinity for GTP by ARL2 in the trimer. We conclude
      that the TBCD*ARL2*beta-tubulin complex represents a functional intermediate in
      the beta-tubulin folding pathway whose activity is regulated by the cycling of
      nucleotides on ARL2. The co-purification of guanine nucleotide on the
      beta-tubulin in the trimer is also shown, with implications to modeling the
      pathway.

AB  - Eukaryotic alpha-arrestins connect environmental or stress signaling pathways to 
      the endocytosis of plasma membrane transporters or receptors. The Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae lactate transporter Jen1p has been used as a model cargo for
      elucidating the mechanisms underlying endocytic turnover in response to carbon
      sources. Here, we discover a novel pathway of Jen1p endocytosis mediated by the
      alpha-arrestin Bul1p in response to the presence of cycloheximide or rapamycin,
      or prolonged growth in lactate. While cycloheximide or rapamycin modify cells
      pleiotropically, the major effect of prolonged growth in lactate was shown to be 
      external pH alkalinization. Importantly, employment of specific inactive Jen1p
      versions showed that Bul1p-dependent endocytosis requires lactate transport,
      according to the signal imposed. Our results support a model where conformational
      changes of Jen1p, associated with substrate/H(+) symport, are critical for the
      efficiency of Bul1p-dependent Jen1p turnover.

AB  - Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family proteins are conserved chromatin binding
      proteins involved in gene silencing, chromosome packaging, and chromosome
      segregation. These proteins recognize histone H3 lysine 9 methylated tails via
      their chromodomain and recruit additional ligand proteins with diverse activities
      through their dimerization domain, the chromoshadow domain. Species that have HP1
      proteins possess multiple paralogs that perform non-overlapping roles in vivo.
      How different HP1 proteins, which are highly conserved, perform different
      functions is not well understood. Here, we use the two Schizosaccharomyces pombe 
      HP1 paralogs, Swi6 and Chp2, as model systems to compare and contrast their
      biophysical properties. We find that Swi6 and Chp2 have similar dimerization and 
      oligomerization equilibria, and that Swi6 binds slightly (~3-fold) more strongly 
      to nucleosomes than Chp2. Furthermore, while Swi6 binding to the H3K9me3 mark is 
      regulated by a previously described auto-inhibition mechanism, the binding of
      Chp2 to the H3K9me3 mark is not analogously regulated. In the context of
      chromoshadow domain interactions, we show using a newly identified peptide
      sequence from the Clr3 histone deacetylase and a previously identified sequence
      from the protein Shugoshin that the Swi6 chromoshadow domain binds both ligands
      more strongly than the Chp2. Overall, our findings uncover quantitative
      differences in how Swi6 and Chp2 interact with nucleosomal and non-nucleosomal
      ligands and qualitative differences in how their assembly on nucleosomes is
      regulated. These findings provide a biochemical framework to explain the varied
      functions of Chp2 and Swi6 in vivo.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the self-assembly of tau and amyloid beta
      proteins into oligomers and fibrils. Tau protein assembles into paired helical
      filaments (PHFs) that constitute the neurofibrillary tangles observed in neuronal
      cell bodies in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism of initiation 
      of tau assembly into PHFs is not well understood. Here we report that a truncated
      95-amino-acid tau fragment (corresponding to residues 297-391 of full-length tau)
      assembles into PHF-like fibrils in vitro without the need for other additives to 
      initiate or template the process. Using electron microscopy, circular dichroism
      and X-ray fiber diffraction, we have characterized the structure of the fibrils
      formed from truncated tau for the first time. To explore the contribution of
      disulfide formation to fibril formation, we have compared the assembly of
      tau(297-391) under reduced and non-reducing conditions and for truncated tau
      carrying a C322A substitution. We show that disulfide bond formation inhibits
      filament assembly and that the C322A variant rapidly forms long and highly
      ordered PHFs.

AB  - The biogenesis of outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) in gram-negative bacteria
      involves delivery by periplasmic chaperones to the beta-barrel assembly machinery
      (BAM), which catalyzes OMP insertion into the outer membrane. Here, we examine
      the effects of membrane thickness, the Escherichia coli periplasmic chaperones
      Skp and SurA, and BamA, the central subunit of the BAM complex, on the folding
      kinetics of a model OMP (tOmpA) using fluorescence spectroscopy, native mass
      spectrometry, and molecular dynamics simulations. We show that prefolded BamA
      promotes the release of tOmpA from Skp despite the nM affinity of the Skp:tOmpA
      complex. This activity is located in the BamA beta-barrel domain, but is greater 
      when full-length BamA is present, indicating that both the beta-barrel and
      polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains are required for maximal
      activity. By contrast, SurA is unable to release tOmpA from Skp, providing direct
      evidence against a sequential chaperone model. By varying lipid acyl chain length
      in synthetic liposomes we show that BamA has a greater catalytic effect on tOmpA 
      folding in thicker bilayers, suggesting that BAM catalysis involves lowering of
      the kinetic barrier imposed by the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane.
      Consistent with this, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that increases in
      membrane thinning/disorder by the transmembrane domain of BamA is greatest in
      thicker bilayers. Finally, we demonstrate that cross-linking of the BamA barrel
      does not affect tOmpA folding kinetics in
      1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) liposomes, suggesting that
      lateral gating of the BamA barrel and/or hybrid barrel formation is not required,
      at least for the assembly of a small 8-stranded OMP in vitro.

AB  - Knowledge of RNA three-dimensional topological structures provides important
      insight into the relationship between RNA structural components and function. It 
      is often likely that near-complete sets of biochemical and biophysical data
      containing structural restraints are not available, but one still wants to obtain
      knowledge about approximate topological folding of RNA. In this regard, general
      methods for determining such topological structures with minimum readily
      available restraints are lacking. Naked RNAs are difficult to crystallize and NMR
      spectroscopy is generally limited to small RNA fragments. By nature, sequence
      determines structure and all interactions that drive folding are self-contained
      within sequence. Nevertheless, there is little apparent correlation between
      primary sequences and three-dimensional folding unless supplemented with
      experimental or phylogenetic data. Thus, there is an acute need for a robust
      high-throughput method that can rapidly determine topological structures of RNAs 
      guided by some experimental data. We present here a novel method (RS3D) that can 
      assimilate the RNA secondary structure information, small-angle X-ray scattering 
      data, and any readily available tertiary contact information to determine the
      topological fold of RNA. Conformations are firstly sampled at glob level where
      each glob represents a nucleotide. Best-ranked glob models can be further refined
      against solvent accessibility data, if available, and then converted to explicit 
      all-atom coordinates for refinement against SAXS data using the Xplor-NIH
      program. RS3D is widely applicable to a variety of RNA folding architectures
      currently present in the structure database. Furthermore, we demonstrate
      applicability and feasibility of the program to derive low-resolution topological
      structures of relatively large multi-domain RNAs.

AB  - Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident "first responders" of the immune
      system that function to protect epithelial barriers against pathogens and
      maintain tissue homeostasis. However, because ILCs are finely tuned to
      perturbations within tissue microenvironments, they can also contribute to host
      pathology when upstream activating signals are dysregulated. Recent work has
      demonstrated that the crosstalk between ILCs and their environment has a
      significant impact on host metabolism in health and disease. In this brief
      review, we summarize recent studies that demonstrate the ability of ILCs to
      influence tissue and systemic metabolism, as well as how ILC biology can be
      regulated by environmental changes in host metabolism. We also highlight studies 
      showing how ILC-intrinsic metabolism influences their activation, proliferation, 
      and homeostasis. Finally, this review discusses the challenges and open questions
      in the rapidly expanding field of immunometabolism.

AB  - LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) is a novel form of non-canonical autophagy
      where LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) is conjugated to
      phagosome membranes using a portion of the canonical autophagy machinery. The
      impact of LAP to immune regulation is best characterized in professional
      phagocytes, in particular macrophages, where LAP has instrumental roles in the
      clearance of extracellular particles including apoptotic cells and pathogens.
      Binding of dead cells via receptors present on the macrophage surface results in 
      the translocation of the autophagy machinery to the phagosome and ultimately LC3 
      conjugation. These events promote a rapid form of phagocytosis that produces an
      "immunologically silent" clearance of the apoptotic cells. Consequences of LAP
      deficiency include a decreased capacity to clear dying cells and the
      establishment of a lupus-like autoimmune disease in mice. The ability of LAP to
      attenuate autoimmunity likely occurs through the dampening of pro-inflammatory
      signals upon engulfment of dying cells and prevention of autoantigen presentation
      to other immune cells. However, it remains unclear how LAP shapes both the
      activation and outcome of the immune response at the molecular level. Herein, we 
      provide a detailed review of LAP and its known roles in the immune response and
      provide further speculation on the putative mechanisms by which LAP may regulate 
      immune function, perhaps through the metabolic reprogramming and polarization of 
      macrophages.

AB  - Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-modifying enzymes play critical roles in a wide variety
      of intracellular signaling pathways. Inflammatory signaling cascades downstream
      of TNF, TLR agonists, antigen receptor cross-linking, and cytokine receptors, all
      rely on ubiquitination events to direct subsequent immune responses. In the past 
      several years, inflammasome activation and subsequent signal transduction have
      emerged as an excellent example of how ubiquitin signals control inflammatory
      responses. Inflammasomes are multiprotein signaling complexes that ultimately
      lead to caspase activation and release of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family
      members, IL-1beta and IL-18. Inflammasome activation is critical for the host's
      defense against pathogens, but dysregulation of inflammasomes may contribute to
      the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. Ultimately, understanding how various
      ubiquitin interacting proteins control inflammatory signaling cascades could
      provide new pathways for therapeutic intervention. Here we review specific
      ubiquitin-modifying enzymes and ubiquitination events that orchestrate
      inflammatory responses, with an emphasis on the NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - Three deubiquitinating enzymes-Rpn11, Usp14, and Uch37-are associated with the
      proteasome regulatory particle. These enzymes allow proteasomes to remove
      ubiquitin from substrates before they are translocated into the core particle to 
      be degraded. Although the translocation channel is too narrow for folded
      proteins, the force of translocation unfolds them mechanically. As translocation 
      proceeds, ubiquitin chains bound to substrate are drawn to the channel's entry
      port, where they can impede further translocation. Rpn11, situated over the port,
      can remove these chains without compromising degradation because substrates must 
      be irreversibly committed to degradation before Rpn11 acts. This coupling between
      deubiquitination and substrate degradation is ensured by the Ins-1 loop of Rpn11,
      which controls ubiquitin access to its catalytic site. In contrast to Rpn11,
      Usp14 and Uch37 can rescue substrates from degradation by promoting substrate
      dissociation from the proteasome prior to the commitment step. Uch37 is unique in
      being a component of both the proteasome and a second multisubunit assembly, the 
      INO80 complex. However, only recruitment into the proteasome activates Uch37.
      Recruitment to the proteasome likewise activates Usp14. However, the influence of
      Usp14 on the proteasome depends on the substrate, due to its marked preference
      for proteins that carry multiple ubiquitin chains. Usp14 exerts complex control
      over the proteasome, suppressing proteasome activity even when inactive in
      deubiquitination. A major challenge for the field will be to elucidate the
      specificities of Rpn11, Usp14, and Uch37 in greater depth, employing not only
      model in vitro substrates but also their endogenous targets.

AB  - Ubiquitin is a small protein that enables one of the most common
      post-translational modifications, where the whole ubiquitin molecule is attached 
      to various target proteins, forming mono- or polyubiquitin conjugations. As a
      prototypical multispecific protein, ubiquitin interacts non-covalently with a
      variety of proteins in the cell, including ubiquitin-modifying enzymes and
      ubiquitin receptors that recognize signals from ubiquitin-conjugated substrates. 
      To enable recognition of multiple targets and to support fast dissociation from
      the ubiquitin modifying enzymes, ubiquitin/protein interactions are characterized
      with low affinities, frequently in the higher muM and lower mM range. To
      determine how structure encodes low binding affinity of ubiquitin/protein
      complexes, we analyzed structures of more than a hundred such complexes compiled 
      in the Ubiquitin Structural Relational Database. We calculated various
      structure-based features of ubiquitin/protein binding interfaces and compared
      them to the same features of general protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with
      various functions and generally higher affinities. Our analysis shows that
      ubiquitin/protein binding interfaces on average do not differ in size and shape
      complementarity from interfaces of higher-affinity PPIs. However, they contain
      fewer favorable hydrogen bonds and more unfavorable hydrophobic/charge
      interactions. We further analyzed how binding interfaces change upon affinity
      maturation of ubiquitin toward its target proteins. We demonstrate that while
      different features are improved in different experiments, the majority of the
      evolved complexes exhibit better shape complementarity and hydrogen bond pattern 
      compared to wild-type complexes. Our analysis helps to understand how
      low-affinity PPIs have evolved and how they could be converted into high-affinity
      PPIs.

AB  - Covalent, reversible, post-translational modification of cellular proteins with
      the small modifier, ubiquitin (Ub), regulates virtually every known cellular
      process in eukaryotes. The process is carried out by a trio of enzymes: a
      Ub-activating (E1) enzyme, a Ub-conjugating (E2) enzyme, and a Ub ligase (E3)
      enzyme. RING-in-Between-RING (RBR) E3s constitute one of three classes of E3
      ligases and are defined by a RING-HECT-hybrid mechanism that utilizes a
      E2-binding RING domain and a second domain (called RING2) that contains an active
      site Cys required for the formation of an obligatory E3~Ub intermediate. Albeit a
      small class, RBR E3s in humans regulate diverse cellular process. This review
      focuses on non-Parkin members such as HOIP/HOIL-1L (the only E3s known to
      generate linear Ub chains), HHARI and TRIAD1, both of which have been recently
      demonstrated to work together with Cullin RING E3 ligases. We provide a brief
      historical background and highlight, summarize, and discuss recent developments
      in the young field of RBR E3s. Insights reviewed here include new understandings 
      of the RBR Ub-transfer mechanism, specifically the role of RING1 and various
      Ub-binding sites, brief structural comparisons among members, and different modes
      of auto-inhibition and activation.

AB  - Post-translational modification of cellular proteins by ubiquitin regulates
      numerous cellular processes, including innate and adaptive immune responses.
      Ubiquitin-mediated control over these processes can be reversed by cellular
      deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin from cellular targets and
      depolymerize polyubiquitin chains. The importance of protein ubiquitination to
      host immunity has been underscored by the discovery of viruses that encode
      proteases with deubiquitinating activity, many of which have been demonstrated to
      actively corrupt cellular ubiquitin-dependent processes to suppress innate
      antiviral responses and promote viral replication. DUBs have now been identified 
      in diverse viral lineages, and their characterization is providing valuable
      insights into virus biology and the role of the ubiquitin system in host
      antiviral mechanisms. Here, we provide an overview of the structural biology of
      these fascinating viral enzymes and their role innate immune evasion and viral
      replication.

AB  - Attachment of ubiquitin to proteins relies on a sophisticated enzyme cascade that
      is tightly regulated. The machinery of ubiquitylation responds to a range of
      signals, which remarkably includes ubiquitin itself. Thus, ubiquitin is not only 
      the central player in the ubiquitylation cascade but also a key regulator. The
      ubiquitin E3 ligases provide specificity to the cascade and often bind the
      substrate, while the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) have a pivotal role in
      determining chain linkage and length. Interaction of ubiquitin with the E2 is
      important for activity, but the weak nature of these contacts has made them hard 
      to identify and study. By reviewing available crystal structures, we identify
      putative ubiquitin binding sites on E2s, which may enhance E2 processivity and
      the assembly of chains of a defined linkage. The implications of these new sites 
      are discussed in the context of known E2-ubiquitin interactions.

AB  - Ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation is a critical signalling process in eukaryotic cells. 
      The precise regulation of deubiquitination is an important component of this
      signalling cascade. Here, we discuss how USP7 (or Herpes-Associated
      Ubiquitin-Specific Protease, HAUSP), one of the most abundant deubiquitinating
      enzymes, is regulated by complex formation with regulatory proteins and targets. 
      Full activity of USP7 requires that its C-terminal Ub-like domains fold back onto
      the catalytic domain, to allow the remodelling of the active site to a
      catalytically competent state by the very C-terminal peptide. This regulatory
      mode can be modulated by complex formation with other proteins. USP7 is found in 
      a large number of relatively stable complexes with different possible functions. 
      Complex formation can provide recruitment of a target, bring in an E3 Ub ligase, 
      or modulate the activation of the deubiquitinating enzyme activity. These
      complexes make up potential cellular "switches", using their (de)ubiquitination
      ability to switch pathways on or off upon cellular signals. Here, we summarize
      what is known for USP7 complexes, focussing on the prevalence of E3 Ub ligases
      and how complex formation can affect Ub switches.

AB  - Post-translational modification of the p53 signaling pathway plays an important
      role in cell cycle progression and stress-induced apoptosis. Indeed, a large body
      of work has shown that dysregulation of p53 and its E3 ligase MDM2 by the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) promotes carcinogenesis and malignant
      transformation. Thus, drug discovery efforts have focused on the restoration of
      wild-type p53 activity or inactivation of oncogenic mutant p53 by targeted
      inhibition of UPS components, particularly key deubiquitinases (DUBs) of the
      ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) class. However, development of selective
      small-molecule USP inhibitors has been challenging, partly due to the highly
      conserved structural features of the catalytic sites across the class. To tackle 
      this problem, we devised a protein engineering strategy for rational design of
      inhibitors for DUBs and other UPS proteins. We employed a phage-displayed
      ubiquitin variant (UbV) library to develop inhibitors targeting the DUBs USP7 and
      USP10, which are involved in regulating levels of p53 and MDM2. We were able to
      identify UbVs that bound USP7 or USP10 with high affinity and inhibited
      deubiquitination activity. We solved the crystal structure of UbV.7.2 and
      rationalized the molecular basis for enhanced affinity and specificity for USP7. 
      Finally, cell death was increased significantly by UbV.7.2 expression in a colon 
      cancer cell line that was treated with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin,
      demonstrating the therapeutic potential of inhibiting USP7 by this approach.

AB  - Cells are exposed to thousands of DNA damage events on a daily basis. This damage
      must be repaired to preserve genetic information and prevent development of
      disease. The most deleterious damage is a double-strand break (DSB), which is
      detected and repaired by mechanisms known as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
      and homologous recombination (HR), which are components of the DNA damage
      response system. NHEJ is an error-prone first line of defense, whereas HR invokes
      error-free repair and is the focus of this review. The functions of the protein
      components of HR-driven DNA repair are regulated by the coordinated action of
      post-translational modifications including lysine acetylation, phosphorylation,
      ubiquitination, and SUMOylation. The latter two mechanisms are fundamental for
      recognition of DSBs and reorganizing chromatin to facilitate repair. We focus on 
      the structures and molecular mechanisms for the protein components underlying
      synthesis, recognition, and cleavage of K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which are
      abundant at damage sites and obligatory for DSB repair. The forward flux of the
      K63-linked ubiquitination cascade is driven by the combined activity of E1
      enzyme, the heterodimeric E2 Mms2-Ubc13, and its cognate E3 ligases RNF8 and
      RNF168, which is balanced through the binding and cleavage of chains by the
      deubiquitinase BRCC36, and the proteasome, and through the binding of chains by
      recognition modules on repair proteins such as RAP80. We highlight a number of
      aspects regarding our current understanding for the role of kinetics and dynamics
      in determining the function of the enzymes and chain recognition modules that
      drive K63 ubiquitination.

AB  - The eukaryotic 26S proteasome is a large multisubunit complex that degrades the
      majority of proteins in the cell under normal conditions. The 26S proteasome can 
      be divided into two subcomplexes: the 19S regulatory particle and the 20S core
      particle. Most substrates are first covalently modified by ubiquitin, which then 
      directs them to the proteasome. The function of the regulatory particle is to
      recognize, unfold, deubiquitylate, and translocate substrates into the core
      particle, which contains the proteolytic sites of the proteasome. Given the
      abundance and subunit complexity of the proteasome, the assembly of this ~2.5MDa 
      complex must be carefully orchestrated to ensure its correct formation. In recent
      years, significant progress has been made in the understanding of proteasome
      assembly, structure, and function. Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy
      have resulted in a series of atomic cryo-electron microscopy structures of both
      human and yeast 26S proteasomes. These structures have illuminated new
      intricacies and dynamics of the proteasome. In this review, we focus on the
      mechanisms of proteasome assembly, particularly in light of recent structural
      information.

AB  - In recent years, our knowledge of the varied role that ubiquitination plays in
      promoting signal amplification, novel protein interactions, and protein turnover 
      has progressed rapidly. This is particularly remarkable in the examination of how
      DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are repaired, with many components of the
      ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation, de-conjugation, and recognition machinery now
      identified as key factors in DSB repair. In addition, a member of the Ub-like
      family, small Ub-like modifier (SUMO), has also been recognised as integral for
      efficient repair. Here, we summarise our emerging understanding of SUMOylation
      both as a distinct modification and as a cooperative modification with Ub, using 
      the cellular response to DNA DSBs as the primary setting to compare these
      modifications.

AB  - Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) and the modification enzymes involved in
      attaching Pup to or removing it from target proteins present a fascinating
      example of convergent evolution with respect to eukaryotic ubiquitination. Like
      ubiquitin (Ub), Pup is a small protein that can be covalently attached to lysine 
      side chains of cellular proteins, and like Ub, it can serve to recruit tagged
      proteins for proteasomal degradation. However, unlike Ub, Pup is conformationally
      highly dynamic, exhibits a different linkage connectivity to its target lysines, 
      and its ligase belongs to a different class of enzymes than the E1/E2/E3 cascade 
      of ubiquitination. A specific feature of actinobacteria (aside from sporadic
      cases in a few other lineages), pupylation appears to have evolved to provide an 
      advantage to the bacteria under certain environmental stresses rather than act as
      a constitutive modification. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pupylation and the
      recruitment of pupylated substrates to the proteasome support persistence inside 
      host macrophages during pathogenesis, rendering the Pup-proteasome system an
      attractive drug target. In this review, we consider the dynamic nature of Pup in 
      relation to its function, discuss the reaction mechanisms of ligation to
      substrates and cleavage from pupylated substrates, and put them in context of the
      evolutionary history of this post-translational modification.

AB  - Post-translational protein modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifiers
      is orchestrated by the sequential action of Ub-activating, -conjugating, and
      -ligating enzymes to regulate a vast array of fundamental biological processes.
      Unsurprisingly, the dysregulation of the intricate interplay between
      ubiquitination and deubiquitination gives rise to numerous pathologies, most
      notably cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. While activity-based probes (ABPs)
      and assay reagents have been extensively developed and applied for
      deubiquitinating enzymes, similar tools for the Ub cascade have only recently
      emerged. Given the recent efforts to develop inhibitors for the Ub system, the
      urgency for developing ABPs and assay reagents is imminent. In this light, we
      comprehensively discuss the currently available ABPs with a focus on the newly
      developed reagents targeting the Ub cascade while illustrating their potential
      applications.

AB  - To untangle the complex signaling of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) isoforms, 
      we need tools that can selectively detect and inhibit individual isoforms.
      Because of the high similarity between JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3, it is very difficult 
      to generate small-molecule inhibitors with this discriminatory power. Thus, we
      have recently selected protein binders from the designed ankyrin repeat protein
      (DARPin) library which were indeed isoform-specific inhibitors of JNK1 with low
      nanomolar potency. Here we provide the structural basis for their isotype
      discrimination and their inhibitory action. All our previous attempts to generate
      crystal structures of complexes had failed. We have now made use of a technology 
      we recently developed which consists of rigid fusion of an additional special
      DARPin, which acts as a crystallization enhancer. This can be rigidly fused with 
      different geometries, thereby generating a range of alternative crystal packings.
      The structures reveal the molecular basis for isoform specificity of the DARPins 
      and their ability to prevent JNK activation and may thus form the basis of
      further investigation of the JNK family as well as novel approaches to drug
      design.

AB  - Viruses have compact genomes that encode limited number of proteins in comparison
      to other biological entities. Interestingly, viral proteins have shown natural
      abundance of either completely disordered proteins that are recognized as
      intrinsically disorder proteins (IDPs) or partially disordered segments known as 
      intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). IDPRs are involved in
      interactions with multiple binding partners to accomplish signaling, regulation, 
      and control functions in cells. Tuning of IDPs and IDPRs are mediated through
      post-translational modification and alternative splicing. Often, the interactions
      of IDPRs with their binding protein partner(s) lead to transition from the state 
      of disorder to ordered form. Such interaction-prone protein IDPRs are identified 
      as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Molecular recognition is an important 
      initial step for the biomolecular interactions and their functional proceedings. 
      Although previous studies have established occurrence of the IDPRs in Zika virus 
      proteome, which provide the functional diversity and structural plasticity to
      viral proteins, the MoRF analysis has not been performed as of yet. Many
      computational methods have been developed for the identification of the MoRFs in 
      protein sequences including ANCHOR, MoRFpred, DISOPRED3, and MoRFchibi_web
      server. In the current study, we have investigated the presence of MoRF regions
      in structural and non-structural proteins of Zika virus using an aforementioned
      set of computational techniques. Furthermore, we have experimentally validated
      the intrinsic disorderness of NS2B cofactor region of NS2B-NS3 protease. NS2B has
      one of the longest MoRF regions in Zika virus proteome. In future, this study may
      provide valuable information while investigating the virus host protein
      interaction networks.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 6A protein (TNRC6A) is an essential protein 
      for microRNA-mediated gene silencing. TNRC6A functions in the cytoplasm as a
      platform protein interacting with Argonaute protein, on which microRNA is loaded 
      for RNA silencing, and decapping enzymes or deadenylation protein complexes to
      induce mRNA degradation. We previously revealed that TNRC6A shuttles between the 
      cytoplasm and nucleus. However, the function of TNRC6A in the nucleus is unclear.
      Here, we performed a comprehensive identification of the nuclear and cytoplasmic 
      interacting proteins of TNRC6A protein by mass spectrometry and identified
      multiple proteins involved in the nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes. We found
      that many RNA degradation pathway proteins were involved in both nuclear and
      cytoplasmic TNRC6A complexes, suggesting that RNA silencing may occur via TNRC6A 
      in both nucleus and cytoplasm or that they were involved in other important
      function in the nucleus. Furthermore, proteins identified in the nuclear TNRC6A
      complex were categorized into the spliceosomal pathway. This may mean that TNRC6A
      regulates splicing in the nucleus. In contrast, pathogen infection- and RNA
      transport-associated proteins were identified in the cytoplasmic TNRC6A complex. 
      Thus, TNRC6A may be also involved in these pathways in the cytoplasm.

      Essential for snoRNA Biogenesis in Trypanosoma brucei.

AB  - The parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping
      sickness and is known for its unique RNA processing mechanisms that are common to
      all the kinetoplastidea including Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi. Trypanosomes 
      possess two canonical RNA poly (A) polymerases (PAPs) termed PAP1 and PAP2. PAP1 
      is encoded by one of the only two genes harboring cis-spliced introns in this
      organism, and its function is currently unknown. In trypanosomes, all mRNAs, and 
      non-coding RNAs such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs
      (lncRNAs), undergo trans-splicing and polyadenylation. Here, we show that the
      function of PAP1, which is located in the nucleus, is to polyadenylate non-coding
      RNAs, which undergo trans-splicing and polyadenylation. Major substrates of PAP1 
      are the snoRNAs and lncRNAs. Under the silencing of either PAP1 or PAP2, the
      level of snoRNAs is reduced. The dual polyadenylation of snoRNA intermediates is 
      carried out by both PAP2 and PAP1 and requires the factors essential for the
      polyadenylation of mRNAs. The dual polyadenylation of the precursor snoRNAs by
      PAPs may function to recruit the machinery essential for snoRNA processing.

TI  - The NS1 Protein from Influenza Virus Stimulates Translation Initiation by
      Enhancing Ribosome Recruitment to mRNAs.

AB  - The non-structural protein NS1 of influenza A viruses exerts pleiotropic
      functions during infection. Among these functions, NS1 was shown to be involved
      in the control of both viral and cellular translation; however, the mechanism by 
      which this occurs remains to be determined. Thus, we have revisited the role of
      NS1 in translation by using a combination of influenza infection, mRNA reporter
      transfection, and in vitro functional and biochemical assays. Our data show that 
      the NS1 protein is able to enhance the translation of virtually all tested mRNAs 
      with the exception of constructs bearing the Dicistroviruses Internal ribosome
      entry segment (IRESes) (DCV and CrPV), suggesting a role at the level of
      translation initiation. The domain of NS1 required for translation stimulation
      was mapped to the RNA binding amino-terminal motif of the protein with residues
      R38 and K41 being critical for activity. Although we show that NS1 can bind
      directly to mRNAs, it does not correlate with its ability to stimulate
      translation. This activity rather relies on the property of NS1 to associate with
      ribosomes and to recruit them to target mRNAs.

      Nervous System.

AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread gene regulatory mechanism that 
      generates mRNAs with different 3'-ends, allowing them to interact with different 
      sets of RNA regulators such as microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Recent studies
      have shown that during development, neural tissues produce mRNAs with
      particularly long 3'UTRs, suggesting that such extensions might be important for 
      neural development and function. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying neural
      APA are not well understood. Here, we investigate this problem within the
      Drosophila nervous system, focusing on the roles played by general cleavage and
      polyadenylation factors (CPA factors). In particular, we examine the model that
      modulations in CPA factor concentration may affect APA during development. For
      this, we first analyse the expression of the Drosophila orthologues of all
      mammalian CPA factors and note that their expression decreases during
      embryogenesis. In contrast to this global developmental decrease in CPA factor
      expression, we see that cleavage factor I (CFI) expression is actually elevated
      in the late embryonic central nervous system, suggesting that CFI might play a
      special role in neural tissues. To test this, we use the UAS/Gal4 system to
      deplete CFI proteins from neural tissue and observe that in this condition,
      multiple genes switch their APA patterns, demonstrating a role of CFI in APA
      control during Drosophila neural development. Furthermore, analysis of genes with
      3'UTR extensions of different length leads us to suggest a novel relation between
      3'UTR length and sensitivity to CPA factor expression. Our work thus contributes 
      to the understanding of the mechanisms of APA control within the developing
      central nervous system.

AB  - In higher eukaryotes, maternally provided gene products drive the initial stages 
      of embryogenesis until the zygotic transcriptional program takes over, a
      developmental process called the midblastula transition (MBT). In addition to
      zygotic genome activation, the MBT involves alterations in cell-cycle length and 
      the implementation of DNA damage/replication checkpoints that serve to monitor
      genome integrity. Previous work has shown that mutations affecting histone mRNA
      metabolism or DNA replication checkpoint factors severely impact developmental
      progression through the MBT, prompting us to characterize and contrast the
      transcriptomic impact of these genetic perturbations. In this study, we define
      gene expression profiles that mark early embryogenesis in Drosophila through
      transcriptomic analyses of developmentally staged (early syncytial versus late
      blastoderm) and biochemically fractionated (nuclear versus cytoplasmic) wild-type
      (wt) embryos. We then compare the transcriptomic profiles of loss-of-function
      mutants of the Chk1/Grapes replication checkpoint kinase and the stem loop
      binding protein (SLBP), a key regulator of replication-dependent histone mRNAs.
      Our analysis of RNA spatial and temporal distribution during embryogenesis offers
      new insights into the dynamics of early embryogenesis. In addition, we find that 
      grp and Slbp mutant embryos display profound and highly similar defects in gene
      expression, most strikingly in zygotic gene expression, compromising the
      transition from a maternal to a zygotic regulation of development.

AB  - Telomerase reverse transcriptase elongates telomeres to overcome their natural
      attrition and allow unlimited cellular proliferation, a characteristic shared by 
      stem cells and the majority of malignant cancerous cells. The telomerase
      holoenzyme comprises a core RNA molecule, a catalytic protein subunit, and other 
      accessory proteins. Malfunction of certain telomerase components can cause
      serious genetic disorders including dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anaemia. 
      A hierarchy of tightly regulated steps constitutes the process of telomerase
      biogenesis, which, if interrupted or misregulated, can impede the production of a
      functional enzyme and severely affect telomere maintenance. Here, we take a
      closer look at the budding yeast telomerase RNA component, TLC1, in its long
      lifetime journey around the cell. We review the extensive knowledge on TLC1
      transcription and processing. We focus on exciting recent studies on telomerase
      assembly, trafficking, and nuclear dynamics, which for the first time unveil
      striking similarities between the yeast and human telomerase ribonucleoproteins. 
      Finally, we identify questions yet to be answered and new directions to be
      followed, which, in the future, might improve our knowledge of telomerase biology
      and trigger the development of new therapies against cancer and other
      telomerase-related diseases.

AB  - The eukaryotic RNA exosome is a well-conserved protein complex with ribonuclease 
      activity implicated in RNA metabolism. Various families of non-coding RNAs have
      been identified as substrates of the complex, underscoring its role as a
      non-coding RNA processing/degradation unit. However, the role of RNA exosome and 
      its RNA processing activity on DNA mutagenesis/alteration events have not been
      investigated until recently. B lymphocytes use two DNA alteration mechanisms,
      class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), to re-engineer 
      their antibody gene expressing loci until a tailored antibody gene for a specific
      antigen is satisfactorily generated. CSR and SHM require the essential activity
      of the DNA activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Causing collateral damage
      to the B-cell genome during CSR and SHM, AID induces unwanted (and sometimes
      oncogenic) mutations at numerous non-immunoglobulin gene sequences. Recent
      studies have revealed that AID's DNA mutator activity is regulated by the RNA
      exosome complex, thus providing an example of a mechanism that relates DNA
      mutagenesis to RNA processing. Here, we review the emergent functions of RNA
      exosome during CSR, SHM, and other chromosomal alterations in B cells, and
      discuss implications relevant to mechanisms that maintain B-cell genomic
      integrity.

AB  - R-loops, three-strand structures consisting of mRNA hybridized to the
      complementary DNA and a single-stranded DNA loop, are formed in switch regions on
      the heavy-chain immunoglobulin locus. To determine if R-loops have a direct
      effect on any of the steps involved in isotype switching, we generated a
      transgenic mouse that over-expressed RNase H1, an enzyme that cleaves the RNA of 
      RNA/DNA hybrids in B cells. R-loops in the switch mu region were depleted by 70% 
      in ex vivo activated splenic B cells. Frequencies of isotype switching to IgG1,
      IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3 were the same as C57BL/6 control cells. However, somatic
      hypermutation was increased specifically on the transcribed strand from mu-gamma 
      joins, indicating that R-loops limit activation-induced (cytosine) deaminase
      access to the transcribed DNA strand. Our data suggest that, in the normal
      G+C-rich context of mammalian class switch recombination regions, R-loops are
      obligatory intermediates. Processing of the R-loops is needed to remove RNA
      allowing activation-induced (cytosine) deaminase to promote somatic hypermutation
      on both DNA strands to generate double-strand DNA breaks for efficient class
      switch recombination. One of the two cellular RNases H may assist in this
      process.

      Processing Following UV-Induced DNA Damage.

AB  - Pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, the process through which almost all eukaryotic mRNAs
      acquire a poly(A) tail is generally inhibited during the cellular DNA damage
      response leading to a profound impact on the level of protein expression since
      unprocessed transcripts at the 3'-end will be degraded or unable to be
      transported to the cytoplasm. However, a compensatory mechanism involving the
      binding of the hnRNP H/F family of RNA binding proteins to an RNA G-quadruplex
      (G4) structure located in the vicinity of a polyadenylation site has previously
      been described to allow the transcript encoding the p53 tumour suppressor protein
      to be properly processed during DNA damage and to provide the cells with a way to
      react to DNA damage. Here we report that the DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box RNA
      helicase DHX36/RHAU/G4R1, which specifically binds to and resolves
      parallel-stranded G4, is necessary to maintain p53 pre-mRNA 3'-end processing
      following UV-induced DNA damage. DHX36 binds to the p53 RNA G4, while mutation of
      the G4 impairs the ability of DHX36 to maintain pre-mRNA 3'-end processing.
      Stabilization of the p53 RNA G4 with two different G4 ligands ((PNA)DOTASQ and
      PhenDC3), which is expected from previous studies to prevent DHX36 from binding
      and unwinding G4s, also impairs p53 pre-mRNA 3'-end processing following UV. Our 
      work identifies DHX36 as a new actor in the compensatory mechanisms that are in
      place to ensure that the mRNAs encoding p53 are still processed following UV.

AB  - PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provide the silencing of transposable elements in 
      the germline. Drosophila telomeres are maintained by transpositions of
      specialized telomeric retroelements. piRNAs generated from sense and antisense
      transcripts of telomeric elements provide telomere length control in the
      germline. Previously, we have found that antisense transcription of the major
      telomeric retroelement HeT-A is initiated upstream of the HeT-A sense
      transcription start site. Here, we performed a deletion analysis of the HeT-A
      promoter and show that common regulatory elements are shared by sense and
      antisense promoters of HeT-A. Therefore, the HeT-A promoter is a bidirectional
      promoter capable of processive sense and antisense transcription. Ovarian small
      RNA data show that a solo HeT-A promoter within an euchromatic transgene
      initiates the divergent transcription of transgenic reporter genes and subsequent
      processing of these transcripts into piRNAs. These events lead to the formation
      of a divergent unistrand piRNA cluster at solo HeT-A promoters, in contrast to
      endogenous telomeres that represent strong dual-strand piRNA clusters. Solo HeT-A
      promoters are not immunoprecipitated with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homolog
      Rhino, a marker of the dual-strand piRNA clusters, but are associated with HP1
      itself, which provides piRNA-mediated transcriptional repression of the reporter 
      genes. Unlike endogenous dual-strand piRNA clusters, the solo HeT-A promoter does
      not produce overlapping transcripts. In a telomeric context, however,
      bidirectional promoters of tandem HeT-A repeats provide a read-through
      transcription of both genomic strands, followed by Rhi binding. These data
      indicate that Drosophila telomeres share properties of unistrand and dual-strand 
      piRNA clusters.

AB  - The faithful transcription of eukaryotic genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) is
      crucial for proper cell function and tissue homeostasis. However,
      transcription-blocking DNA lesions of both endogenous and environmental origin
      continuously challenge the progression of elongating RNAP2. The stalling of RNAP2
      on a transcription-blocking lesion triggers a series of highly regulated events, 
      including RNAP2 processing to make the lesion accessible for DNA repair,
      R-loop-mediated DNA damage signaling, and the initiation of transcription-coupled
      DNA repair. The correct execution and coordination of these processes is vital
      for resuming transcription following the successful repair of
      transcription-blocking lesions. Here, we outline recent insights into the
      molecular consequences of RNAP2 stalling on transcription-blocking DNA lesions
      and how these lesions are resolved to restore mRNA synthesis.

AB  - Transcription has classically been considered a potential threat to genome
      integrity. Collision between transcription and DNA replication machinery, and
      retention of DNA:RNA hybrids, may result in genome instability. On the other
      hand, it has been proposed that active genes repair faster and preferentially via
      homologous recombination. Moreover, while canonical transcription is inhibited in
      the proximity of DNA double-strand breaks, a growing body of evidence supports
      active non-canonical transcription at DNA damage sites. Small non-coding RNAs
      accumulate at DNA double-strand break sites in mammals and other organisms, and
      are involved in DNA damage signaling and repair. Furthermore, RNA binding
      proteins are recruited to DNA damage sites and participate in the DNA damage
      response. Here, we discuss the impact of transcription on genome stability, the
      role of RNA binding proteins at DNA damage sites, and the function of small
      non-coding RNAs generated upon damage in the signaling and repair of DNA lesions.

AB  - R-loops comprise an RNA/DNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA. They play
      crucial biological functions and are implicated in neurological diseases,
      including ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nucleotide expansion disorders 
      (Friedreich ataxia and fragile X syndrome), and cancer. Currently, it is unclear 
      which mechanisms cause R-loop structures to become pathogenic. The RNA/DNA
      helicase senataxin (SETX) is one of the best characterised R-loop-binding factors
      in vivo. Mutations in SETX are linked to two neurodegenerative disorders: ataxia 
      with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4
      (ALS4). SETX is known to play a role in transcription, neurogenesis, and
      antiviral response. Here, we review the causes of R-loop dysregulation in
      neurodegenerative diseases and how these structures contribute to
      pathomechanisms. We will discuss the importance of SETX as a genome guardian in
      suppressing aberrant R-loop formation and analyse how SETX mutations can lead to 
      neurodegeneration in AOA2/ALS4. Finally, we will discuss the implications for
      other R-loop-associated neurodegenerative diseases and point to future
      therapeutic approaches to treat these disorders.

AB  - Upon DNA damage, cells trigger an early DNA-damage response (DDR) involving DNA
      repair and cell cycle checkpoints, and late responses involving gene expression
      regulation that determine cell fate. Screens for genes involved in the DDR have
      found many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), while screens for novel RBPs have
      identified DDR proteins. An increasing number of RBPs are involved in early
      and/or late DDR. We propose to call this new class of actors of the DDR, which
      contain an RNA-binding activity, DNA-damage response RNA-binding proteins
      (DDRBPs). We then discuss how DDRBPs contribute not only to gene expression
      regulation in the late DDR but also to early DDR signaling, DNA repair, and
      chromatin modifications at DNA-damage sites through interactions with both long
      and short noncoding RNAs.

AB  - Aberrant R-loop structures are increasingly being realized as an important
      contributor to human disease. R loops, which are mainly co-transcriptional,
      abundant RNA/DNA hybrids, form naturally and can indeed be beneficial for
      transcription regulation at certain loci. However, their unwanted persistence
      elsewhere or in particular situations can lead to DNA double-strand breaks,
      chromosome rearrangements, and hypermutation, which are all sources of genomic
      instability. Mutations in genes involved in R-loop resolution or mutations
      leading to R-loop formation at specific genes affect the normal physiology of the
      cell. We discuss here the examples of diseases for which a link with R loops has 
      been described, as well as how disease-causing mutations might participate in the
      development and/or progression of diseases that include repeat-associated
      conditions, other neurological disorders, and cancers.

AB  - Calorie restriction (CR) is a broadly effective environmental intervention that
      extends life by operating through numerous biological processes. Here, we discuss
      how non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules act as mediators and targets of
      lifespan-extending CR. We also highlight how these RNA molecules connect CR to
      its effects on genome stability, cell metabolism, programmed cell death,
      senescence, cancer, and neurodegeneration. We anticipate that an advanced
      understanding of the connections between CR and non-coding RNA will provide
      unique insights into aging mechanisms while pointing to novel approaches aimed at
      modulating aging and age-related diseases.

AB  - High levels of transcription stimulate mutation rates in microorganisms, and this
      occurs primarily through an enhanced accumulation of DNA damage. The major source
      of transcription-associated damage in yeast is Topoisomerase I (Top1), an enzyme 
      that removes torsional stress that accumulates when DNA strands are separated.
      Top1 relieves torsional stress by nicking and resealing one DNA strand, and some 
      Top1-dependent mutations are due to trapping and processing of the covalent
      cleavage intermediate. Most, however, reflect enzyme incision at ribonucleotides,
      which are the most abundant noncanonical component of DNA. In either case, Top1
      generates a distinctive mutation signature composed of short deletions in tandem 
      repeats; in the specific case of ribonucleotide-initiated events, mutations
      reflect sequential cleavage by the enzyme. Top1-dependent mutations do not
      require highly activated transcription, but their levels are greatly increased by
      transcription, which partially reflects an interaction of Top1 with RNA
      polymerase. Recent studies have demonstrated that Top1-dependent mutations
      exhibit a strand bias, with the nature of the bias differing depending on the
      transcriptional status of the underlying DNA. Under low-transcription conditions,
      most Top1-dependent mutations arise in the context of replication and reflect
      incision at ribonucleotides incorporated during leading-strand synthesis. Under
      high-transcription conditions, most Top1-dependent events arise when the enzyme
      cleaves the non-transcribed strand of DNA. In addition to increasing genetic
      instability in growing cells, Top1 activity in transcriptionally active regions
      may be a source of mutations in quiescent cells.

AB  - DNA repair defects create cancer predisposition in humans by fostering a higher
      rate of mutations. While DNA repair is quite well characterized, recent studies
      have identified previously unrecognized relationships between DNA repair and
      R-loop-mediated genome instability. R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid
      structures in which RNA binds to genomic DNA to displace a loop of
      single-stranded DNA. Mutations in homologous recombination, nucleotide excision
      repair, crosslink repair, and DNA damage checkpoints have all now been linked to 
      formation and function of transcription-coupled R-loops. This perspective will
      summarize recent literature linking DNA repair to R-loop-mediated genomic
      instability and discuss how R-loops may contribute to mutagenesis in
      DNA-repair-deficient cancers.

TI  - Conformational Plasticity of Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein Enables RNA-Induced
      Formation of Nucleocapsid-like Particles.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2017.10.010 [doi]
AB  - Many of the unanswered questions associated with hepatitis C virus assembly are
      related to the core protein (HCVcp), which forms an oligomeric nucleocapsid
      encompassing the viral genome. The structural properties of HCVcp have been
      difficult to quantify, at least in part because it is an intrinsically disordered
      protein. We have used single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer
      techniques to study the conformational dimensions and dynamics of the HCVcp
      nucleocapsid domain (HCVncd) at various stages during the RNA-induced formation
      of nucleocapsid-like particles. Our results indicate that HCVncd is a typical
      intrinsically disordered protein. When it forms small ribonucleoprotein complexes
      with various RNA hairpins from the 3' end of the HCV genome, it compacts but
      remains intrinsically disordered and conformationally dynamic. Above a critical
      RNA concentration, these ribonucleoprotein complexes rapidly and cooperatively
      assemble into large nucleocapsid-like particles, wherein the individual HCVncd
      subunits become substantially more extended.

TI  - Tripodal Lipoprotein Variants with C-Terminal Hydrophobic Residues Allosterically
      Modulate Activity of the DegP Protease.

AB  - DegP, a member of the highly conserved HtrA family of proteases, performs a
      regulated proteolysis of toxic misfolded proteins in the periplasm of
      Gram-negative bacteria. The allosteric switch between inactive and active
      conformations is a central mechanism to carefully control proteolytic activity of
      DegP and to maintain the optimal cellular fitness, but few other molecules than
      substrates are known to allosterically control DegP activity. Here, we
      demonstrate that a mutant variant of an outer-membrane lipoprotein, Lpp(+Leu),
      can function as a novel allosteric effector that changes the dynamic range of
      DegP activity. The three leucines at the C-termini of trimeric Lpp(+Leu) are
      central components for activity modulation. Selection experiments with Lpp
      variant libraries show that Lpp variants with diverse sequences at or near
      C-termini, in particular those with hydrophobic residues at C-termini, function
      similarly to Lpp(+Leu). Interestingly, Lpp variants carrying different residues
      at C-terminal, penultimate, or antepenultimate positions display dramatically
      different patterns of activation and inhibition effects, suggesting that their
      interactions with DegP differentially stabilize distinct inactive or active
      conformations. We propose that the tripodal structure with three hydrophobic ends
      that mimics Lpp(+Leu) is a novel platform for allosteric effectors, which may be 
      useful in developing new antibiotics against DegP or homologous HtrA proteases.

AB  - Cellular growth crucially depends on protein synthesis and the abundance of
      translational components. Among them, aminoacyl-tRNAs play a central role in
      biosynthesis and shape the kinetics of mRNA translation, thus influencing protein
      production. Here, we used microarray-based approaches to determine the charging
      levels and tRNA abundance of Bacillus licheniformis. We observed an interesting
      cross-talk among tRNA expression, charging pattern, and growth rate. For a large 
      subset of tRNAs, we found a co-regulated and augmented expression at high growth 
      rate. Their tRNA aminoacylation level is kept relatively constant through
      riboswitch-regulated expression of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase (AARS). 
      We show that AARSs with putative riboswitch-controlled expression are those
      charging tRNAs with amino acids which disfavor cell growth when individually
      added to the nutrient medium. Our results suggest that the riboswitch-regulated
      AARS expression in B. licheniformis is a powerful mechanism not only to maintain 
      a constant ratio of aminoacyl-tRNA independent of the growth rate but
      concomitantly to control the intracellular level of free amino acids.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. It is
      characterized by aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in Lewy
      bodies, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress in the
      substantia nigra. Oxidative stress leads to several modifications of biomolecules
      including dityrosine (DiY) crosslinking in proteins, which has recently been
      detected in alpha-syn in Lewy bodies from Parkinson's disease patients. Here we
      report that alpha-syn is highly susceptible to ultraviolet-induced DiY formation.
      We investigated DiY formation of alpha-syn and nine tyrosine-to-alanine mutants
      and monitored its effect on alpha-syn fibril formation in vitro. Ultraviolet
      irradiation of intrinsically disordered alpha-syn generates DiY-modified monomers
      and dimers, which inhibit fibril formation of unmodified alpha-syn by interfering
      with fibril elongation. The inhibition depends on both the DiY group and its
      integration into alpha-syn. When preformed alpha-syn fibrils are crosslinked by
      DiY formation, they gain increased resistance to denaturation. DiY-stabilized
      alpha-syn fibrils retain their high seeding efficiency even after being exposed
      to denaturant concentrations that completely depolymerize non-crosslinked seeds. 
      Oxidative stress-associated DiY crosslinking of alpha-syn therefore entails two
      opposing effects: (i) inhibition of aggregation by DiY-modified monomers and
      dimers, and (ii) stabilization of fibrillar aggregates against potential
      degradation mechanisms, which can lead to promotion of aggregation, especially in
      the presence of secondary nucleation.

      Molecular Characterization of Its Interaction with EAF1 and TAF7.

AB  - MED26 is a subunit of Mediator, a large complex central to the regulation of gene
      transcription by RNA Polymerase II. MED26 plays a role in the switch between the 
      initiation and elongation phases of RNA Polymerase II-mediated transcription
      process. Regulation of these steps requires successive binding of MED26
      N-terminal domain (NTD) to TATA-binding protein-associated factor 7 (TAF7) and
      Eleven-nineteen lysine-rich in leukemia-Associated Factor 1 (EAF1). In order to
      investigate the mechanism of regulation by MED26, MED26-NTD structure was solved 
      by NMR, revealing a 4-helix bundle. EAF1 (239-268) and TAF7 (205-235) peptide
      interactions were both mapped to the same groove formed by H3 and H4 helices of
      MED26-NTD. Both interactions are characterized by dissociation constants in the
      10-muM range. Further experiments revealed a folding-upon-binding mechanism that 
      leads to the formation of EAF1 (N247-S260) and TAF7 (L214-S227) helices. Chemical
      shift perturbations and nuclear Overhauser enhancement contacts support the
      involvement of residues I222/F223 in anchoring TAF7 helix to a hydrophobic pocket
      of MED26-NTD, including residues L48, W80 and I84. In addition, Ala mutations of 
      charged residues located in the C-terminal disordered part of TAF7 and EAF1
      peptides affected the binding, with a loss of affinity characterized by a 10-time
      increase of dissociation constants. A structural model of MED26-NTD/TAF7 complex 
      shows bi-partite components, combining ordered and disordered segments, as well
      as hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions to the binding. This study
      provides molecular detail that will help to decipher the mechanistic basis for
      the initiation to elongation switch-function mediated by MED26-NTD.

AB  - Chromatin fiber organization is implicated in processes such as transcription,
      DNA repair and chromosome segregation, but how nucleosomes interact to form
      higher-order structure remains poorly understood. We solved two crystal
      structures of tetranucleosomes with approximately 11-bp DNA linker length at 5.8 
      and 6.7 A resolution. Minimal intramolecular nucleosome-nucleosome interactions
      result in a fiber model resembling a flat ribbon that is compatible with a
      two-start helical architecture, and that exposes histone and DNA surfaces to the 
      environment. The differences in the two structures combined with electron
      microscopy reveal heterogeneous structural states, and we used site-specific
      chemical crosslinking to assess the diversity of nucleosome-nucleosome
      interactions through identification of structure-sensitive crosslink sites that
      provide a means to characterize fibers in solution. The chromatin fiber
      architectures observed here provide a basis for understanding heterogeneous
      chromatin higher-order structures as they occur in a genomic context.

AB  - Fine tuning of signaling pathways is essential for cells to cope with sudden
      environmental variations. This delicate balance is maintained in particular by
      protein kinases that control the activity of target proteins by reversible
      phosphorylation. In addition to homologous eukaryotic enzymes, bacteria have
      evolved some specific Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases without any structural
      resemblance to their eukaryotic counterparts. Here, we show that a previously
      identified family of ATPases, broadly conserved among bacteria, is in fact a new 
      family of protein kinases with a Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase activity. A prototypic member
      of this family, YdiB from Bacillus subtilis, is able to autophosphorylate and to 
      phosphorylate a surrogate substrate, the myelin basic protein. Two crystal
      structures of YdiB were solved (1.8 and 2.0A) that display a unique ATP-binding
      fold unrelated to known protein kinases, although a conserved HxD motif is
      reminiscent of that found in Hanks-type protein kinases. The effect of mutations 
      of conserved residues further highlights the unique nature of this new protein
      kinase family that we name ubiquitous bacterial kinase. We investigated the
      cellular role of YdiB and showed that a ydiB mutant was more sensitive to
      paraquat treatment than the wild type, with ~13% of cells with an aberrant
      morphology. In addition, YdiE, which is known to participate with both YdiC and
      YdiB in an essential chemical modification of some specific tRNAs, is
      phosphorylated in vitro by YdiB. These results expand the boundaries of the
      bacterial kinome and support the involvement of YdiB in protein translation and
      resistance to oxidative stress in B. subtilis.

AB  - Temporal kinetics and spatial coordination of signal transduction in cells are
      vital for cell fate determination. Tools that allow for precise modulation of
      spatiotemporal regulation of intracellular signaling in intact cells and
      multicellular organisms remain limited. The emerging optobiological approaches
      use light to control protein-protein interaction in live cells and multicellular 
      organisms. Optobiology empowers light-mediated control of diverse cellular and
      organismal functions such as neuronal activity, intracellular signaling, gene
      expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. In
      this review, we highlight recent developments in optobiology, focusing on new
      features of second-generation optobiological tools. We cover applications of
      optobiological approaches in the study of cellular and organismal functions,
      discuss current challenges, and present our outlook. Taking advantage of the high
      spatial and temporal resolution of light control, optobiology promises to provide
      new insights into the coordination of signaling circuits in intact cells and

TI  - Structures of Leishmania Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase Reveal Species-Specific
      Differences in the Mechanism of Allosteric Inhibition.

AB  - The gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase has been proposed as a
      potential drug target against Leishmania parasites that cause up to 20,000-30,000
      deaths annually. A comparison of three crystal structures of Leishmania major
      fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (LmFBPase) along with enzyme kinetic data show how
      AMP acts as an allosteric inhibitor and provides insight into its metal-dependent
      reaction mechanism. The crystal structure of the apoenzyme form of LmFBPase is a 
      homotetramer in which the dimer of dimers adopts a planar conformation with
      disordered "dynamic loops". The structure of LmFBPase, complexed with manganese
      and its catalytic product phosphate, shows the dynamic loops locked into the
      active sites. A third crystal structure of LmFBPase complexed with its allosteric
      inhibitor AMP shows an inactive form of the tetramer, in which the dimer pairs
      are rotated by 18 degrees relative to each other. The three structures suggest an
      allosteric mechanism in which AMP binding triggers a rearrangement of hydrogen
      bonds across the large and small interfaces. Retraction of the "effector loop"
      required for AMP binding releases the side chain of His23 from the dimer-dimer
      interface. This is coupled with a flip of the side chain of Arg48 which ties down
      the key catalytic dynamic loop in a disengaged conformation and also locks the
      tetramer in an inactive rotated T-state. The structure of the effector site of
      LmFBPase shows different structural features compared with human FBPases, thereby
      offering a potential and species-specific drug target.

AB  - We report a new distance- and orientation-dependent, all-atom statistical
      potential derived from side-chain packing, named OPUS-DOSP, for protein structure
      modeling. The framework of OPUS-DOSP is based on OPUS-PSP, previously developed
      by us [JMB (2008), 376, 288-301], with refinement and new features. In
      particular, distance or orientation contribution is considered depending on the
      range of contact distance. A new auxiliary function in energy function is also
      introduced, in addition to the traditional Boltzmann term, in order to adjust the
      contributions of extreme cases. OPUS-DOSP was tested on 11 decoy sets commonly
      used for statistical potential benchmarking. Among 278 native structures, 239 and
      249 native structures were recognized by OPUS-DOSP without and with the auxiliary
      function, respectively. The results show that OPUS-DOSP has an increased decoy
      recognition capability comparing with those of other relevant potentials to date.

TI  - ETV4 and AP1 Transcription Factors Form Multivalent Interactions with three Sites
      on the MED25 Activator-Interacting Domain.

AB  - The recruitment of transcriptional cofactors by sequence-specific transcription
      factors challenges the basis of high affinity and selective interactions.
      Extending previous studies that the N-terminal activation domain (AD) of ETV5
      interacts with Mediator subunit 25 (MED25), we establish that similar,
      aromatic-rich motifs located both in the AD and in the DNA-binding domain (DBD)
      of the related ETS factor ETV4 interact with MED25. These ETV4 regions bind MED25
      independently, display distinct kinetics, and combine to contribute to a
      high-affinity interaction of full-length ETV4 with MED25. High-affinity
      interactions with MED25 are specific for the ETV1/4/5 subfamily as other ETS
      factors display weaker binding. The AD binds to a single site on MED25 and the
      DBD interacts with three MED25 sites, allowing for simultaneous binding of both
      domains in full-length ETV4. MED25 also stimulates the in vitro DNA binding
      activity of ETV4 by relieving autoinhibition. ETV1/4/5 factors are often
      overexpressed in prostate cancer and genome-wide studies in a prostate cancer
      cell line indicate that ETV4 and MED25 occupy enhancers that are enriched for
      ETS-binding sequences and are both functionally important for the transcription
      of genes regulated by these enhancers. AP1-motifs, which bind JUN and FOS
      transcription factor families, were observed in MED25-occupied regions and
      JUN/FOS also contact MED25; FOS strongly binds to the same MED25 site as ETV4 AD 
      and JUN interacts with the other two MED25 sites. In summary, we describe
      features of the multivalent ETV4- and AP1-MED25 interactions, thereby implicating
      these factors in the recruitment of MED25 to transcriptional control elements.

AB  - Asymmetric local concentration of protein complexes on distinct membrane regions 
      is a fundamental property in numerous biological processes and is a hallmark of
      cell polarity. Evolutionarily conserved core polarity proteins form specific and 
      dynamic networks to regulate the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, 
      as well as distinct polarity-driven cellular events. This review focuses on the
      molecular and structural basis governing regulated formation of several sets of
      core cell polarity regulatory complexes, as well as their functions in epithelial
      cell polarization and asymmetric cell division.

      Protein-Protein Interaction.

AB  - We report here a distinct mechanism of interaction between topoisomerase I and
      RNA polymerase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis that has
      evolved independently from the previously characterized interaction between
      bacterial topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase. Bacterial DNA topoisomerase I is
      responsible for preventing the hyper-negative supercoiling of genomic DNA. The
      association of topoisomerase I with RNA polymerase during transcription
      elongation could efficiently relieve transcription-driven negative supercoiling. 
      Our results demonstrate a direct physical interaction between the C-terminal
      domains of topoisomerase I (TopoI-CTDs) and the beta' subunit of RNA polymerase
      of M. smegmatis in the absence of DNA. The TopoI-CTDs in mycobacteria are
      evolutionarily unrelated in amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure
      to the TopoI-CTD found in the majority of bacterial species outside
      Actinobacteria, including Escherichia coli. The functional interaction between
      topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase has evolved independently in mycobacteria and 
      E. coli, with distinctively different structural elements of TopoI-CTD utilized
      for this protein-protein interaction. Zinc ribbon motifs in E. coli TopoI-CTD are
      involved in the interaction with RNA polymerase. For M. smegmatis TopoI-CTD, a
      27-amino-acid tail that is rich in basic residues at the C-terminal end is
      responsible for the interaction with RNA polymerase. Overexpression of
      recombinant TopoI-CTD in M. smegmatis competed with the endogenous topoisomerase 
      I for protein-protein interactions with RNA polymerase. The TopoI-CTD
      overexpression resulted in decreased survival following treatment with
      antibiotics and hydrogen peroxide, supporting the importance of the
      protein-protein interaction between topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase during
      stress response of mycobacteria.

TI  - Soluble Extracellular Domain of Death Receptor 5 Inhibits TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis
      by Disrupting Receptor-Receptor Interactions.

AB  - Dysregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor signaling is a key feature 
      of various inflammatory disorders. Current treatments for TNF-related diseases
      function either by sequestering ligand or blocking ligand-receptor interactions, 
      which can cause dangerous side effects by inhibiting the receptors that are not
      involved in the disease condition. Thus, alternate strategies that target
      receptor-receptor interactions are needed. We hypothesized that the soluble
      extracellular domain (ECD) of long isoform of death receptor 5 (DR5) could block 
      endogenous receptor assembly, mimicking the biological effect of decoy receptors 
      that lack the death domain to trigger apoptosis. Using live-cell fluorescence
      resonance energy transfer studies, we demonstrated that soluble ECD disrupts
      endogenous DR5-DR5 interactions. Cell viability assays were used to demonstrate
      the complete inhibition of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced 
      apoptosis by the ECD, although TRAIL is still able to bind to the receptor.
      Importantly, we used mutagenesis to prove that the inhibition of TRAIL-induced
      apoptosis by the ECD predominantly comes from the disruption of DR5
      oligomerization and not ligand sequestration. Inhibition of death receptor
      activation should have important therapeutic applications in diseases such as
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. More generally, this approach should be
      generalized to enable the inhibition of other TNF receptor signaling mechanisms
      that are associated in a wide range of clinical conditions.

TI  - Studies on the Interaction of the Histone Demethylase KDM5B with Tricarboxylic
      Acid Cycle Intermediates.

AB  - Methylation of lysine-4 of histone H3 (H3K4men) is an important regulatory factor
      in eukaryotic transcription. Removal of the transcriptionally activating H3K4
      methylation is catalyzed by histone demethylases, including the Jumonji C (JmjC) 
      KDM5 subfamily. The JmjC KDMs are Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent
      oxygenases, some of which are associated with cancer. Altered levels of
      tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and the associated metabolites D-
      and L-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) can cause changes in chromatin methylation status.
      We report comprehensive biochemical, structural and cellular studies on the
      interaction of TCA cycle intermediates with KDM5B, which is a current medicinal
      chemistry target for cancer. The tested TCA intermediates were poor or moderate
      KDM5B inhibitors, except for oxaloacetate and succinate, which were shown to
      compete for binding with 2OG. D- and L-2HG were moderate inhibitors at levels
      that might be relevant in cancer cells bearing isocitrate dehydrogenase
      mutations. Crystallographic analyses with succinate, fumarate, L-malate,
      oxaloacetate, pyruvate and D- and L-2HG support the kinetic studies showing
      competition with 2OG. An unexpected binding mode for oxaloacetate was observed in
      which it coordinates the active site metal via its C-4 carboxylate rather than
      the C-1 carboxylate/C-2 keto groups. Studies employing immunofluorescence
      antibody-based assays reveal no changes in H3K4me3 levels in cells ectopically
      overexpressing KDM5B in response to dosing with TCA cycle metabolite pro-drug
      esters, suggesting that the high levels of cellular 2OG may preclude inhibition. 
      The combined results reveal the potential for KDM5B inhibition by TCA cycle
      intermediates, but suggest that in cells, such inhibition will normally be
      effectively competed by 2OG.

AB  - SorCS1, SorCS2 and SorCS3 belong to the Vps10p-domain family of multiligand
      receptors. Genetic and functional studies have linked SorCS receptors to
      psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes, demonstrating
      critical roles in neuronal functionality and metabolic control. Surprisingly,
      their structural composition has so far not been studied. Here we have
      characterized SorCS1, SorCS2 and SorCS3 using biochemical methods and electron
      microscopy. We found that their purified extracellular domains co-exist in stable
      dimeric and monomeric populations. This was supported by co-immunoprecipitation
      experiments, where membrane-bound dimers were successfully pulled down from cell 
      lysate. While dimers were virtually unbreakable, dimerization of the monomeric
      population was promoted through enzymatic deglycosylation. We conclude that
      post-translational modifications, specifically the degree and pattern of
      glycosylation, regulate the oligomeric state of the protein. Hence, cells may
      dictate ligand specificity by controlling the ratio between monomers and dimers
      and, therefore, regulate the multiple functions of SorCS receptors.

AB  - The ATPase cycle of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone is essential for maintaining
      the stability of numerous client proteins. Extensive analysis has focused on
      ATP-driven conformational changes of Hsp90; however, little is known about how
      Hsp90 operates under physiological nucleotide conditions in which both ATP and
      ADP are present. By quantifying Hsp90 activity under mixed nucleotide conditions,
      we find dramatic differences in ADP sensitivity among Hsp90 homologs. ADP acts as
      a strong ATPase inhibitor of cytosol-specific Hsp90 homologs, whereas
      organellular Hsp90 homologs (Grp94 and TRAP1) are relatively insensitive to the
      presence of ADP. These results imply that an ATP/ADP heterodimer of cytosolic
      Hsp90 is the predominant active state under physiological nucleotide conditions. 
      ADP inhibition of human and yeast cytosolic Hsp90 can be relieved by the
      cochaperone aha1. ADP inhibition of bacterial Hsp90 can be relieved by bacterial 
      Hsp70 and an activating client protein. These results suggest that altering ADP
      inhibition may be a mechanism of Hsp90 regulation. To determine the molecular
      origin of ADP inhibition, we identify residues that preferentially stabilize
      either ATP or ADP. Mutations at these sites can both increase and decrease ADP
      inhibition. An accounting of ADP is critically important for designing and
      interpreting experiments with Hsp90. For example, contaminating ADP is a
      confounding factor in fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments
      measuring arm closure rates of Hsp90. Our observations suggest that ADP at
      physiological levels is important to Hsp90 structure, activity, and regulation.

TI  - RNase HII Saves rnhA Mutant Escherichia coli from R-Loop-Associated Chromosomal
      Fragmentation.

AB  - The rnhAB mutant Escherichia coli, deficient in two RNase H enzymes that remove
      both R-loops and incorporated ribonucleotides (rNs) from DNA, grow slowly,
      suggesting accumulation of rN-containing DNA lesions (R-lesions). We report that 
      the rnhAB mutants have reduced viability, form filaments with abnormal nucleoids,
      induce SOS, and fragment their chromosome, revealing replication and/or
      segregation stress. R-loops are known to interfere with replication forks, and
      sensitivity of the double rnhAB mutants to translation inhibition points to
      R-loops as precursors for R-lesions. However, the strict specificity of bacterial
      RNase HII for RNA-DNA junctions indicates that R-lesions have rNs integrated into
      DNA. Indeed, instead of relieving problems of rnhAB mutants, transient inhibition
      of replication from oriC kills them, suggesting that oriC-initiated replication
      removes R-loops instead of compounding them to R-lesions. Yet, replication from
      an R-loop-initiating plasmid origin kills the double rnhAB mutant, revealing
      generation of R-lesions by R-loop-primed DNA synthesis. These R-lesions could be 
      R-tracts, contiguous runs of >/=4 RNA nucleotides within DNA strand and the only 
      common substrate between the two bacterial RNase H enzymes. However, a plasmid
      relaxation test failed to detect R-tracts in DNA of the rnhAB mutants, although
      it readily detected R-patches (runs of 1-3 rNs). Instead, we detected R-gaps,
      single-strand gaps containing rNs, in the chromosomal DNA of the rnhAB mutant.
      Therefore, we propose that RNase H-deficient mutants convert some R-loops into
      R-tracts, which progress into R-gaps and then to double-strand breaks-explaining 
      why R-tracts do not accumulate in RNase H-deficient cells, while double-strand
      breaks do.

AB  - Owing to their high affinities and specificities, rabbit monoclonal antibodies
      (mAbs) have demonstrated value and potential primarily as basic research and
      diagnostic reagents, but, in some cases, also as therapeutics. To accelerate
      access to rabbit mAbs bypassing immunization, we generated a large naive rabbit
      antibody repertoire represented by a phage display library encompassing >10
      billion independent antibodies in chimeric rabbit/human Fab format and validated 
      it by next-generation sequencing. Panels of rabbit mAbs selected from this
      library against two emerging cancer targets, ROR1 and ROR2, revealed high
      diversity, affinity, and specificity. Moreover, ROR1- and ROR2-targeting rabbit
      mAbs demonstrated therapeutic utility as components of chimeric antigen
      receptor-engineered T cells, further corroborating the value of the naive rabbit 
      antibody library as a rich and virtually unlimited source of rabbit mAbs.

AB  - The shelterin complex is a macromolecular assembly of proteins that binds to and 
      protects telomeric DNA, which composes the ends of all linear chromosomes.
      Shelterin proteins prevent chromosome ends from fusing together and from
      eliciting erroneous induction of DNA damage response pathways. In addition,
      shelterin proteins play key roles in regulating the recruitment and activation of
      telomerase, an enzyme that extends telomeric DNA. In fission yeast,
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe, interactions between the shelterin proteins Ccq1,
      Tpz1, and Poz1 are important for regulating telomerase-mediated telomere
      synthesis and thus telomere length homeostasis. Here, we used electron microscopy
      combined with genetic labeling to define the three-dimensional arrangement of the
      S. pombe Ccq1-Tpz1-Poz1 (CTP) complex. Crosslinking mass spectrometry was used to
      identify individual residues that are in proximity to the protein-protein
      interfaces of the assembled CTP complex. Together, our data provide a first
      glimpse into the architectural design of the CTP complex and reveals unique
      interactions that are important in maintaining the S. pombe telomere in a
      non-extendible state.

AB  - Enteroviruses use a type I Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) structure to
      facilitate protein synthesis and promote genome replication. Type I IRES elements
      require auxiliary host proteins to organize RNA structure for 40S ribosomal
      subunit assembly. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 stimulates
      enterovirus 71 (EV71) translation in part through specific interactions with its 
      stem loop II (SLII) IRES domain. Here, we determined a conjoined NMR-small angle 
      x-ray scattering structure of the EV71 SLII domain and a mutant that
      significantly attenuates viral replication by abrogating hnRNP A1 interactions.
      Native SLII adopts a locally compact structure wherein stacking interactions in a
      conserved 5'-AUAGC-3' bulge preorganize the adjacent helices at nearly orthogonal
      orientations. Mutating the bulge sequence to 5'-ACCCC-3' ablates base stacking in
      the loop and globally reorients the SLII structure. Biophysical titrations reveal
      that the 5'-AUAGC-3' bulge undergoes a conformational change to assemble a
      functional hnRNP A1-RNA complex. Importantly, IRES mutations that delete the
      bulge impair viral translation and completely inhibit replication. Thus, this
      work provides key details into how an EV71 IRES structure adapts to hijack a
      cellular protein, and it suggests that the SLII domain is a potential target for 
      antiviral therapy.

AB  - E. coli single strand (ss) DNA binding protein (SSB) is an essential protein that
      binds to ssDNA intermediates formed during genome maintenance. SSB homotetramers 
      bind ssDNA in several modes that differ in occluded site size and cooperativity. 
      High "unlimited" cooperativity is associated with the 35 site size ((SSB)35) mode
      at low [NaCl], whereas the 65 site size ((SSB)65) mode formed at higher [NaCl] (>
      200mM), where ssDNA wraps completely around the tetramer, displays "limited"
      cooperativity forming dimers of tetramers. It was previously thought that high
      cooperativity was associated only with the (SSB)35 binding mode. However, we show
      here that highly cooperative binding also occurs in the (SSB)65/(SSB)56 binding
      modes at physiological salt concentrations containing either glutamate or
      acetate. Highly cooperative binding requires the 56 amino acid intrinsically
      disordered C-terminal linker (IDL) that connects the DNA binding domain with the 
      9 amino acid C-terminal acidic tip that is involved in SSB binding to other
      proteins involved in genome maintenance. These results suggest that high
      cooperativity involves interactions between IDL regions from different SSB
      tetramers. Glutamate, which is preferentially excluded from protein surfaces, may
      generally promote interactions between intrinsically disordered regions of
      proteins. Since glutamate is the major monovalent anion in E. coli, these results
      suggest that SSB likely binds to ssDNA with high cooperativity in vivo.

AB  - The development of haploid mammalian cell lines, coupled to next-generation
      sequencing, has recently facilitated forward genetic screenings in mammals. For
      mutagenesis, retrovirus- or transposon-based gene traps are frequently used.
      Current methods to map gene-trap insertions are based on inverse or splinkerette 
      PCR, which despite their efficacy are prone to artifacts and do not provide
      information on expression of the targeted gene. Here, we describe a new RNA
      sequencing-based method (Trap(Seq)) to map gene-trap insertions. By recognizing
      chimeric mRNAs containing gene-trap sequences spliced to an exon, our method
      identifies insertions that lead to productive trapping. When applied to
      individual mutant clones, our method provides a fast and cost-effective way that 
      not only identifies the insertion site but also reveals its impact on the
      expression of the trapped gene. As proof of principle, we conducted two
      independent screenings for resistance against 6-thioguanine and an ATR inhibitor,
      which identified mutations known to provide resistance to these reagents and
      revealed ECT2 as a novel determinant for the sensitivity to ATR inhibition.

AB  - Viral tyrosine phosphatases such as VH1 from Vaccinia and Variola virus are
      recognized as important effectors of host-pathogen interactions. While proteins
      sharing sequence to VH1 have been identified in other viruses, their structural
      and functional characterization is not known. In this work, we determined the
      crystal structure of the VH1 homolog in the Orf virus, herein named OH1.
      Similarly to Variola and Vaccinia VH1, the structure of OH1 shows a dimer with
      the typical dual-specificity phosphatase fold. In contrast to VH1, the OH1 dimer 
      is covalently stabilized by a disulfide bond involving residue Cys15 in the
      N-terminal helix alpha-1 of both monomers, and Cys15 is a conserved residue
      within the Parapoxvirus genus. The in vitro functional characterization confirms 
      that OH1 is a dual-specificity phosphatase and reveals its ability to
      dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, a new activity potentially
      relevant in phosphoinositide recycling during virion maturation.

AB  - Approximately one-third of the human proteome is made up of proteins that are
      entirely disordered or that contain extended disordered regions. Although these
      disordered proteins are closely linked with many major diseases, their binding
      mechanisms with small molecules remain poorly understood, and a major concern is 
      whether their specificity can be sufficient for drug development. Here, by
      studying the interaction of a small molecule and a disordered peptide from the
      oncogene protein c-Myc, we describe a "specific-diffuse" binding mechanism that
      exhibits sequence specificity despite being of entropic nature. By combining NMR 
      spectroscopy, biophysical measurements, statistical inference, and molecular
      simulations, we provide a quantitative measure of such sequence specificity and
      compare it to the case of the interaction of urea, which is diffuse but not
      specific. To investigate whether this type of binding can generally modify
      intermolecular interactions, we show that it leads to an inhibition of the
      aggregation of the peptide. These results suggest that the binding mechanism that
      we report may create novel opportunities to discover drugs that target disordered
      proteins in their monomeric states in a specific manner.

TI  - The Changing Face of Aging: Highly Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans Induce Amyloid
      Formation in a Lattice Corneal Dystrophy Model Protein.

AB  - Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are related to multiple biological functions and
      diseases. There is growing evidence that GAG concentration and sulfate content
      increase with age. The destabilizing mutation A546T in the corneal protein TGFBIp
      leads to lattice-type corneal dystrophy, but symptoms only appear in the fourth
      decade of life. We hypothesize that this delayed phenotype can be explained by
      increased GAG sulfation over time. Using in vitro assays with the C-terminal
      TGFIBIp domain Fas1-4, previously shown to recapitulate many properties of
      full-length TGFBIp, we find that only long GAGs with multiple sulfate groups on
      each repeating unit increase the amount of worm-like aggregates and induce long, 
      straight fibrils in A546T. In contrast, GAGs did not induce aggregation of
      wildtype Fas1-4, suggesting that the finding might be specific for lattice
      corneal dystrophy mutants. Our results highlight a possible role of changing GAG 
      sulfation in the accumulation of amyloid, which also may have implications for
      the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

      Eukaryotic Translation Initiation.

AB  - Protein synthesis is a key process in all living organisms. In eukaryotes,
      initiation factor 2 (eIF2) plays an important role in translation initiation as
      it selects and delivers the initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit. Under 
      stress conditions, phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eIF2 downregulates
      cellular protein synthesis. However, translation of certain mRNAs continues via
      the eIF2D-dependent non-canonical initiation pathway. The molecular mechanism of 
      this process remains elusive. In addition, eIF2D plays a role in translation
      re-initiation and ribosome recycling. Currently, there has been no structural
      information of eIF2D. We have now determined the crystal structure of the
      C-terminal domains of eIF2D at 1.4-A resolution. One domain has the fold similar 
      to that of eIF1, which is crucial for the scanning and initiation codon
      selection. The second domain has a known SWIB/MDM2 fold, which was not observed
      before in other translation initiation factors. Our structure reveals atomic
      details of inter-domain interactions in the C-terminal part of eIF2D and sheds
      light on the possible role of these domains in eIF2D during translation.

      Mammarenavirus.

AB  - Whitewater Arroyo virus belongs to the "New World" group of mammarenaviruses that
      reside in rodent reservoirs and are prevalent in North and South Americas. Clades
      B and A/B of New World mammarenaviruses use transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) for
      entry. While all of these viruses use rodent-derived TfR1 orthologs, some can
      also use the human-TfR1 and thereby infect humans. Although we have structural
      information for TfR1 recognition by pathogenic virus, we do not know what the
      structural differences are between the receptor-binding domains of pathogenic and
      non-pathogenic viruses that allow some but not all viruses to utilize the human
      receptor for entry. The poor understanding of the molecular determinants of
      mammarenavirus host range, and thus pathogenicity, is partly due to the low
      sequence similarity between the receptor-binding domains from these viruses and
      the limited available structural information that preclude the use of modeling
      approaches. Here we present the first crystal structure of a receptor-binding
      domain of a non-pathogenic clade A/B mammarenavirus. This structure reveals the
      magnitude of structural differences within the receptor-binding domains of
      TfR1-tropic viruses. Our structural and sequence analyses indicate that the same 
      structural incompatibilities with the human receptor equally affect both
      pathogenic and non-pathogenic mammarenaviruses. Non-pathogenic viruses do not
      have specific structural elements that prevent them from using the human
      receptor. Instead, the ability to utilize the human receptor directly depends on 
      the extent of weak interactions throughout the receptor-binding site that in some
      viruses are sufficiently strong to overcome the structural incompatibilities.

AB  - Adenoviruses are respiratory, ocular and enteric pathogens that form complex
      capsids, which are assembled from seven different structural proteins and
      composed of several core proteins that closely interact with the packaged dsDNA
      genome. The recent near-atomic resolution structures revealed that the
      interlacing continuous hexagonal network formed by the protein IX molecules is
      conserved among different human adenoviruses (HAdVs), but not in non-HAdVs. In
      this report, we propose a distinct role for the hexon protein as a "molecular
      mold" in enabling the formation of such hexagonal protein IX network that has
      been shown to preserve the stability and infectivity of HAdVs.

AB  - The cell cycle has gained attention as a key determinant for cell fate decisions,
      but the contribution of DNA replication and mitosis in stem cell differentiation 
      has not been extensively studied. To understand if these processes act as
      "windows of opportunity" for changes in cell identity, we established
      synchronized cultures of mouse embryonic stem cells as they exit the ground state
      of pluripotency. We show that initial transcriptional changes in this transition 
      do not require passage through mitosis and that conversion to primed pluripotency
      is linked to lineage priming in the G1 phase. Importantly, we demonstrate that
      impairment of DNA replication severely blocks transcriptional switch to primed
      pluripotency, even in the absence of p53 activity induced by the DNA damage
      response. Our data suggest an important role for DNA replication during mouse
      embryonic stem cell differentiation, which could shed light on why pluripotent
      cells are only receptive to differentiation signals during G1, that is, before
      the S phase.

AB  - Nearly every cell in the human body contains a set of programmable gene-silencing
      proteins named Argonaute. Argonaute proteins mediate gene regulation by small
      RNAs and thereby contribute to cellular homeostasis during diverse physiological 
      process, such as stem cell maintenance, fertilization, and heart development.
      Over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made toward understanding
      Argonaute proteins, small RNAs, and their roles in eukaryotic biology. Here, we
      review current understanding of Argonaute proteins from a structural prospective 
      and discuss unanswered questions surrounding this fascinating class of enzymes.

AB  - The cellular uptake of glucose is an essential physiological process, and
      movement of glucose across biological membranes requires specialized
      transporters. The major facilitator superfamily glucose transporters GLUTs,
      encoded by the SLC2A genes, have been a paradigm for functional, mechanistic, and
      structural understanding of solute transport in the past century. This review
      starts with a glimpse into the structural biology of membrane proteins and
      particularly membrane transport proteins, enumerating the landmark structures in 
      the past 25years. The recent breakthrough in the structural elucidation of GLUTs 
      is then elaborated following a brief overview of the research history of these
      archetypal transporters, their functional specificity, and physiological and
      pathophysiological significances. Structures of GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT5 in
      distinct transport and/or ligand-binding states reveal detailed mechanisms of the
      alternating access transport cycle and substrate recognition, and thus illuminate
      a path by which structure-based drug design may be applied to help discover novel
      therapeutics against several debilitating human diseases associated with GLUT
      malfunction and/or misregulation.

AB  - Pre-mRNA splicing is executed by the ribonucleoprotein machinery spliceosome.
      Nearly 40 years after the discovery of pre-mRNA splicing, the atomic structure of
      the spliceosome has finally come to light. Four distinct conformational states of
      the yeast spliceosome have been captured at atomic or near-atomic resolutions.
      Two catalytic metal ions at the active site are specifically coordinated by the
      U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and catalyze both the branching reaction and the
      exon ligation. Of the three snRNAs in the fully assembled spliceosome, U5 and U6,
      along with 30 contiguous nucleotides of U2 at its 5'-end, remain structurally
      rigid throughout the splicing reaction. The rigidity of these RNA elements is
      safeguarded by Prp8 and 16 core protein components, which maintain the same
      overall conformation in all structurally characterized spliceosomes during the
      splicing reaction. Only the sequences downstream of nucleotide 30 of U2 snRNA are
      mobile; their movement, directed by the protein components, delivers the intron
      branch site into the close proximity of the 5'-splice site for the branching
      reaction. A set of additional structural rearrangement is required for exon
      ligation, and the lariat junction is moved out of the active site for recruitment
      of the 3'-splice site and 3'-exon. The spliceosome is proven to be a
      protein-directed metalloribozyme.

AB  - Recent breakthroughs in isotope-labeling and pulse sequence techniques have
      enabled the NMR characterization of large protein systems with molecular masses
      of hundreds of kilodaltons. NMR studies of a great variety of large proteins have
      provided unique insights into the binding, dynamic, and allosteric mechanisms.
      Here we present a brief summary of these developments by highlighting few cases
      that exemplify the uniqueness of NMR in providing atomic resolution information
      into key dynamic processes and structures of protein complexes with high degree
      of flexibility.

AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell surface
      receptors and are important human drug targets. Of the 826 human GPCRs, 118 of
      them recognize endogenous peptide or protein ligands, and 30 of the 118 are
      targeted by approved drug molecules, including the very high-profile class B
      glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor. In this review, we analyze the 21
      experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of the known
      peptide-binding GPCRs in relation to the endogenous peptides and drug molecules
      that modulate their cell signaling processes. Our integrated analyses reveal that
      half of the marketed drugs and most of the drugs in clinical trials that interact
      with peptide GPCRs are small molecules with a wide range of binding modes
      distinct from those of large peptide ligands. As we continue to collect
      additional data on these receptors from orthogonal approaches, including nuclear 
      magnetic resonance and electron microscopy, we are beginning to understand how
      these receptors interact with their ligands at the molecular level and how
      improving the pharmacology of GPCR signal transduction requires us to study these
      receptors using multiple biophysical techniques.

AB  - Sixty years ago, the first protein structure of myoglobin was determined by John 
      Kendrew and his colleagues; hemoglobin followed shortly thereafter. For quite
      some time, it seemed that only X-ray crystallography would be capable of
      determining the structure of proteins to high resolution. In recent years,
      cryo-electron microscopy has emerged as a viable alternative and indeed in many
      cases the preferred approach. It is capable of studying proteins that span a size
      range from several megadaltons to proteins as small as myoglobin and hemoglobin.

      Insights from Influenza Virus.

AB  - Influenza virus evolves rapidly to constantly escape from natural immunity. Most 
      humoral immune responses to influenza virus target the hemagglutinin (HA)
      glycoprotein, which is the major antigen on the surface of the virus. The HA is
      composed of a globular head domain for receptor binding and a stem domain for
      membrane fusion. The major antigenic sites of HA are located in the globular head
      subdomain, which is highly tolerant of amino acid substitutions and continual
      addition of glycosylation sites. Nonetheless, the evolution of the
      receptor-binding site and the stem region on HA is severely constrained by their 
      functional roles in engaging the host receptor and in mediating membrane fusion, 
      respectively. Here, we review how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) exploit
      these evolutionary constraints to protect against diverse influenza strains. We
      also discuss the emerging role of other epitopes that are conserved only in
      subsets of viruses. This rapidly increasing knowledge of the evolutionary
      biology, immunology, structural biology, and virology of influenza virus is
      invaluable for development and design of more universal influenza vaccines and
      novel therapeutics.

AB  - Interest in applications of protein crystallography to medicine was evident, as
      the first high-resolution structures emerged in the 50s and 60s. In Cambridge,
      Max Perutz and John Kendrew sought to understand mutations in sickle cell and
      other genetic diseases related to hemoglobin, while in Oxford, the group of
      Dorothy Hodgkin became interested in long-lasting zinc-insulin crystals for
      treatment of diabetes and later considered insulin redesign, as synthetic
      insulins became possible. The use of protein crystallography in structure-guided 
      drug discovery emerged as enzyme structures allowed the identification of
      potential inhibitor-binding sites and optimization of interactions of hits using 
      the structure of the target protein. Early examples of this approach were the use
      of the structure of renin to design antihypertensives and the structure of HIV
      protease in design of AIDS antivirals. More recently, use of structure-guided
      design with fragment-based drug discovery, which reduces the size of screening
      libraries by decreasing complexity, has improved ligand efficiency in drug design
      and has been used to progress three oncology drugs through clinical trials to FDA
      approval. We exemplify current developments in structure-guided target
      identification and fragment-based lead discovery with efforts to develop new
      antimicrobials for mycobacterial infections.

AB  - Bacteria produce protein polymers on their surface called pili or fimbriae that
      serve either as attachment devices or as conduits for secreted substrates. This
      review will focus on the chaperone-usher pathway of pilus biogenesis, a
      widespread assembly line for pilus production at the surface of Gram-negative
      bacteria and the archetypical protein-polymerizing nanomachine. Comparison with
      other nanomachines polymerizing other types of biological units, such as
      nucleotides during DNA replication, provides some unifying principles as to how
      multidomain proteins assemble biological polymers.

AB  - By celebrating the 100th anniversary of John Kendrew's birth in 1917, the Journal
      of Molecular Biology recognizes his seminal contributions to science in general
      and structural biology in particular. John was first to use X-ray diffraction to 
      solve the 3-dimensional structure of a protein, sperm-whale myoglobin, worthy of 
      a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962. John was the Founder and first
      Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Molecular Biology, Deputy Chairman of the
      Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Head of its Division of Structural Studies, a
      Founder of the European Molecular Biology Organization, first Director-General of
      the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, and 33rd President of St. John's
      College, Oxford. In this personal perspective I relate how I came to know John as
      his postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1967 and as his
      biographer 45 years later.

TI  - RA-Induced Transcriptional Silencing of Checkpoint Kinase-2 through Promoter
      Methylation by Dnmt3b Is Required for Neuronal Differentiation of P19 Cells.

AB  - In a previous study, we identified several novel targets of Dnmt3b using a
      chromatin library from retinoic acid (RA)-treated P19 cells. The present study
      describes the regulation of expression and function of checkpoint kinase (Chk2), 
      which was one of the target genes of Dnmt3b. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
      followed by quantitative PCR analysis showed that recruitment of Dnmt3b on Chk2
      promoter is induced following RA treatment of P19 cells. Both bisulfite genomic
      sequence and COBRA analyses showed that the methylation level of Chk2 promoter is
      progressively increased during RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. 
      Concomitantly, both mRNA and protein expression of Chk2 are reduced as determined
      by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Suppression of Dnmt3b
      expression by lentiviral-mediated shRNA resulted in increased expression and
      reduced methylation of Chk2, which clearly showed that Dnmt3b is responsible for 
      transcriptional silencing of Chk2 gene in RA-treated P19 cells. Neuronal
      differentiation of P19 cells was inhibited upon enforced Chk2 expression in P19
      cells, which showed that the decrease in endogenous expression of Chk2 is
      essential for normal differentiation. Ectopic Chk2 expression also negatively
      regulated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following RA treatment, which could
      also contribute to impaired neuronal differentiation. Together, this study
      described the regulation of Chk2 expression through promoter methylation and also
      presented a novel role of Chk2 during neuronal differentiation, which is
      independent of its previously known function in DNA damage response.

AB  - Viruses build icosahedral capsids of specific size and shape by regulating the
      spatial arrangement of the hexameric and pentameric protein capsomers in the
      growing shell during assembly. In the T=7 capsids of Escherichia coli
      bacteriophage HK97 and other phages, 60 capsomers are hexons, while the rest are 
      pentons that are correctly positioned during assembly. Assembly of the HK97
      capsid to the correct size and shape has been shown to depend on specific ionic
      contacts between capsomers. We now describe additional ionic interactions within 
      capsomers that also regulate assembly. Each is between the long hairpin, the
      "E-loop," that extends from one subunit to the adjacent subunit within the same
      capsomer. Glutamate E153 on the E-loop and arginine R210 on the adjacent
      subunit's backbone alpha-helix form salt bridges in hexamers and pentamers.
      Mutations that disrupt these salt bridges were lethal for virus production,
      because the mutant proteins assembled into tubes or sheets instead of capsids.
      X-ray structures show that the E153-R210 links are flexible and maintained during
      maturation despite radical changes in capsomer shape. The E153-R210 links appear 
      to form early in assembly to enable capsomers to make programmed changes in their
      shape during assembly. The links also prevent flattening of capsomers and
      premature maturation. Mutant phenotypes and modeling support an assembly model in
      which flexible E153-R210 links mediate capsomer shape changes that control where 
      pentons are placed to create normal-sized capsids. The E-loop may be conserved in
      other systems in order to play similar roles in regulating assembly.

AB  - The Abeta peptide forms extracellular plaques associated with Alzheimer's
      disease. In addition to protein fibrils, amyloid plaques also contain
      non-proteinaceous components, including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). We have shown 
      previously that the GAG low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) binds to Abeta40
      fibrils with a three-fold-symmetric (3Q) morphology with higher affinity than
      Abeta40 fibrils in alternative structures, Abeta42 fibrils, or amyloid fibrils
      formed from other sequences. Solid-state NMR analysis of the GAG-3Q fibril
      complex revealed an interaction site at the corners of the 3Q fibril structure,
      but the origin of the binding specificity remained obscure. Here, using a library
      of short heparin polysaccharides modified at specific sites, we show that the
      N-sulfate or 6-O-sulfate of glucosamine, but not the 2-O-sulfate of iduronate
      within heparin is required for 3Q binding, indicating selectivity in the
      interactions of the GAG with the fibril that extends beyond general electrostatic
      complementarity. By creating 3Q fibrils containing point substitutions in the
      amino acid sequence, we also show that charged residues at the fibril three-fold 
      apices provide the majority of the binding free energy, while charged residues
      elsewhere are less critical for binding. The results indicate, therefore, that
      LMWH binding to 3Q fibrils requires a precise molecular complementarity of the
      sulfate moieties on the GAG and charged residues displayed on the fibril surface.
      Differences in GAG binding to fibrils with distinct sequence and/or structure may
      thus contribute to the diverse etiology and progression of amyloid diseases.

      Actin Filament Bundling by Human Plastins.

AB  - The actin cytoskeleton is a complex network controlled by a vast array of
      intricately regulated actin-binding proteins. Human plastins (PLS1, PLS2, and
      PLS3) are evolutionary conserved proteins that non-covalently crosslink actin
      filaments into tight bundles. Through stabilization of such bundles, plastins
      contribute, in an isoform-specific manner, to the formation of kidney and
      intestinal microvilli, inner ear stereocilia, immune synapses, endocytic patches,
      adhesion contacts, and invadosomes of immune and cancer cells. All plastins
      comprise an N-terminal Ca(2+)-binding regulatory headpiece domain followed by two
      actin-binding domains (ABD1 and ABD2). Actin bundling occurs due to simultaneous 
      binding of both ABDs to separate actin filaments. Bundling is negatively
      regulated by Ca(2+), but the mechanism of this inhibition remains unknown. In
      this study, we found that the bundling abilities of PLS1 and PLS2 were similarly 
      sensitive to Ca(2+) (pCa50 ~6.4), whereas PLS3 was less sensitive (pCa50 ~5.9).
      At the same time, all three isoforms bound to F-actin in a Ca(2+)-independent
      manner, suggesting that binding of only one of the ABDs is inhibited by Ca(2+).
      Using limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry, we found that in the presence of
      Ca(2+) the EF-hands of human plastins bound to an immediately adjacent sequence
      homologous to canonical calmodulin-binding peptides. Furthermore, our data from
      differential centrifugation, Forster resonance energy transfer, native
      electrophoresis, and chemical crosslinking suggest that Ca(2+) does not affect
      ABD1 but inhibits the ability of ABD2 to interact with actin. A structural
      mechanism of signal transmission from Ca(2+) to ABD2 through EF-hands remains to 
      be established.

TI  - Engineering Aglycosylated IgG Variants with Wild-Type or Improved Binding
      Affinity to Human Fc Gamma RIIA and Fc Gamma RIIIAs.

AB  - The binding of human IgG1 to human Fc gamma receptors (hFcgammaRs) is highly
      sensitive to the presence of a single N-linked glycosylation site at asparagine
      297 of the Fc, with deglycosylation resulting in a complete loss of hFcgammaR
      binding. Previously, we demonstrated that aglycosylated human IgG1 Fc variants
      can engage the human FcgammaRII class of the low-affinity hFcgammaRs,
      demonstrating that N-linked glycosylation of the Fc is not a strict requirement
      for hFcgammaR engagement. In the present study, we demonstrate that aglycosylated
      IgG variants can be engineered to productively engage with FcgammaRIIIA, as well 
      as the human Fc gamma RII subset. We also assess the biophysical properties and
      serum half-life of the aglycosylated IgG variants to measure stability.
      Aglycosylated constructs N297D/S298T (DTT)-K326I/A327Y/L328G (IYG) and
      N297D/S298A-IYG optimally drove tumor cell phagocytosis. A mathematical model of 
      phagocytosis suggests that hFcgammaRI and hFcgammaRIIIA dimers were the main
      drivers of phagocytosis. In vivo tumor control of B16F10 lung metastases further 
      confirmed the variant DTT-IYG to be the best at restoring wild-type-like
      properties in prevention of lung metastases. While deuterium incorporation was
      similar across most of the protein, several peptides within the CH2 domain of
      DTT-IYG showed differential deuterium uptake in the peptide region of the FG loop
      as compared to the aglycosylated N297Q. Thus, in this study, we have found an
      aglycosylated variant that may effectively substitute for wild-type Fc. These

AB  - Genome-wide studies of aging have identified subsets of genes that show
      age-related changes in expression. Although the types of genes that are age
      regulated vary among different tissues and organisms, some patterns emerge from
      these large data sets. First, aging is associated with a broad induction of
      stress response pathways, although the specific genes and pathways involved
      differ depending on cell type and species. In contrast, a wide variety of
      functional classes of genes are downregulated with age, often including
      tissue-specific genes. Although the upregulation of age-regulated genes is likely
      to be governed by stress-responsive transcription factors, questions remain as to
      why particular genes are susceptible to age-related transcriptional decline.
      Here, we discuss recent findings showing that splicing is misregulated with age. 
      While defects in splicing could lead to changes in protein isoform levels, they
      could also impact gene expression through nonsense-mediated decay of
      intron-retained transcripts. The discovery that splicing is misregulated with age
      suggests that other aspects of gene expression, such as transcription elongation,
      termination, and polyadenylation, must also be considered as potential mechanisms
      for age-related changes in transcript levels. Moreover, the considerable
      variation between genome-wide aging expression studies indicates that there is a 
      critical need to analyze the transcriptional signatures of aging in single-cell
      types rather than whole tissues. Since age-associated decreases in gene
      expression could contribute to a progressive decline in cellular function,
      understanding the mechanisms that determine the aging transcriptome provides a
      potential target to extend healthy cellular lifespan.

AB  - Genome packaging is an essential step to generate infectious HIV-1 virions and is
      mediated by interactions between the viral protein Gag and cis-acting elements in
      the full-length RNA. The sequence necessary and sufficient to allow RNA genome
      packaging into an HIV-1 particle has not been defined. Here, we used two distinct
      reporter systems to determine the HIV-1 sequence required for heterologous,
      non-viral RNAs to be packaged into viral particles. Although the 5' untranslated 
      region (UTR) of the HIV-1 RNA is known to be important for RNA packaging, we
      found that its ability to mediate packaging relies heavily on the context of the 
      downstream sequences. Insertion of the 5' UTR and the first 32-nt of gag into two
      different reporter RNAs is not sufficient to mediate the packaging of these RNA
      into HIV-1 particles. However, adding the 5' half of the gag gene to the 5' UTR
      strongly facilitates the packaging of two reporter RNAs; such RNAs can be
      packaged at >50% of the efficiencies of an HIV-1 near full-length vector. To
      further examine the role of the gag sequence in RNA packaging, we replaced the 5'
      gag sequence in the HIV-1 genome with two codon-optimized gag sequences and found
      that such substitutions only resulted in a moderate decrease of RNA packaging
      efficiencies. Taken together, these results indicated that both HIV-1 5' UTR and 
      the 5' gag sequence are required for efficient packaging of non-viral RNA into
      HIV-1 particles, although the gag sequence likely plays an indirect role in
      genome packaging.

AB  - Fragment-based drug discovery is an increasingly popular method to identify novel
      small-molecule drug candidates. One of the limitations of the approach is the
      difficulty of accurately characterizing weak binding events. This work reports a 
      combination of X-ray diffraction, surface plasmon resonance experiments and
      molecular dynamics simulations for the characterization of binders to different
      isoforms of the cyclophilin (Cyp) protein family. Although several Cyp inhibitors
      have been reported in the literature, it has proven challenging to achieve high
      binding selectivity for different isoforms of this protein family. The present
      studies have led to the identification of several structurally novel fragments
      that bind to diverse Cyp isoforms in distinct pockets with low millimolar
      dissociation constants. A detailed comparison of the merits and drawbacks of the 
      experimental and computational techniques is presented, and emerging strategies
      for designing ligands with enhanced isoform specificity are described.

AB  - Arabinoxylans are constituents of the human diet. Although not utilizable by the 
      human host, they can be fermented by colonic bacteria. The arabinoxylan backbone 
      is decorated with arabinose side chains that may be substituted with ferulic
      acid, thus limiting depolymerization to fermentable sugars. We investigated the
      polypeptides encoded by two genes upregulated during growth of the colonic
      bacterium Bacteroides intestinalis on wheat arabinoxylan. The recombinant
      proteins, designated BiFae1A and BiFae1B, were functionally assigned esterase
      activities. Both enzymes were active on acetylated substrates, although each
      showed a higher ferulic acid esterase activity on methyl-ferulate. BiFae1A showed
      a catalytic efficiency of 12mM s(-1) on para-nitrophenyl-acetate, and on
      methyl-ferulate, the value was 27 times higher. BiFae1B showed low catalytic
      efficiencies for both substrates. Furthermore, the two enzymes released ferulic
      acid from various structural elements, and NMR spectroscopy indicated complete
      de-esterification of arabinoxylan oligosaccharides from wheat bran. BiFae1A is a 
      tetramer based on the crystal structure, whereas BiFae1B is a dimer in solution
      based on size exclusion chromatography. The structure of BiFae1A was solved to
      1.98A resolution, and two tetramers were observed in the asymmetric unit. A
      flexible loop that may act as a hinge over the active site and likely coordinates
      critical interactions with the substrate was prominent in BiFae1A. Sequence
      alignments of the esterase domains in BiFae1B with the feruloyl esterase from
      Clostridium thermocellum suggest that both domains lack the flexible hinge in
      BiFae1A, an observation that may partly provide a molecular basis for the
      differences in activities in the two esterases.

AB  - The inherent conformational flexibility of nucleic acids facilitates the
      formation of a range of conformations such as duplex, triplex, quadruplex, etc.
      that play crucial roles in biological processes. Elucidation of the influence of 
      non-canonical base pair mismatches on DNA/RNA structures at different sequence
      contexts to understand the mismatch repair, misregulation of alternative splicing
      mechanisms and the sequence-dependent effect of RNA-DNA hybrid in relevance to
      antisense strategy demand their three-dimensional structural information.
      Furthermore, structural insights about nucleic acid triplexes, which are
      generally not tractable to structure determination by X-ray crystallography or
      NMR techniques, are essential to establish their biological function(s). A web
      server, namely 3D-NuS (http://iith.ac.in/3dnus/), has been developed to generate 
      energy-minimized models of 80 different types of triplexes, 64 types of
      G-quadruplexes, left-handed Z-DNA/RNA duplexes, and RNA-DNA hybrid duplex along
      with inter- and intramolecular DNA or RNA duplexes comprising a variety of
      mismatches and their chimeric forms for any user-defined sequence and length. It 
      also generates an ensemble of conformations corresponding to the modeled
      structure. These structures may serve as good starting models for docking
      proteins and small molecules with nucleic acids, NMR structure determination,
      cryo-electron microscope modeling, DNA/RNA nanotechnology applications and
      molecular dynamics simulation studies.

AB  - How structural dynamics affects cytokine signaling is under debate. Here, we
      investigated the dynamics of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor, IFNAR1, and
      its effect on signaling upon binding IFN and IFNAR2 using a combination of
      structure-based mechanistic studies, in situ binding, and gene induction assays. 
      Our study reveals that IFNAR1 flexibility modulates ligand-binding affinity,
      which, in turn, regulates biological signaling. We identified the hinge sites and
      key interactions implicated in IFNAR1 inter-subdomain (SD1-SD4) movements. We
      showed that the predicted cooperative movements are essential to accommodate
      intermolecular interactions. Engineered disulfide bridges, computationally
      predicted to interfere with IFNAR1 dynamics, were experimentally confirmed.
      Notably, introducing disulfide bonds between subdomains SD2 and SD3 modulated IFN
      binding and activity in accordance with the relative attenuation of cooperative
      movements with varying distance from the hinge center, whereas locking the
      SD3-SD4 interface flexibility in favor of an extended conformer increased
      activity.

AB  - Chromatin is the complex of eukaryotic DNA and proteins required for the
      efficient compaction of the nearly 2-meter-long human genome into a roughly
      10-micron-diameter cell nucleus. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is
      the nucleosome: 147bp of DNA wrapped about an octamer of histone proteins.
      Nucleosomes are stable enough to organize the genome yet must be dynamically
      displaced and reassembled to allow access to the underlying DNA for
      transcription, replication, and DNA damage repair. Histone chaperones are a
      non-catalytic group of proteins that are central to the processes of nucleosome
      assembly and disassembly and thus the fluidity of the ever-changing chromatin
      landscape. Histone chaperones are responsible for binding the highly basic
      histone proteins, shielding them from non-specific interactions, facilitating
      their deposition onto DNA, and aiding in their eviction from DNA. Although most
      histone chaperones perform these common functions, recent structural studies of
      many different histone chaperones reveal that there are few commonalities in
      their folds. Importantly, sequence-based predictions show that histone chaperones
      are highly enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and acidic
      stretches. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms underpinning
      histone binding, selectivity, and regulation of these highly dynamic protein
      regions. We highlight new evidence suggesting that IDRs are often critical for
      histone chaperone function and play key roles in chromatin assembly and
      disassembly pathways.

      Conformational Plasticity.

AB  - Arkadia (Rnf111) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a central role in the
      amplification of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling responses
      by targeting for degradation the negative regulators of the pathway, Smad6 and
      Smad7, and the nuclear co-repressors Ski and Skil (SnoN). Arkadia's function in
      vivo depends on the really interesting new gene (RING)-H2 interaction with the E2
      enzyme UbcH5b in order to ligate ubiquitin chains on its substrates. A conserved 
      tryptophan (W972) in the C-terminal alpha-helix is widely accepted as essential
      for E2 recruitment and interaction and thus also for E3 enzymatic activity. The
      present NMR-driven study provides an atomic-level investigation of the structural
      and dynamical properties of two W972 Arkadia RING mutants, attempting to
      illuminate for the first time the differences between a functional and a
      nonfunctional mutant W972A and W972R, respectively. A TGF-beta-responsive
      promoter driving luciferase was used to assay for Arkadia function in vivo. These
      experiments showed that the Arkadia W972A mutant has the same activity as
      wild-type (WT) Arkadia in enhancing TGF-beta signaling responses, while W972R
      does not. Only minor structural differences exist between the W972A RING domain
      and WT-RING. In contrast, the W972R mutant hardly interacts with E2. The loss of 
      function correlates with structural changes in the C-terminal alpha-helix and an 
      increase in the distance between the Zn(II) ions. Our data show that the position
      occupied by W972 within WT Arkadia is critical for the function of RING and that 
      it depends on the nature of the residue at this position.

AB  - Drug-like molecules targeting allosteric sites in proteins are of great
      therapeutic interest; however, identification of potential sites is not trivial. 
      A straightforward approach to identify hidden allosteric sites is demonstrated in
      protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) by creation of single alanine mutations in
      the catalytic acid loop of PTP1B and VHR. This approach relies on the reciprocal 
      interactions between an allosteric site and its coupled orthosteric site. The
      resulting NMR chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) of each mutant reveal clusters 
      of distal residues affected by acid loop mutation. In PTP1B and VHR, two new
      allosteric clusters were identified in each enzyme. Mutations in these allosteric
      clusters altered phosphatase activity with changes in kcat/KM ranging from 30% to
      nearly 100-fold. This work outlines a simple method for identification of new
      allosteric sites in PTP, and given the basis of this method in thermodynamics, it
      is expected to be generally useful in other systems.

AB  - Direction switching in the flagellar motor of Escherichia coli is under the
      control of a complex on the rotor formed from the proteins FliG, FliM, and FliN. 
      FliG lies at the top of the switch complex (i.e., nearest the membrane) and is
      arranged with its C-terminal domain (FliGC) resting on the middle domain (FliGM) 
      of the neighboring subunit. This organization requires the protein to adopt an
      open conformation that exposes the surfaces engaging in intersubunit FliGC/FliGM 
      contacts. In a recent study, Baker and coworkers [13] obtained evidence that FliG
      in the cytosol is monomeric and takes on a more compact conformation, with FliGC 
      making intramolecular contact with FliGM of the same subunit. In the present
      work, we examine the conformational preferences and interactions of FliG through 
      in vivo crosslinking experiments in cells that lack either all other flagellar
      proteins or just the MS-ring protein FliF. The results indicate that FliG has a
      significant tendency to form multimers independently of other flagellar
      components. The multimerization of FliG is promoted by FliF and also by FliM.
      FliM does not multimerize efficiently by itself but does so in the presence of
      FliG. Thus, pre-assemblies of the switch-complex proteins can form in the cytosol
      and might function as intermediates in assembly.

AB  - Continuous and error-free chromosome inheritance through the cell cycle is
      essential for genomic stability and tumor suppression. However, accumulation of
      aberrant genetic materials often causes the cell cycle to go awry, leading to
      malignant transformation. In response to genotoxic stress, cells employ diverse
      adaptive mechanisms to halt or exit the cell cycle temporarily or permanently.
      The intrinsic machinery of cycling, resting, and exiting shapes the cellular
      response to extrinsic stimuli, whereas prevalent disruption of the cell cycle
      machinery in tumor cells often confers resistance to anticancer therapy.
      Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and a guardian of the
      genome that is frequently mutated or deleted in human cancer. Moreover, it is
      increasingly evident that PTEN deficiency disrupts the fundamental processes of
      genetic transmission. Cells lacking PTEN exhibit cell cycle deregulation and cell
      fate reprogramming. Here, we review the role of PTEN in regulating the key
      processes in and out of cell cycle to optimize genomic integrity.

AB  - Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni is a human pathogen that causes
      leptospirosis, a worldwide zoonosis. The L. interrogans genome codes for a wide
      array of potential diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes with characteristic GGDEF
      domains capable of synthesizing the cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP, known to
      regulate transitions between different cellular behavioral states in bacteria.
      Among such enzymes, LIC13137 (Lcd1), which has an N-terminal cGMP-specific
      phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclases, and FhlA (GAF) domain and a C-terminal
      GGDEF domain, is notable for having close orthologs present only in pathogenic
      Leptospira species. Although the function and structure of GGDEF and GAF domains 
      have been studied extensively separately, little is known about enzymes with the 
      GAF-GGDEF architecture. In this report, we address the question of how the GAF
      domain regulates the DGC activity of Lcd1. The full-length Lcd1 and its GAF
      domain form dimers in solution. The GAF domain binds specifically cAMP (KD of
      0.24muM) and has an important role in the regulation of the DGC activity of the
      GGDEF domain. Lcd1 DGC activity is negligible in the absence of cAMP and is
      significantly enhanced in its presence (specific activity of 0.13s(-1)). The
      crystal structure of the Lcd1 GAF domain in complex with cAMP provides valuable
      insights toward explaining its specificity for cAMP and pointing to possible
      mechanisms by which this cyclic nucleotide regulates the assembly of an active
      DGC enzyme.

AB  - Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) is the ability of DNA polymerases to incorporate 
      nucleotides opposite and beyond damaged DNA. TLS activity is an important risk
      factor for the initiation and progression of genetic diseases such as cancer. In 
      this study, we evaluate the ability of a high-fidelity DNA polymerase to perform 
      TLS with 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-G), a highly pro-mutagenic DNA lesion formed by
      reactive oxygen species. Results of kinetic studies monitoring the incorporation 
      of modified nucleotide analogs demonstrate that the binding affinity of the
      incoming dNTP is controlled by the overall hydrophobicity of the nucleobase.
      However, the rate constant for the polymerization step is regulated by
      hydrogen-bonding interactions made between the incoming nucleotide with 8-oxo-G. 
      Results generated here for replicating the miscoding 8-oxo-G are compared to
      those published for the replication of the non-instructional abasic site. During 
      the replication of both lesions, binding of the nucleotide substrate is
      controlled by energetics associated with nucleobase desolvation, whereas the rate
      constant for the polymerization step is influenced by the physical nature of the 
      DNA lesion, that is, miscoding versus non-instructional. Collectively, these
      studies highlight the importance of nucleobase desolvation as a key physical
      feature that enhances the misreplication of structurally diverse DNA lesions.

AB  - In addition to contributing to immune exclusion at mucosal surfaces, secretory
      IgA (SIgA) made of polymeric IgA and secretory component is able to selectively
      reenter via microfold cells into Peyer's patches (PPs) present along the
      intestine and to associate with dendritic cells (DCs) of the
      CD11c(+)CD11b(+)MHCII(+)F4/80(-)CD8(-)phenotype in the subepithelial dome region 
      and the draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). However, the nature of the
      receptor(s) for SIgA on murine PP and MLN DCs is unknown. We find that
      glycosylated secretory component moiety and polymeric IgA are both involved in
      the specific interaction with these cells. Using blocking antibodies and
      competition experiments, we identify Dectin-1 and specific intercellular adhesion
      molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin receptor 3 (SIGNR3) as receptors for SIgA. While
      SIgA-commensal immune complexes (ICs) contribute to local homeostasis upon
      interaction with mucosal DCs, the picture is less clear for pathogenic agents. We
      find that in comparison with incubation of Shigella flexneri alone, association
      of the enteropathogen with SIgA prompts freshly isolated DCs from PPs and MLNs to
      invert the production of pro- versus non-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. The
      sum of the data suggests that in contrast to IgG-based ICs boosting immune
      reactivity of antigen-presenting cells, SIgA produced during an ongoing immune
      response can, in addition to its known function of immune exclusion, modulate
      mucosal DC conditioning via specific interaction with Dectin-1 and SIGNR3.

AB  - Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) catalyzes the introduction of
      monomethylation marks at the arginine residues of substrate proteins. PRMT7 plays
      important roles in the regulation of gene expression, splicing, DNA damage,
      paternal imprinting, cancer and metastasis. However, little is known about the
      interaction partners of PRMT7. To address this, we performed yeast two-hybrid
      screening of PRMT7 and identified argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) as a
      potential interaction partner of PRMT7. We confirmed that PRMT7 directly
      interacts with ASS1 using pull-down studies. ASS1 catalyzes the rate-limiting
      step of arginine synthesis in urea cycle and citrulline-nitric oxide cycle. We
      mapped the interface of PRMT7-ASS1 complex through computational approaches and
      validated the predicted interface in vivo by site-directed mutagenesis.
      Evolutionary analysis revealed that the ASS1 residues important for PRMT7-ASS1
      interaction have co-evolved with PRMT7. We showed that ASS1 mutations linked to
      type I citrullinemia disrupt the ASS1-PRMT7 interaction, which might explain the 
      molecular pathogenesis of the disease.

      Resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.

AB  - Enterococcus faecalis, a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, exhibits 
      intrinsic resistance to most cephalosporins, which are antibiotics in the
      beta-lactam family that target cell-wall biosynthesis. A comprehensive
      understanding of the underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms of
      cephalosporin resistance in E. faecalis is lacking. We previously determined that
      a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase (IreK) and its cognate phosphatase (IreP)
      reciprocally regulate cephalosporin resistance in E. faecalis, dependent on the
      kinase activity of IreK. Other than IreK itself, thus far the only known
      substrate for reversible phosphorylation by IreK and IreP is IreB, a small
      protein of unknown function that is well conserved in low-GC Gram-positive
      bacteria. We previously showed that IreB acts as a negative regulator of
      cephalosporin resistance in E. faecalis. However, the biochemical mechanism by
      which IreB modulates cephalosporin resistance remains unknown. As a next step
      toward an understanding of the mechanism by which IreB regulates resistance, we
      initiated a structure-function study on IreB. The NMR solution structure of IreB 
      was determined, revealing that IreB adopts a unique fold and forms a dimer in
      vitro. Dimerization of IreB was confirmed in vivo. Substitutions at the dimer
      interface impaired IreB function and stability in vivo, indicating that
      dimerization is functionally important for the biological activity of IreB.
      Hence, these studies provide new insights into the structure and function of a
      widely conserved protein of unknown function that is an important regulator of
      antimicrobial resistance in E. faecalis.

AB  - A long-standing question of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genetic variation 
      and evolution has been whether differences exist in mutation rate and/or mutation
      spectra among HIV types (i.e., HIV-1 versus HIV-2) and among HIV groups (i.e.,
      HIV-1 groups M-P and HIV-2 groups A-H) and HIV-1 Group M subtypes (i.e., subtypes
      A-D, F-H, and J-K). To address this, we developed a new single-strand consensus
      sequencing assay for the determination of HIV mutation frequencies and spectra
      using the Illumina sequencing platform. This assay enables parallel and
      standardized comparison of HIV mutagenesis among various viral vectors with lower
      background error than traditional methods of Illumina library preparation. We
      found significant differences in viral mutagenesis between HIV types but
      intriguingly no significant differences among HIV-1 Group M subtypes. More
      specifically, HIV-1 exhibited higher transition frequencies than HIV-2, due
      mostly to single G-to-A mutations and (to a lesser extent) G-to-A hypermutation. 
      These data suggest that HIV-2 RT exhibits higher fidelity during viral
      replication, and taken together, these findings demonstrate that HIV type but not
      subtype significantly affects viral mutation frequencies and spectra. These
      differences may inform antiviral and vaccine strategies.

AB  - Although phosphorylation directs serine-arginine (SR) proteins from nuclear
      storage speckles to the nucleoplasm for splicing function, dephosphorylation
      paradoxically induces similar movement, raising the question of how such chemical
      modifications are balanced in these essential splicing factors. In this new
      study, we investigated the interaction of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) with the SR
      protein splicing factor (SRSF1) to understand the foundation of these opposing
      effects in the nucleus. We found that RNA recognition motif 1 (RRM1) in SRSF1
      binds PP1 and represses its catalytic function through an allosteric mechanism.
      Disruption of RRM1-PP1 interactions reduces the phosphorylation status of the RS 
      domain in vitro and in cells, redirecting SRSF1 in the nucleus. The data imply
      that an allosteric SR protein-phosphatase platform balances phosphorylation
      levels in a "goldilocks" region for the proper subnuclear storage of an SR
      protein splicing factor.

AB  - Mitochondrial biogenesis and function depend on the intensive exchange of
      molecules with other cellular compartments. The mitochondrial outer membrane
      plays a central role in this communication process. It is equipped with a number 
      of specific protein machineries that enable the transport of proteins and
      metabolites. Furthermore, the outer membrane forms molecular contact sites with
      other cell organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus integrating
      mitochondrial function in cellular physiology. The best-studied mitochondrial
      organelle contact site, the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) has been 
      linked to many vital processes including mitochondrial division, inheritance,
      mitophagy, and phospholipid transport. Strikingly, ER-mitochondria contact sites 
      are closely connected to outer membrane protein translocases. The translocase of 
      the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) represents the general mitochondrial entry
      gate for precursor proteins that are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes. The
      outer membrane also harbors the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) that
      mediates membrane insertion of beta-barrel proteins. Both of these essential
      protein translocases are functionally linked to ER-mitochondria contact sites.
      First, the SAM complex associates with an ERMES core component to promote
      assembly of the TOM complex. Second, several TOM components have been co-opted as
      ER-mitochondria tethers. We propose that protein import and organelle contact
      sites are linked to coordinate processes important for mitochondrial biogenesis.

AB  - G-quadruplexes (G4s) are extremely stable DNA or RNA secondary structures formed 
      by sequences rich in guanine. These structures are implicated in many essential
      cellular processes, and the number of biological functions attributed to them
      continues to grow. While DNA G4s are well understood on structural and, to some
      extent, functional levels, RNA G4s and their functions have received less
      attention. The presence of bona fide RNA G4s in cells has long been a matter of
      debate. The development of G4-specific antibodies and ligands hinted on their
      presence in vivo, but recent advances in RNA sequencing coupled with chemical
      footprinting suggested the opposite. In this review, we will critically discuss
      the biology of RNA G4s focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying their
      proposed functions.

AB  - Epithelial cadherin (Ecadherin) is responsible for the intercellular cohesion of 
      epithelial tissues. It forms lateral clusters within adherens cell-cell
      junctions, but its association state outside these clusters is unknown. Here, we 
      use a quantitative Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach to show that
      Ecadherin forms constitutive dimers and that these dimers exist independently of 
      the actin cytoskeleton or cytoplasmic proteins. The dimers are stabilized by
      intermolecular contacts that occur along the entire length of Ecadherin, with the
      intracellular domains having a surprisingly strong favorable contribution. We
      further show that Ecadherin mutations and calcium depletion induce structural
      alterations that propagate from the N terminus all the way to the C terminus,
      without destabilizing the dimeric state. These findings provide context for the
      interpretation of Ecadherin adhesion experiments. They also suggest that early
      events of adherens junction assembly involve interactions between from preformed 
      Ecadherin dimers.

AB  - The protein kinase threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK; also known as Mps1) is a
      critical component of the spindle assembly checkpoint and a promising drug target
      for the treatment of aggressive cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer.
      While the first TTK inhibitors have entered clinical trials, little is known
      about how the inhibition of TTK with small-molecule compounds affects cellular
      activity. We studied the selective TTK inhibitor NTRC 0066-0, which was developed
      in our own laboratory, together with 11 TTK inhibitors developed by other
      companies, including Mps-BAY2b, BAY 1161909, BAY 1217389 (Bayer), TC-Mps1-12
      (Shionogi), and MPI-0479605 (Myrexis). Parallel testing shows that the cellular
      activity of these TTK inhibitors correlates with their binding affinity to TTK
      and, more strongly, with target residence time. TTK inhibitors are therefore an
      example where target residence time determines activity in in vitro cellular
      assays. X-ray structures and thermal stability experiments reveal that the most
      potent compounds induce a shift of the glycine-rich loop as a result of binding
      to the catalytic lysine at position 553. This "lysine trap" disrupts the
      catalytic machinery. Based on these insights, we developed TTK inhibitors, based 
      on a (5,6-dihydro)pyrimido[4,5-e]indolizine scaffold, with longer target
      residence times, which further exploit an allosteric pocket surrounding Lys553.
      Their binding mode is new for kinase inhibitors and can be classified as hybrid
      Type I/Type III. These inhibitors have very potent anti-proliferative activity
      that rivals classic cytotoxic therapy. Our findings will open up new avenues for 
      more applications for TTK inhibitors in cancer treatment.

AB  - The influenza M2 protein forms an acid-activated proton channel that is essential
      for virus replication. The transmembrane H37 selects for protons under low
      external pH while W41 ensures proton conduction only from the N terminus to the C
      terminus and prevents reverse current under low internal pH. Here, we address the
      molecular basis for this asymmetric conduction by investigating the structure and
      dynamics of a mutant channel, W41F, which permits reverse current under low
      internal pH. Solid-state NMR experiments show that W41F M2 retains the
      pH-dependent alpha-helical conformations and tetrameric structure of the
      wild-type (WT) channel but has significantly altered protonation and tautomeric
      equilibria at H37. At high pH, the H37 structure is shifted toward the pi
      tautomer and less cationic tetrads, consistent with faster forward deprotonation 
      to the C terminus. At low pH, the mutant channel contains more cationic tetrads
      than the WT channel, consistent with faster reverse protonation from the C
      terminus. (15)N NMR spectra allow the extraction of four H37 pKas and show that
      the pKas are more clustered in the mutant channel compared to WT M2. Moreover,
      binding of the antiviral drug, amantadine, at the N-terminal pore at low pH did
      not convert all histidines to the neutral state, as seen in WT M2, but left half 
      of all histidines cationic, unambiguously demonstrating C-terminal protonation of
      H37 in the mutant. These results indicate that asymmetric conduction in WT M2 is 
      due to W41 inhibition of C-terminal acid activation by H37. When Trp is replaced 
      by Phe, protons can be transferred to H37 bidirectionally with distinct rate
      constants.

AB  - Mutation of the cysteines forming the disulfide loop of the platelet GPIbalpha
      adhesive A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF) causes quantitative VWF
      deficiencies in the blood and von Willebrand disease. We report two cases of
      transient severe thrombocytopenia induced by DDAVP treatment. Cys1272Trp and
      Cys1458Tyr mutations identified by genetic sequencing implicate an abnormal
      gain-of-function phenotype, evidenced by thrombocytopenia, which quickly relapses
      back to normal platelet counts and deficient plasma VWF. Using surface plasmon
      resonance, analytical rheology, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
      (HXMS), we decipher mechanisms of A1-GPIbalpha-mediated platelet adhesion and
      resolve dynamic secondary structure elements that regulate the binding pathway.
      Constrained by the disulfide, conformational selection between weak and tight
      binding states of A1 takes precedence and drives normal platelet adhesion to VWF.
      Less restrained through mutation, loss of the disulfide preferentially diverts
      binding through an induced-fit disease pathway enabling high-affinity GPIbalpha
      binding and firm platelet adhesion to a partially disordered A1 domain. HXMS
      reveals a dynamic asymmetry of flexible and ordered regions common to both
      variants, indicating that the partially disordered A1 lacking the disulfide
      retains native-like structural dynamics. Both binding mechanisms share common
      structural and thermodynamic properties, but the enhanced local disorder in the
      disease state perpetuates high-affinity platelet agglutination, characteristic of
      type 2B VWD, upon DDAVP-stimulated secretion of VWF leading to transient
      thrombocytopenia and a subsequent deficiency of plasma VWF, characteristic of
      type 2A VWD.

AB  - Telomerase maintains telomere length and chromosome integrity by adding short
      tandem repeats of single-stranded DNA to the 3' ends, via reverse transcription
      of a defined template region of its RNA subunit. To further understand the
      telomerase elongation mechanism, we studied the primer utilization and extension 
      activity of the telomerase from the budding yeast Naumovozyma castellii
      (Saccharomyces castellii), which displays a processive nucleotide and repeat
      addition polymerization. For the efficient initiation of canonical elongation,
      telomerase required 4-nt primer 3' end complementarity to the template RNA. This 
      DNA-RNA hybrid formation was highly important for the stabilization of an
      initiation-competent telomerase-DNA complex. Anchor site interactions with the
      DNA provided additional stabilization to the complex. Our studies indicate three 
      additional separate interactions along the length of the DNA primer, each
      providing different and distinct contributions to the initiation event. A
      sequence-independent anchor site interaction acts immediately adjacent to the
      base-pairing 3' end, indicating a protein anchor site positioned very close to
      the catalytic site. Two additional anchor regions further 5' on the DNA provide
      sequence-specific contributions to the initiation of elongation. Remarkably, a
      non-telomeric sequence in the distal 25- to 32-nt region negatively influences
      the initiation of telomerase elongation, suggesting an anchor site with a
      regulatory role in the telomerase elongation decision.

AB  - The low frequency of HIV-1 recombinants within entire viral populations in both
      individual patients and culture-based infection models impedes investigation of
      the underlying factors contributing to either the occurrence of recombinants or
      the survival of recombinants once they are formed. So far, most of the related
      studies have no consideration of recombinants' functionality. Here, we
      established a functional recombinant production (FRP) system to produce pure and 
      functional HIV-1 intersubtype Env recombinants and utilized 454 pyrosequencing to
      investigate the distribution of over 4000 functional and non-functional
      recombination breakpoints from either the FRP system or dual infection cultures. 
      The results revealed that most of the breakpoints converged in gp41 (62%) and C1 
      (25.3%) domains of gp120, which has strong correlation with the similarity
      between the two recombining sequences. Yet, the breakpoints also appeared in C2
      (5.2%) and C5 (4.6%) domains not correlated with the recombining sequence
      similarity. Interestingly, none of the intersubtype gp120 recombinants recombined
      between C1 and gp41 regions either from the FRP system or from the dual infection
      culture, and very few from the HIV epidemic were functional. The present study
      suggests that the selection of functional Env recombinants is one of the reasons 
      for the predominance of C1 and gp41 Env recombinants in the HIV epidemic, and it 
      provides an in vitro model to mimic the selection of replication-competent HIV-1 
      intersubtype recombination in dual or superinfected patients.

AB  - Dedifferentiation is an important process to replenish lost stem cells during
      aging or regeneration after injury to maintain tissue homeostasis. Here, we
      report that Enhancer of Zeste [E(z)], a component of the Polycomb repression
      complex 2 (PRC2), is required to maintain a stable pool of germline stem cells
      (GSCs) within the niche microenvironment. During aging, germ cells with reduced
      E(z) activity cannot meet that requirement, but the defect arises from neither
      increased GSC death nor premature differentiation. Instead, we found evidence
      that the decrease of GSCs upon the inactivation of E(z) in the germline could be 
      attributed to defective dedifferentiation. During recovery from genetically
      manipulated GSC depletion, E(z) knockdown germ cells also fail to replenish lost 
      GSCs. Taken together, our data suggest that E(z) acts intrinsically in germ cells
      to activate dedifferentiation and thus replenish lost GSCs during both aging and 
      tissue regeneration.

TI  - Regulation of Nucleosome Stacking and Chromatin Compaction by the Histone H4
      N-Terminal Tail-H2A Acidic Patch Interaction.
PG  - 2075-2092

AB  - Chromatin folding and dynamics are critically dependent on nucleosome-nucleosome 
      interactions with important contributions from internucleosome binding of the
      histone H4 N-terminal tail K16-R23 domain to the surface of the H2A/H2B dimer.
      The H4 Lys16 plays a pivotal role in this regard. Using in vitro reconstituted
      12-mer nucleosome arrays, we have investigated the mechanism of the H4 N-terminal
      tail in maintaining nucleosome-nucleosome stacking and mediating intra- and
      inter-array chromatin compaction, with emphasis on the role of K16 and the
      positive charge region, R17-R23. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation
      velocity experiments and precipitation assays were employed to analyze effects on
      chromatin folding and self-association, respectively. Effects on chromatin
      folding caused by various mutations and modifications at position K16 in the H4
      histone were studied. Additionally, using charge-quenching mutations, we
      characterized the importance of the interaction of the residues within the H4
      positive charge region R17-R23 with the H2A acidic patch of the adjacent
      nucleosome. Furthermore, crosslinking experiments were conducted to establish the
      proximity of the basic tail region to the acidic patch. Our data indicate that
      the positive charge and length of the side chain of H4 K16 are important for its 
      access to the adjacent nucleosome in the process of nucleosome-nucleosome
      stacking and array folding. The location and orientation of the H4 R17-R23 domain
      on the H2A/H2B dimer surface of the neighboring nucleosome core particle (NCP) in
      the compacted chromatin fiber were established. The dominance of electrostatic
      interactions in maintaining intra-array interaction was demonstrated.

AB  - Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) carry an epigenetic layer of
      message to regulate diverse cellular processes at the chromatin level. Many of
      these PTMs are selectively recognized by dedicated effector proteins for normal
      cell growth and development, while dysregulation of these recognition events is
      often implicated in human diseases, notably cancer. Thus, it is fundamentally
      important to elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying the readout of PTMs
      on histones. The Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, Sas5 (YEATS) domain is an emerging reader
      module that selectively recognizes histone lysine acylation with a preference for
      crotonylation over acetylation. In the review, we discuss the recognition of
      histone acylations by the YEATS domain and the biological significance of this
      readout from multiple perspectives.

AB  - Serine 31 of histone H3.3 is phosphorylated during mitosis in mammalian cells and
      has been shown to influence chromosome segregation. We established a screening
      system to identify candidate kinase(s) phosphorylating H3.3S31 by using siRNA
      library targeting 720 human kinases, and we confirmed the results with an
      independent kinase inhibitor screen. Aurora kinase B was the best candidate hit
      in both screens. Moreover, the kinase activity of Aurora B on H3.3S31 was
      biochemically confirmed with nucleosomal substrates in vitro.

AB  - Transcriptional enhancers play a key role in cell type-specific gene expression
      and cell fate transition. Enhancers are marked by histone H3K4 mono- and
      di-methylation (H3K4me1/2). The tumor suppressor MLL4 (KMT2D) is a major enhancer
      H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with a partial functional redundancy with
      MLL3 (KMT2C). However, the functional role of MLL4 enzymatic activity remains
      elusive. To address this issue, we have generated MLL4 enzyme-dead knock-in (KI) 
      embryonic stem (ES) cells and mice, which carry Y5477A/Y5523A/Y5563A mutations in
      the enzymatic SET domain of the MLL4 protein. Homozygous MLL4 enzyme-dead KI
      (Mll4(KI/KI)) mice are embryonic lethal and die around E10.5, which phenocopies
      Mll4 knockout mice. Interestingly, enzyme-dead MLL4 protein in ES cells is highly
      unstable. Like Mll4 knockout ES cells, Mll4(KI/KI) ES cells show reduced levels
      of H3K4me1/2. Furthermore, we show that ectopic expression of histone H3.3 lysine
      4-to-methionine (K4M) mutant, which reduces endogenous H3K4 methylation levels in
      ES cells, decreases the protein stability of MLL3 and MLL4 but not that of H3K4
      methyltransferases SET1A (KMT2F) and SET1B (KMT2G). Taken together, our findings 
      indicate that MLL4 protein stability is tightly regulated by its H3K4
      methyltransferase activity.

AB  - Mutations that affect myelodysplasia/myeloid leukemia factor (MLF) proteins are
      associated with leukemia and several other cancers. However, with no strong
      homology to other proteins of known function, the role of MLF proteins in the
      cell has remained elusive. Here, we describe a proteomics approach that
      identifies MLF as a member of a nuclear chaperone complex containing a DnaJ
      protein, BCL2-associated anthanogene 2, and Hsc70. This complex associates with
      chromatin and regulates the expression of target genes. The MLF complex is bound 
      to sites of nucleosome depletion and sites containing active chromatin marks
      (e.g., H3K4me3 and H3K4me1). Hence, MLF binding is enriched at promoters and
      enhancers. Additionally, the MLF-chaperone complex functions to regulate
      transcription factor stability, including the RUNX transcription factor involved 
      in hematopoiesis. Although Hsc70 and other co-chaperones have been shown to play 
      a role in nuclear translocation of a variety of proteins including transcription 
      factors, our findings suggest that MLF and the associated co-chaperones play a
      direct role in modulating gene transcription.

AB  - Histone proteins wrap around DNA to form nucleosomes, which further compact into 
      the higher-order structure of chromatin. In addition to the canonical histones,
      there are also variant histones that often have pivotal roles in regulating
      chromatin dynamics and in the accessibility of the underlying DNA. H3.3 is the
      most common non-centromeric variant of histone H3 that differs from the canonical
      H3 by just 4-5 aa. Here, we discuss the current knowledge of H3.3 in
      transcriptional regulation and the recent discoveries and molecular mechanisms of
      H3.3 mutations in human cancer.

AB  - Lysine acetylation of histone proteins is a fundamental post-translational
      modification that regulates chromatin structure and plays an important role in
      gene transcription. Aberrant levels of histone lysine acetylation are associated 
      with the development of several diseases. Acetyl-lysine modifications create
      docking sites for bromodomains, which are structurally conserved modules present 
      in transcription-associated proteins that are termed "reader" proteins.
      Bromodomain-containing reader proteins are part of multiprotein complexes that
      regulate transcription programs, which are often associated with profound
      phenotypic changes. Many bromodomain-containing proteins are aberrantly expressed
      in diseases, as best studied in cancers, where bromodomain proteins impact the
      expression of oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins. Thus, bromodomain readers of
      histone acetylation have emerged as attractive targets for cancer drug discovery,
      prompting immense interest in epigenetic-focused, medicinal chemistry to develop 
      structurally guided chemical probes of bromodomains. Here, we describe
      bromodomain-containing proteins with defined roles in cancer and highlight recent
      progress in the development of bromodomain inhibitors.

AB  - When a cell divides, it must not only accurately duplicate its genome but also
      recapitulate its programme of gene expression. A significant body of evidence
      suggests that an important fraction of the information specifying the
      transcriptional programme of vertebrate cells is carried epigenetically by
      post-translational modifications of histone proteins. For such a system to
      operate, propagation of key histone marks must be coupled to replication such
      that they remain correctly associated with the underlying DNA sequence, despite
      the huge disruption to chromatin structure generated by unwinding the parental
      DNA strands. Focusing on vertebrate cells but drawing on experimental evidence
      from a wide range of systems, we will examine the evidence that histone mark
      propagation through replication contributes to transcriptional stability. We then
      discuss the emerging molecular mechanisms that ensure that histone recycling is
      tightly coupled to DNA replication, focusing on how parental histone proteins are
      chaperoned around the replication fork, and the strategies that ensure that this 
      process is not disrupted by impediments to replication.

AB  - Incorporation of variant histone sequences, in addition to post-translational
      modification of histones, serves to modulate the chromatin environment. Different
      histone chaperone proteins mediate the storage and chromatin deposition of
      variant histones. Although the two non-centromeric histone H3 variants, H3.1 and 
      H3.3, differ by only 5 aa, replacement of histone H3.1 with H3.3 can modulate the
      transcription for highly expressed and developmentally required genes, lead to
      the formation of repressive heterochromatin, or aid in DNA and chromatin repair. 
      The human histone cell cycle regulator (HIRA) complex composed of HIRA,
      ubinuclein-1, CABIN1, and transiently anti-silencing function 1, forms one of the
      two complexes that bind and deposit H3.3/H4 into chromatin. A number of recent
      biochemical and structural studies have revealed important details underlying how
      these proteins assemble and function together as a multiprotein H3.3-specific
      histone chaperone complex. Here, we present a review of existing data and present
      a new model for the assembly of the HIRA complex and for the HIRA-mediated
      incorporation of H3.3/H4 into chromatin.

AB  - Genome sequencing of large cohorts of tumors has revealed that mutations in genes
      encoding chromatin regulators are frequent in cancer. However, the precise
      contribution of these mutations to tumor development often remains elusive. Here,
      we review the current knowledge concerning the alterations of the Polycomb
      machinery in cancer, with a particular focus on the Polycomb repressive complex 2
      (PRC2), a key chromatin modifier involved in the maintenance of transcriptional
      silencing. A broad variety of alterations can impair PRC2 activity; yet, overall,
      only one type of alteration is found in a given class of tumor. We discuss the
      potential impact of the various types of PRC2 alterations on gene expression. We 
      propose that the distinct set of genes regulated by PRC2, depending on tumor
      etiology, constrain the type of alteration of PRC2 that can fuel tumor
      development. Beyond this specificity, we propose that PRC2 and, more generally,
      chromatin regulators act as gatekeepers of transcriptional integrity, a role that
      often confers a tumor-suppressive function.

AB  - When yeast cells are challenged by a fluctuating environment, signaling networks 
      activate differentiation programs that promote their individual or collective
      survival. These programs include the initiation of meiotic sporulation, the
      formation of filamentous growth structures, and the activation of programmed cell
      death pathways. The establishment and maintenance of these distinct cell fates
      are driven by massive gene expression programs that promote the necessary changes
      in morphology and physiology. While these genomic reprogramming events depend on 
      a specialized network of transcription factors, a diverse set of chromatin
      regulators, including histone-modifying enzymes, chromatin remodelers, and
      histone variants, also play essential roles. Here, we review the broad functions 
      of histone modifications in initiating cell fate transitions, with particular
      focus on their contribution to the control of expression of key genes required
      for the differentiation programs and chromatin reorganization that accompanies
      these cell fates.

AB  - Histone methylation dynamics plays a critical role in cellular programming during
      development. For example, specific lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine
      demethylases (KDMs) have been implicated in the differentiation of mesenchymal
      stem cells into various cell lineages. However, a systematic and functional
      analysis for an entire family of KMT or KDM enzymes has not been performed. Here,
      we test the function of all the known and candidate KDMs in myoblast and
      osteoblast differentiation using the C2C12 cell differentiation model system. Our
      analysis identified that LSD1 is the only KDM required for myogenic
      differentiation and that KDM3B, KDM6A, and KDM8 are the candidate KDMs required
      for osteoblast differentiation. We find that LSD1, via H3K4me1 demethylation,
      represses the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation RUNX2 to promote
      myogenesis in the C2C12 model system. Finally, MLL4 is required for efficient
      osteoblast differentiation in part by countering LSD1 H3K4me1 demethylation at
      the RUNX2 enhancer. Together, our findings provide additional mechanisms by which
      lysine methylation signaling impacts on cell fate decisions.

AB  - Development is generally regarded as a unidirectional process that results in the
      acquisition of specialized cell fates. During this process, cellular identity is 
      precisely defined by signaling cues that tailor the chromatin landscape for
      cell-specific gene expression programs. Once established, these pathways and cell
      states are typically resistant to disruption. However, loss of cell identity
      occurs during tumor initiation and upon injury response. Moreover, terminally
      differentiated cells can be experimentally provoked to become pluripotent.
      Chromatin reorganization is key to the establishment of new gene expression
      signatures and thus new cell identity. Here, we explore an emerging concept that 
      lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) enzymes drive cellular plasticity in the context
      of somatic cell reprogramming and tumorigenesis.

AB  - The plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of Set3 binds methylated lysine 4 of histone
      H3 in vitro and in vivo; however, precise selectivity of this domain has not been
      fully characterized. Here, we explore the determinants of methyllysine
      recognition by the PHD fingers of Set3 and its orthologs. We use X-ray
      crystallographic and spectroscopic approaches to show that the Set3 PHD finger
      binds di- and trimethylated states of H3K4 with comparable affinities and employs
      similar molecular mechanisms to form complexes with either mark. Composition of
      the methyllysine-binding pocket plays an essential role in determining the
      selectivity of the PHD fingers. The finding that the histone-binding activity is 
      not conserved in the PHD finger of Set4 suggests different functions for the Set3
      and Set4 paralogs.

AB  - Structure-based vaccine design depends on extensive structural analyses of
      antigen-antibody complexes.Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) can
      circumvent some of the problems of x-ray crystallography as a pipeline for
      obtaining the required structures. We have examined the potential of
      single-particle cryoEM for determining the structure of influenza-virus
      hemagglutinin (HA):single-chain variable-domain fragment complexes, by studying a
      complex we failed to crystallize in pursuing an extended project on the human
      immune response to influenza vaccines.The result shows that a combination of
      cryoEM and molecular modeling can yield details of the antigen-antibody
      interface, although small variation in the twist of the rod-likeHA trimer limited
      the overall resolution to about 4.5A.Comparison of principal 3D classes suggests 
      ways to modify the HA trimer to overcome this limitation. A closely related
      antibody from the same donor did yield crystals when bound with the same HA,
      giving us an independent validation of the cryoEM results.The two structures also
      augment our understanding of receptor-binding site recognition by antibodies that
      neutralize a wide range of influenza-virus variants.

      Targeting ETS-1.

AB  - MicroRNAs are key regulators of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) phenotypic
      switch, one of the main events responsible for bare metal in-stent restenosis
      after percutaneous coronary intervention. miR-125a-5p is an important modulator
      of differentiation, proliferation, and migration in different cell types;
      however, its role in VSMCs is still unknown. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the role of miR-125a-5p in VSMCs phenotypic switch. Our results suggest 
      that miR-125a-5p is highly expressed in VSMCs, but it is down-regulated after
      vascular injury in vivo. Its overexpression is sufficient to reduce VSMCs
      proliferation and migration, and it is able to promote the expression of
      selective VSMCs markers such as alpha smooth muscle actin, myosin heavy chain 11,
      and smooth muscle 22 alpha. Interestingly, miR-125a-5p directly targets ETS-1, a 
      transcription factor implicated in cell proliferation and migration and is
      crucial in PDGF-BB pathway in VSMCs. Thus, miR-125a-5p in this context inhibits
      PDGF-BB pathway and is therefore a potential regulator of VSMCs phenotypic
      switch.

TI  - Salt-Mediated Oligomerization of the Mouse Prion Protein Monitored by Real-Time
      NMR.

AB  - The prion protein forms beta-rich soluble oligomers in vitro at pH4 in the
      presence of physiological concentrations of salt. In the absence of salt,
      oligomerization and misfolding do not take place in an experimentally tractable
      timescale. While it is well established that a lowering of pH facilitates
      misfolding and oligomerization of this protein, the role of salt remains poorly
      understood. Here, solution-state NMR was used to probe perturbations in the
      monomeric mouse prion protein structure immediately upon salt addition, prior to 
      the commencement of the oligomerization reaction. The weak binding of salt at
      multiple sites dispersed all over the monomeric protein causes a weak and
      non-specific perturbation of structure throughout the protein. The only
      significant perturbation occurs in the loop between helix 2 and 3 in and around
      the partially buried K193-E195 salt bridge. The disruption of this key
      electrostatic interaction is the earliest detectable change in the monomer before
      any major conformational change occurs and appears to constitute the trigger for 
      the commencement of misfolding and oligomerization. Subsequently, the kinetics of
      monomer loss, due to oligomerization, was monitored at the individual residue
      level. The oligomerization reaction was found to be rate-limited by association
      and not conformational change, with an average reaction order of 2.6 across
      residues. Not surprisingly, salt accelerated the oligomerization kinetics, in a
      non-specific manner, by electrostatic screening of the highly charged monomers at
      acidic pH. Together, these results allowed a demarcation of the specific and
      non-specific effects of salt on prion protein misfolding and oligomerization.

AB  - The mu-opioid receptor (MOPr) is a clinically important G protein-coupled
      receptor that couples to Gi/o proteins and arrestins. At present, the receptor
      conformational changes that occur following agonist binding and activation are
      poorly understood. This study has employed molecular dynamics simulations to
      investigate the binding mode and receptor conformational changes induced by
      structurally similar opioid ligands of widely differing intrinsic agonist
      efficacy, norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine, and diprenorphine. Bioluminescence
      resonance energy transfer assays for Gi activation and arrestin-3 recruitment in 
      human embryonic kidney 293 cells confirmed that norbuprenorphine is a high
      efficacy agonist, buprenorphine a low efficacy agonist, and diprenorphine an
      antagonist at the MOPr. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that these
      ligands adopt distinct binding poses and engage different subsets of residues,
      despite sharing a common morphinan scaffold. Notably, norbuprenorphine interacted
      with sodium ion-coordinating residues W293(6.48) and N150(3.35), whilst
      buprenorphine and diprenorphine did not. Principal component analysis of the
      movements of the receptor transmembrane domains showed that the
      buprenorphine-bound receptor occupied a distinct set of conformations to the
      norbuprenorphine-bound receptor. Addition of an allosteric sodium ion caused the 
      receptor and ligand to adopt an inactive conformation. The differences in
      ligand-residue interactions and receptor conformations observed here may underlie
      the differing efficacies for cellular signalling outputs for these ligands.

TI  - Oligomeric Structure of Anabaena Sensory Rhodopsin in a Lipid Bilayer Environment
      by Combining Solid-State NMR and Long-range DEER Constraints.

AB  - Oligomerization of membrane proteins is common in nature. Here, we combine
      spin-labeling double electron-electron resonance (DEER) and solid-state NMR
      (ssNMR) spectroscopy to refine the structure of an oligomeric integral membrane
      protein, Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR), reconstituted in a lipid environment. 
      An essential feature of such a combined approach is that it provides structural
      distance restraints spanning a range of ca 3-60A while using the same sample
      preparation (i.e., mutations, paramagnetic labeling, and reconstitution in lipid 
      bilayers) for both ssNMR and DEER. Direct modeling of the multispin effects on
      DEER signal allowed for the determination of the oligomeric order and for
      obtaining long-range DEER distance restraints between the ASR trimer subunits
      that were used to refine the ssNMR structure of ASR. The improved structure of
      the ASR trimer revealed a more compact packing of helices and side chains at the 
      intermonomer interface, compared to the structure determined using the ssNMR data
      alone. The extent of the refinement is significant when compared with typical
      helix movements observed for the active states of homologous proteins. Our
      combined approach of using complementary DEER and NMR measurements for the
      determination of oligomeric structures would be widely applicable to membrane
      proteins where paramagnetic tags can be introduced. Such a method could be used
      to study the effects of the lipid membrane composition on protein oligomerization
      and to observe structural changes in protein oligomers upon drug, substrate, and 
      co-factor binding.

TI  - Functional Requirements for DjlA- and RraA-Mediated Enhancement of Recombinant
      Membrane Protein Production in the Engineered Escherichia coli Strains SuptoxD
      and SuptoxR.

AB  - In previous work, we have generated the engineered Escherichia coli strains
      SuptoxD and SuptoxR, which upon co-expression of the effector genes djlA or rraA,
      respectively, are capable of suppressing the cytotoxicity caused by membrane
      protein (MP) overexpression and of producing dramatically enhanced yields for a
      variety of recombinant MPs of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. Here, we
      investigated the functional requirements for DnaJ-like protein A (DjlA)- and
      regulator of ribonuclease activity A (RraA)-mediated enhancement of recombinant
      MP production in these strains and show that: (i) DjlA and RraA act
      independently, that is, the beneficial effects of each protein on recombinant MP 
      production occur through a mechanism that does not involve the other, and in a
      non-additive manner; (ii) full-length and membrane-bound DjlA is required for
      exerting its beneficial effects on recombinant MP production in E. coli SuptoxD; 
      (iii) the MP production-promoting properties of DjlA in SuptoxD involve the
      action of the molecular chaperone DnaK but do not rely on the activation of the
      regulation of capsular synthesis response, a well-established consequence of djlA
      overexpression; (iv) the observed RraA-mediated effects in E. coli SuptoxR
      involve the ribonucleolytic activity of RNase E, but not that of its paralogous
      ribonuclease RNase G; and (v) DjlA and RraA are unique among similar E. coli
      proteins in their ability to promote bacterial recombinant MP production. These
      observations provide important clues about the molecular requirements for
      suppressed toxicity and enhanced MP accumulation in SuptoxD/SuptoxR and will
      guide future studies aiming to decipher the exact mechanism of DjlA- and
      RraA-mediated enhancement of recombinant MP production in these strains.

AB  - Mollicutes, including mycoplasmas and spiroplasmas, have been considered as good 
      representatives of the << minimal cell >> concept: these wall-less bacteria are
      small in size and possess a minimal genome and restricted metabolic capacities.
      However, the recent discovery of the presence of post-translational modifications
      unknown so far, such as the targeted processing of membrane proteins of
      mycoplasma pathogens for human and swine, revealed a part of the hidden
      complexity of these microorganisms. In this study, we show that in the
      phytopathogen, insect-vectored Spiroplasma citri GII-3 adhesion-related protein
      (ScARP) adhesins are post-translationally processed through an ATP-dependent
      targeted cleavage. The cleavage efficiency could be enhanced in vitro when
      decreasing the extracellular pH or upon the addition of polyclonal antibodies
      directed against ScARP repeated units, suggesting that modification of the
      surface charge and/or ScARP conformational changes could initiate the cleavage.
      The two major sites for primary cleavage are localized within predicted
      disordered regions and do not fit any previously reported cleavage motif; in
      addition, the inhibition profile and the metal ion requirements indicate that
      this post-translational modification involves at least one non-conventional
      protease. Such a proteolytic process may play a role in S. citri colonization of 
      cells of the host insect. Furthermore, our work indicates that post-translational
      cleavage of adhesins represents a common feature to mollicutes colonizing
      distinct hosts and that processing of surface antigens could represent a way to
      make the most out of a minimal genome.

AB  - All proteins are synthesized by the ribosome, a macromolecular complex that
      accomplishes the life-sustaining tasks of faithfully decoding mRNA and catalyzing
      peptide bond formation at the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). The ribosome has
      evolved an exit tunnel to host the elongating new peptide, protect it from
      proteolytic digestion, and guide its emergence. It is here that the nascent chain
      begins to fold. This folding process depends on the rate of translation at the
      PTC. We report here that besides PTC events, translation kinetics depend on
      steric constraints on nascent peptide side chains and that confined movements of 
      cramped side chains within and through the tunnel fine-tune elongation rates.

AB  - Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)
      proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases involved in various important
      biological processes such as antibody diversification/maturation, restriction of 
      viral infection, and generation of somatic mutations. Catalytically active APOBEC
      proteins execute their biological functions mostly through deaminating cytosine
      (C) to uracil on single-stranded DNA/RNA. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase, 
      one of the APOBEC members, was reported to deaminate methylated cytosine (mC) on 
      DNA, and this mC deamination was proposed to be involved in the demethylation of 
      mC for epigenetic regulation. The mC deamination activity is later demonstrated
      for APOBEC3A (A3A) and more recently for APOBEC3B and APOBEC3H (A3H). Despite
      extensive studies on APOBEC proteins, questions regarding whether the rest of
      APOBEC members have any mC deaminase activity and what are the relative deaminase
      activities for each APOBEC member remain unclear. Here, we performed a
      family-wide analysis of deaminase activities on C and mC by using purified
      recombinant proteins for 11 known human APOBEC proteins under similar conditions.
      Our comprehensive analyses revealed that each APOBEC has unique deaminase
      activity and selectivity for mC. A3A and A3H showed distinctively high deaminase 
      activities on C and mC with relatively high selectivity for mC, whereas six other
      APOBEC members showed relatively low deaminase activity and selectivity for mC.
      Our mutational analysis showed that loop-1 of A3A is responsible for its high
      deaminase activity and selectivity for mC. These findings extend our
      understanding of APOBEC family proteins that have important roles in diverse
      biological functions and in genetic mutations.

AB  - Despite the recent approval of third-generation therapies, overcoming resistance 
      to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors remains a major challenge
      in non-small cell lung cancer. Conceptually, synthetic lethality holds the
      promise of identifying non-intuitive targets for tackling both acquired and
      intrinsic resistance in this setting. However, translating these laboratory
      findings into effective clinical strategies continues to be elusive. Here, we
      provide an overview of the synthetic lethal approaches that have been employed to
      study EGFR inhibitor resistance and review the oncogene and non-oncogene
      signalling mechanisms that have thus far been unveiled by synthetic lethality
      screens. We highlight the potential challenges associated with progressing these 
      discoveries into the clinic including context dependency, signalling plasticity, 
      and tumour heterogeneity, and we offer a perspective on emerging network biology 
      and computational solutions to exploit these phenomena for cancer therapy and
      biomarker discovery. We conclude by presenting a number of tangible steps to
      bolster our understanding of fundamental synthetic lethality mechanisms and
      advance these findings beyond the confines of the laboratory.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRs) play a vital role in governing cell function, with their levels 
      tightly controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Different 
      sets of RNA-binding proteins interact with primary miRs (pri-miRs) and
      precursor-miR transcripts (pre-miRs), controlling their biogenesis
      post-transcriptionally. The Hu antigen R (HuR)-mediated binding of Musashi
      homolog2 (MSI2) to the conserved terminal loop of pri-miR-7 regulates the levels 
      of brain-enriched miR-7 formation in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we show that
      oleic acid (OA) inhibits the binding of proteins containing RNA recognition
      motifs (RRM) to the conserved terminal loop of pri-miR-7. Using electrophoretic
      mobility shift assays in HeLa cell extracts, we show that OA treatment disrupts
      pre-miR/protein complexes. Furthermore, OA rescues in vitro processing of
      pri-miR-7, which is otherwise blocked by HuR and MSI2 proteins. On the contrary, 
      pri-miR-16 shows reduced processing in the presence of OA. This indicates that OA
      may inhibit the binding of other RRM-containing protein/s necessary for miR-16
      processing. Finally, we demonstrate that OA induces mature miR-7 production in
      HeLa cells. Together, our results demonstrate that OA can regulate the processing
      of pri-miRs by remodeling their protein complexes. This provides a new tool to
      study RNA processing and a potential lead for small molecules that target the
      miR-7 biogenesis pathway.

AB  - Proteins begin to fold in the ribosome, and misfolding has pathological
      consequences. Among the earliest folding events in biogenesis is the formation of
      a helix, an elementary structure that is ubiquitously present and required for
      correct protein folding in all proteomes. The determinants underlying helix
      formation in the confined space of the ribosome exit tunnel are relatively
      unknown. We chose the second transmembrane segment, S2, of a voltage-gated
      potassium channel, Kv1.3, as a model to probe this issue. Since the N terminus of
      S2 is initially in an extended conformation in the folding vestibule of the
      ribosome yet ultimately emerges at the exit port as a helix, S2 is ideally suited
      for delineating sequential events and folding determinants of helix formation
      inside the ribosome. We show that S2's extended N terminus inside the tunnel is
      converted into a helix by a single, distant mutation in the nascent peptide. This
      transition depends on nascent peptide sequence at specific tunnel locations.
      Co-translational secondary folding of nascent chains inside the ribosome has
      profound physiological consequences that bear on correct membrane insertion,
      tertiary folding, oligomerization, and biochemical modification of the newborn
      protein during biogenesis.

TI  - Amyloid beta-Sheet Secondary Structure Identified in UV-Induced Cataracts of
      Porcine Lenses using 2D IR Spectroscopy.

AB  - Cataracts are formed by the aggregation of crystallin proteins in the eye lens.
      Many in vitro studies have established that crystallin proteins precipitate into 
      aggregates that contain amyloid fibers when denatured, but there is little
      evidence that ex vivo cataracts contain amyloid. In this study, we collect
      two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra on tissue slices of porcine eye lenses. 
      As shown in control experiments on in vitro alphaB- and gammaD-crystallin, 2D IR 
      spectroscopy can identify the highly ordered beta-sheets typical of amyloid
      secondary structure even if the fibers themselves are too short to be resolved
      with TEM. In ex vivo experiments of acid-treated tissues, characteristic 2D IR
      features are observed and fibers >50nm in length are resolved by transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM), consistent with amyloid fibers. In UV-irradiated lens 
      tissues, fibers are not observed with TEM, but highly ordered beta-sheets of
      amyloid secondary structure is identified from the 2D IR spectra. The
      characteristic 2D IR features of amyloid beta-sheet secondary structure are
      created by as few as four or five strands and so identify amyloid secondary
      structure even if the aggregates themselves are too small to be resolved with
      TEM. We discuss these findings in the context of the chaperone system of the
      lens, which we hypothesize sequesters small aggregates, thereby preventing long
      fibers from forming. This study expands the scope of heterodyned 2D IR
      spectroscopy to tissues. The results provide a link between in vitro and ex vivo 
      studies and support the hypothesis that cataracts are an amyloid disease.

AB  - Mammalian BAF complexes are a subfamily of SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin
      remodelers that dynamically modulate chromatin structure to regulate fundamental 
      cellular processes including gene transcription, cell cycle control, and DNA
      damage response. So far, many distinct BAF complexes have been identified with
      polymorphic assemblies of up to 15 subunits from 29 genes. The evolutionarily
      conserved BRG1/BRM, BAF47, and BAF155/BAF170 form a stable complex that carries
      out essential chromatin remodeling activity and therefore have been regarded as
      the core components of BAF complex. Here, we first confirmed that SWIRM domain of
      BAF155 is responsible for its interaction with BAF47 and then narrowed down the
      SWIRM-binding region in BAF47 to the Repeat 1 (RPT1) domain. We further presented
      the high-resolution crystal structure of SWIRM/RPT1 complex. Extensive
      mutagenesis experiments together with isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR
      titrations were performed to corroborate the interactions observed in crystal
      structure. Overall, we demonstrated that BAF155 SWIRM is a modular domain
      involved in BAF47 interaction, which is functionally distinct from other
      characterized SWIRM domains that possess DNA binding activity.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) encode multifunctional papain-like
      proteases (PLPs) that have the ability to process the viral polyprotein to
      facilitate RNA replication and antagonize the host innate immune response. The
      latter function involves reversing the post-translational modification of
      cellular proteins conjugated with either ubiquitin (Ub) or Ub-like
      interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). Ub is known to be highly conserved
      among eukaryotes, but surprisingly, ISG15 is highly divergent among animals. The 
      ramifications of this sequence divergence to the recognition of ISG15 by
      coronavirus PLPs at a structural and biochemical level are poorly understood.
      Therefore, the activity of PLPs from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and mouse hepatitis
      virus was evaluated against seven ISG15s originating from an assortment of animal
      species susceptible, and not, to certain coronavirus infections. Excitingly, our 
      kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural analysis revealed an array of different
      preferences among PLPs. Included in these studies is the first insight into a
      coronavirus PLP's interface with ISG15 via SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with the
      principle binding domain of human ISG15 (hISG15) and mouse ISG15s (mISG15s). The 
      first X-ray structure of the full-length mISG15 protein is also reported and
      highlights a unique, twisted hinge region of ISG15 that is not conserved in
      hISG15, suggesting a potential role in differential recognition. Taken together, 
      this new information provides a structural and biochemical understanding of the
      distinct specificities among coronavirus PLPs observed and addresses a critical
      gap of how PLPs can interact with ISG15s from a wide variety of species.

TI  - Rationally Designed PI3Kalpha Mutants to Mimic ATR and Their Use to Understand
      Binding Specificity of ATR Inhibitors.

AB  - ATR, a protein kinase in the PIKK family, plays a critical role in the cell
      DNA-damage response and is an attractive anticancer drug target. Several potent
      and selective inhibitors of ATR have been reported showing significant antitumor 
      efficacy, with most advanced ones entering clinical trials. However, due to the
      absence of an experimental ATR structure, the determinants contributing to ATR
      inhibitors' potency and specificity are not well understood. Here we present the 
      mutations in the ATP-binding site of PI3Kalpha to progressively transform the
      pocket to mimic that of ATR. The generated PI3Kalpha mutants exhibit
      significantly improved affinity for selective ATR inhibitors in multiple chemical
      classes. Furthermore, we obtained the X-ray structures of the PI3Kalpha mutants
      in complex with the ATR inhibitors. The crystal structures together with the
      analysis on the inhibitor affinity profile elucidate the roles of individual
      amino acid residues in the binding of ATR inhibitors, offering key insights for
      the binding mechanism and revealing the structure features important for the
      specificity of ATR inhibitors. The ability to obtain structural and binding data 
      for these PI3Kalpha mutants, together with their ATR-like inhibitor binding
      profiles, makes these chimeric PI3Kalpha proteins valuable model systems for
      structure-based inhibitor design.

AB  - Parallel and antiparallel transmembrane helix-helix interactions support the
      folding and non-covalent assembly of many integral membrane proteins. While
      several genetic tools are currently in use to study parallel transmembrane
      helix-helix interactions, antiparallel associations have been difficult to
      determine. Here, we present a novel genetic approach, termed BLaTM 2.0, which can
      be used in combination with the recently presented BLaTM 1.2 to compare the
      efficiency of antiparallel and parallel transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions
      in a natural membrane. In a practical application of the BLaTM system, we find
      that the antiparallel interaction of TMD4, the known dimerization domain of the
      dual-topology small multidrug transporter EmrE, is sequence-specific and much
      stronger than the parallel one. This suggests that TMD4 has evolved to favor the 
      formation of dual-topology EmrE dimers over single-topology dimers.

AB  - The protein triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is an
      immunomodulatory receptor with a central role in myeloid cell activation and
      survival. In recent years, the importance of TREM2 has been highlighted by the
      identification of coding variants that increase risk for Alzheimer's disease and 
      other neurodegenerative diseases. Animal studies have further shown the
      importance of TREM2 in neurodegenerative and other inflammatory disease models
      including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. 
      A mechanistic understanding of TREM2 function remains elusive, however, due in
      part to the absence of conclusive information regarding the identity of
      endogenous TREM2 ligands. While many TREM2 ligands have been proposed, their
      physiological role and mechanism of engagement remain to be determined. In this
      review, we highlight the suggested roles of TREM2 in these diseases and the
      recent advances in our understanding of TREM2 and discuss putative TREM2-ligand
      interactions and their potential roles in signaling during health and disease. We
      develop a model based on the TREM2 structure to explain how different TREM2
      ligands might interact with the receptor and how disease risk variants may alter 
      ligand interactions. Finally, we propose future experimental directions to
      establish the role and importance of these different interactions on TREM2
      function.

      Subunit Targeting and Membrane Extraction Steps during Fibre Assembly.

AB  - Bacterial type 2 secretion systems (T2SS), type 4 pili, and archaeal flagella
      assemble fibres from initially membrane-embedded pseudopilin and pilin subunits. 
      Fibre subunits are made as precursors with positively charged N-terminal anchors,
      whose cleavage via the prepilin peptidase, essential for pilin membrane
      extraction and assembly, is followed by N-methylation of the mature (pseudo)pilin
      N terminus. The conserved Glu residue at position 5 (E5) of mature (pseudo)pilins
      is essential for assembly. Unlike T4 pilins, where E5 residue substitutions also 
      abolish N-methylation, the E5A variant of T2SS pseudopilin PulG remains
      N-methylated but is affected in interaction with the T2SS component PulM. Here,
      biochemical and functional analyses showed that the PulM interaction defect only 
      partly accounts for the PulG(E5A) assembly defect. First, PulG(T2A) variant,
      equally defective in PulM interaction, remained partially functional.
      Furthermore, pseudopilus assembly defect of pulG(E5A) mutant was stronger than
      that of the pulM deletion mutant. To understand the dominant effect of E5A
      mutation, we used molecular dynamics simulations of PulG(E5A), methylated
      PulG(WT) (MePulG(WT)), and MePulG(E5A) variant in a model membrane. These
      simulations pointed to a key role for an intramolecular interaction between the
      pseudopilin N-terminal amine and E5 to limit polar interactions with membrane
      phospholipids. N-methylation of the N-terminal amine further limited its
      interactions with phospholipid head-groups to facilitate pseudopilin membrane
      escape. By binding to polar residues in the conserved N-terminal region of PulG, 
      we propose that PulM acts as chaperone to promote pseudopilin recruitment and
      coordinate its membrane extraction with subsequent steps of the fibre assembly
      process.

AB  - Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression. p53 is the most
      frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and over half of human cancers contain
      p53 mutations. Majority of p53 mutations in cancer are missense mutations,
      leading to the expression of full-length mutant p53 (mutp53) protein. While the
      critical role of wild-type p53 in tumor suppression has been firmly established, 
      mounting evidence has demonstrated that many tumor-associated mutp53 proteins not
      only lose the tumor-suppressive function of wild-type p53 but also gain new
      activities to promote tumorigenesis independently of wild-type p53, termed
      gain-of-function. Mutant p53 protein often accumulates to very high levels in
      tumors, contributing to malignant progression. Recently, mutp53 has become an
      attractive target for cancer therapy. Further understanding of the mechanisms
      underlying mutp53 protein accumulation and gain-of-function will accelerate the
      development of targeted therapies for human cancer harboring mutp53. In this
      review, we summarize the recent advances in the studies on mutp53 protein
      accumulation and gain-of-function and targeted therapies for mutp53 in human
      cancer.

TI  - Trigger Factor-Induced Nascent Chain Dynamics Changes Suggest Two Different
      Chaperone-Nascent Chain Interactions during Translation.

AB  - Protein biogenesis is poorly understood due to the ribosome that perturbs
      measurement attempted on the ribosome-bound nascent chain (RNC). Investigating
      nascent chain dynamics may provide invaluable insight into the co-translational
      processes such as structure formation or interaction with a chaperone [e.g., the 
      bacterial trigger factor (TF)]. In this study, we aim to establish a platform for
      studying nascent chain dynamics by exploring the local environment near the
      fluorescent dye on site-specifically labeled RNCs with time-resolved fluorescence
      anisotropy. To prepare a quantitative model of fluorescence depolarization, we
      utilized intrinsically disordered protein bound to ribosome, which helped us
      couple the sub-nanosecond depolarization with the motion of the nascent chain
      backbone. This was consistent with zinc-finger-domain-containing RNCs, where the 
      extent of sub-nanosecond motion decreased upon the addition of zinc when the
      fluorophore was in close proximity of the domain. After the characterization of
      disordered nascent chain dynamics, we investigated the synthesis of a model
      cytosolic protein, Entner-Doudoroff aldolase, labeled at different sites during
      various stages of translation. Depending on the stage of translation, the
      addition of the TF to the nascent chain led to two different responses in the
      nascent chain dynamics serendipitously, suggesting steric hindrance between the
      nascent chain and the chaperone as a mechanism for TF dissociation from the
      ribosome during translation. Overall, our study demonstrates the possible use of 
      site-specific labeling and time-resolved anisotropy to gain insight on chaperone 
      binding event at various stages of translation and hints on TF co-translational
      mechanism.

AB  - Post-translational modification of proteins by phosphorylation plays a key role
      in regulating all aspects of eukaryotic biology. Embryonic stem cell (ESC)
      pluripotency, defined as the ability to differentiate into all cell types in the 
      adult body, is no exception. Maintenance and dissolution of pluripotency are
      tightly controlled by phosphorylation. As a result, key signalling pathways that 
      regulate pluripotency have been identified and their functions well
      characterised. Amongst the best studied are the fibroblast growth factor
      (FGF)-ERK1/2 pathway, PI3K-AKT, the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-JAK-STAT3
      axis, Wnt-GSK3 signalling, and the transforming growth factor (TGF)beta family.
      However, these kinase pathways constitute only a small proportion of the protein 
      kinase complement of pluripotent cells, and there is accumulating evidence that
      diverse phosphorylation systems modulate ESC pluripotency. Here, we review recent
      progress in understanding the overarching role of phosphorylation in mediating
      communication from the cellular environment, metabolism, and cell cycle to the
      core pluripotency machinery.

AB  - The Rett-syndrome-associated methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) selectively
      binds methylated DNA to regulate transcription during the development of mature
      neurons. Like other members of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family, MeCP2 
      functions through the recognition of symmetrical 5-methylcytosines in CpG (mCG)
      dinucleotides. Advances in base-level resolution epigenetic mapping techniques
      have revealed, however, that MeCP2 can bind asymmetrically methylated and
      hydroxymethylated CpA dinucleotides and that this alternative binding selectivity
      modifies gene expression in the developing mammalian brain. The structural
      determinants of binding to methylated CpA (mCA) and hydroxymethylated DNA have
      not been previously investigated. Here, we employ isothermal titration
      calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy to characterize MeCP2 binding to methylated and 
      hydroxymethylated mCG and mCA DNA, examine the effects of
      Rett-syndrome-associated missense mutations, and make comparisons to the related 
      and evolutionarily most ancient protein, MBD2. These analyses reveal that MeCP2
      binds mCA with high affinity in a strand-specific and orientation-dependent
      manner. In contrast, MBD2 does not show high affinity or methyl-specific binding 
      to mCA. The Rett-associated missense mutations (T158M, R106W, and P101S)
      destabilize the MeCP2 MBD and disrupt the recognition of mCG and mCA equally.
      Finally, hydroxymethylation of a high-affinity mCA site does not alter the
      binding properties, whereas hemi-hydroxylation of the equivalent cytosine in an
      mCG site decreases affinity and specificity. Based on these findings, we suggest 
      that MeCP2 recognition of methylated/hydroxymethylated CpA dinucleotides
      functions as an epigenetic switch redistributing MeCP2 among mCG and mCA loci.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic human pathogen able to transfer
      virulence genes to other cells through the mobilization of S. aureus
      pathogenicity islands (SaPIs). SaPIs are derepressed and packaged into phage-like
      transducing particles by helper phages like 80alpha or phiNM1. Phages 80alpha and
      phiNM1 encode structurally distinct dUTPases, Dut80alpha (type 1) and DutNM1
      (type 2). Both dUTPases can interact with the SaPIbov1 Stl master repressor,
      leading to derepression and mobilization. That two structurally distinct dUTPases
      bind the same repressor led us to speculate that dUTPase activity may be
      important to the derepression process. In type 1 dUTPases, Stl binding is
      inhibited by dUTP. The purpose of this study was to assess the involvement of
      dUTP binding and dUTPase activity in derepression by DutNM1. DutNM1 activity
      mutants were created and tested for dUTPase activity using a novel NMR-based
      assay. We found that all DutNM1 null activity mutants interacted with the
      SaPIbov1 Stl C-terminal domain, formed DutNM1-Stl heterodimers, and caused the
      release of the Pstr promoter. However, promoter release was inhibited in the
      presence of dUTP or dUMP. We tested two phiNM1 mutant phages that had null enzyme
      activity and found that they could still mobilize SaPIbov1. These results show
      that only the apo form of DutNM1 is active in Stl derepression and that dUTPase
      activity is not necessary for the mobilization of SaPIbov1 by DutNM1.

AB  - Dehydration reactions play a crucial role in the de novo biosynthesis of fatty
      acids and a wide range of pharmacologically active polyketide natural products
      with strong emphasis on human medicine. The type I polyketide synthase PpsC from 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalyzes key biosynthetic steps of lipid virulence
      factors phthiocerol dimycocerosates and phenolic glycolipids. Given the
      insolubility of the natural C28-C30 fatty acyl substrate of the PpsC dehydratase 
      (DH) domain, we investigated its structure-function relationships in the presence
      of shorter surrogate substrates. Since most enzymes belonging to the (R)-specific
      enoyl hydratase/hydroxyacyl dehydratase family conduct the reverse hydration
      reaction in vitro, we have determined the X-ray structures of the PpsC DH domain,
      both unliganded (apo) and in complex with trans-but-2-enoyl-CoA or
      trans-dodec-2-enoyl-CoA derivatives. This study provides for the first time a
      snapshot of dehydratase-ligand interactions following a hydration reaction. Our
      structural analysis allowed us to identify residues essential for substrate
      binding and activity. The structural comparison of the two complexes also sheds
      light on the need for long acyl chains for this dehydratase to carry out its
      function, consistent with both its in vitro catalytic behavior and the
      physiological role of the PpsC enzyme.

AB  - Animal development entails the sequential and coordinated specialization of
      cells. During cell differentiation, transcription factors, cell signaling
      pathways, and chromatin-associated protein complexes cooperate in regulating the 
      expression of a large number of genes. Here, we review the present understanding 
      of the establishment of chromatin states by focusing on X chromosome inactivation
      (XCI) as a model for facultative heterochromatin formation in female embryonic
      cells. The inactive X chromosome is large enough to be investigated by
      biochemical and microscopy techniques. In addition, the ability to compare the
      inactivated chromatin to the active X in male cells enables us to differentiate
      events specific to gene silencing during XCI from gene regulatory effects from
      changing pathways in the same cell. Findings in XCI are useful as blueprints for 
      investigation of the action of epigenetic pathways in differentiation and lineage
      commitment. We summarize recent studies that have identified factors that are
      critical for chromosome-wide gene repression in XCI, and we discuss their
      implications for epigenetic regulation in pluripotent cells of the early embryo.

AB  - DNA methylation is one of the most extensively studied epigenetic marks. It is
      involved in transcriptional gene silencing and plays important roles during
      mammalian development. Its perturbation is often associated with human diseases. 
      In mammalian genomes, DNA methylation is a prevalent modification that decorates 
      the majority of cytosines. It is found at the promoters and enhancers of inactive
      genes, at repetitive elements, and within transcribed gene bodies. Its presence
      at promoters is dynamically linked to gene activity, suggesting that it could
      directly influence gene expression patterns and cellular identity. The
      genome-wide distribution and dynamic behaviour of this mark have been studied in 
      great detail in a variety of tissues and cell lines, including early embryonic
      development and in embryonic stem cells. In combination with functional studies, 
      these genome-wide maps of DNA methylation revealed interesting features of this
      mark and provided important insights into its dynamic nature and potential
      functional role in genome regulation. In this review, we discuss how these recent
      observations, in combination with insights obtained from biochemical and
      functional genetics studies, have expanded our current knowledge about the
      regulation and context-dependent roles of DNA methylation in mammalian genomes.

AB  - Complex gene regulation systems ensure the maintenance of cellular identity
      during early development in mammals. Eukaryotic small RNAs have emerged as
      critical players in RNA interference (RNAi) by mediating gene silencing during
      embryonic stem cell self-renewal. Most of the proteins involved in the biogenesis
      of small RNAs are essential for proliferation and differentiation into the three 
      germ layers of mouse embryonic stem cells. In the last decade, new functions for 
      some RNAi proteins, independent of their roles in RNAi pathways, have been
      demonstrated in different biological systems. In parallel, new concepts in stem
      cell biology have emerged. Here, we review and integrate the current
      understanding of how RNAi proteins regulate stem cell identity with the new
      advances in the stem cell field and the recent non-canonical functions of the
      RNAi proteins. Finally, we propose a reevaluation of all RNAi mutant phenotypes, 
      as non-canonical (small non-coding RNA independent) functions may contribute to
      the molecular mechanisms governing mouse embryonic stem cells commitment.

AB  - The formation of tissues and organs during metazoan development begs fundamental 
      questions of cellular plasticity: How can the very same genome program have
      diverse cell types? How do cell identity programs unfold during development in
      space and time? How can defects in these mechanisms cause disease and also
      provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention? And ultimately, can
      developmental programs be exploited for bioengineering tissues and organs?
      Understanding principle designs of cellular identity and developmental
      progression is crucial for providing answers. Here, I will discuss how the
      capture of embryonic pluripotency in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro 
      has allowed fundamental insights into the molecular underpinnings of a
      developmental cell state and how its ordered disassembly during differentiation

AB  - The propagation and maintenance of gene expression programs are at the foundation
      of the preservation of cell identity. A large and complex set of epigenetic
      mechanisms enables the long-term stability and inheritance of transcription
      states. A key property of authentic epigenetic regulation is being independent
      from the instructive signals used for its establishment. This makes epigenetic
      regulation, particularly epigenetic silencing, extremely robust and powerful to
      lock regulatory states and stabilise cell identity. In line with this, the
      establishment of epigenetic silencing during development restricts cell potency
      and maintains the cell fate choices made by transcription factors (TFs). However,
      how more immature cells that have not yet established their definitive fate
      maintain their transitory identity without compromising their responsiveness to
      signalling cues remains unclear. A paradigmatic example is provided by
      pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from a transient population of
      cells of the blastocyst. Here, we argue that ES cells represent an interesting
      "epigenetic paradox": even though they are captured in a self-renewing state
      characterised by extremely efficient maintenance of their identity, which is a
      typical manifestation of robust epigenetic regulation, they seem not to heavily
      rely on classical epigenetic mechanisms. Indeed, self-renewal strictly depends on
      the TFs that previously instructed their undifferentiated identity and relies on 
      a particular signalling-dependent chromatin state where repressive chromatin
      marks play minor roles. Although this "epigenetic paradox" may underlie their
      exquisite responsiveness to developmental cues, it suggests that alternative
      mechanisms to faithfully propagate gene regulatory states might be prevalent in
      ES cells.

      Nanog Function.

AB  - The level of the transcription factor Nanog directly determines the efficiency of
      mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal. Nanog protein exists as a dimer with the 
      dimerization domain composed of a simple repeat region in which every fifth
      residue is a tryptophan, the tryptophan repeat (WR). Although WR is necessary to 
      enable Nanog to confer LIF-independent self-renewal, the mechanism of
      dimerization and the effect of modulating dimerization strength have been
      unclear. Here we couple mutagenesis with functional and dimerization assays to
      show that the number of tryptophans within the WR is linked to the strength of
      homodimerization, Sox2 heterodimerization and self-renewal activity. A reduction 
      in the number of tryptophan residues leads initially to a gradual reduction in
      activity before a precipitous reduction in activity occurs upon reduction in
      tryptophan number below eight. Further functional attrition follows subsequent
      tryptophan number reduction with substitution of all tryptophan residues ablating
      dimerization and self-renewal function completely. A strong positional influence 
      of tryptophans exists, with residues at the WR termini contributing more to Nanog
      function, particularly at the N-terminal end. Limited proteolysis demonstrates
      that a structural core of Nanog encompassing the homeodomain and the tryptophan
      repeat can support LIF-independent colony formation. These results increase
      understanding of the molecular interactions occurring between transcription
      factor subunits at the core of the pluripotency gene regulatory network and will 
      enhance our ability to control pluripotent cell self-renewal and differentiation.

AB  - Protein acetylation plays important roles in many biological processes. Malate
      dehydrogenase (MDH), a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, has been
      identified to be acetylated in bacteria by proteomic studies, but no further
      characterization has been reported. One challenge for studying protein
      acetylation is to get purely acetylated proteins at specific positions. Here, we 
      applied the genetic code expansion strategy to site-specifically incorporate
      N(epsilon)-acetyllysine into MDH. The acetylation of lysine residues in MDH could
      enhance its enzyme activity. The Escherichia coli deacetylase CobB could
      deacetylate acetylated MDH, while the E. coli acetyltransferase YfiQ cannot
      acetylate MDH efficiently. Our results also demonstrated that acetyl-CoA or
      acetyl-phosphate could acetylate MDH chemically in vitro. Furthermore, the
      acetylation level of MDH was shown to be affected by carbon sources in the growth
      medium.

AB  - For decades, it has been speculated that specific loci on eukaryotic chromosomes 
      are inherently susceptible to breakage. The advent of high-throughput genomic
      technologies has now paved the way to their identification. A wealth of data
      suggests that transcriptionally active loci are particularly fragile and that a
      specific DNA damage response is activated and dedicated to their repair. Here, we
      review current understanding of the crosstalk between transcription and
      double-strand break repair, from the reasons underlying the intrinsic fragility
      of genes to the mechanisms that restore the integrity of damaged transcription
      units.

      with Some but Not All Client Proteins.

AB  - The 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) chaperones the late folding steps of many
      protein kinases, transcription factors, and a diverse set of other protein
      clients not related in sequence and structure. Hsp90's interaction with clients
      appears to be coupled to a series of conformational changes. How these
      conformational changes contribute to its chaperone activity is currently unclear.
      Using crosslinking, hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry, and fluorescence
      experiments, we demonstrate here that the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 rotates by
      approximately 180 degrees as compared to the crystal structure of yeast Hsp90 in 
      complex with Sba1 and AMPPNP. Surprisingly, Aha1 but not Sba1 suppresses this
      rotation in the presence of AMPPNP but not in its absence. A minimum length of
      the largely unstructured linker between N-terminal and middle domain is necessary
      for this rotation, and interfering with the rotation strongly affects the
      interaction with Aha1 and the intrinsic and Aha1-stimulated ATPase activity.
      Surprisingly, suppression of the rotation only affects the activity of some
      clients and does not compromise yeast viability.

AB  - WASP homolog associated with actin, membranes, and microtubules (WHAMM) is a
      vertebrate protein functioning in membrane tubulation for intracellular membrane 
      trafficking and specific organelle formation. Composed of multiple domains, WHAMM
      can bind to membrane and microtubule (MT) and promote actin polymerization
      nucleation. Previous work revealed that WHAMM's activity to promote actin
      nucleation is repressed upon binding to MTs. Here, we discovered that WHAMM
      interacts with alphabeta-tubulin through a small peptide motif within its
      MT-binding domain. We reconstructed a high-resolution structure of WHAMM's
      MT-binding motif (MBM) assembling around MTs using cryo-electron microscopy and
      verified it with chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry analysis. We also
      detected a conformational switch of this motif between the non-MT-bound state and
      the MT-bound state. These discoveries provide new insights into the mechanism by 
      which WHAMM coordinates actin and MT networks, the two major cytoskeletal systems
      involved in membrane trafficking and membrane remodeling.

TI  - Selective Targeting of SH2 Domain-Phosphotyrosine Interactions of Src Family
      Tyrosine Kinases with Monobodies.

AB  - The binding of Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains to phosphotyrosine (pY) sites is
      critical for the autoinhibition and substrate recognition of the eight Src family
      kinases (SFKs). The high sequence conservation of the 120 human SH2 domains poses
      a significant challenge to selectively perturb the interactions of even the SFK
      SH2 family against the rest of the SH2 domains. We have developed synthetic
      binding proteins, termed monobodies, for six of the SFK SH2 domains with
      nanomolar affinity. Most of these monobodies competed with pY ligand binding and 
      showed strong selectivity for either the SrcA (Yes, Src, Fyn, Fgr) or SrcB
      subgroup (Lck, Lyn, Blk, Hck). Interactome analysis of intracellularly expressed 
      monobodies revealed that they bind SFKs but no other SH2-containing proteins.
      Three crystal structures of monobody-SH2 complexes unveiled different and only
      partly overlapping binding modes, which rationalized the observed selectivity and
      enabled structure-based mutagenesis to modulate inhibition mode and selectivity. 
      In line with the critical roles of SFK SH2 domains in kinase autoinhibition and
      T-cell receptor signaling, monobodies binding the Src and Hck SH2 domains
      selectively activated respective recombinant kinases, whereas an Lck SH2-binding 
      monobody inhibited proximal signaling events downstream of the T-cell receptor
      complex. Our results show that SFK SH2 domains can be targeted with unprecedented
      potency and selectivity using monobodies. They are excellent tools for dissecting
      SFK functions in normal development and signaling and to interfere with aberrant 
      SFK signaling networks in cancer cells.

AB  - The misfolding of proteins to form amyloid is a key pathological feature of
      several progressive, and currently incurable, diseases. A mechanistic
      understanding of the pathway from soluble, native protein to insoluble amyloid is
      crucial for therapeutic design, and recent efforts have helped to elucidate the
      key molecular events that trigger protein misfolding. Generally, either global or
      local structural perturbations occur early in amyloidogenesis to expose
      aggregation-prone regions of the protein that can then self-associate to form
      toxic oligomers. Surprisingly, these initiating structural changes are often
      caused or influenced by protein regions distal to the classically amyloidogenic
      sequences. Understanding the importance of these distal regions in the pathogenic
      process has highlighted many remaining knowledge gaps regarding the precise
      molecular events that occur in classic aggregation pathways. In this review, we
      discuss how these distal regions can influence aggregation in disease and the
      recent technical and conceptual advances that have allowed this insight.

AB  - Light-regulated enzymes enable organisms to quickly respond to changing light
      conditions. We characterize a photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (AC) from
      Beggiatoa sp. (bPAC) that translates a blue light signal into the production of
      the second messenger cyclic AMP. bPAC contains a BLUF photoreceptor domain that
      senses blue light using a flavin chromophore, linked to an AC domain. We present 
      a dark state crystal structure of bPAC that closely resembles the recently
      published structure of the homologous OaPAC from Oscillatoria acuminata. To
      elucidate the structural mechanism of light-dependent AC activation by the BLUF
      domain, we determined the crystal structures of illuminated bPAC and of a
      pseudo-lit state variant. We use hydrogen-deuterium exchange measurements of
      secondary structure dynamics and hypothesis-driven point mutations to trace the
      activation pathway from the chromophore in the BLUF domain to the active site of 
      the cyclase. The structural changes are relayed from the residues interacting
      with the excited chromophore through a conserved kink of the BLUF beta-sheet to a
      tongue-like extrusion of the AC domain that regulates active site opening and
      repositions catalytic residues. Our findings not only show the specific molecular
      pathway of photoactivation in BLUF-regulated ACs but also have implications for
      the general understanding of signaling in BLUF domains and of the activation of
      ACs.

AB  - Vicinal disulfides between sequence-adjacent cysteine residues are very rare and 
      rather startling structural features which play a variety of functional roles.
      Typically discussed as an isolated curiosity, they have never received a general 
      treatment covering both cis and trans forms. Enabled by the growing database of
      high-resolution structures, required deposition of diffraction data, and improved
      methods for discriminating reliable from dubious cases, we identify and describe 
      distinct protein families with reliably genuine examples of cis or trans vicinal 
      disulfides and discuss their conformations, conservation, and functions. No
      cis-trans interconversions and only one case of catalytic redox function are
      seen. Some vicinal disulfides are essential to large, functionally coupled
      motions, whereas most form the centers of tightly packed internal regions. Their 
      most widespread biological role is providing a rigid hydrophobic contact surface 
      under the undecorated side of a sugar or multiring ligand, contributing an

AB  - Tau is a multifaceted neuronal protein that stabilizes microtubules (MTs), but
      the mechanism of this activity remains poorly understood. Questions include
      whether Tau binds MTs laterally or longitudinally and whether Tau's binding
      affinity depends on the nucleotide state of tubulin. We observed that Tau binds
      tightly to Dolastatin-10 tubulin rings and promotes the formation of
      Dolastatin-10 ring stacks, implying that Tau can crosslink MT protofilaments
      laterally. In addition, we found that Tau prefers GDP-like tubulin conformations,
      which implies that Tau binding to the MT surface is biased away from the dynamic 
      GTP-rich MT tip. To investigate the potential impact of these Tau activities on
      MT stabilization, we incorporated them into our previously developed dimer-scale 
      computational model of MT dynamics. We found that lateral crosslinking activities
      have a much greater effect on MT stability than do longitudinal crosslinking
      activities, and that introducing a bias toward GDP tubulin has little impact on
      the observed MT stabilization. To address the question of why Tau is
      GDP-tubulin-biased, we tested whether Tau might affect MT binding of the +TIP
      EB1. We confirmed recent reports that Tau binds directly to EB1 and that Tau
      competes with EB1 for MT binding. Our results lead to a conceptual model where
      Tau stabilizes the MT lattice by strengthening lateral interactions between
      protofilaments. We propose that Tau's GDP preference allows the cell to
      independently regulate the dynamics of the MT tip and the stability of the
      lattice.

TI  - Architecture of the Flagellar Switch Complex of Escherichia coli: Conformational 
      Plasticity of FliG and Implications for Adaptive Remodeling.

AB  - Structural models of the complex that regulates the direction of flagellar
      rotation assume either ~34 or ~25 copies of the protein FliG. Support for ~34
      came from crosslinking experiments identifying an intersubunit contact most
      consistent with that number; support for ~25 came from the observation that
      flagella can assemble and rotate when FliG is genetically fused to FliF, for
      which the accepted number is ~25. Here, we have undertaken crosslinking and other
      experiments to address more fully the question of FliG number. The results
      indicate a copy number of ~25 for FliG. An interaction between the C-terminal and
      middle domains, which has been taken to support a model with ~34 copies, is also 
      supported. To reconcile the interaction with a FliG number of ~25, we hypothesize
      conformational plasticity in an interdomain segment of FliG that allows some
      subunits to bridge gaps created by the number mismatch. This proposal is
      supported by mutant phenotypes and other results indicating that the normally
      helical segment adopts a more extended conformation in some subunits. The FliG
      amino-terminal domain is organized in a regular array with dimensions matching a 
      ring in the upper part of the complex. The model predicts that FliG copy number
      should be tied to that of FliF, whereas FliM copy number can increase or decrease
      according to the number of FliG subunits that adopt the extended conformation.
      This has implications for the phenomenon of adaptive switch remodeling, in which 
      the FliM copy number varies to adjust the bias of the switch.

TI  - Bacteriophage SPP1 pac Cleavage: A Precise Cut without Sequence Specificity
      Requirement.

AB  - In many tailed bacteriophages, DNA packaging is initiated by recognition and
      cleavage of a specific sequence pac by the small (TerS) and large (TerL)
      terminase subunits. It was previously shown that the SPP1 pac region has two
      sequences where TerS binds (pacR and pacL), flanking the segment where TerL
      cleaves the SPP1 DNA (pacC). However, the pac-specific sequences required to
      achieve this endonucleolytic cut were not established. Their characterization is 
      essential to understand the underlying mechanism. We show that the pacR sequence 
      localized within 35bp downstream of the pac cut can be extensively degenerated,
      including its c1 and c2 repeats, and that only a disruption of a 5-bp polyadenine
      tract impairs the pac cleavage. This result together with deletion analysis of
      pacL shows that the specific DNA sequences required for targeting the terminase
      for pac cleavage are considerably shorter than the large region bound by TerS.
      Furthermore, extensive degeneration of the 6-bp target sequence within pacC where
      pac cleavage occurs reveals that TerL maintains, remarkably, its precise position
      of cleavage. Studies with SPP1-related phages show the conservation of the cut
      position, irrespective of the sequence variation in pacC and in pacR or the
      changes in pacL-pacC distance. Mechanistically, our data are compatible with a
      model in which TerS interactions with part of the pacL sequence and a poly-A
      tract in pacR are sufficient to orient very accurately the TerL nuclease to a
      defined pacC position. They also demonstrate that the resulting precise cut at
      pacC is independent of the targeted DNA sequence.

AB  - The APOBEC3 (A3) family of cellular cytidine deaminases comprises seven members
      (A, B, C, D, F, G, and H) that potently inhibit retroviral replication. Human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif is a small pleiotropic protein that
      specifically inactivates these enzymes, targeting them for ubiquitin-mediated
      proteasomal degradation. A3 Vif-interaction sites are presumed to fall into three
      distinct types: A3C/D/F, A3G, and A3H. To date, two types of A3G and A3C/D/F
      sites have been well characterized, whereas the A3H Vif-binding site remains
      poorly defined. Here, we explore the residues critical for the A3H-type Vif
      interaction. To avoid technical difficulties in performing experiments with human
      A3H haplotype II (hapII), which is relatively resistant to HIV-1 Vif, we employed
      its ortholog chimpanzee A3H (cA3H), which displays high Vif sensitivity, for a
      comparison of sensitivity with that of A3H hapII. The Vif susceptibility of A3H
      hapII-cA3H chimeras and their substitution mutants revealed a single residue at
      position 97 as a major determinant for the difference in their Vif sensitivities.
      We further surveyed critical residues by structure-guided mutagenesis using an
      A3H structural model and thus identified eight additional residues important for 
      Vif sensitivity, which mapped to the alpha3 and alpha4 helices of A3H.
      Interestingly, this area is located on a surface adjacent to the A3G and A3C/D/F 
      interfaces and is composed of negatively charged and hydrophobic patches. These
      findings suggest that HIV-1 Vif has evolved to utilize three dispersed surfaces
      for recognizing three types of interfaces on A3 proteins under certain structural
      constraints.

AB  - Protein aggregation remains a major area of focus in the production of monoclonal
      antibodies. Improving the intrinsic properties of antibodies can improve
      manufacturability, attrition rates, safety, formulation, titers, immunogenicity, 
      and solubility. Here, we explore the potential of predicting and reducing the
      aggregation propensity of monoclonal antibodies, based on the identification of
      aggregation-prone regions and their contribution to the thermodynamic stability
      of the protein. Although aggregation-prone regions are thought to occur in the
      antigen binding region to drive hydrophobic binding with antigen, we were able to
      rationally design variants that display a marked decrease in aggregation
      propensity while retaining antigen binding through the introduction of artificial
      aggregation gatekeeper residues. The reduction in aggregation propensity was
      accompanied by an increase in expression titer, showing that reducing protein
      aggregation is beneficial throughout the development process. The data presented 
      show that this approach can significantly reduce liabilities in novel therapeutic
      antibodies and proteins, leading to a more efficient path to clinical studies.

AB  - The retroviral restriction factors of the APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminase family 
      catalyze the deamination of cytidines in single-stranded viral DNA. APOBEC3C
      (A3C) is a strong antiviral factor against viral infectivity factor
      (vif)-deficient simian immunodeficiency virus Deltavif, which is, however, a weak
      inhibitor against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 for reasons unknown. The
      precise link between the antiretroviral effect of A3C and its catalytic activity 
      is incompletely understood. Here, we show that the S61P mutation in human A3C
      (A3C.S61P) boosted hypermutation in the viral genomes of simian immunodeficiency 
      virus Deltavif and murine leukemia virus but not in human immunodeficiency virus 
      HIV-1Deltavif. The enhanced antiviral activity of A3C.S61P correlated with
      enhanced in vitro cytidine deamination. Furthermore, the S61P mutation did not
      change the substrate specificity of A3C, ribonucleoprotein complex formation,
      self-association, Zinc coordination, or viral incorporation features. We propose 
      that local structural changes induced by the serine-to-proline substitution are
      responsible for the gain of catalytic activity of A3C.S61P. Our results are a
      first step toward an understanding of A3C's DNA binding capacity,
      deamination-dependent editing, and antiviral functions at the molecular level. We
      conclude that the enhanced enzymatic activity of A3C is insufficient to restrict 
      HIV-1, indicating an unknown escape mechanism of HIV-1.

      System, Interacts with the Dimeric F1Fo-ATP Synthase.

AB  - The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) is crucial
      for maintaining the architecture of the mitochondrial inner membrane. MICOS is
      enriched at crista junctions that connect the two inner membrane domains: inner
      boundary membrane and cristae membrane. MICOS promotes the formation of crista
      junctions, whereas the oligomeric F1Fo-ATP synthase is crucial for shaping
      cristae rims, indicating antagonistic functions of these machineries in
      organizing inner membrane architecture. We report that the MICOS core subunit
      Mic10, but not Mic60, binds to the F1Fo-ATP synthase. Mic10 selectively
      associates with the dimeric form of the ATP synthase and supports the formation
      of ATP synthase oligomers. Our results suggest that Mic10 plays a dual role in
      mitochondrial inner membrane architecture. In addition to its central function in
      sculpting crista junctions, a fraction of Mic10 molecules interact with the
      cristae rim-forming F1Fo-ATP synthase.

      Marker CD83.

AB  - CD83 is a type-I membrane protein and an efficient marker for identifying mature 
      dendritic cells. Whereas membrane-bound, full-length CD83 co-stimulates the
      immune system, a soluble variant (sCD83), consisting of the extracellular domain 
      only, displays strong immune-suppressive activities. Besides a prediction that
      sCD83 adopts a V-set Ig-like fold, however, little is known about the molecular
      architecture of CD83 and the mechanism by which CD83 exerts its function on
      dendritic cells and additional immune cells. Here, we report the crystal
      structure of human sCD83 up to a resolution of 1.7A solved in three different
      crystal forms. Interestingly, beta-strands C', C'', and D that are typical for
      V-set Ig-domains could not be traced in sCD83. Mass spectrometry analyses,
      limited proteolysis experiments, and bioinformatics studies show that the
      corresponding segment displays enhanced main-chain accessibility, extraordinary
      low sequence conservation, and a predicted high disorder propensity. Chimeric
      proteins with amino acid swaps in this segment show unaltered immune-suppressive 
      activities in a TNF-alpha assay when compared to wild-type sCD83. This strongly
      indicates that this segment does not participate in the biological activity of
      CD83. The crystal structure of CD83 shows the recurrent formation of dimers and
      trimers in the various crystal forms and reveals strong structural similarities
      between sCD83 and B7 family members and CD48, a signaling lymphocyte activation
      molecule family member. This suggests that CD83 exerts its immunological activity
      by mixed homotypic and heterotypic interactions as typically observed for
      proteins present in the immunological synapse.

AB  - Melanoma antigen (MAGE) genes are conserved in all eukaryotes and encode for
      proteins sharing a common MAGE homology domain. Although only a single MAGE gene 
      exists in lower eukaryotes, the MAGE family rapidly expanded in eutherians and
      consists of more than 50 highly conserved genes in humans. A subset of MAGEs
      initially garnered interest as cancer biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets
      due to their antigenic properties and unique expression pattern that is primary
      restricted to germ cells and aberrantly reactivated in various cancers. However, 
      further investigation revealed that MAGEs not only drive tumorigenesis but also
      regulate pathways essential for diverse cellular and developmental processes.
      Therefore, MAGEs are implicated in a broad range of diseases including
      neurodevelopmental, renal, and lung disorders, and cancer. Recent biochemical and
      biophysical studies indicate that MAGEs assemble with E3 RING ubiquitin ligases
      to form MAGE-RING ligases (MRLs) and act as regulators of ubiquitination by
      modulating ligase activity, substrate specification, and subcellular
      localization. Here, we present a comprehensive guide to MAGEs highlighting the
      molecular mechanisms of MRLs and their physiological roles in germ cell and
      neural development, oncogenic functions in cancer, and potential as therapeutic
      targets in disease.

      4E10 Extend into the Core of the Membrane.

AB  - The exceptional breadth of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the
      membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the transmembrane protein gp41 makes 
      this class of antibodies an ideal model to design HIV vaccines. From a practical 
      point of view, however, the preparation of vaccines eliciting bNAbs is still a
      major roadblock that limits their clinical application. Fresh mechanistic
      insights are necessary to develop more effective strategies. In particular, the
      function of the unusually long complementarity-determining region three of the
      heavy chain (CDRH3) of 4E10, an anti-MPER bNAb, is an open question that
      fascinates researchers in the field. Residues comprising the apex region are
      dispensable for engagement of the epitope in solution; still, their single
      mutation profoundly impairs the neutralization capabilities of the antibody.
      Since this region is very hydrophobic, it has been proposed that the apex is
      essential for anchoring the antibody to the viral membrane where MPER resides.
      Herein, we have critically examined this idea using structural, biophysical,
      biochemical, and cell-based approaches. Our results demonstrate that the apex
      region is not just a "greasy" spot merely increasing the affinity of the antibody
      for the membrane. We demonstrate the three-dimensional engagement of the apex
      region of the CDRH3 with the conglomerate of gp41 epitope and membrane lipids as 
      a means of effective binding and neutralization of the virus. This mechanism of
      recognition suggests a standard route of antibody ontogeny. Therefore, we need to
      focus our efforts on recreating a more realistic MPER/lipid immunogen in order to
      generate more effective anti-HIV-1 vaccines.

AB  - Stochastic fluctuations, termed "noise," in the level of biological molecules can
      greatly impact cellular functions. While biological noise can sometimes be
      detrimental, recent studies have provided an increasing number of examples in
      which biological noise can be functionally beneficial. Rather than provide an
      exhaustive review of the growing literature in this field, in this review, we
      focus on single-cell studies based on quantitative microscopy that have generated
      a deeper understanding of the sources, characteristics, limitations, and benefits
      of biological noise. Specifically, we highlight studies showing how noise can
      help coordinate the expression of multiple downstream target genes, impact the
      channel capacity of signaling networks, and interact synergistically with
      oscillatory dynamics to enhance the sensitivity of signal processing. We conclude
      with a discussion of current challenges and future opportunities.

AB  - Many organisms can adapt to changes in the solute content of their surroundings
      (i.e., the osmolarity). Hyperosmotic shock causes water efflux and a concomitant 
      reduction in cell volume, which is countered by the accumulation of osmolytes.
      This volume reduction increases the crowded nature of the cytoplasm, which is
      expected to affect protein stability. In contrast to traditional theory, which
      predicts that more crowded conditions can only increase protein stability, recent
      work shows that crowding can destabilize proteins through transient attractive
      interactions. Here, we quantify protein stability in living Escherichia coli
      cells before and after hyperosmotic shock in the presence and absence of the
      osmolyte, glycine betaine. The 7-kDa N-terminal src-homology 3 domain of
      Drosophila signal transduction protein drk is used as the test protein. We find
      that hyperosmotic shock decreases SH3 stability in cells, consistent with the
      idea that transient attractive interactions are important under physiologically
      relevant crowded conditions. The subsequent uptake of glycine betaine returns SH3
      to the stability observed without osmotic shock. These results highlight the
      effect of transient attractive interactions on protein stability in cells and
      provide a new explanation for why stressed cells accumulate osmolytes.

AB  - Phosphorylation and ubiquitination are pervasive post-translational modifications
      that impact all processes inside eukaryotic cells. The role of each modification 
      has been studied for decades, and functional interplay between the two has long
      been demonstrated and even more widely postulated. However, our understanding of 
      the molecular features that allow phosphorylation to control protein
      ubiquitination and ubiquitin to control phosphorylation has only recently begun
      to build. Here, we review examples of regulation between ubiquitination and
      phosphorylation, aiming to describe mechanisms at the molecular level. In
      general, these examples illustrate phosphorylation as a versatile switch
      throughout ubiquitination pathways, and ubiquitination primarily impacting kinase
      signalling in a more emphatic manner through scaffolding or degradation. Examples
      of regulation between these two processes are likely to grow even further as
      advances in molecular biology, proteomics, and computation allow a system-level
      understanding of signalling. Many new cases could involve similar principles to
      those described here, but the extensive co-regulation of these two systems leaves
      no doubt that they still have many surprises in store.

AB  - Bacteria sense and adapt to environmental changes using two-component systems.
      These signaling pathways are formed by a histidine kinase that phosphorylates a
      response regulator (RR), which finally modulates the transcription of target
      genes. The bacterium Brucella abortus codes for a two-component system formed by 
      the histidine kinase NtrY and the RR NtrX that participates in sensing low oxygen
      tension and generating an adaptive response. NtrX is a modular protein with REC, 
      AAA+, and DNA-binding domains, an architecture that classifies it among the NtrC 
      subfamily of RRs. However, it lacks the signature GAFTGA motif that is essential 
      for activating transcription by the mechanism proposed for canonical members of
      this subfamily. In this article, we present the first crystal structure of
      full-length NtrX, which is also the first structure of a full-length NtrC-like RR
      with all the domains solved, showing that the protein is structurally similar to 
      other members of the subfamily. We also report that NtrX binds nucleotides and
      the structures of the protein bound to ATP and ADP. Despite binding ATP, NtrX
      does not have ATPase activity and does not form oligomers in response to
      phosphorylation or nucleotide binding. We also identify a nucleotide sequence
      recognized by NtrX that allows it to bind to a promoter region that regulates its
      own transcription and to establish a negative feedback mechanism to modulate its 
      expression. Overall, this article provides a detailed description of the NtrX RR 
      and supports that it functions by a mechanism different to classical NtrC-like
      RRs.

AB  - The phosphorylation of specific residues in a flexible disordered activation loop
      yields precise control of signal transduction. One paradigm is the
      phosphorylation of S339/S340 in the intrinsically disordered tail of the
      multi-domain scaffolding protein NHERF1, which affects the intracellular
      localization and trafficking of NHERF1 assembled signaling complexes. Using
      neutron spin echo spectroscopy (NSE), we show salt-concentration-dependent
      excitation of nanoscale motion at the tip of the C-terminal tail in the
      phosphomimic S339D/S340D mutant. The "tip of the whip" that is unleashed is near 
      the S339/S340 phosphorylation site and flanks the hydrophobic Ezrin-binding
      motif. The kinetic association rate constant of the binding of the S339D/S340D
      mutant to the FERM domain of Ezrin is sensitive to buffer salt concentration,
      correlating with the excited nanoscale dynamics. The results suggest that
      electrostatics modulates the activation of nanoscale dynamics of an intrinsically
      disordered protein, controlling the binding kinetics of signaling partners. NSE
      can pinpoint the nanoscale dynamics changes in a highly specific manner.

AB  - Phospholipases are abundant in various types of cells and compartments, where
      they play key roles in physiological processes as diverse as digestion, cell
      proliferation, and neural activation. In Gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane
      phospholipase A (OmpLA) is involved in outer-membrane lipid homeostasis and
      bacterial virulence. Although the enzymatic activity of OmpLA can be probed with 
      an assay relying on an artificial monoacyl thioester substrate, only little is
      known about its activity on diacyl phospholipids. Here, we used high-speed atomic
      force microscopy (HS-AFM) to directly image enzymatic phospholipid degradation by
      OmpLA in real time. In the absence of Ca(2+), reconstituted OmpLA diffused within
      a phospholipid bilayer without revealing any signs of phospholipase activity.
      Upon the addition of Ca(2+), OmpLA was activated and degraded the membrane with a
      turnover of ~2 phospholipid molecules per second and per OmpLA dimer until most
      of the membrane phospholipids were hydrolyzed and the protein became tightly
      packed.

AB  - Protein side-chain mutation is fundamental both to natural evolutionary processes
      and to the engineering of protein therapeutics, which constitute an increasing
      fraction of important medications. Molecular simulation enables the prediction of
      the effects of mutation on properties such as binding affinity, secondary and
      tertiary structure, conformational dynamics, and thermal stability. A number of
      widely differing approaches have been applied to these predictions, including
      sequence-based algorithms, knowledge-based potential functions, and all-atom
      molecular mechanics calculations. Free energy perturbation theory, employing
      all-atom and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, is a rigorous
      physics-based approach for calculating thermodynamic effects of, for example,
      protein side-chain mutations. Over the past several years, we have initiated an
      investigation of the ability of our most recent free energy perturbation
      methodology to model the thermodynamics of protein mutation for two specific
      problems: protein-protein binding affinities and protein thermal stability. We
      highlight recent advances in the field and outline current and future challenges.

TI  - DNA and IkappaBalpha Both Induce Long-Range Conformational Changes in NFkappaB.
PG  - 999-1008

AB  - We recently discovered that IkappaBalpha enhances the rate of release of nuclear 
      factor kappa B (NFkappaB) from DNA target sites in a process we have termed
      molecular stripping. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the
      stripping pathway revealed two mechanisms for the enhanced release rate: the
      negatively charged PEST region of IkappaBalpha electrostatically repels the DNA, 
      and the binding of IkappaBalpha appears to twist the NFkappaB heterodimer so that
      the DNA can no longer bind. Here, we report amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange
      data that reveal long-range allosteric changes in the NFkappaB (RelA-p50)
      heterodimer induced by DNA or IkappaBalpha binding. The data suggest that the two
      Ig-like subdomains of each Rel-homology region, which are connected by a flexible
      linker in the heterodimer, communicate in such a way that when DNA binds to the
      N-terminal DNA-binding domains, the nuclear localization signal becomes more
      highly exchanging. Conversely, when IkappaBalpha binds to the dimerization
      domains, amide exchange throughout the DNA-binding domains is decreased as if the
      entire domain is becoming globally stabilized. The results help understand how
      the subtle mechanism of molecular stripping actually occurs.

AB  - The role of cullin E3-ubiquitin ligases for muscle homeostasis is best known
      during muscle atrophy, as the cullin-1 substrate adaptor atrogin-1 is among the
      most well-characterized muscle atrogins. We investigated whether cullin activity 
      was also crucial during terminal myoblast differentiation and aggregation of
      acetylcholine receptors for the establishment of neuromuscular junctions in
      vitro. The activity of cullin E3-ligases is modulated through post-translational 
      modification with the small ubiquitin-like modifier nedd8. Using either the Nae1 
      inhibitor MLN4924 (Pevonedistat) or siRNA against nedd8 in early or late stages
      of differentiation on C2C12 myoblasts, and primary satellite cells from mouse and
      human, we show that cullin E3-ligase activity is necessary for each step of the
      muscle cell differentiation program in vitro. We further investigate known
      transcriptional repressors for terminal muscle differentiation, namely ZBTB38,
      Bhlhe41, and Id1. Due to their identified roles for terminal muscle
      differentiation, we hypothesize that the accumulation of these potential cullin
      E3-ligase substrates may be partially responsible for the observed phenotype.
      MLN4924 is currently undergoing clinical trials in cancer patients, and our
      experiments highlight concerns on the homeostasis and regenerative capacity of
      muscles in these patients who often experience cachexia.

TI  - Structure and Function of a Novel ATPase that Interacts with Holliday Junction
      Resolvase Hjc and Promotes Branch Migration.

AB  - Holliday junction (HJ) is a hallmark intermediate in DNA recombination and must
      be processed by dissolution (for double HJ) or resolution to ensure genome
      stability. Although HJ resolvases have been identified in all domains of life,
      there is a long-standing effort to search in prokaryotes and eukarya for proteins
      promoting HJ migration. Here, we report the structural and functional
      characterization of a novel ATPase, Sulfolobus islandicusPilT
      N-terminal-domain-containing ATPase (SisPINA), encoded by the gene adjacent to
      the resolvase Hjc coding gene. PINA is conserved in archaea and vital for S.
      islandicus viability. Purified SisPINA forms hexameric rings in the crystalline
      state and in solution, similar to the HJ migration helicase RuvB in Gram-negative
      bacteria. Structural analysis suggests that ATP binding and hydrolysis cause
      conformational changes in SisPINA to drive branch migration. Further studies
      reveal that SisPINA interacts with SisHjc and coordinates HJ migration and
      cleavage.

AB  - In bacteria, ribosomal subunits are connected via 12 intersubunit bridges
      involving RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions. The only
      protein-protein bridge in the ribosome is ribosomal intersubunit bridge 1b (B1b),
      which is mainly formed by the bacterial protein L31 (bL31) and connects the head 
      domain of 30S subunit and the central protuberance of the 50S subunit. It is
      known to be the most dynamic intersubunit bridge. Here, we have evaluated the
      role of bL31 and thereby the bridge B1b in the working cycle of the ribosome.
      First, bL31-deficient ribosomes are severely compromised in their ability to
      ensure translational fidelity particularly in reading frame maintenance in vivo. 
      Second, in the absence of bL31, the rate of initiation is significantly reduced
      both in vivo and in vitro. Third, polysome profile and subunit reassociation
      assays demonstrate that bL31 is important for stabilizing subunit joining in vivo
      and in vitro. Together, our results demonstrate that bL31 is important for
      determining translational fidelity and stabilizing subunit association. We
      conclude that the only protein-protein intersubunit bridge of the bacterial
      ribosome facilitates translation initiation and is essential for maintaining the 
      reading frame of mRNA translation.

AB  - Intercellular contacts in multicellular organisms are maintained by membrane
      receptors called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which are expressed on cell
      surfaces. One interesting feature of CAMs is that almost all of their
      extracellular regions contain repeating copies of structural domains. It is not
      clear why so many extracellular domains need to be evolved through natural
      selection. We tackled this problem by computational modeling. A generic model of 
      CAMs was constructed based on the domain organization of neuronal CAM, which is
      engaged in maintaining neuron-neuron adhesion in central nervous system. By
      placing these models on a cell-cell interface, we developed a Monte-Carlo
      simulation algorithm that incorporates both molecular factors including
      conformational changes of CAMs and cellular factor including fluctuations of
      plasma membranes to approach the physical process of CAM-mediated adhesion. We
      found that the presence of multiple domains at the extracellular region of a CAM 
      plays a positive role in regulating its trans-interaction with other CAMs from
      the opposite side of cell surfaces. The trans-interaction can further be
      facilitated by the intramolecular contacts between different extracellular
      domains of a CAM. Finally, if more than one CAM is introduced on each side of
      cell surfaces, the lateral binding (cis-interactions) between these CAMs will
      positively correlate with their trans-interactions only within a small energetic 
      range, suggesting that cell adhesion is an elaborately designed process in which 
      both trans- and cis-interactions are fine-tuned collectively by natural
      selection. In short, this study deepens our general understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms of cell adhesion.

AB  - The exotoxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are produced by the bacterial
      pathogen Clostridium difficile and are responsible for the pathology associated
      with C. difficile infection (CDI). The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and
      bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab was
      recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have
      previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct
      epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain,
      preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the
      binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization.
      Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques,
      we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP
      domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189
      and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at
      higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association
      of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity
      by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of
      neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB.
      Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile
      ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis 
      for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency.
      These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody
      in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI.

      Poly(L-Proline) Binding Capacity Suitable for Imaging.

AB  - Profilin is vital for actin organisation in eukaryotic cells. It controls actin
      filament formation by binding monomeric actin and numerous proteins involved in
      polarised actin assembly. Important for the latter is the interaction surface
      formed by the N- and C-terminal helices, which pack close to each other on one
      side of the molecule at a distance from the actin site and mediate binding to
      poly-proline sequences present in many of the targeted proteins. Via these
      interactions, profilin contributes to the spatiotemporal control of actin
      filament growth. Studies of profilin dynamics in living cells by imaging
      techniques have been hampered by problems to generate fusion constructs with
      fluorophore proteins without negatively impacting on its poly-proline binding.
      With the object to circumvent this problem, we have generated an internal fusion 
      of profilin with the green fluorescent variant citrine, here referred to as
      citrine-profilin. The characterisation of citrine-profilin (CIT-Pfn) demonstrates
      that it has full capacity to interact with poly-proline and also binds
      phosphatidylinositol lipids and actin, albeit with 10 times reduced affinity for 
      the latter. Imaging of living cells expressing CIT-Pfn showed a distribution of
      the fusion protein similar to endogenous profilin. Furthermore, CIT-Pfn rescued
      the phenotypes observed after the Crispr/Cas9 knockout of the profilin 1 gene,
      including the lost migratory capacity characterising the knockout cells. Based on
      this, we conclude that the CIT-Pfn construct will be useful as a tool for
      displaying profilin localisation in living cells and obtaining information on its
      dynamic organisation under different conditions and activations of the actin
      microfilament and microtubule systems.

AB  - The stability of folded proteins is critical to their biological function and for
      the efficacy of protein therapeutics. Predicting the energetic effects of protein
      mutations can improve our fundamental understanding of structural biology, the
      molecular basis of diseases, and possible routes to addressing those diseases
      with biological drugs. Identifying the effect of single amino acid point
      mutations on the thermodynamic equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states
      of a protein can pinpoint residues of critical importance that should be avoided 
      in the process of improving other properties (affinity, solubility, viscosity,
      etc.) and suggest changes at other positions for increasing stability in protein 
      engineering. Multiple computational tools have been developed for in silico
      predictions of protein stability in recent years, ranging from sequence-based
      empirical approaches to rigorous physics-based free energy methods. In this work,
      we show that FEP+, which is a free energy perturbation method based on all-atom
      molecular dynamics simulations, can provide accurate thermal stability
      predictions for a wide range of biologically relevant systems. Significantly, the
      FEP+ approach, while originally developed for relative binding free energies of
      small molecules to proteins and not specifically fitted for protein stability
      calculations, performs well compared to other methods that were fitted
      specifically to predict protein stability. Here, we present the broadest
      validation of a rigorous free energy-based approach applied to protein stability 
      reported to date: 700+ single-point mutations spanning 10 different protein
      targets. Across the entire data set, we correctly classify the mutations as
      stabilizing or destabilizing in 84% of the cases, and obtain statistically
      significant predictions as compared with experiment [average error of
      ~1.6kcal/mol and coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.40]. This study
      demonstrates, for the first time in a large-scale validation, that rigorous free 
      energy calculations can be used to predict changes in protein stability from
      point mutations without parameterization or system-specific customization,
      although further improvements should be possible with additional sampling and a
      better representation of the unfolded state of the protein. Here, we describe the
      FEP+ method as applied to protein stability calculations, summarize the
      large-scale retrospective validation results, and discuss limitations of the
      method, along with future directions for further improvements.

AB  - Direct calculation of relative binding affinities between antibodies and antigens
      is a long-sought goal. However, despite substantial efforts, no generally
      applicable computational method has been described. Here, we describe a
      systematic free energy perturbation (FEP) protocol and calculate the binding
      affinities between the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and three broadly
      neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the VRC01 class. The protocol has been adapted
      from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated
      with modeling protein-protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology
      models of the three antibody-gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for
      large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of
      gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve 
      sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in
      which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically
      mutated to alanine. The RMS error in the large set (55 total cases) of FEP tests 
      as compared to these experiments, 0.68kcal/mol, is near experimental accuracy,
      and it compares favorably with the results obtained from a simpler, empirical
      methodology. The correlation coefficient for the combined data set including
      residues with glycan contacts, R(2)=0.49, should be sufficient to guide the
      choice of residues for antibody optimization projects, assuming that this level
      of accuracy can be realized in prospective prediction. More generally, these
      results are encouraging with regard to the possibility of using an FEP approach
      to calculate the magnitude of protein-protein binding affinities.

AB  - Residues E402 and R404 of the Escherichia coli serine chemoreceptor, Tsr, appear 
      to form a salt bridge that spans the interfaces between neighboring dimers in the
      Tsr trimer of dimers, a key structural component of receptor core signaling
      complexes. To assess their functional roles, we constructed full sets of single
      amino acid replacement mutants at E402 and R404 and characterized their signaling
      behaviors with a suite of in vivo assays. Our results indicate that the E402 and 
      R404 residues of Tsr play their most critical signaling roles at their inner
      locations near the trimer axis where they likely participate in stabilizing the
      trimer-of-dimer packing and the kinase-ON state of core signaling complexes.
      Mutant receptors with a variety of side-chain replacements still accessed both
      the ON and OFF signaling states, suggesting that core signaling complexes produce
      kinase activity over a range of receptor conformations and dynamic motions.
      Similarly, the kinase-OFF state may not be a discrete conformation but rather a
      range of structures outside the range of those suitable for kinase activation.
      Consistent with this idea, some structural lesions at both E402 and R404 produced
      signaling behaviors that are not compatible with discrete two-state models of
      core complex signaling states. Those lesions might stabilize intermediate
      receptor conformations along the OFF-ON energy landscape. Amino acid replacements
      produced different constellations of signaling defects at each residue,
      indicating that they play distinct structure-function roles. R404, but not E402, 
      was critical for high signal cooperativity in the receptor array.

AB  - The i-AAA protease is a component of the mitochondrial quality control machinery 
      that regulates respiration, mitochondrial dynamics, and protein import. The
      protease is required to select specific substrates for degradation from among the
      diverse complement of proteins present in mitochondria, yet the rules that govern
      this selection are unclear. Here, we reconstruct the yeast i-AAA protease, Yme1p,
      to examine the in vitro degradation of two intermembrane space chaperone
      subunits, Tim9 and Tim10. Yme1p degrades Tim10 more rapidly than Tim9 despite
      high sequence and structural similarity, and loss of Tim10 is accelerated by the 
      disruption of conserved disulfide bonds within the substrate. An unstructured
      N-terminal region of Tim10 is necessary and sufficient to target the substrate to
      the protease through recognition of a short phenylalanine-rich motif, and the
      presence of similar motifs in other small Tim proteins predicts robust
      degradation by the protease. Together, these results identify the first specific 
      degron sequence within a native i-AAA protease substrate.

AB  - The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a carbohydrate
      transport and phosphorylation system present in bacteria of all different phyla
      and in archaea. It is usually composed of three proteins or protein complexes,
      enzyme I, HPr, and enzyme II, which are phosphorylated at histidine or cysteine
      residues. However, in many bacteria, HPr can also be phosphorylated at a serine
      residue. The PTS not only functions as a carbohydrate transporter but also
      regulates numerous cellular processes either by phosphorylating its target
      proteins or by interacting with them in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The
      target proteins can be catabolic enzymes, transporters, and signal transduction
      proteins but are most frequently transcriptional regulators. In this review, we
      will describe how PTS components interact with or phosphorylate proteins to
      regulate directly or indirectly the activity of transcriptional repressors,
      activators, or antiterminators. We will briefly summarize the well-studied
      mechanism of carbon catabolite repression in firmicutes, where the
      transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A needs to interact with
      seryl-phosphorylated HPr in order to be functional. We will present new results
      related to transcriptional activators and antiterminators containing specific PTS
      regulation domains, which are the phosphorylation targets for three different
      types of PTS components. Moreover, we will discuss how the phosphorylation level 
      of the PTS components precisely regulates the activity of target transcriptional 
      regulators or antiterminators, with or without PTS regulation domain, and how the
      availability of PTS substrates and thus the metabolic status of the cell are
      connected with various cellular processes, such as biofilm formation or virulence
      of certain pathogens.

AB  - Ca(2+) concentration jumps for the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent ion channels or
      transporters can be obtained either by fast solution exchange or by the use of
      caged Ca(2+). Here, we report on an alternate optogenetic method for the
      activation of Ca(2+) and voltage-dependent large conductance (BK) potassium
      channels. This was achieved through the use of the light-gated channelrhodopsin 2
      variant, CatCh(Calcium translocating Channelrhodopsin) with enhanced Ca, which
      produces locally [Ca(2+)] in the muM range on the inner side of the membrane,
      without significant [Ca(2+)] increase in the cytosol. BK channel subunits alpha
      and beta1 were expressed together with CatCh in HEK293 cells, and voltage and
      Ca(2+) dependence were analyzed. Light activation of endogenous BK channels under
      native conditions in astrocytes and glioma cells was also investigated.
      Additionally, BK channels were used as sensors for the calibration of the
      [Ca(2+)] on the inner surface of the cell membrane.

TI  - Dynamic Phenylalanine Clamp Interactions Define Single-Channel Polypeptide
      Translocation through the Anthrax Toxin Protective Antigen Channel.

AB  - Anthrax toxin is an intracellularly acting toxin where sufficient detail is known
      about the structure of its channel, allowing for molecular investigations of
      translocation. The toxin is composed of three proteins, protective antigen (PA), 
      lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). The toxin's translocon, PA,
      translocates the large enzymes, LF and EF, across the endosomal membrane into the
      host cell's cytosol. Polypeptide clamps located throughout the PA channel
      catalyze the translocation of LF and EF. Here, we show that the central peptide
      clamp, the varphi clamp, is a dynamic site that governs the overall peptide
      translocation pathway. Single-channel translocations of a 10-residue, guest-host 
      peptide revealed that there were four states when peptide interacted with the
      channel. Two of the states had intermediate conductances of 10% and 50% of full
      conductance. With aromatic guest-host peptides, the 50% conducting intermediate
      oscillated with the fully blocked state. A Trp guest-host peptide was studied by 
      manipulating its stereochemistry and prenucleating helix formation with a
      covalent linkage in the place of a hydrogen bond or hydrogen-bond surrogate
      (HBS). The Trp peptide synthesized with L-amino acids translocated more
      efficiently than peptides synthesized with D- or alternating D,L-amino acids. HBS
      stapled Trp peptide exhibited signs of steric hindrance and difficulty
      translocating. However, when mutant varphi clamp (F427A) channels were tested,
      the HBS peptide translocated normally. Overall, peptide translocation is defined 
      by dynamic interactions between the peptide and varphi clamp. These dynamics
      require conformational flexibility, such that the peptide productively forms both
      extended-chain and helical states during translocation.

      Remodeler.

AB  - Chromatin remodelers are ATP-dependent enzymes that are critical for reorganizing
      and repositioning nucleosomes in concert with many basic cellular processes. For 
      the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) remodeler, nucleosome
      sliding has been shown to depend on the DNA flanking the nucleosome,
      transcription factor binding at the nucleosome edge, and the presence of the
      histone H2A/H2B dimer on the entry side. Here, we report that Chd1 is also
      sensitive to the sequence of DNA within the nucleosome and slides nucleosomes
      made with the 601 Widom positioning sequence asymmetrically. Kinetic and
      equilibrium experiments show that poly(dA:dT) tracts perturb remodeling reactions
      if within one and a half helical turns of superhelix location 2 (SHL2), where the
      Chd1 ATPase engages nucleosomal DNA. These sequence-dependent effects do not rely
      on the Chd1 DNA-binding domain and are not due to differences in nucleosome
      affinity. Using site-specific cross-linking, we show that internal poly(dA:dT)
      tracts do not block the engagement of the ATPase motor with SHL2, yet they
      promote multiple translational positions of DNA with respect to both Chd1 and the
      histone core. We speculate that Chd1 senses the sequence-dependent response of
      DNA as the remodeler ATPase perturbs the duplex at SHL2. These results suggest
      that the sequence sensitivity of histones and remodelers occur at unique segments
      of DNA on the nucleosome, allowing them to work together or in opposition to
      determine nucleosome positions throughout the genome.

AB  - Merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) is an intrinsically disordered antigen that is
      abundant on the surface of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The two
      allelic families of MSP2, 3D7 and FC27, differ in their central variable regions,
      which are flanked by highly conserved C-terminal and N-terminal regions. In a
      vaccine trial, full-length 3D7 MSP2 induced a strain-specific protective immune
      response despite the detectable presence of conserved region antibodies. This
      work focuses on the conserved C-terminal region of MSP2, which includes the only 
      disulphide bond in the protein and encompasses key epitopes recognised by the
      mouse monoclonal antibodies 4D11 and 9H4. Although the 4D11 and 9H4 epitopes are 
      overlapping, immunofluorescence assays have shown that the mouse monoclonal
      antibody 4D11 binds to MSP2 on the merozoite surface with a much stronger signal 
      than 9H4. Understanding the structural basis for this antigenic difference
      between these antibodies will help direct the design of a broad-spectrum and
      MSP2-based malaria vaccine. 4D11 and 9H4 were reengineered into antibody
      fragments [variable region fragment (Fv) and single-chain Fv (scFv)] and were
      validated as suitable models for their full-sized IgG counterparts by surface
      plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry. An alanine scan of the
      13-residue epitope 3D7-MSP2207-222 identified the minimal binding epitope of 4D11
      and the key residues involved in binding. A 2.2-A crystal structure of 4D11 Fv
      bound to the eight-residue epitope NKENCGAA provided valuable insight into the
      possible conformation of the C-terminal region of MSP2 on the parasite. This work
      underpins continued efforts to optimise recombinant MSP2 constructs for
      evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

AB  - Traditionally, an enzyme is a protein that mediates biochemical action by binding
      to the substrate and by catalyzing the reaction that translates external cues
      into biological responses. Sequential dissemination of information from one
      enzyme to another facilitates signal transduction in biological systems providing
      for feed-forward and feed-back mechanisms. Given this viewpoint, an enzyme
      without its catalytic activity is generally considered to be an inert
      organizational protein without catalytic function and has classically been termed
      as pseudo-enzymes. However, pseudo-enzymes still have biological function albeit 
      non-enzymatic like serving as a chaperone protein or an interactive platform
      between proteins. In this regard, majority of the studies have focused solely on 
      the catalytic role of enzymes in biological function, overlooking the potentially
      critical non-enzymatic roles. Increasing evidence from recent studies implicate
      that the scaffolding function of enzymes could be as important in signal
      transduction as its catalytic activity, which is an antithesis to the definition 
      of enzymes. Recognition of non-enzymatic functions could be critical, as these
      unappreciated roles may hold clues to the ineffectiveness of kinase inhibitors in
      pathology, which is characteristically associated with increased enzyme
      expression. Using an established enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma, we
      discuss the insights obtained from the scaffolding function and how this
      non-canonical role could contribute to/alter the outcomes in pathology like
      cancer and heart failure. Also, we hope that with this review, we provide a forum
      and a starting point to discuss the idea that catalytic function alone may not
      account for all the actions observed with increased expression of the enzyme.

      Implication in Filament Assembly.

AB  - FliD is a self-oligomerizing structural protein that caps the growing end of the 
      bacterial flagellar filament. FliD also plays a key role in the flagellar system 
      by continuously adding a new flagellin protein to the tip of the filament. To
      structurally characterize FliD oligomerization and to provide a FliD-mediated
      flagellin polymerization mechanism, we have determined the crystal structures of 
      FliD proteins from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
      (ecFliD and stFliD, respectively). ecFliD consists of three domains (D1, D2, and 
      D3) and forms a hexamer plate of the D2 and D3 domains that resembles a
      six-pointed star with legs consisting of the D1 domain. In contrast, the D2 and
      D3 domains of stFliD assemble into a pentamer as a five-pointed star plate.
      Despite their distinct oligomeric states, ecFliD and stFliD engage a common
      molecular surface for oligomerization. FliD also features interdomain and
      intersubunit flexibility, suggesting that FliD reorganizes its domains and
      adjacent subunits depending on the FliD binding partner. The similarity of the
      FliD shape to flagellin and the structural dynamics of FliD led us to propose a
      FliD-catalyzed filament elongation mechanism. In this model, FliD occupies a
      position in place of a nascent flagellin until the flagellin reaches the growing 
      end of the filament, and then, FliD moves aside to repeat the positional
      replacement.

AB  - Iron-sulfur (Fe/S)-cluster-containing proteins constitute one of the largest
      protein classes, with varied functions that include electron transport,
      regulation of gene expression, substrate binding and activation, and radical
      generation. Consequently, the biosynthetic machinery for Fe/S clusters is
      evolutionarily conserved, and mutations in a variety of putative intermediate
      Fe/S cluster scaffold proteins can cause disease states, including multiple
      mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome (MMDS), sideroblastic anemia, and
      mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Herein, we have characterized the impact of
      defects occurring in the MMDS1 disease state that result from a point mutation
      (Gly208Cys) near the active site of NFU1, an Fe/S scaffold protein, via an in
      vitro investigation into the structural and functional consequences. Analysis of 
      protein stability and oligomeric state demonstrates that the mutant increases the
      propensity to dimerize and perturbs the secondary structure composition. These
      changes appear to underlie the severely decreased ability of mutant NFU1 to
      accept an Fe/S cluster from physiologically relevant sources. Therefore, the
      point mutation on NFU1 impairs downstream cluster trafficking and results in the 
      disease phenotype, because there does not appear to be an alternative in vivo
      reconstitution path, most likely due to greater protein oligomerization from a
      minor structural change.

AB  - To identify and structurally characterize the precursor conformation of the prion
      protein (PrP), from which misfolding and aggregation directly commence, has been 
      a long-standing goal. Misfolding converts the alpha-helical, non-pathogenic
      functional form of PrP to pathogenic, beta-structured oligomeric and
      amyloidogenic forms, which are the cause of prion diseases. Susceptibility to
      sporadic prion disease correlates well with the propensity of PrP to misfold to
      cytotoxic, proteinase K resistant oligomeric conformations at low pH. In this
      study, mutagenesis at the hydrophobic core of the mouse PrP has been shown to
      stabilize a monomeric unfolding intermediate (I), which is populated
      significantly at equilibrium at low pH. Importantly, the rate of formation of
      beta-structured oligomers at low pH is found to correlate well with the extent to
      which this intermediate is populated. The misfolding process is limited by the

      misfolding-prone solvent conditions.

AB  - The 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a widely conserved and ubiquitous
      molecular chaperone that participates in ATP-dependent protein remodeling in both
      eukaryotes and prokaryotes. It functions in conjunction with Hsp70 and the Hsp70 
      cochaperones, an Hsp40 (J-protein) and a nucleotide exchange factor. In
      Escherichia coli, the functional collaboration between Hsp90Ec and Hsp70, DnaK,
      requires that the two chaperones directly interact. We used molecular docking to 
      model the interaction of Hsp90Ec and DnaK. The top-ranked docked model predicted 
      that a region in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of DnaK interacted with a
      region in the middle domain of Hsp90Ec. We then made substitution mutants in DnaK
      residues suggested by the model to interact with Hsp90Ec. Of the 12 mutants
      tested, 11 were defective or partially defective in their ability to interact
      with Hsp90Ecin vivo in a bacterial two-hybrid assay and in vitro in a bio-layer
      interferometry assay. These DnaK mutants were also defective in their ability to 
      function collaboratively in protein remodeling with Hsp90Ec but retained the
      ability to act with DnaK cochaperones. Taken together, these results suggest that
      a specific region in the NBD of DnaK is involved in the interaction with Hsp90Ec,
      and this interaction is functionally important. Moreover, the region of DnaK that
      we found to be necessary for Hsp90Ec binding includes residues that are also
      involved in J-protein binding, suggesting a functional interplay among DnaK, DnaK
      cochaperones, and Hsp90Ec.

AB  - Nuclear export of partially spliced or unspliced HIV-1 RNA transcripts requires
      binding of the viral protein regulator of expression of virion (Rev) to the Rev
      response element (RRE) and subsequent oligomerization in a cooperative manner.
      Cellular DEAD-box helicase DEAD-box protein 1 (DDX1) plays a role in HIV
      replication, interacting with and affecting Rev-containing HIV transcripts in
      vivo, interacting directly with the RRE and Rev in vitro, and promoting Rev
      oligomerization in vitro. Binding of DDX1 results in enhancement of Rev
      oligomerization on the RRE that is correlated with an RNA structural change
      within the RRE that persists even after dissociation of DDX1. Furthermore, this
      structural transition is likely located within the three-way junction of stem II 
      of the RRE that is responsible for initial Rev binding. This discovery of the
      stem II structural transition leads to a model wherein DDX1 can act as an RNA
      chaperone, folding stem IIB into a proper Rev binding conformation.

TI  - Multimodal and Polymorphic Interactions between Anillin and Actin: Their
      Implications for Cytokinesis.

AB  - Cytokinesis of animal cells requires the assembly of a contractile ring, which
      promotes daughter cell splitting. Anillin is a conserved scaffold protein
      involved in organizing the structural components of the contractile ring
      including filamentous actin (F-actin), myosin, and septins and in forming the
      subsequent midbody ring. Like other metazoan homologs, Drosophila anillin
      contains a conserved domain that can bind and bundle F-actin, but the importance 
      and molecular details of its interaction with F-actin remain unclear. Here, we
      show that in a depletion-and-rescue assay in Drosophila S2 cells, anillin lacking
      the entire actin-binding domain (ActBD) exhibits defective cortical localization 
      during mitosis and a greatly diminished ability to support cytokinesis. Using in 
      vitro binding assays and electron microscopy on recombinant fragments, we
      determine that the anillin ActBD harbors three distinct actin-binding sites (ABS 
      1-3). We show that each ABS binds to a distinct place on F-actin. Importantly,
      ABS1 and ABS3 partially overlap on the surface of actin and, therefore, interact 
      with F-actin in a mutually exclusive fashion. Although ABS2 and ABS3 are
      sufficient for bundling, ABS1 contributes to the overall F-actin bundling
      activity of anillin and enables anillin to switch between two actin-bundling
      morphologies and promote the formation of three-dimensional F-actin bundles.
      Finally, we show that in live S2 cells, ABS2 and ABS3 are each required and
      together sufficient for the robust cortical localization of the ActBD during
      cytokinesis. Collectively, our structural, biochemical, and cell biological data 
      suggest that multiple anillin-actin interaction modes promote the faithful
      progression of cytokinesis.

AB  - Calcium signaling plays an important role in cell survival by influencing
      mitochondria-related processes such as energy production and apoptosis. The
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main storage compartment for cell calcium
      (Ca(2+); ~60-500muM), and the Ca(2+) released by the ER has a prompt effect on
      the homeostasis of the juxtaposed mitochondria. Recent findings have highlighted 
      a close connection between ER redox and Ca(2+) signaling that is mediated by
      Ca(2+)-handling proteins. This paper describes the redox-regulated mediators and 
      mechanisms that orchestrate Ca(2+) signals from the ER to mitochondria.

AB  - In order for many proteins to move across hydrophobic membrane bilayers, they
      must be unfolded and translocated by a membrane-embedded channel. These
      translocase channels interact with the substrate proteins they translocate via
      hydrophobic pore loops and cleft structures called clamps. The molecular basis
      for how clamps facilitate unfolding and translocation is poorly understood.
      Anthrax toxin is composed of three proteins, a translocase channel-forming
      subunit, called protective antigen (PA), and two substrate proteins, called
      lethal factor (LF) and edema factor. Oligomeric PA forms a large channel that
      contains three types of polypeptide clamp sites: an alpha clamp, a phenylalanine 
      clamp, and a charge clamp. Currently, it is thought that these clamp sites
      operate allosterically and promote translocation via an allosteric helix
      compression mechanism. Here, we report on the substrate secondary structure
      dependence of the PA channel. Peptides derived from regions of LF with high
      alpha-helical content bound cooperatively, but those derived from beta-sheet
      regions in LF did not, suggesting that an allosteric site preferentially
      recognizes alpha-helical structure over beta-sheet structure. Peptides derived
      from helical sites in LF showed increasingly longer single-channel blockades as a
      function of peptide concentration, a result that was consistent with stronger
      clamping behavior and reduced backsliding. Moreover, peptides derived from
      helical regions of LF translocated more efficiently than peptides derived from
      beta-sheet regions of LF. Overall, in support of the allosteric helix compression
      model, we find that the channel prefers alpha-helical sequences over beta-sheet
      sequences.

AB  - Virions of the single-stranded RNA bacteriophages contain a single copy of the
      maturation protein, which is bound to the phage genome and is required for the
      infectivity of the particles. The maturation protein mediates the adsorption of
      the virion to bacterial pili and the subsequent release and penetration of the
      genome into the host cell. Here, we report a crystal structure of the maturation 
      protein from bacteriophage Qbeta. The protein has a bent, highly asymmetric shape
      and spans 110A in length. Apart from small local substructures, the overall fold 
      of the maturation protein does not resemble that of other known proteins. The
      protein is organized in two distinct regions, an alpha-helical part with a
      four-helix core, and a beta stranded part that contains a seven-stranded sheet in
      the central part and a five-stranded sheet at the tip of the protein. The Qbeta
      maturation protein has two distinct, positively charged areas at opposite sides
      of the alpha-helical part, which are involved in genomic RNA binding. The
      maturation protein binds to each of the surrounding coat protein dimers in the
      capsid differently, and the interaction is considerably weaker compared to coat
      protein interdimer contacts. The coat protein- or RNA-binding residues are not
      preserved among different ssRNA phage maturation proteins; instead, the distal
      end of the alpha-helical part is the most evolutionarily conserved, suggesting
      the importance of this region for maintaining the functionality of the protein.

AB  - The 90-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90s) assist the maturation of many key
      regulators of signal transduction pathways and cellular control circuits like
      protein kinases and transcription factors and chaperone their stability and
      activity. In this function, Hsp90s cooperate with some 30 cochaperones and they
      are themselves subject to regulation by numerous post-translational
      modifications. In vertebrates, two major isoforms exist in the cytosol,
      Hsp90alpha and Hsp90beta, which share a high degree of sequence identity and are 
      expressed in tissue- and environmental condition-dependent manner. We identified 
      an isoform-specific phosphorylation site in human Hsp90beta. This phosphorylation
      site seems to be linked to vertebrate evolution since it is not found in
      invertebrata but in all tetrapoda and many but not all fish species. We provide
      data suggesting that this phosphorylation is important for the activation of
      Hsp90 clients like glucocorticoid receptor and a protein kinase. Replacement of
      the phosphorylation site by glutamate affects the conformational dynamics of
      Hsp90 and interaction with the kinase-specific cochaperone Cdc37.

AB  - The past decade has seen a remarkable surge in structural characterization of ATP
      binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which have spurred a more focused functional
      analysis of these elaborate molecular machines. As a result, it has become
      increasingly apparent that there is a substantial degree of mechanistic variation
      between ABC transporters that function as importers, which correlates with their 
      physiological roles. Here, we summarize recent advances in ABC importers'
      structure-function studies and provide an explanation as to the origin of the
      different mechanisms of action.

AB  - A number of microtubule (MT)-stabilizing agents (MSAs) have demonstrated or
      predicted potential as anticancer agents, but a detailed structural basis for
      their mechanism of action is still lacking. We have obtained high-resolution
      (3.9-4.2A) cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of MTs stabilized
      by the taxane-site binders Taxol and zampanolide, and by peloruside, which
      targets a distinct, non-taxoid pocket on beta-tubulin. We find that each molecule
      has unique distinct structural effects on the MT lattice structure. Peloruside
      acts primarily at lateral contacts and has an effect on the "seam" of
      heterologous interactions, enforcing a conformation more similar to that of
      homologous (i.e., non-seam) contacts by which it regularizes the MT lattice. In
      contrast, binding of either Taxol or zampanolide induces MT heterogeneity. In
      doubly bound MTs, peloruside overrides the heterogeneity induced by Taxol
      binding. Our structural analysis illustrates distinct mechanisms of these drugs
      for stabilizing the MT lattice and is of relevance to the possible use of
      combinations of MSAs to regulate MT activity and improve therapeutic potential.

AB  - Ion pumps are integral membrane proteins responsible for transporting ions
      against concentration gradients across biological membranes. Sarco/endoplasmic
      reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), a member of the P-type ATPases family,
      transports two calcium ions per hydrolyzed ATP molecule via an
      "alternating-access" mechanism. High-resolution crystallographic structures
      provide invaluable insight on the structural mechanism of the ion pumping
      process. However, to understand the molecular details of how ATP hydrolysis is
      coupled to calcium transport, it is necessary to gain knowledge about the
      conformational transition pathways connecting the crystallographically resolved
      conformations. Large-scale transitions in SERCA occur at time-scales beyond the
      current reach of unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we overcome this 
      challenge by employing the string method, which represents a transition pathway
      as a chainofstates linking two conformational endpoints. Using a multiscale
      methodology, we have determined all-atom transition pathways for three main
      conformational transitions responsible for the alternating-access mechanism. The 
      present pathways provide a clear chronology and ordering of the key events
      underlying the active transport of calcium ions by SERCA. Important conclusions
      are that the conformational transition that leads to occlusion with bound ATP and
      calcium is highly concerted and cooperative, the phosphorylation of Asp351 causes
      areorganization of the cytoplasmic domains that subsequently drives the opening
      of the luminal gate, and thereclosing of luminal gate induces a shift in the
      cytoplasmic domains that subsequently enables the dephosphorylation of Asp351-P. 
      Formation of transient residue-residue contacts along the conformational
      transitions predicted by the computations provide an experimental route to test
      the general validity of the computational pathways.

TI  - SAXS Structural Studies of Dps from Deinococcus radiodurans Highlights the
      Conformation of the Mobile N-Terminal Extensions.

AB  - The radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans contains two
      DNA-binding proteins from starved cells (Dps): Dps1 (DR2263) and Dps2 (DRB0092). 
      These are suggested to play a role in DNA interaction and manganese and iron
      storage. The proteins assemble as a conserved dodecameric structure with
      structurally uncharacterised N-terminal extensions. In the case of DrDps1, these 
      extensions have been proposed to be involved in DNA interactions, while in
      DrDps2, their function has yet to be established. The reported data reveal the
      relative position of the N-terminal extensions to the dodecameric sphere in
      solution for both Dps. The low-resolution small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
      results show that the N-terminal extensions protrude from the spherical shell of 
      both proteins. The SAXS envelope of a truncated form of DrDps1 without the
      N-terminal extensions appears as a dodecameric sphere, contrasting strongly with 
      the protrusions observed in the full-length models. The effect of iron
      incorporation into DrDps2 was investigated by static and stopped-flow SAXS
      measurements, revealing dynamic structural changes upon iron binding and core
      formation, as reflected by a quick alteration of its radius of gyration. The
      truncated and full-length versions of DrDps were also compared on the basis of
      their interaction with DNA to analyse functional roles of the N-terminal
      extensions. DrDps1 N-terminal protrusions appear to be directly involved with
      DNA, whilst those from DrDps2 are indirectly associated with DNA binding.
      Furthermore, detection of DrDps2 in the D. radiodurans membrane fraction suggests
      that the N-terminus of the protein interacts with the membrane.

AB  - Mammalian hosts interface intimately with commensal and pathogenic bacteria. It
      is increasingly clear that molecular interactions between the nervous system and 
      microbes contribute to health and disease. Both commensal and pathogenic bacteria
      are capable of producing molecules that act on neurons and affect essential
      aspects of host physiology. Here we highlight several classes of physiologically 
      important molecular interactions that occur between bacteria and the nervous
      system. First, clostridial neurotoxins block neurotransmission to or from neurons
      by targeting the SNARE complex, causing the characteristic paralyses of botulism 
      and tetanus during bacterial infection. Second, peripheral sensory
      neurons-olfactory chemosensory neurons and nociceptor sensory neurons-detect
      bacterial toxins, formyl peptides, and lipopolysaccharides through distinct
      molecular mechanisms to elicit smell and pain. Bacteria also damage the central
      nervous system through toxins that target the brain during infection. Finally,
      the gut microbiota produces molecules that act on enteric neurons to influence
      gastrointestinal motility, and metabolites that stimulate the "gut-brain axis" to
      alter neural circuits, autonomic function, and higher-order brain function and
      behavior. Furthering the mechanistic and molecular understanding of how bacteria 
      affect the nervous system may uncover potential strategies for modulating neural 
      function and treating neurological diseases.

AB  - In response to intracellular stress events ranging from starvation to pathogen
      invasion, the cell activates one or more forms of macroautophagy. The key event
      in these related pathways is the de novo formation of a new organelle called the 
      autophagosome, which either surrounds and sequesters random portions of the
      cytoplasm or selectively targets individual intracellular challenges. Thus, the
      autophagosome is a flexible membrane platform with dimensions that ultimately
      depend upon the target cargo. The intermediate membrane, termed the phagophore or
      isolation membrane, is a cup-like structure with a clear concave face and a
      highly curved rim. The phagophore is largely devoid of integral membrane
      proteins; thus, its shape and size are governed by peripherally associated
      membrane proteins and possibly by the lipid composition of the membrane itself.
      Growth along the phagophore rim marks the progress of both organelle expansion
      and ultimately organelle closure around a particular cargo. These two properties,
      a reliance on peripheral membrane proteins and a structurally distinct membrane
      architecture, suggest that the ability to target or manipulate membrane curvature
      might be an essential activity of proteins functioning in this pathway. In this
      review, we discuss the extent to which membranes are naturally curved at each of 
      the cellular sites believed to engage in autophagosome formation, review basic
      mechanisms used to sense this curvature, and then summarize the existing
      literature concerning which autophagy proteins are capable of curvature
      recognition.

AB  - Macroautophagy, or simply autophagy, is a degradative pathway that delivers
      cytoplasmic components, including cytosol and organelles, to the lysosome in
      double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. This process is initiated at the 
      pre-autophagosomal structure or phagophore assembly site and involves a number of
      highly conserved autophagy-related proteins. These support the generation and
      conversion of an open membranous cistern known as the phagophore or isolation
      membrane into a closed autophagosome. Within this review, we will focus on recent
      insights into the molecular events following the sealing/completion of an
      autophagosome, which lead to its maturation and subsequent fusion with
      endosomes/lysosomes.

AB  - Macroautophagy is a degradation process in which autophagosomes are generated to 
      isolate and transport various materials, including damaged organelles and protein
      aggregates, as cargos to the lysosomes or vacuoles. Bulk autophagy is one of the 
      two types of macroautophagy, which is triggered by starvation and targets
      non-specific cargos. The second type, that is, selective autophagy, identifies
      and preferentially degrades specific cargos via receptor recognition.
      Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) is a selective autophagy pathway that
      specifically transports vacuolar hydrolases into the vacuole in budding yeast
      cells and has been extensively studied as a model of selective autophagy. In the 
      present review, we focused on the Cvt pathway, especially on the recent
      structural insights into cargo assembly, receptor recognition, and recruitment
      mechanisms of the Cvt machinery. Elucidating the Cvt pathway would help in
      understanding the basic molecular mechanisms of various types of selective
      autophagy.

AB  - Target residence time (tau) has been suggested to be a better predictor of the
      biological activity of kinase inhibitors than inhibitory potency (IC50) in enzyme
      assays. Surface plasmon resonance binding assays for 46 human protein and lipid
      kinases were developed. The association and dissociation constants of 80 kinase
      inhibitor interactions were determined. tau and equilibrium affinity constants
      (KD) were calculated to determine kinetic selectivity. Comparison of tau and KD
      or IC50 values revealed a strikingly different view on the selectivity of several
      kinase inhibitors, including the multi-kinase inhibitor ponatinib, which was
      tested on 10 different kinases. In addition, known pan-Aurora inhibitors resided 
      much longer on Aurora B than on Aurora A, despite having comparable affinity for 
      Aurora A and B. Furthermore, the gamma/delta-selective PI3K inhibitor duvelisib
      and the delta-selective drug idelalisib had similar 20-fold selectivity for
      delta- over gamma-isoform but duvelisib resided much longer on both targets.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel gasotransmitter, is endogenously synthesized by
      multiple enzymes that are differentially expressed in the peripheral tissues and 
      central nervous systems. H2S regulates a wide range of physiological processes,
      namely cardiovascular, neuronal, immune, respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver,
      and endocrine systems, by influencing cellular signaling pathways and
      sulfhydration of target proteins. This review focuses on the recent progress made
      in H2S signaling that affects mechanistic and functional aspects of several
      biological processes such as autophagy, inflammation, proliferation and
      differentiation of stem cell, cell survival/death, and cellular metabolism under 
      both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, we highlighted the
      cross-talk between nitric oxide and H2S in several bilogical contexts.

AB  - Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process carried out by a
      double-membrane organelle, termed the autophagosome, which sequesters cytoplasmic
      material destined for lysosomal degradation and recycling. Autophagy and
      autophagosome biogenesis are highly conserved processes in eukaryotes and are
      essential for cell survival, stress responses, and homeostasis. Autophagosomes
      are dynamic and complex organelles that can originate from several different
      membrane compartments. Autophagosomes traffic through the cell to fuse with
      lysosomes or other compartments. Despite identification of key proteins necessary
      for autophagosome assembly and transport, such as those encoded by the
      autophagy-related genes, the relationship and interdependence of the
      autophagosome with other intracellular endo-membranes, including those of
      organelles involved in exocytosis and endocytic trafficking pathways, are still
      poorly understood. Here we discuss formation of autophagosomes, the journey of
      these organelles through the cell, and their close interplay with other mammalian
      organelles from points of view of signalization platforms and membrane dynamics.

AB  - Autophagy is a cellular degradation process integral for promoting cellular
      adaptation during metabolic stress while also functioning as a cellular
      homeostatic mechanism. Mounting evidence also demonstrates that autophagy is
      induced upon loss of integrin-mediated cell attachments to the surrounding
      extracellular matrix (ECM). Analogous to its established cytoprotective role
      during nutrient starvation, autophagy protects cells from detachment-induced cell
      death, termed anoikis. Here, we review the significance of autophagy as an
      anoikis resistance pathway, focusing on the intracellular signals associated with
      integrins that modulate the autophagy response and dictate the balance between
      cell death and survival following loss of cell-matrix contact. In addition, we
      highlight recent studies demonstrating that autophagy functions in the upstream
      regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion via the control of focal adhesion
      remodeling, and discuss how these emerging interconnections between
      integrin-mediated adhesion pathways and autophagy influence cancer progression
      and metastasis.

AB  - Macroautophagy and the autophagy-related gene (Atg) machinery execute during
      their canonical function cytoplasmic constituent degradation in lysosomes. This
      canonical function contributes to pathogen restriction and intracellular antigen 
      presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules to
      CD4(+) T cells. However, in the recent years, it has become clear that the Atg
      machinery is also used for other membrane transport functions, including
      endocytosis and exocytosis. This review describes these non-canonical functions
      in the context of antigen presentation on MHC class I and II molecules to CD8(+) 
      and CD4(+) T cells, respectively, and during viral replication. Future studies
      will need to address how the Atg machinery is modified for these non-canonical
      functions, gets recruited to the respective sites of membrane modification, and
      recruits alternative Atg interactors to execute endo- and exocytosis instead of
      macroautophagy.

      prognoses. Here, we design genetically encoded antibody-like ligands
      (intrabodies) that recognize active, GTP-bound K- and H-Ras. These ligands, which
      use the 10th domain of human fibronectin as their scaffold, are stable inside the
      cells and when fused with a fluorescent protein label, the constitutively active 
      G12V mutant H-Ras. Primary selection of ligands against Ras with mRNA display
      resulted in an intrabody (termed RasIn1) that binds with a KD of 2.1muM to
      H-Ras(G12V) (GTP), excellent state selectivity, and remarkable specificity for K-
      and H-Ras. RasIn1 recognizes residues in the Switch I region of Ras, similar to
      Raf-RBD, and competes with Raf-RBD for binding. An affinity maturation selection 
      based on RasIn1 resulted in RasIn2, which binds with a KD of 120nM and also
      retains excellent state selectivity. Both of these intrabodies colocalize with
      H-Ras, K-Ras, and G12V mutants inside the cells, providing new potential tools to
      monitor and modulate Ras-mediated signaling. Finally, RasIn1 and Rasin2 both
      display selectivity for the G12V mutants as compared with wild-type Ras providing
      a potential route for mutant selective recognition of Ras.

AB  - Comparing the gene-expression profiles between biological conditions is useful
      for understanding gene regulation underlying complex phenotypes. Along this line,
      analysis of differential co-expression (DC) has gained attention in the recent
      years, where genes under one condition have different co-expression patterns
      compared with another. We developed an R package Bayes Factor approach for
      Differential Co-expression Analysis (BFDCA) for DC analysis. BFDCA is unique in
      integrating various aspects of DC patterns (including Shift, Cross, and
      Re-wiring) into one uniform Bayes factor. We tested BFDCA using simulation data
      and experimental data. Simulation results indicate that BFDCA outperforms
      existing methods in accuracy and robustness of detecting DC pairs and DC modules.
      Results of using experimental data suggest that BFDCA can cluster disease-related
      genes into functional DC subunits and estimate the regulatory impact of
      disease-related genes well. BFDCA also achieves high accuracy in predicting
      case-control phenotypes by using significant DC gene pairs as markers. BFDCA is
      publicly available at http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/jdz4vtvnm3.1.

AB  - Interactions between proteins and their ligands, such as small molecules, other
      proteins, and DNA, depend on specific interatomic interactions that can be
      classified on the basis of atom type and distance and angle constraints.
      Visualisation of these interactions provides insights into the nature of
      molecular recognition events and has practical uses in guiding drug design and
      understanding the structural and functional impacts of mutations. We present
      Arpeggio, a web server for calculating interactions within and between proteins
      and protein, DNA, or small-molecule ligands, including van der Waals', ionic,
      carbonyl, metal, hydrophobic, and halogen bond contacts, and hydrogen bonds and
      specific atom-aromatic ring (cation-pi, donor-pi, halogen-pi, and carbon-pi) and 
      aromatic ring-aromatic ring (pi-pi) interactions, within user-submitted
      macromolecule structures. PyMOL session files can be downloaded, allowing
      high-quality publication images of the interactions to be generated. Arpeggio is 
      implemented in Python and available as a user-friendly web interface at
      http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/arpeggio/ and as a downloadable package at
      https://bitbucket.org/harryjubb/arpeggio.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial in many biological processes. The
      first step towards the molecular characterisation of PPIs implies the charting of
      their interfaces, that is, the surfaces mediating the interaction. To this end,
      we present here iFrag, a sequence-based computational method that infers possible
      interacting regions between two proteins by searching minimal common sequence
      fragments of the interacting protein pairs. By utilising the sequences of two
      interacting proteins (queries), iFrag derives a two-dimensional matrix computing 
      a score for each pair of residues that relates to the presence of similar regions
      in interolog protein pairs. The scoring matrix is represented as a heat map
      reflecting the potential interface regions in both query proteins. Unlike
      existing approaches, iFrag does not require three-dimensional structural
      information or multiple sequence alignments and can even predict small
      interaction sites consisting only of few residues. Thus, predicted interfaces
      range from short fragments composed of few residues to domains of proteins,
      depending on available information on PPIs, as we demonstrate in several
      examples. Moreover, as a proof of concept, we include the experimental validation
      on the successful prediction of a peptide competing with the aggregation of
      beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. iFrag is freely accessible at
      http://sbi.imim.es/iFrag.

AB  - Structure determination of complex molecular machines requires a combination of
      an increasing number of experimental methods with highly specialized software
      geared toward each data source to properly handle the gathered data. Recently, we
      introduced the two software packages PowerFit and DisVis. These combine
      high-resolution structures of atomic subunits with density maps from
      cryo-electron microscopy or distance restraints, typically acquired by chemical
      cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry, respectively. Here, we report on
      recent advances in both GPGPU-accelerated software packages: PowerFit is a tool
      for rigid body fitting of atomic structures in cryo-electron density maps and has
      been updated to also output reliability indicators for the success of fitting,
      through the use of the Fisher z-transformation and associated confidence
      intervals; DisVis aims at quantifying the information content of distance
      restraints and identifying false-positive restraints. We extended its analysis
      capabilities to include an analysis of putative interface residues and to output 
      an average shape representing the putative location of the ligand. To facilitate 
      their use by a broad community, they have been implemented as web portals
      harvesting both local CPU resources and GPGPU-accelerated EGI grid resources.
      They offer user-friendly interfaces, while minimizing computational requirements,
      and provide a first interactive view of the results. The portals can be accessed 
      freely after registration via http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS and
      http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/POWERFIT.

AB  - Large-scale genome sequencing holds great promise for the interpretation of
      protein structures through the discovery of many, rare functional variants in the
      human population. However, because protein-coding regions are under high
      selective constraints, these variants occur at low frequencies, such that there
      is often insufficient statistics for downstream calculations. To address this
      problem, we develop the Intensification approach, which uses the modular
      structure of repeat protein domains to amplify signals of selection from
      population genetics and traditional interspecies conservation. In particular, we 
      are able to aggregate variants at the codon level to identify important positions
      in repeat domains that show strong conservation signals. This allows us to
      compare conservation over different evolutionary timescales. It also enables us
      to visualize population-genetic measures on protein structures. We make available
      the Intensification results as an online resource
      (http://intensification.gersteinlab.org) and illustrate the approach through a
      case study on the tetratricopeptide repeat.

AB  - SCOPe (Structural Classification of Proteins-extended, http://scop.berkeley.edu) 
      is a database of relationships between protein structures that extends the
      Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database. SCOP is an expert-curated 
      ordering of domains from the majority of proteins of known structure in a
      hierarchy according to structural and evolutionary relationships. SCOPe
      classifies the majority of protein structures released since SCOP development
      concluded in 2009, using a combination of manual curation and highly precise
      automated tools, aiming to have the same accuracy as fully hand-curated SCOP
      releases. SCOPe also incorporates and updates the ASTRAL compendium, which
      provides several databases and tools to aid in the analysis of the sequences and 
      structures of proteins classified in SCOPe. SCOPe continues high-quality manual
      classification of new superfamilies, a key feature of SCOP. Artifacts such as
      expression tags are now separated into their own class, in order to distinguish
      them from the homology-based annotations in the remainder of the SCOPe hierarchy.
      SCOPe 2.06 contains 77,439 Protein Data Bank entries, double the 38,221
      structures classified in SCOP.

AB  - Understanding how gene-level mutations affect the binding affinity of
      protein-protein interactions is a key issue of protein engineering. Due to the
      complexity of the problem, using physical force field to predict the
      mutation-induced binding free-energy change remains challenging. In this work, we
      present a renewed approach to calculate the impact of gene mutations on the
      binding affinity through the structure-based profiling of protein-protein
      interfaces, where the binding free-energy change (DeltaDeltaG) is counted as the 
      logarithm of relative probability of mutant amino acids over wild-type ones in
      the interface alignment matrix; three pseudo-counts are introduced to alleviate
      the limit of the current interface library. Compared with a previous profile
      score that was based on the log-odds likelihood calculation, the correlation
      between predicted and experimental DeltaDeltaG of single-site mutations is
      increased in this approach from 0.33 to 0.68. The structure-based profile score
      is found complementary to the physical potentials, where a linear combination of 
      the profile score with the FoldX potential could increase the DeltaDeltaG
      correlation from 0.46 to 0.74. It is also shown that the profile score is robust 
      for counting the coupling effect of multiple individual mutations. For the
      mutations involving more than two mutation sites where the correlation between
      FoldX and experimental data vanishes, the profile-based calculation retains a
      strong correlation with the experimental measurements.

AB  - SimGen is a stand-alone computer program that reads a script of commands to
      represent complex macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, in a
      structural hierarchy that can then be viewed using an integral graphical viewer
      or animated through a high-level application programming interface in C++.
      Structural levels in the hierarchy range from alpha-carbon or phosphate backbones
      through secondary structure to domains, molecules, and multimers with each level 
      represented in an identical data structure that can be manipulated using the
      application programming interface. Unlike most coarse-grained simulation
      approaches, the higher-level objects represented in SimGen can be soft, allowing 
      the lower-level objects that they contain to interact directly. The default
      motion simulated by SimGen is a Brownian-like diffusion that can be set to occur 
      across all levels of representation in the hierarchy. Links can also be defined
      between objects, which, when combined with large high-level random movements,
      result in an effective search strategy for constraint satisfaction, including
      structure prediction from predicted pairwise distances. The implementation of
      SimGen makes use of the hierarchic data structure to avoid unnecessary
      calculation, especially for collision detection, allowing it to be simultaneously
      run and viewed on a laptop computer while simulating large systems of over 20,000
      objects. It has been used previously to model complex molecular interactions
      including the motion of a myosin-V dimer "walking" on an actin fibre, RNA
      stem-loop packing, and the simulation of cell motion and aggregation. Several
      extensions to this original functionality are described.

AB  - The studies of biological, disease, and pharmacological networks are facilitated 
      by the systems-level investigations using computational tools. In particular, the
      network descriptors developed in other disciplines have found increasing
      applications in the study of the protein, gene regulatory, metabolic, disease,
      and drug-targeted networks. Facilities are provided by the public web servers for
      computing network descriptors, but many descriptors are not covered, including
      those used or useful for biological studies. We upgraded the PROFEAT web server
      http://bidd2.nus.edu.sg/cgi-bin/profeat2016/main.cgi for computing up to 329
      network descriptors and protein-protein interaction descriptors. PROFEAT network 
      descriptors comprehensively describe the topological and connectivity
      characteristics of unweighted (uniform binding constants and molecular levels),
      edge-weighted (varying binding constants), node-weighted (varying molecular
      levels), edge-node-weighted (varying binding constants and molecular levels), and
      directed (oriented processes) networks. The usefulness of the network descriptors
      is illustrated by the literature-reported studies of the biological networks
      derived from the genome, interactome, transcriptome, metabolome, and diseasome
      profiles.

AB  - ClusPro-DC (https://cluspro.bu.edu/) implements a straightforward approach to the
      discrimination between crystallographic and biological dimers by docking the two 
      subunits to exhaustively sample the interaction energy landscape. If a
      substantial number of low energy docked poses cluster in a narrow vicinity of the
      native structure of the dimer, then one can assume that there is a well-defined
      free energy well around the native state, which makes the interaction stable. In 
      contrast, if the interaction sites in the docked poses do not form a large enough
      cluster around the native structure, then it is unlikely that the subunits form a
      stable biological dimer. The number of near-native structures is used to estimate
      the probability of a dimer being biological. Currently, the server examines only 
      the stability of a given interface rather than generating all putative quaternary
      structures as accomplished by PISA or EPPIC, but it complements the information
      provided by these methods.

AB  - TMDOCK is a novel computational method for the modeling of parallel homodimers
      formed by transmembrane (TM) alpha-helices. Three-dimensional (3D) models of
      dimers are generated by threading a target amino acid sequence through several
      structural templates, followed by local energy minimization. This is the first
      method that identifies helix dimerization modes and ranks them based on the
      calculated free energy of alpha-helix association. Free energy components include
      van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, and dipole interactions; side-chain
      conformational entropy; and solvation energy in the anisotropic lipid
      environment. TMDOCK reproduced 26 experimental dimeric structures formed by TM
      alpha-helices of 21 single-pass membrane proteins (including 4 mutants) with
      Calpha atom rmsd from 1.0 to 3.3A. Assessment of dimerization heterogeneity of
      these TM domains demonstrated that 7 of them have a unique dimer structure, 12
      have at least 2 alternative conformations, and 2 have a large number of different
      association modes. All unique experimental structures of proteins from the first 
      group and eight structures from the second group were reproduced in computations 
      as top-ranked models. A fast version of the method is available through the web
      server (http://membranome.org/tm_server.php).

AB  - abYsis is a web-based antibody research system that includes an integrated
      database of antibody sequence and structure data. The system can be interrogated 
      in numerous ways-from simple text and sequence searches to sophisticated queries 
      that apply 3D structural constraints. The publicly available version includes
      pre-analyzed sequence data from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
      European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-ENA) and Kabat as well as structure data from
      the Protein Data Bank. A researcher's own sequences can also be analyzed through 
      the web interface. A defining characteristic of abYsis is that the sequences are 
      automatically numbered with a series of popular schemes such as Kabat and Chothia
      and then annotated with key information such as complementarity-determining
      regions and potential post-translational modifications. A unique aspect of abYsis
      is a set of residue frequency tables for each position in an antibody, allowing
      "unusual residues" (those rarely seen at a particular position) to be highlighted
      and decisions to be made on which mutations may be acceptable. This is especially
      useful when comparing antibodies from different species. abYsis is useful for any
      researcher specializing in antibody engineering, especially those developing
      antibodies as drugs. abYsis is available at www.abysis.org.

      Stability.

AB  - MAF1 is a conserved negative regulator of RNA polymerase (pol) III and
      intracellular lipid homeostasis across species. Here, we show that the MAF1 C-box
      region negatively regulates its activity. Mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans
      mafr-1 that truncate the C-box retain the ability to inhibit the transcription of
      RNA pol III targets, reduce lipid biogenesis, and lower reproductive output. In
      human cells, C-box deletion of MAF1 leads to increased MAF1 nuclear localization 
      and enhanced repression of ACC1 and FASN, but with impaired repression of RNA pol
      III targets. Surprisingly, C-box mutations render MAF1 insensitive to rapamycin, 
      further defining a regulatory role for this region. Two MAF1 species, MAF1L and
      MAF1S, are regulated by the C-box YSY motif, which, when mutated, alters species 
      stoichiometry and proteasome-dependent turnover of nuclear MAF1. Our results
      reveal a role for the C-box region as a critical determinant of MAF1 stability,
      activity, and response to cellular stress.

AB  - Candidates for the toxic molecular species in the expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      repeat diseases range from various types of aggregates to "misfolded" monomers.
      One way to vet these candidates is to develop mutants that restrict
      conformational landscapes. Previously, we inserted two self-complementary
      beta-hairpin enhancing motifs into a short polyQ sequence to generate a mutant,
      here called "betaHP," that exhibits greatly improved amyloid nucleation without
      measurably enhancing beta-structure in the monomer ensemble. We extend these
      studies here by introducing single-backbone H-bond impairing modifications
      (alpha)N-methyl Gln or l-Pro at key positions within betaHP. Modifications
      predicted to allow formation of a fully H-bonded beta-hairpin at the fibril edge 
      while interfering with H-bonding to the next incoming monomer exhibit poor
      amyloid formation and act as potent inhibitors in trans of simple polyQ peptide
      aggregation. In contrast, a modification that disrupts intra-beta-hairpin
      H-bonding within betaHP, while also aggregating poorly, is ineffective at
      inhibiting amyloid formation in trans. The inhibitors constitute a dynamic
      version of the edge-protection negative design strategy used in protein evolution
      to limit unwanted protein aggregation. Our data support a model in which polyQ
      peptides containing strong beta-hairpin encouraging motifs only rarely form
      beta-hairpin conformations in the monomer ensemble, but nonetheless take on such 
      conformations at key steps during amyloid formation. The results provide insights
      into polyQ solution structure and fibril formation while also suggesting an
      approach to the design of inhibitors of polyQ amyloid growth that focuses on
      conformational requirements for fibril and nucleus elongation.

AB  - Regulatory ATPase variant A (RavA) is a MoxR AAA+ protein that functions together
      with a partner protein that we termed VWA interacting with AAA+ ATPase (ViaA)
      containing a von Willebrand Factor A domain. However, the functional role of
      RavA-ViaA in the cell is not yet well established. Here, we show that RavA-ViaA
      are functionally associated with anaerobic respiration in Escherichia coli
      through interactions with the fumarate reductase (Frd) electron transport
      complex. Expression analysis of ravA and viaA genes showed that both proteins are
      co-expressed with multiple anaerobic respiratory genes, many of which are
      regulated by the anaerobic transcriptional regulator Fnr. Consistently, the
      expression of both ravA and viaA was found to be dependent on Fnr in cells grown 
      under oxygen-limiting condition. ViaA was found to physically interact with FrdA,
      the flavin-containing subunit of the Frd complex. Both RavA and the
      Fe-S-containing subunit of the Frd complex, FrdB, regulate this interaction.
      Importantly, Frd activity was observed to increase in the absence of RavA and
      ViaA. This indicates that RavA and ViaA modulate the activity of the Frd complex,
      signifying a potential regulatory chaperone-like function for RavA-ViaA during
      bacterial anaerobic respiration with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor.

TI  - Methylarginines within the RGG-Motif Region of hnRNP A1 Affect Its IRES
      Trans-Acting Factor Activity and Are Required for hnRNP A1 Stress Granule
      Localization and Formation.

AB  - Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is a stress
      granule-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a role in apoptosis and
      cellular stress recovery. HnRNP A1 is a major non-histone target of protein
      arginine methyltransferase 1, which asymmetrically dimethylates hnRNP A1 at
      several key arginine residues within its arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG)-motif
      region. Although arginine methylation is known to regulate general RNA binding of
      hnRNP A1 in vitro, the functional role of arginine methylation in hnRNP A1
      cytoplasmic activity is unknown. To test the impact of key methylarginine
      residues on hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic activity and stress granule association,
      cytoplasmically restricted Flag-tagged mutants of hnRNP A1 were generated in
      which key methylarginine residues within the RGG-motif region were changed to
      either lysine or alanine. Lysine substitution, which mimics unmethylated
      arginine, resulted in a 40% increase in internal ribosome entry site trans-acting
      factor (ITAF) activity and the protein readily associates with stress granules.
      Alanine substitution resulted in a loss of ITAF activity and reduced mRNA
      binding. The alanine mutant also displays reduced stress granule association and 
      suppresses stress granule formation. Our data suggest that arginine residues
      within the RGG-motif region are critical for hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic activities and 
      that endogenous asymmetric dimethylation of the RGG-motif region suppresses hnRNP
      A1 ITAF activity in cells. Our findings indicate that methylarginine residues
      within the RGG-motif region of hnRNP A1 are important for its cytoplasmic
      activities and that hypomethylation and/or mutation of the RGG-motif region may
      contribute to the role of hnRNP A1 in diseases such as cancer.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (TK)
      that-once activated upon ligand binding-leads to receptor dimerization,
      recruitment of protein complexes, and activation of multiple signaling cascades. 
      The EGFR is frequently overexpressed or mutated in various cancers leading to
      aberrant signaling and tumor growth. Hence, identification of interaction
      partners that bind to mutated EGFR can help identify novel targets for drug
      discovery. Here, we used a systematic approach to identify novel proteins that
      are involved in cancerous EGFR signaling. Using a combination of high-content
      imaging and a mammalian membrane two-hybrid protein-protein interaction method,
      we identified eight novel interaction partners of EGFR, of which half strongly
      interacted with oncogenic, hyperactive EGFR variants. One of these, transforming 
      acidic coiled-coil proteins (TACC) 3, stabilizes EGFR on the cell surface, which 
      results in an increase in downstream signaling via the mitogen-activated protein 
      kinase and AKT pathway. Depletion of TACC3 from cells using small hairpin RNA
      (shRNA) knockdown or small-molecule targeting reduced mitogenic signaling in
      non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that targeting TACC3 has
      potential as a new therapeutic approach for non-small cell lung cancer.

      Antibody Tralokinumab as Inhibition of Binding to IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2.

AB  - Interleukin (IL)-13 is a pleiotropic T helper type 2 cytokine frequently
      associated with asthma and atopic dermatitis. IL-13-mediated signalling is
      initiated by binding to IL-13Ralpha1, which then recruits IL-4Ralpha to form a
      heterodimeric receptor complex. IL-13 also binds to IL-13Ralpha2, considered as
      either a decoy or a key mediator of fibrosis. IL-13-neutralising antibodies act
      by preventing IL-13 binding to IL-13Ralpha1, IL-4Ralpha and/or IL-13Ralpha2.
      Tralokinumab (CAT-354) is an IL-13-neutralising human IgG4 monoclonal antibody
      that has shown clinical benefit in patients with asthma. To decipher how
      tralokinumab inhibits the effects of IL-13, we determined the structure of
      tralokinumab Fab in complex with human IL-13 to 2 A resolution. The structure
      analysis reveals that tralokinumab prevents IL-13 from binding to both
      IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2. This is supported by biochemical ligand-receptor
      interaction assay data. The tralokinumab epitope is mainly composed of residues
      in helices D and A of IL-13. It is mostly light chain complementarity-determining
      regions that are driving paratope interactions; the variable light
      complementarity-determining region 2 plays a key role by providing residue
      contacts for a network of hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge in the core of
      binding. The key residues within the paratope contributing to binding were
      identified as Asp50, Asp51, Ser30 and Lys31. This study demonstrates that
      tralokinumab prevents the IL-13 pharmacodynamic effect by binding to IL-13
      helices A and D, thus preventing IL-13 from interacting with IL-13Ralpha1 and
      IL-13Ralpha2.

AB  - The evolutionarily conserved Arp2/3 complex plays a central role in nucleating
      the branched actin filament arrays that drive cell migration, endocytosis, and
      other processes. To better understand Arp2/3 complex regulation, we used
      single-particle electron microscopy to compare the structures of Arp2/3 complex
      bound to three different inhibitory ligands: glia maturation factor (GMF),
      Coronin, and Arpin. Although the three inhibitors have distinct binding sites on 
      Arp2/3 complex, they each induced an "open" nucleation-inactive conformation.
      Coronin promoted a standard (previously described) open conformation of Arp2/3
      complex, with the N-terminal beta-propeller domain of Coronin positioned near the
      p35/ARPC2 subunit of Arp2/3 complex. GMF induced two distinct open conformations 
      of Arp2/3 complex, which correlated with the two suggested binding sites for GMF.
      Furthermore, GMF synergized with Coronin in inhibiting actin nucleation by Arp2/3
      complex. Arpin, which uses VCA-related acidic (A) motifs to interact with the
      Arp2/3 complex, induced the standard open conformation, and two new masses
      appeared at positions near Arp2 and Arp3. Furthermore, Arpin showed additive
      inhibitory effects on Arp2/3 complex with Coronin and GMF. Together, these data
      suggest that Arp2/3 complex conformation is highly polymorphic and that its
      activities can be controlled combinatorially by different inhibitory ligands.

TI  - Structures of the Karyopherins Kap121p and Kap60p Bound to the Nuclear
      Pore-Targeting Domain of the SUMO Protease Ulp1p.
PG  - 249-260
LID - S0022-2836(16)30524-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2016.11.029 [doi]
AB  - The budding yeast small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease Ulp1p catalyzes
      both the processing of newly synthesized SUMO to its mature form and the
      deconjugation of SUMO from target proteins, thereby regulating a wide range of
      cellular processes including cell division, DNA repair, DNA replication,
      transcription, and mRNA quality control. Ulp1p is localized primarily at the
      nuclear pore complex (NPC) through interactions involving the karyopherins
      Kap121p and Kap95p-Kap60p heterodimer and a subset of nuclear pore-associated
      proteins. The sequestration of Ulp1p at the nuclear periphery is crucial for the 
      proper control of protein desumoylation. To gain insights into the role of the
      karyopherins in regulating the localization of Ulp1p, we have determined the
      crystal structures of Kap121p and Kap60p bound to the N-terminal non-catalytic
      domain of Ulp1p that is necessary and sufficient for NPC targeting. Contrary to a
      previous proposal that Ulp1p is tethered to the transport channel of the NPC
      through unconventional interactions with the karyopherins, our structures reveal 
      that Ulp1p has canonical nuclear localization signals (NLSs): (1) an
      isoleucine-lysine-NLS (residues 51-55) that binds to the NLS-binding site of
      Kap121p, and (2) a classical bipartite NLS (residues 154-172) that binds to the
      major and minor NLS-binding sites of Kap60p. Ulp1p also binds Kap95p directly,
      and the Ulp1p-Kap95p binding is enhanced by the importin-beta-binding domain of
      Kap60p. GTP-bound Gsp1p (the yeast Ran ortholog) and the exportin Cse1p cooperate
      to release Ulp1p from the karyopherins, indicating that the stable sequestration 
      of Ulp1p to the NPC would require a karyopherin-independent mechanism to anchor
      Ulp1p at the NPC.

AB  - Characterizing the substrate specificity of protease enzymes is critical for
      illuminating the molecular basis of their diverse and complex roles in a wide
      array of biological processes. Rapid and accurate prediction of their extended
      substrate specificity would also aid in the design of custom proteases capable of
      selectively and controllably cleaving biotechnologically or therapeutically
      relevant targets. However, current in silico approaches for protease specificity 
      prediction, rely on, and are therefore limited by, machine learning of sequence
      patterns in known experimental data. Here, we describe a general approach for
      predicting peptidase substrates de novo using protein structure modeling and
      biophysical evaluation of enzyme-substrate complexes. We construct atomic
      resolution models of thousands of candidate substrate-enzyme complexes for each
      of five model proteases belonging to the four major protease mechanistic
      classes-serine, cysteine, aspartyl, and metallo-proteases-and develop a
      discriminatory scoring function using enzyme design modules from Rosetta and
      AMBER's MMPBSA. We rank putative substrates based on calculated interaction
      energy with a modeled near-attack conformation of the enzyme active site. We show
      that the energetic patterns obtained from these simulations can be used to
      robustly rank and classify known cleaved and uncleaved peptides and that these
      structural-energetic patterns have greater discriminatory power compared to
      purely sequence-based statistical inference. Combining sequence and energetic
      patterns using machine-learning algorithms further improves classification
      performance, and analysis of structural models provides physical insight into the
      structural basis for the observed specificities. We further tested the predictive
      capability of the model by designing and experimentally characterizing the
      cleavage of four novel substrate motifs for the hepatitis C virus NS3/4 protease 
      using an in vivo assay. The presented structure-based approach is generalizable
      to other protease enzymes with known or modeled structures, and complements
      existing experimental methods for specificity determination.

AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci and their 
      flanking CRISPR-associated (cas) genes make up RNA-guided, adaptive immune
      systems in prokaryotes whose effector proteins have become powerful tools for
      basic research and biotechnology. While the Cas effector proteins are remarkably 
      diverse, they commonly rely on protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) as the first
      step in target recognition. PAM sequences are known to vary considerably between 
      systems and have proven to be difficult to predict, spurring the need for new
      tools to rapidly identify and communicate these sequences. Recent advances have
      also shown that Cas proteins can be engineered to alter PAM recognition, opening 
      new opportunities to develop CRISPR-based tools with enhanced targeting
      capabilities. In this review, we discuss the properties of the CRISPR PAM and the
      emerging tools for determining, visualizing, and engineering PAM recognition. We 
      also propose a standard means of orienting the PAM to simplify how its location
      and sequence are communicated.

AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the primary bacterial species responsible
      for healthcare-associated infections. The most significant virulence factor for
      S. epidermidis is its ability to form a biofilm, which renders the bacteria
      highly resistant to host immune responses and antibiotic action. Intercellular
      adhesion within the biofilm is mediated by the accumulation-associated protein
      (Aap), a cell wall-anchored protein that self-assembles in a zinc-dependent
      manner. The C-terminal portion of Aap contains a 135-aa-long,
      proline/glycine-rich region (PGR) that has not yet been characterized. The region
      contains a set of 18 nearly identical AEPGKP repeats. Analysis of the PGR using
      biophysical techniques demonstrated the region is a highly extended,
      intrinsically disordered polypeptide with unusually high polyproline type II
      helix propensity. In contrast to many intrinsically disordered polypeptides,
      there was a minimal temperature dependence of the global conformational state of 
      PGR in solution as measured by analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light
      scattering. Furthermore, PGR was resistant to conformational collapse or
      alpha-helix formation upon the addition of the osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide or
      the cosolvent 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Collectively, these results suggest PGR
      functions as a resilient, extended stalk that projects the rest of Aap outward
      from the bacterial cell wall, promoting intercellular adhesion between cells in
      the biofilm. This work sheds light on regions of low complexity often found near 
      the attachment point of bacterial cell wall-anchored proteins.

AB  - The immune system of vertebrates confers protective mechanisms to the host
      through the sensing of stress-induced agents expressed during infection or cell
      stress. Among them, the first line of host defense composed of the innate immune 
      sensing of these agents by pattern recognition receptors enables downstream
      adaptive immunity to be primed, mediating the body's appropriate response to
      clear infection and tissue damage. Mitochondria are <<bacteria within>> that
      allowed the emergence of functional eukaryotic cells by positioning themselves as
      the cell powerhouse and an initiator of cell death programs. It is striking to
      consider that such ancestral bacteria, which had to evade host defense at some
      point to develop evolutionary endosymbiosis, have become instrumental for the
      modern eukaryotic cell in alerting the immune system against various insults
      including infection by other pathogens. Mitochondria have indeed become critical 
      regulators of innate immune responses to both pathogens and cell stress. They
      host numerous modulators, which play a direct role into the assembly of innate
      sensing machineries that trigger host immune response in both sterile and
      non-sterile conditions. Several lines of evidence indicate the existence of a
      complex molecular interplay between mechanisms involved in inflammation and
      metabolism. Mitochondrial function seems to participate in innate immunity at
      various stages as diverse as the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory
      cytokines and chemokines and their maturation by inflammasomes. Here, we review
      the mechanisms by which mitochondria orchestrate innate immune responses at
      different levels by promoting a cellular metabolic reprogramming and the
      cytosolic immune signaling cascades.

AB  - The multiprotein Mediator coactivator complex functions in large part by
      controlling the formation and function of the promoter-bound preinitiation
      complex (PIC), which consists of RNA polymerase II and general transcription
      factors. However, precisely how Mediator impacts the PIC, especially
      post-recruitment, has remained unclear. Here, we have studied Mediator effects on
      basal transcription in an in vitro transcription system reconstituted from
      purified components. Our results reveal a close functional interplay between
      Mediator and TFIIH in the early stages of PIC development. We find that under
      conditions when TFIIH is not normally required for transcription, Mediator
      actually represses transcription. TFIIH, whose recruitment to the PIC is known to
      be facilitated by the Mediator, then acts to relieve Mediator-induced repression 
      to generate an active form of the PIC. Gel mobility shift analyses of PICs and
      characterization of TFIIH preparations carrying mutant XPB translocase subunit
      further indicate that this relief of repression is achieved through expending
      energy via ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that it is coupled to TFIIH's established
      promoter melting activity. Our interpretation of these results is that Mediator
      functions as an assembly factor that facilitates PIC maturation through its
      various stages. Whereas the overall effect of the Mediator is to stimulate basal 
      transcription, its initial engagement with the PIC generates a transcriptionally 
      inert PIC intermediate, which necessitates energy expenditure to complete the
      process.

AB  - Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allows the high-resolution
      structural determination of biological assemblies in a near-native environment.
      However, all high-resolution (better than 3.5A) cryo-EM structures reported to
      date were obtained by using 300kV transmission electron microscopes (TEMs). We
      report here the structures of a cypovirus capsid of 750-A diameter at 3.3-A
      resolution and of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complexes within the capsid
      at 3.9-A resolution using a 200-kV TEM. The newly resolved structure revealed
      conformational changes of two subdomains in the RdRp. These conformational
      changes, which were involved in RdRp's switch from non-transcribing to
      transcribing mode, suggest that the RdRp may facilitate the unwinding of genomic 
      double-stranded RNA. The possibility of 3-A resolution structural determinations 
      for biological assemblies of relatively small sizes using cryo-EM at 200kV was
      discussed.

TI  - Multiple Conformations of Gal3 Protein Drive the Galactose-Induced Allosteric
      Activation of the GAL Genetic Switch of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

AB  - Gal3p is an allosteric monomeric protein that activates the GAL genetic switch of
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to galactose. Expression of constitutive
      mutant of Gal3p or overexpression of wild-type Gal3p activates the GAL switch in 
      the absence of galactose. These data suggest that Gal3p exists as an ensemble of 
      active and inactive conformations. Structural data have indicated that Gal3p
      exists in open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations. However, a mutant of
      Gal3p that predominantly exists in inactive conformation and is yet capable of
      responding to galactose has not been isolated. To understand the mechanism of
      allosteric transition, we have isolated a triple mutant of Gal3p with V273I,
      T404A, and N450D substitutions, which, upon overexpression, fails to activate the
      GAL switch on its own but activates the switch in response to galactose.
      Overexpression of Gal3p mutants with single or double mutations in any of the
      three combinations failed to exhibit the behavior of the triple mutant. Molecular
      dynamics analysis of the wild-type and the triple mutant along with two
      previously reported constitutive mutants suggests that the wild-type Gal3p may
      also exist in super-open conformation. Furthermore, our results suggest that the 
      dynamics of residue F237 situated in the hydrophobic pocket located in the hinge 
      region drives the transition between different conformations. Based on this
      study, we suggest that conformational selection mechanism is the driving force in
      the allosteric transition of Gal3p, which may have implications in other
      signaling pathways involving monomeric proteins.

AB  - The stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase complex-with its
      significant roles in hematopoiesis and angiogenesis-is an attractive target for
      rational drug design. There is thus a need to map, in detail, the SCF/c-Kit
      interaction sites and the mechanisms that modulate this interaction. While most
      residues in the direct SCF/c-Kit binding interface can be identified from the
      existing crystal structure of the complex, other residues that affect binding
      through protein unfolding, intermolecular interactions, allosteric or
      long-distance electrostatic effects cannot be directly inferred. Here, we
      describe an efficient method for protein-wide epitope mapping using yeast surface
      display. A library of single SCF mutants that span the SCF sequence was screened 
      for decreased affinity to soluble c-Kit. Sequencing of selected clones allowed
      the identification of mutations that reduce SCF binding affinity to c-Kit.
      Moreover, the screening of these SCF clones for binding to a structural antibody 
      helped identify mutations that result in small or large conformational changes in
      SCF. Computational modeling of the experimentally identified mutations showed
      that these mutations reduced the binding affinity through one of the three
      scenarios: through SCF destabilization, through elimination of favorable
      SCF/c-Kit intermolecular interactions, or through allosteric changes. Eight SCF
      variants were expressed and purified. Experimentally measured in vitro binding
      affinities of these mutants to c-Kit confirmed both the yeast surface display
      selection results and the computational predictions. This study has thus
      identified the residues crucial for c-Kit/SCF binding and has demonstrated the
      advantages of using a combination of computational and combinatorial methods for 
      epitope mapping.

AB  - The blood von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediates platelet adhesion to injured
      vessels by sequestering platelets from blood flow and depositing them to collagen
      and other exposed subendothelial matrix proteins. This process of capturing
      platelets to facilitate formation of platelet plugs occurs through transient
      interactions with platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha via the VWF A1 domain which also 
      binds collagen. Using a conformationally diverse collection of natively folded
      and mutation-induced misfolded von Willebrand disease (VWD) variants, we test a
      recently proposed affinity up-regulation hypothesis which states that collagen
      binding changes the conformation of the A1 domain to a high-affinity GPIbalpha
      binding competent state. With surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we present this
      diversified collection to collagen and quantify the kinetics of association and
      dissociation to ascertain the conformational selectivity of collagen. With
      analytical rheology, we quantify real-time platelet pause times and translocation
      velocities across a Cu(2+) HisTag-chelated and collagen-bound A1 single domain
      and A1A2A3 tridomain fragment of VWF under shear stress in an ex vivo shear flow 
      microfluidic chamber. In contrast to expected hypothetical outcomes, collagen has
      limited conformational selectivity for binding A1. A1-collagen binding is
      independent of gain- or loss-of-function phenotype and under shear stress,
      platelet translocation pause times on collagen-bound A1A2A3 are either normal or 
      shorter depending on whether A1 is concertedly bound with the A3 domain to
      collagen. With respect to A1, collagen has an inhibitory role that provides an
      explanation for the lack of thrombosis in patients with gain-of-function VWD.

AB  - We report the design, construction, and validation of a highly diverse
      phage-displayed naive ubiquitin variant (Ubv) library. We first conducted a
      mutation tolerance scan of 27 residues and confirmed that 24 of these could be
      substituted by chemically diverse amino acids without compromising the display of
      Ubvs on phage. Subsequently, we constructed a library containing 6.8x10(10)
      unique members, in which these 24 positions were diversified with a degenerate
      codon that encodes for 6 aa that are prevalent in protein interaction sites. To
      ensure the optimal structural stability of the Ubvs, we constructed the library
      in a two-step process, whereby 12 positions were randomized first, and following 
      the selection for displayed Ubvs, the resulting pool was further diversified at
      the other 12 positions. The resulting library was validated by conducting binding
      selections against a panel of 40 diverse protein antigens and was found to be as 
      functional as a highly validated synthetic antibody library, yielding binders
      against 30 of the antigens. Detailed characterization of an Ubv that bound to the
      cell-surface receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 revealed tight
      binding in the single-digit nanomolar range. Moreover, Ubvs that bound to two
      distinct sites on the intracellular adapter Grb2 could be combined to generate a 
      potent inhibitor that functioned in cells. These results validate ubiquitin as a 
      robust scaffold for the construction of naive libraries that can be used to
      generate Ubvs that target signaling networks both outside and inside the cells.

AB  - The human APOBEC3G (A3G) enzyme restricts HIV-1 in the absence of the viral
      accessory protein viral infectivity factor (Vif) by deaminating viral cDNA
      cytosines to uracils. These uracil lesions base-pair with adenines during the
      completion of reverse transcription and result in A3G signature G-to-A mutations 
      in the viral genome. Vif protects HIV-1 from A3G-mediated restriction by forming 
      an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to polyubiquitinate A3G and trigger its
      degradation. Prior studies indicated that Vif may also directly block the
      enzymatic activity of A3G and, provocatively, that Vif-derived peptides, Vif
      25-39 and Vif 105-119, are similarly inhibitory. Here, we show that Vif 25-39
      does not inhibit A3G enzymatic activity and that the inhibitory effect of Vif
      105-119 and that of a shorter derivative Vif 107-115, although recapitulated, are
      non-specific. We also elaborate a simple method for assaying DNA cytosine
      deaminase activity that eliminates potential polymerase chain reaction-induced
      biases. Our results show that these Vif-derived peptides are unlikely to be
      useful as tools to study A3G function or as leads for the development of future
      therapeutics.

AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a family of ATP-independent molecular
      chaperones that are important for binding and stabilizing unfolded proteins. In
      this task, the sHsps have been proposed to coordinate with ATP-dependent
      chaperones, including heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). However, it is not yet clear
      how these two important components of the chaperone network are linked. We report
      that the Hsp70 co-chaperone, BAG3, is a modular, scaffolding factor to bring
      together sHsps and Hsp70s. Using domain deletions and point mutations, we found
      that BAG3 uses both of its IPV motifs to interact with sHsps, including Hsp27
      (HspB1), alphaB-crystallin (HspB5), Hsp22 (HspB8), and Hsp20 (HspB6). BAG3 does
      not appear to be a passive scaffolding factor; rather, its binding promoted
      de-oligomerization of Hsp27, likely by competing for the self-interactions that
      normally stabilize large oligomers. BAG3 bound to Hsp70 at the same time as
      Hsp22, Hsp27, or alphaB-crystallin, suggesting that it might physically bring the
      chaperone families together into a complex. Indeed, addition of BAG3 coordinated 
      the ability of Hsp22 and Hsp70 to refold denatured luciferase in vitro. Together,
      these results suggest that BAG3 physically and functionally links Hsp70 and
      sHsps.

AB  - Cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) plays key transcriptional
      roles in cell metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Ser133 phosphorylation by 
      protein kinase A (PKA) is a well-characterized CREB activation mechanism.
      Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HIPK) 2, a nuclear serine/threonine
      kinase, activates CREB through Ser271 phosphorylation; however, the regulatory
      mechanism remains uncharacterized. Transfection of CREB in HEK293 cells together 
      with the kinase demonstrated that HIPK2 phosphorylated CREB at Ser271 but not
      Ser133; likewise, PKA phosphorylated CREB at Ser133 but not Ser271, suggesting
      two distinct CREB regulatory mechanisms by HIPK2 and PKA. In vitro kinase assay
      revealed that HIPK2, and HIPK1 and HIPK3, directly phosphorylated CREB. Cells
      exposed to 10muM sodium arsenite increased the stability of HIPK1 and HIPK2
      proteins, leading to CREB activation via Ser271 phosphorylation. Phospho-Ser271
      CREB showed facilitated interaction with the TFIID subunit coactivator TAF4
      assessed by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, a focused gene array between cells 
      transfected with CREB alone and CREB plus HIPK2 over empty vector-transfected
      control displayed 14- and 32-fold upregulation of cyclin A1, respectively, while 
      no upregulation was displayed by HIPK2 alone. These results suggest that the
      HIPK2-phospho-Ser271 CREB axis is a new arsenic-responsive CREB activation
      mechanism in parallel with the PKA-phospho-Ser133 CREB axis.

AB  - During the process of autophagy, the autophagy-related proteins are translocated 
      to autophagosome formation sites. Here, we demonstrate that S100A10 is required
      for ULK1 localization to autophagosome formation sites. Silencing of S100A10
      reduces IFN-gamma-induced autophagosome formation. We also determined the role of
      annexin A2 (ANXA2), a binding partner of S100A10, which has been reported to
      promote phagophore assembly. Silencing of ANXA2 reduced S100A10 expression.
      However, overexpression of S100A10 in ANXA2-silenced cells was still able to
      enhance autophagosome formation, suggesting that ANXA2 regulates
      IFN-gamma-induced autophagy through S100A10. We also observed that S100A10
      interacted with ULK1 after IFN-gamma stimulation, and S100A10 knockdown prevented
      ULK1 localization to autophagosome formation sites. Finally, the release of high 
      mobility group protein B1, one of the functions mediated by IFN-gamma-induced
      autophagy, was inhibited in S100A10 knockdown cells. These results elucidate the 
      importance of S100A10 in autophagosome formation and reveal the relationship
      between S100A10 and ULK1 in IFN-gamma-induced autophagy.

AB  - Regulation of eukaryotic transcription in vivo occurs at distinct stages.
      Previous research has identified many active or repressive transcription factors 
      (TFs) and core transcription components and studied their functions in vitro and 
      in vivo. Nonetheless, how individual TFs act in concert to regulate mRNA gene
      expression in a single cell remains poorly understood. Direct observation of TF
      assembly and disassembly and various biochemical reactions during transcription
      of a single-copy gene in vivo is the ideal approach to study this problem.
      Research in this area requires developing novel techniques for single-cell
      transcription imaging and integrating imaging studies into understanding the
      molecular biology of transcription. In the past decade, advanced cell imaging has
      enabled unprecedented capabilities to visualize individual TF molecules, to track
      single transcription sites, and to detect individual mRNA in fixed and living
      cells. These studies have raised several novel insights on transcriptional
      regulation such as the "hit-and-run" model and transcription bursting that could 
      not be obtained by in vitro biochemistry analysis. At this point, the key
      question is how to achieve deeper understandings or discover novel mechanisms of 
      eukaryotic transcriptional regulation by imaging transcription in single cells.
      Meanwhile, further technical advancements are likely required for visualizing
      distinct kinetic steps of transcription on a single-copy gene in vivo. This
      review article summarizes recent progress in the field and describes the
      challenges and opportunities ahead.

AB  - Oct4 is a transcription factor required for maintaining pluripotency and
      self-renewal in stem cells. Prior to differentiation, Oct4 must be silenced to
      allow for the development of the three germ layers in the developing embryo. This
      fine-tuning is controlled by the nuclear receptors (NRs), liver receptor
      homolog-1 (LRH-1) and germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF). Liver receptor homolog-1
      is responsible for driving the expression of Oct4 where GCNF represses its
      expression upon differentiation. Both receptors bind to a DR0 motif located
      within the Oct4 promoter. Here, we present the first structure of mouse GCNF
      DNA-binding domain in complex with the Oct4 DR0. The overall structure revealed
      two molecules bound in a head-to-tail fashion on opposite sides of the DNA.
      Additionally, we solved the structure of the human LRH-1 DNA-binding domain bound
      to the same element. We explore the structural elements that govern Oct4
      recognition by these two NRs.

AB  - Nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NaMNAT) is an indispensable
      enzyme for the synthesis of NAD and NAD phosphate. It catalyzes the adenylylation
      of nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) to yield nicotinic acid adenine
      dinucleotide (NaAD). Since NAD(H) and NAD phosphate(H) are essentially involved
      in metabolic and redox regulatory reactions, NaMNAT is an attractive drug target 
      in the fight against bacterial and parasitic infections. Notably, NaMNAT of the
      malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses only 20% sequence identity with 
      the homologous human enzyme. Here, we present for the first time the two X-ray
      structures of P. falciparum NaMNAT (PfNaMNAT)-in the product-bound state with
      NaAD and complexed with an alpha,beta-non-hydrolizable ATP analog-the structures 
      were determined to a resolution of 2.2A and 2.5A, respectively. The overall
      architecture of PfNaMNAT was found to be more similar to its bacterial homologs
      than its human counterparts although the PPHK motif conserved in bacteria is
      missing. Furthermore, PfNaMNAT possesses two cysteine residues within the active 
      site that have not been described for any other NaMNATase so far and are likely
      to be involved in redox regulation of PfNaMNAT activity. Enzymatic studies and
      surface plasmon resonance data reveal that PfNaMNAT is capable of utilizing NaMN 
      and nicotinamide mononucleotide with a slight preference for NaMN. Surprisingly, 
      a comparison with the active site of Escherichia coli NaMNAT showed very similar 
      architectures, despite different substrate preferences.

AB  - Endothelial cell (EC) barrier function plays a prevalent regulatory mechanism for
      the integrity and homeostasis of blood vessels and modulates angiogenesis and
      immune responses. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a central role in the
      barrier function of ECs. Although Ig-containing and proline-rich
      receptor-1(IGPR-1) was recently identified as a novel CAM expressed in ECs, the
      molecular mechanisms underlying the function of IGPR-1 in ECs remain
      uncharacterized. In this report, we investigated the role of IGPR-1 in EC barrier
      function and the molecular mechanism of its activation in ECs. We demonstrate
      that IGPR-1 is localized to endothelial adherens junctions and, through
      trans-homophilic dimerization, regulates endothelial cell-cell adhesion and
      barrier function. Trans-homophilic dimerization of IGPR-1 stimulates the
      phosphorylation of serine 220 (Ser220), which is required for IGPR-1 to regulate 
      endothelial barrier function and angiogenesis. Moreover, IGPR-1 chimera, which
      mimics the trans-homophilic dimerization of IGPR-1, induced a sustained
      phosphorylation of Ser220 upon stimulation with a ligand. Coordinated
      dimerization of IGPR-1 and its homophilic interaction modulates its adhesive
      function and Ser220 phosphorylation. This adhesive function of IGPR-1 contributes
      to the barrier function of ECs.

TI  - Structure of a PKA RIalpha Recurrent Acrodysostosis Mutant Explains Defective
      cAMP-Dependent Activation.

AB  - Most disease-related mutations that impair cAMP protein kinase A (PKA) signaling 
      are present within the regulatory (R) PKA RI alpha-subunit (RIalpha). Although
      mutations in the PRKAR1A gene are linked to Carney complex (CNC) disease and,
      more recently, to acrodysostosis-1 (ACRDYS1), the two diseases show contrasting
      phenotypes. While CNC mutations cause increased PKA activity, ACRDYS1 mutations
      result in decreased PKA activity and cAMP resistant holoenzymes. Mapping the
      ACRDYS1 disease mutations reveals their localization to the second of two tandem 
      cAMP-binding (CNB) domains (CNB-B), and here, we characterize a recurrent
      deletion mutant where the last 14 residues are missing. The crystal structure of 
      a monomeric form of this mutant (RIalpha92-365) bound to the catalytic
      (C)-subunit reveals the dysfunctional regions of the RIalpha subunit. Beyond the 
      missing residues, the entire capping motif is disordered (residues 357-379) and
      explains the disrupted cAMP binding. Moreover, the effects of the mutation extend
      far beyond the CNB-B domain and include the active site and N-lobe of the
      C-subunit, which is in a partially open conformation with the C-tail disordered. 
      A key residue that contributes to this crosstalk, D267, is altered in our
      structure, and we confirmed its functional importance by mutagenesis. In
      particular, the D267 interaction with Arg241, a residue shown earlier to be
      important for allosteric regulation, is disrupted, thereby strengthening the
      interaction of D267 with the C-subunit residue Arg194 at the R:C interface. We
      see here how the switch between active (cAMP-bound) and inactive (holoenzyme)
      conformations is perturbed and how the dynamically controlled crosstalk between
      the helical domains of the two CNB domains is necessary for the functional
      regulation of PKA activity.

AB  - RNA methylation is the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved chemical
      modification of bases or ribose in noncoding and coding RNAs. This rather simple 
      modification has nevertheless major consequences on the function of maturated RNA
      molecules and ultimately on their cellular fates. The methyl group employed in
      the methylation is almost universally derived from S-adenosyl-L-methionine via a 
      simple SN2 displacement reaction. However, in some rare cases, the carbon
      originates from N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2=THF). Here, a methylene
      group is transferred first and requires a subsequent reduction step (2e(-)+H(+)) 
      via the flavin adenine dinucleotide hydroquinone (FADH(-)) to form the final
      methylated derivative. This FAD/folate-dependent mode of chemical reaction,
      called reductive methylation, is thus far more complex than the usual simple
      S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent one. This reaction is catalyzed by
      flavoenzymes, now named TrmFO and RlmFO, which respectively modify transfer and
      ribosomal RNAs. In this review, we briefly recount how these new RNA
      methyltransferases were discovered and describe a novel aspect of the chemistry
      of flavins, wherein this versatile biological cofactor is not just a simple redox
      catalyst but is also a new methyl transfer agent acting via a critical
      CH2=(N5)FAD iminium intermediate. The enigmatic structural reorganization of
      these enzymes that needs to take place during catalysis in order to build their
      active center is also discussed. Finally, recent findings demonstrated that this 
      flavin-dependent mechanism is also employed by enzymatic systems involved in DNA 
      synthesis, suggesting that the use of this cofactor as a methylating agent of
      biomolecules could be far more usual than initially anticipated.

AB  - The heterodimeric transcription factor E2F1-DP1 plays crucial roles in
      coordinating gene expression during G1/S cell cycle progression. For
      transcriptional activation, the transactivation domain (TAD) of E2F1 is known to 
      interact with the TATA-binding protein of TFIID and the p62 subunit of TFIIH. It 
      is generally believed that DP1 facilitates E2F1 binding to target DNA and does
      not possess a TAD. Here, we show that an acidic region of DP1, whose function has
      remained elusive, binds to the plekstrin homology (PH) domain of p62 with higher 
      affinity than that of E2F1 and contributes to transcriptional activation. The
      structure of the complex revealed that DP1 forms a twisted U-shaped, string-like 
      conformation and binds to the surface of the PH domain by anchoring Phe403 into a
      pocket in the PH domain. The transcriptional activity of E2F1-DP1 was reduced
      when Phe403 of DP1 was mutated. These findings indicate that the acidic region of
      DP1 acts as a TAD by contacting TFIIH.

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae sir2Delta or top1Delta mutants exhibit similar
      phenotypes involving ribosomal DNA, including (i) loss of transcriptional
      silencing, resulting in non-coding RNA hyperproduction from cryptic RNA
      polymerase II promoters; (ii) alterations in recombination; and (iii) a general
      increase in histone acetylation. Given the distinct enzymatic activities of Sir2 
      and Top1 proteins, a histone deacetylase and a DNA topoisomerase, respectively,
      we investigated whether genetic and/or physical interactions between the two
      proteins could explain the shared ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) phenotypes. We
      employed an approach of complementing top1Delta cells with yeast, human,
      truncated, and chimeric yeast/human TOP1 constructs and of assessing the extent
      of non-coding RNA silencing and histone H4K16 deacetylation. Our findings
      demonstrate that residues 115-125 within the yeast Top1p N-terminal domain are
      required for the complementation of the top1 rDNA phenotypes. In chromatin
      immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we further
      demonstrate the physical interaction between Top1p and Sir2p. Our genetic and
      biochemical studies support a model whereby Top1p recruits Sir2p to the rDNA and 
      clarifies a structural role of DNA topoisomerase I in the epigenetic regulation
      of rDNA, independent of its known catalytic activity.

AB  - Septins are a protein family found in all eukaryotes (except higher plants) that 
      have roles in membrane remodeling and formation of diffusion barriers and as a
      scaffold to recruit other proteins. In budding yeast, proper execution of
      cytokinesis and cell division requires the formation of a collar of
      circumferential filaments at the bud neck. These filaments are assembled from
      apolar septin hetero-octamers. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms
      that control the arrangement and dynamics of septin structures. In this study, we
      utilized both Forster resonance energy transfer and electron microscopy to
      analyze the biophysical properties of the septin-binding protein Bni5 and how its
      association with septin filaments affects their organization. We found that the
      interaction of Bni5 with the terminal subunit (Cdc11) at the junctions between
      adjacent hetero-octamers in paired filaments is highly cooperative. Both the
      C-terminal end of Bni5 and the C-terminal extension of Cdc11 make important
      contributions to their interaction. Moreover, this binding may stabilize the
      dimerization of Bni5, which, in turn, forms cross-filament braces that
      significantly narrow, and impose much more uniform spacing on, the gap between
      paired filaments.

AB  - Large RNAs often utilize GNRA tetraloops as structural elements to stabilize the 
      overall tertiary fold. These tetraloop-receptor (TR) interactions have a
      conserved geometry in which the tetraloop docks into the receptor at an angle of 
      ~15 degrees from the helix containing the receptor. Here, we show that the
      conserved GUAAY pentaloop found in domain III of group IIB1 introns participates 
      in a novel class of RNA tertiary interaction with a geometry and mode of binding 
      that are significantly different from that found in GNRA TR interactions. This
      pentaloop is highly conserved within the IIB1 class and interacts with the minor 
      groove of the catalytic domain V. The base planes of the loop and receptor
      nucleotides are not coplanar and greatly deviate from standard A-minor motifs.
      The helical axis of the GUAAY stem loop diverges ~70 degrees from the angle of
      insertion found in a typical GNRA TR interaction. Therefore, the loop
      architecture and insertion orientation are distinctive, with in vitro splicing
      data indicating that a GNRA tetraloop is incompatible at this position. The GUAAY
      pentaloop-receptor motif is also found in the structure of the eukaryotic
      thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch in the context of a hexanucleotide loop
      sequence. We therefore propose, based on phylogenetic, structural, and
      biochemical data, that the GUAAY pentaloop-receptor interaction represents a
      novel structural motif that is present in multiple structured RNAs.

AB  - Cell polarity arises from a combination of interactions between biological
      molecules, such as activation, inhibition, and positive or negative feedback
      between specific polarity units. Activation and inhibition often take place in
      the form of a membrane binding switch. Lethal giant larvae (LGL), a conserved
      regulator of cell polarity in animals, was suggested to function as such a
      switch. LGL localizes to both the cytoplasm and, asymmetrically, the membrane.
      However, the spatial regulation mechanism of LGL membrane localization has
      remained unclear. For systematic elucidation, we set out to reconstitute a
      minimal polarity unit using a model membrane, Caenorhabditis elegans LGL (LGL-1),
      and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) supposed to activate the membrane switch. We
      identified a membrane binding sequence (MBS) in LGL-1 by a screen in vivo,
      reconstituted LGL-1 membrane binding in vitro, and successfully implemented the
      membrane switch by aPKC phosphorylation activity, detaching LGL from membranes.
      Upon membrane binding, LGL-1 MBS folds into an alpha-helix in which three regions
      can be identified: a positively charged patch, a switch area containing the three
      aPKC phosphorylation sites, and a hydrophobic area probably buried in the
      membrane. Phosphorylation by aPKC dramatically reduces the binding affinity of
      the LGL-1 MBS to negatively charged model membranes, inducing its detachment.
      Specific residues in the MBS are critical for LGL-1 function in C. elegans.

AB  - Iron and oxygen chemistry is mediated by iron proteins for many biological
      functions. Carboxylate-bridged diiron enzymes including ferritin have the common 
      mechanism of oxygen activation via peroxodiferric intermediates. However, the
      route for iron uptake and the structural identification of intermediates still
      remain incomplete. The 4-fold symmetry channel of Helicobacter pylori ferritin
      was previously proposed as the iron-uptake route in eubacteria, but the amino
      acid residues at the 4-fold channel are not highly conserved. Here, we show
      evidence for a short path for iron uptake from His93 on the surface to the
      ferroxidase center in H. pylori ferritin and Escherichia coli ferritin. The amino
      acid residues along this path are highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria and 
      some archaea, and the mutants containing S20A and H93L showed significantly
      decreased iron oxidation. Surprisingly, the E. coli ferritin S20A crystal
      structure showed oxygen binding and side-on, symmetric mu-eta(2):eta(2)
      peroxodiferric and oxodiferric intermediates. The results provide the structural 
      basis for understanding the chemical nature of intermediates in iron oxidation in
      bacteria and some of archaea.

      Substrates with Modifications at the Cleavage Site.

AB  - Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is the enzyme that endonucleolytically removes
      5'-precursor sequences from tRNA transcripts in all domains of life. RNase P
      activities are either ribonucleoprotein (RNP) or protein-only RNase P (PRORP)
      enzymes, raising the question about the mechanistic strategies utilized by these 
      architecturally different enzyme classes to catalyze the same type of reaction.
      Here, we analyzed the kinetics and cleavage-site selection by PRORP3 from
      Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPRORP3) using precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) with individual
      modifications at the canonical cleavage site, with either Rp- or
      Sp-phosphorothioate, or 2'-deoxy, 2'-fluoro, 2'-amino, or 2'-O-methyl
      substitutions. We observed a small but robust rescue effect of
      Sp-phosphorothioate-modified pre-tRNA in the presence of thiophilic Cd(2+) ions, 
      consistent with metal-ion coordination to the (pro-)Sp-oxygen during catalysis.
      Sp-phosphorothioate, 2'-deoxy, 2'-amino, and 2'-O-methyl modification redirected 
      the cleavage mainly to the next unmodified phosphodiester in the 5'-direction.
      Our findings are in line with the 2'-OH substituent at nucleotide -1 being
      involved in an H-bonding acceptor function. In contrast to bacterial RNase P,
      AtPRORP3 was found to be able to utilize the canonical and upstream cleavage site
      with similar efficiency (corresponding to reduced cleavage fidelity), and the two
      cleavage pathways appear less interdependent than in the bacterial RNA-based
      system.

AB  - Many cell-membrane-associated processes require transient spatiotemporal
      separation of components on scales ranging from a couple of molecules to
      micrometers in size. Understanding these processes mechanistically involves
      understanding how lipids and proteins self-organize and interact with the cell
      cortex. Here, we review recent advances in dissecting the mechanisms of cell
      membrane compartmentalization. We introduce the challenges in studying cell
      membrane organization, the current understanding of how complex membranes
      self-organize to form transient domains, and the role of protein scaffolds in
      membrane organization. We discuss the formation of signaling domains as an
      important example of transient membrane compartmentalization. We conclude by
      pointing to the current limitations of measuring membrane organization in living 
      cells and the steps that are required to advance the field.

AB  - Two isoforms of the small GTPase Rap1, Rap1A and Rap1B, participate in cell
      adhesion; Rap1A promotes steady state adhesion, while Rap1B regulates dynamic
      changes in cell adhesion. These events depend on the prenylation of Rap1, which
      promotes its membrane localization. Here, we identify previously unsuspected
      differences in the regulation of prenylation of Rap1A versus Rap1B, due in part
      to their different phosphorylation-dependent interactions with the chaperone
      protein SmgGDS-607. Previous studies indicate that the activation of Galphas
      protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) phosphorylates S-179 and S-180 in the polybasic
      region (PBR) of Rap1B, which inhibits Rap1B binding to SmgGDS-607 and diminishes 
      Rap1B prenylation and membrane localization. In this study, we investigate how
      phosphorylation in the PBR of multiple small GTPases, including K-Ras4B, RhoA,
      Rap1A, and Rap1B, affects their binding to SmgGDS, with emphasis on differences
      between Rap1A and Rap1B. We identify the amino acids in SmgGDS-607 necessary for 
      binding of Rap1A and Rap1B, and present homology models examining the binding
      between Rap1A or Rap1B and SmgGDS-607. Unlike Rap1B, phosphorylation in the PBR
      of Rap1A does not detectably inhibit its prenylation or its binding to
      SmgGDS-607. Activation of GPCRs suppresses Rap1A prenylation, but unlike this
      effect on Rap1B, the GPCR-mediated suppression of Rap1A prenylation can occur
      independently of Rap1A phosphorylation and does not detectably diminish Rap1A
      membrane localization. These data demonstrate unexpected evolutionarily conserved
      differences in the ability of GPCRs to regulate the prenylation of Rap1B compared
      to Rap1A.

AB  - Death receptor 5 (DR5) is an apoptosis-inducing member of the tumor necrosis
      factor receptor superfamily, whose activity has been linked to membrane
      cholesterol content. Upon ligand binding, DR5 forms large clusters within the
      plasma membrane that have often been assumed to be manifestations of receptor
      co-localization in cholesterol-rich membrane domains. However, we have recently
      shown that DR5 clusters are more than just randomly aggregated receptors.
      Instead, these are highly structured networks held together by receptor dimers.
      These dimers are stabilized by specific transmembrane helix-helix interactions,
      including a disulfide bond in the long isoform of the receptor. The complex
      relationships among DR5 network formation, transmembrane helix dimerization,
      membrane cholesterol, and receptor activity has not been established. It is
      unknown whether the membrane itself plays an active role in driving DR5
      transmembrane helix interactions or in the formation of the networks. We show
      that cholesterol depletion in cells does not inhibit the formation of DR5
      networks. However, the networks that form in cholesterol-depleted cells fail to
      induce caspase cleavage. These results suggest a potential structural difference 
      between active and inactive networks. As evidence, we show that cholesterol is
      necessary for the covalent dimerization of DR5 transmembrane domains. Molecular
      simulations and experiments in synthetic vesicles on the DR5 transmembrane dimer 
      suggest that dimerization is facilitated by increased helicity in a thicker
      bilayer.

AB  - Sphingolipids (SL) and their metabolites play key roles both as structural
      components of membranes and as signaling molecules. Many of the key enzymes and
      regulators of SL metabolism were discovered using the yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, and based on the high degree of conservation, a number of mammalian
      homologs were identified. Although yeast continues to be an important tool for SL
      research, the complexity of SL structure and nomenclature often hampers the
      ability of new researchers to grasp the subtleties of yeast SL biology and
      discover new modulators of this intricate pathway. Moreover, the emergence of
      lipidomics by mass spectrometry has enabled the rapid identification of SL
      species in yeast and rendered the analysis of SL composition under various
      physiological and pathophysiological conditions readily amenable. However, the
      complex nomenclature of the identified species renders much of the data
      inaccessible to non-specialists. In this review, we focus on parsing both the
      classical SL nomenclature and the nomenclature normally used during mass
      spectrometry analysis, which should facilitate the understanding of yeast SL data
      and might shed light on biological processes in which SLs are involved. Finally, 
      we discuss a number of putative roles of various yeast SL species.

AB  - Since its initial formalization nearly 20 years ago, the concept of lipid rafts
      has generated a tremendous amount of attention and interest and nearly as much
      controversy. The controversy is perhaps surprising because the notion itself is
      intuitive: compartmentalization in time and space is a ubiquitous theme at all
      scales of biology, and therefore, the partitioning of cellular membranes into
      lateral subdivision should be expected. Nevertheless, the physicochemical
      principles responsible for compartmentalization and the molecular mechanisms by
      which they are functionalized remain nearly as mysterious today as they were two 
      decades ago. Herein, we review recent literature on this topic with a specific
      focus on the major open questions in the field including: (1) what are the best
      tools to assay raft behavior in living membranes? (2) what is the function of the
      complex lipidome of mammalian cells with respect to membrane organization? (3)
      what are the mechanisms that drive raft formation and determine their properties?
      (4) how can rafts be modulated? (5) how is membrane compartmentalization
      integrated into cellular signaling? Despite decades of intensive research, this
      compelling field remains full of fundamental questions.

AB  - Biological membranes are complex and dynamic assemblies of lipids and proteins.
      Poikilothermic organisms including bacteria, fungi, reptiles, and fish do not
      control their body temperature and must adapt their membrane lipid composition in
      order to maintain membrane fluidity in the cold. This adaptive response was
      termed homeoviscous adaptation and has been frequently studied with a specific
      focus on the acyl chain composition of membrane lipids. Massspectrometry-based
      lipidomics can nowadays provide more comprehensive insights into the complexity
      of lipid remodeling during adaptive responses. Eukaryotic cells compartmentalize 
      biochemical processes in organelles with characteristic surface properties, and
      the lipid composition of organelle membranes must be tightly controlled in order 
      to maintain organelle function and identity during adaptive responses. Some
      highly differentiated cells such as neurons maintain unique lipid compositions
      with specific physicochemical properties. To date little is known about the
      sensory mechanisms regulating the acyl chain profile in such specialized cells or
      during adaptive responses. Here we summarize our current understanding of lipid
      metabolic networks with a specific focus on the role of physicochemical membrane 
      properties for the regulation of the acyl chain profile during homeoviscous
      adaptation. By comparing the mechanisms of the bacterial membrane sensors with
      the prototypical eukaryotic lipid packing sensor Mga2 fromSaccharomyces
      cerevisiae,we identify common operational principles that might guide our search 
      for novel membrane sensors in different organelles, organisms, and highly
      specialized cells.

AB  - In this study, we used water-soluble stable mass isotope precursors to measure
      the turnover of endogenous ceramide (Cer) and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in HEp-2 
      cells. Cells incubated in the presence of [(13)C-U]glucose showed rapid
      incorporation of hexose residues with an increased mass of 6Da into GSLs.
      Different turnover rates of GSL classes and their molecular species were
      observed. Approximately 30% of the glucosylceramide, 50% of the lactosylceramide,
      and 50% of the globotriaosylceramide species showed a much slower turnover than
      the rest. This demonstrates the existence of different lipid pools, where a
      certain fraction of species survived for a long time in the cells. The species
      with the shortest N-amidated fatty acyl groups (C16:0 and C18:0) showed a more
      rapid turnover than those with the longest N-amidated fatty acids (C24:0 and
      C24:1). Experiments with addition of [(13)C-U]serine were performed to study de
      novo synthesis of Cer from serine and palmitoyl-CoA. These experiments revealed
      that de novo synthesis contributes to a minor extent to the total synthesis of
      new sphingolipids and showed that there is a more rapid formation of the longest 
      Cer species (C24:0 and C24:1) than of the shortest species (C16:0), that is, the 
      opposite as observed for the GSLs in the experiments with [(13)C-U]glucose. In
      conclusion, this FLUX lipidomics experimental approach with the addition of
      [(13)C-U]glucose to cells allows us to not only study the total turnover but also
      permit observations of lipid intermediates and metabolic flow of endogenous GSL
      species at the molecular lipid level.

AB  - The crystal structure of a construct consisting of the FERM and SH2-like domains 
      of the human Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) bound to a fragment of the intracellular
      domain of the interferon-lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1) has been determined at the
      nominal resolution of 2.1A. In this structure, the receptor peptide forms an
      85-A-long extended chain, in which both the previously identified box1 and box2
      regions bind simultaneously to the FERM and SH2-like domains of JAK1. Both
      domains of JAK1 are generally well ordered, with regions not seen in the crystal 
      structure limited to loops located away from the receptor-binding regions. The
      structure provides a much more complete and accurate picture of the interactions 
      between JAK1 and IFNLR1 than those given in earlier reports, illuminating the
      molecular basis of the JAK-cytokine receptor association. A glutamate residue
      adjacent to the box2 region in IFNLR1 mimics the mode of binding of a
      phosphotyrosine in classical SH2 domains. It was shown here that a deletion of
      residues within the box1 region of the receptor abolishes stable interactions
      with JAK1, although it was previously shown that box2 alone is sufficient to
      stabilize a similar complex of the interferon-alpha receptor and TYK2.

TI  - An Mcm10 Mutant Defective in ssDNA Binding Shows Defects in DNA Replication
      Initiation.

AB  - Mcm10 is an essential protein that functions to initiate DNA replication after
      the formation of the replication fork helicase. In this manuscript, we identified
      a budding yeast Mcm10 mutant (Mcm10-m2,3,4) that is defective in DNA binding in
      vitro. Moreover, this Mcm10-m2,3,4 mutant does not stimulate the phosphorylation 
      of Mcm2 by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) in vitro. When we expressed wild-type
      levels of mcm10-m2,3,4 in budding yeast cells, we observed a severe growth defect
      and a substantially decreased DNA replication. We also observed a substantially
      reduced replication protein A- chromatin immunoprecipitation signal at origins of
      replication, reduced levels of DDK-phosphorylated Mcm2, and diminished Go, Ichi, 
      Ni, and San (GINS) association with Mcm2-7 in vivo. mcm5-bob1 bypasses the growth
      defect conferred by DDK-phosphodead Mcm2 in budding yeast. However, the growth
      defect observed by expressing mcm10-m2,3,4 is not bypassed by the mcm5-bob1
      mutation. Furthermore, origin melting and GINS association with Mcm2-7 are
      substantially decreased for cells expressing mcm10-m2,3,4 in the mcm5-bob1
      background. Thus, the origin melting and GINS-Mcm2-7 interaction defects we
      observed for mcm10-m2,3,4 are not explained by decreased Mcm2 phosphorylation by 
      DDK, since the defects persist in an mcm5-bob1 background. These data suggest
      that DNA binding by Mcm10 is essential for the initiation of DNA replication.

TI  - Structure of Escherichia coli Flavodiiron Nitric Oxide Reductase.

AB  - Flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) are present in organisms from all domains of life and
      have been described so far to be involved in the detoxification of oxygen or
      nitric oxide (NO), acting as O2 and/or NO reductases. The Escherichia coli FDP,
      named flavorubredoxin (FlRd), is the most extensively studied FDP. Biochemical
      and in vivo studies revealed that FlRd is involved in NO detoxification as part
      of the bacterial defense mechanisms against reactive nitrogen species. E. coli
      FlRd has a clear preference for NO as a substrate in vitro, exhibiting a very low
      reactivity toward O2. To contribute to the understanding of the structural
      features defining this substrate selectivity, we determined the crystallographic 
      structure of E. coli FlRd, both in the isolated and reduced states. The overall
      tetrameric structure revealed a highly conserved flavodiiron core domain, with a 
      metallo-beta-lactamase-like domain containing a diiron center, and a flavodoxin
      domain with a flavin mononucleotide cofactor. The metal center in the oxidized
      state has a mu-hydroxo bridge coordinating the two irons, while in the reduced
      state, this moiety is not detected. Since only the flavodiiron domain was
      observed in these crystal structures, the structure of the rubredoxin domain was 
      determined by NMR. Tunnels for the substrates were identified, and through
      molecular dynamics simulations, no differences for O2 or NO permeation were
      found. The present data represent the first structure for a NO-selective FDP.

AB  - Members of the really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase family bind
      to both substrate and ubiquitin-charged E2 enzyme, promoting the transfer of
      ubiquitin from the E2 to substrate. Either a single ubiquitin or one of the
      several types of polyubiquitin chains can be conjugated to substrate proteins,
      with different types of ubiquitin modifications signaling the distinct outcomes. 
      E2 enzymes play a central role in governing the nature of the ubiquitin
      modification, although the essential features of the E2 that differentiate mono- 
      versus polyubiquitinating E2 enzymes remain unclear. RNF4 is a compact RING E3
      ligase that directs the ubiquitination of polySUMO chains in concert with several
      different E2 enzymes. RNF4 monoubiquitinates polySUMO substrates in concert with 
      RAD6B and polyubiquitinates substrates together with UBCH5B, a promiscuous E2
      that can function with a broad range of E3 ligases. We find that the divergent
      ubiquitination activities of RAD6B and UBCH5B are governed by differences at the 
      RING-binding surface of the E2. By mutating the RAD6B RING-binding surface to
      resemble that of UBCH5B, RAD6B can be transformed into a highly active
      UBCH5B-like E2 that polyubiquitinates SUMO chains in concert with RNF4. The
      switch in RAD6B activity correlates with increased affinity of the E2 for RNF4.
      These results point to an important role of the affinity between an E3 and its
      cognate E2 in governing the multiplicity of substrate ubiquitination.

      Initiation.

AB  - Bacterial sigma factors are subunits of RNA polymerase that direct the holoenzyme
      to specific sets of promoters in the genome and are a central element of
      regulating transcription. Most polymerase holoenzymes open the promoter and
      initiate transcription rapidly after binding. However, polymerase containing the 
      members of the sigma(54) family must be acted on by a transcriptional activator
      before DNA opening and initiation occur. A key domain in these transcriptional
      activators forms a hexameric AAA+ ATPase that acts through conformational changes
      brought on by ATP hydrolysis. Contacts between the transcriptional activator and 
      sigma(54) are primarily made through an N-terminal sigma(54) activator
      interacting domain (AID). To better understand this mechanism of bacterial
      transcription initiation, we characterized the sigma(54) AID by NMR spectroscopy 
      and other biophysical methods and show that it is an intrinsically disordered
      domain in sigma(54) alone. We identified a minimal construct of the Aquifex
      aeolicus sigma(54) AID that consists of two predicted helices and retains
      native-like binding affinity for the transcriptional activator NtrC1. Using the
      NtrC1 ATPase domain, bound with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ADP-beryllium
      fluoride, we studied the NtrC1-sigma(54) AID complex using NMR spectroscopy. We
      show that the sigma(54) AID becomes structured after associating with the core
      loops of the transcriptional activators in their ATP state and that the primary
      site of the interaction is the first predicted helix. Understanding this complex,
      formed as the first step toward initiation, will help unravel the mechanism of
      sigma(54) bacterial transcription initiation.

AB  - Matrix proteins (MAs) play a key role in the transport of retroviral proteins
      inside infected cells and in the interaction with cellular membranes. In most
      retroviruses, retroviral MAs are N-terminally myristoylated. This modification
      serves as a membrane targeting signal and also as an anchor for membrane
      interaction. The aim of this work was to characterize the interactions anchoring 
      retroviral MA at the plasma membrane of infected cell. To address this issue, we 
      compared the structures and membrane affinity of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus
      (M-PMV) wild-type MA with its two budding deficient double mutants, that is,
      T41I/T78I and Y28F/Y67F. The structures of the mutants were determined using
      solution NMR spectroscopy, and their interactions with water-soluble
      phospholipids were studied. Water-soluble phospholipids are widely used models
      for studying membrane interactions by solution NMR spectroscopy. However, this
      approach might lead to artificial results due to unnatural hydrophobic
      interactions. Therefore, we used a new approach based on the measurement of the
      loss of the (1)H NMR signal intensity of the protein sample induced by the
      addition of the liposomes containing phospholipids with naturally long fatty
      acids. HIV-1 MA was used as a positive control because its ability to interact
      with liposomes has already been described. We found that in contrast to HIV-1,
      the M-PMV MA interacted with the liposomes differently and much weaker. In our
      invivo experiments, the M-PMV MA did not co-localize with lipid rafts. Therefore,
      we concluded that M-PMV might adopt a different membrane binding mechanism than
      HIV-1.

AB  - Structural dynamics of Ras proteins contributes to their activity in signal
      transduction cascades. Directly targeting Ras proteins with small molecules may
      rely on the movement of a conserved structural motif, switch II. To understand
      Ras signaling and advance Ras-targeting strategies, experimental methods to
      measure Ras dynamics are required. Here, we demonstrate the utility of
      hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) to measure Ras dynamics 
      by studying representatives from two branches of the Ras superfamily, Ras and
      Rho. A comparison of differential deuterium exchange between active
      (GMPPNP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) proteins revealed differences between the
      families, with the most notable differences occurring in the phosphate-binding
      loop and switch II. The P-loop exchange signature correlated with switch II
      dynamics observed in molecular dynamics simulations focused on measuring
      main-chain movement. HDX provides a means of evaluating Ras protein dynamics,
      which may be useful for understanding the mechanisms of Ras signaling, including 
      activated signaling of pathologic mutants, and for targeting strategies that rely
      on protein dynamics.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are increasingly important targets for drug
      discovery. Efficient fragment-based drug discovery approaches to tackle PPIs are 
      often stymied by difficulties in the production of stable, unliganded target
      proteins. Here, we report an approach that exploits protein engineering to
      "humanise" thermophilic archeal surrogate proteins as targets for small-molecule 
      inhibitor discovery and to exemplify this approach in the development of
      inhibitors against the PPI between the recombinase RAD51 and tumour suppressor
      BRCA2. As human RAD51 has proved impossible to produce in a form that is
      compatible with the requirements of fragment-based drug discovery, we have
      developed a surrogate protein system using RadA from Pyrococcus furiosus. Using a
      monomerised RadA as our starting point, we have adopted two parallel and mutually
      instructive approaches to mimic the human enzyme: firstly by mutating RadA to
      increase sequence identity with RAD51 in the BRC repeat binding sites, and
      secondly by generating a chimeric archaeal human protein. Both approaches
      generate proteins that interact with a fourth BRC repeat with affinity and
      stoichiometry comparable to human RAD51. Stepwise humanisation has also allowed
      us to elucidate the determinants of RAD51 binding to BRC repeats and the
      contributions of key interacting residues to this interaction. These surrogate
      proteins have enabled the development of biochemical and biophysical assays in
      our ongoing fragment-based small-molecule inhibitor programme and they have
      allowed us to determine hundreds of liganded structures in support of our
      structure-guided design process, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of 
      using archeal surrogates to overcome difficulties in handling human proteins.

AB  - Intervening protein sequences (inteins) from extremely halophilic haloarchaea can
      be inactive under low salinity but could be activated by increasing the salt
      content to a specific concentration for each intein. The halo-obligatory inteins 
      confer high solubility under both low and high salinity conditions. We showed the
      broad utility of salt-dependent protein splicing in cis and trans by
      demonstrating backbone cyclization, self-cleavage for purification, and scarless 
      protein ligation for segmental isotopic labeling. Artificially split MCM2 intein 
      derived from Halorhabdus utahensis remained highly soluble and was capable of
      protein trans-splicing with excellent ligation kinetics by reassembly under high 
      salinity conditions. Importantly, the MCM2 intein has the active site residue of 
      Ser at the +1 position, which remains in the ligated product, instead of Cys as
      found in many other efficient split inteins. Since Ser is more abundant than Cys 
      in proteins, the novel split intein could widen the applications of segmental
      labeling in protein NMR spectroscopy and traceless protein ligation by exploiting
      a Ser residue in the native sequences as the +1 position of the MCM2 intein. The 
      split halo-obligatory intein was successfully used to demonstrate the utility in 
      NMR investigation of intact proteins by producing segmentally isotope-labeled
      intact TonB protein from Helicobacter pylori.

AB  - APOBEC3H (A3H) is the most polymorphic member of the APOBEC3 family. Seven
      haplotypes (hap I-VII) and four mRNA splicing variants (SV) of A3H have been
      identified. The various haplotypes differ in anti-HIV activity, which is
      attributed to differences in protein stability, subcellular distribution, and/or 
      RNA binding and virion packaging. Here, we report the first comparative
      biochemical studies of all the A3H variants using highly purified proteins. We
      show that all haplotypes were stably expressed and could be purified to
      homogeneity by Escherichia coli expression. Surprisingly, four out of the seven
      haplotypes showed high cytosine (C) deaminase activity, with hap V displaying
      extremely high activity that was comparable to the highly active A3A.
      Furthermore, all four haplotypes that were active in C deamination were also
      highly active on methylated C (mC), with hap II displaying almost equal
      deamination efficiency on both. The deamination activity of these A3H variants
      correlates well with their reported anti-HIV activity for the different
      haplotypes, suggesting that deaminase activity may be an important factor in
      determining their respective anti-HIV activities. Moreover, mC deamination of A3H
      displayed a strong preference for the sequence motif of T-mCpG-C/G, which may
      suggest a potential role in genomic mC modification at the characteristic "CpG"
      island motif.

TI  - NMR Reveals the Interplay among the AMSH SH3 Binding Motif, STAM2, and

AB  - AMSH [associated molecule with a Src homology 3 domain of signal transducing
      adaptor molecule (STAM)] is one of the deubiquitinating enzymes associated in the
      regulation of endocytic cargo trafficking. It shows an exquisite selectivity for 
      Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains that are the main chains involved in cargo
      sorting. The first step requires the ESCRT-0 complex that comprises the STAM and 
      hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate (Hrs) proteins. Previous studies
      have shown that the presence of the STAM protein increases the efficiency of
      Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain cleavage by AMSH, one of the deubiquitinating
      enzyme involved in lysosomal degradation. In the present study, we are seeking to
      understand if a particular structural organization among these three key players 
      is responsible for the stimulation of the catalytic activity of AMSH. To address 
      this question, we first monitored the interaction between the ubiquitin
      interacting motif (UIM)-SH3 construct of STAM2 and the Lys63-linked diubiquitin
      (Lys63-Ub2) chains by means of NMR. We show that Lys63-Ub2 is able to bind either
      the UIM or the SH3 domain without any selectivity. We further demonstrate that
      the SH3 binding motif (SBM) of AMSH (AMSH-SBM) outcompetes Lys63-Ub2 for binding 
      SH3. Additionally, we show how different AMSH-SBM variants, modified by their
      sequence and length, exhibit similar equilibrium dissociation constants when
      binding SH3 but significantly differ in their dissociation rate constants.
      Finally, we report the solution NMR structure of the AMSH-SBM/SH3 complex and
      propose a structural organization where the AMSH-SBM interacts with the STAM2-SH3
      domain and contributes to the correct positioning of AMSH prior to polyubiquitin 
      chains' cleavage.

AB  - The tertiary structure of the GTPase center (GAC) of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as 
      seen in cocrystals is extremely compact. It is stabilized by long-range hydrogen 
      bonds and nucleobase stacking and by a triloop that forms within its three-way
      junction. Its folding pathway from secondary structure to tertiary structure has 
      not been previously observed, but it was shown to require Mg(2+) ions in
      equilibrium experiments. The fluorescent nucleotide 2-aminopurine was substituted
      at selected sites within the 60-nt GAC. Fluorescence intensity changes upon
      addition of MgCl2 were monitored over a time-course from 1ms to 100s as the RNA
      folds. The folding pathway is revealed here to be hierarchical through several
      intermediates. Observation of the nucleobases during folding provides a new
      perspective on the process and the pathway, revealing the dynamics of nucleobase 
      conformational exchange during the folding transitions.

TI  - MOMP from Campylobacter jejuni Is a Trimer of 18-Stranded beta-Barrel Monomers
      with a Ca(2+) Ion Bound at the Constriction Zone.

AB  - The Gram-negative organism Campylobacter jejuni is the major cause of food
      poisoning. Unlike Escherichia coli, which has two major porins, OmpC and OmpF, C.
      jejuni has one, termed major outer membrane protein (MOMP) through which
      nutrients and antibiotics transit. We report the 2.1-A crystal structure of C.
      jejuni MOMP expressed in E. coli and a lower resolution but otherwise identical
      structure purified directly from C. jejuni. The 2.1-A resolution structure of
      recombinant MOMP showed that although the protein has timeric arrangement similar
      to OmpC, it is an 18-stranded, not 16-stranded, beta-barrel. The structure has
      identified a Ca(2+) bound at the constriction zone, which is functionally
      significant as suggested by molecular dynamics and single-channel experiments.
      The water-filled channel of MOMP has a narrow constriction zone, and
      single-molecule studies show a monomeric conductivity of 0.7+/-0.2 nS and a
      trimeric conductance of 2.2+/-0.2 nS. The ion neutralizes negative charges at the
      constriction zone, reducing the transverse electric field and reversing ion
      selectivity. Modeling of the transit of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic of choice
      for treating Campylobacter infection, through the pore of MOMP reveals a
      trajectory that is dependent upon the presence metal ion.

AB  - The chaperonin-containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT, also known as TRiC)
      assists protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. CCT/TRiC was mixed rapidly
      with different concentrations of ATP, and the amount of phosphate formed upon ATP
      hydrolysis was measured as a function of time using the coumarin-labeled
      phosphate-binding protein method. Two burst phases were observed, followed by a
      lag phase and then a linear steady-state phase of ATP hydrolysis. The phases were
      assigned by (i) determining their dependence on ATP and K(+) concentrations and
      (ii) by measuring their sensitivity to the mutation Gly345-->Asp in subunit CCT4,
      which decreases cooperativity in ATP binding. The values of the observed rate
      constants corresponding to the burst phases are found to decrease with increasing
      ATP and K(+) concentrations, thereby indicating that the apo state of CCT/TRiC is
      in equilibrium between several conformations and that "conformational selection" 
      by ATP takes place before hydrolysis. The amplitude of the lag phase, which
      follows, decreases with increasing ATP concentrations, thus indicating that it
      reflects a transition between states with low affinity for ATP and a state with
      high affinity for ATP that is predominant under steady-state conditions. A
      kinetic model based on the data is suggested, in which CCT/TRiC is in equilibrium
      between a relatively large number of states that are distinguished kinetically,
      in agreement with its proposed sequential allosteric mechanism.

      Peptide Resistance Mimics Phosphorylation and Stabilizes LiaR in an Activated
      State.

AB  - The cyclic antimicrobial lipopeptide daptomycin (DAP) triggers the LiaFSR
      membrane stress response pathway in enterococci and many other Gram-positive
      organisms. LiaR is the response regulator that, upon phosphorylation, binds in a 
      sequence-specific manner to DNA to regulate transcription in response to membrane
      stress. In clinical settings, non-susceptibility to DAP by Enterococcus faecium
      is correlated frequently with a mutation in LiaR of Trp73 to Cys (LiaR(W73C)). We
      have determined the structure of the activated E. faecium LiaR protein at 3.2A
      resolution and, in combination with solution studies, show that the activation of
      LiaR induces the formation of a LiaR dimer that increases LiaR affinity at least 
      40-fold for the extended regulatory regions upstream of the liaFSR and liaXYZ
      operons. In vitro, LiaR(W73C) induces phosphorylation-independent dimerization of
      LiaR and provides a biochemical basis for non-susceptibility to DAP by the
      upregulation of the LiaFSR regulon. A comparison of the E. faecalis LiaR, E.
      faecium LiaR, and the LiaR homolog from Staphylococcus aureus (VraR) and the
      mutations associated with DAP resistance suggests that physicochemical properties
      such as oligomerization state and DNA specificity, although tuned to the biology 
      of each organism, share some features that could be targeted for new
      antimicrobials.

TI  - New Insights into the Phage Genetic Switch: Effects of Bacteriophage Lambda
      Operator Mutations on DNA Looping and Regulation of PR, PL, and PRM.
PG  - 4438-4456
LID - S0022-2836(16)30347-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2016.08.027 [doi]
AB  - One of the best understood systems in genetic regulatory biology is the so-called
      "genetic switch" that determines the choice the phage-encoded CI repressor binds 
      cooperatively to tripartite operators, OL and OR, in a defined pattern, thus
      blocking the transcription at two lytic promoters, PL and PR, and auto-regulating
      the promoter, PRM, which directs CI synthesis by the prophage. Fine-tuning of the
      maintenance of lysogeny is facilitated by interactions between CI dimers bound to
      OR and OL through the formation of a loop by the intervening DNA segment. By
      using a purified in vitro transcription system, we have genetically dissected the
      roles of individual operator sites in the formation of the DNA loop and thus have
      gained several new and unexpected insights into the system. First, although both 
      OR and OL are tripartite, the presence of only a single active CI binding site in
      one of the two operators is sufficient for DNA loop formation. Second, in PL,
      unlike in PR, the promoter distal operator site, OL3, is sufficient to directly
      repress PL. Third, DNA looping mediated by the formation of CI octamers arising
      through the interaction of pairs of dimers bound to adjacent operator sites in OR
      and OL does not require OR and OL to be aligned "in register", that is, CI bound 
      to "out-of-register" sub-operators, for example, OL1~Ol2 and OR2~OR3, can also
      mediate loop formation. Finally, based on an examination of the mechanism of
      activation of PRM when only OR1 or OR2 are wild type, we hypothesize that RNA
      polymerase bound at PR interferes with DNA loop formation. Thus, the formation of
      DNA loops involves potential interactions between proteins bound at numerous
      cis-acting sites, which therefore very subtly contribute to the regulation of the
      "switch".

      Recognition.

AB  - Armadillo repeat proteins (ArmRPs) recognize their target peptide in extended
      conformation and bind, in a first approximation, two residues per repeat. Thus,
      they may form the basis for building a modular system, in which each repeat is
      complementary to a piece of the target peptide. Accordingly, preselected repeats 
      could be assembled into specific binding proteins on demand and thereby avoid the
      traditional generation of every new binding molecule by an independent selection 
      from a library. Stacked armadillo repeats, each consisting of 42 aa arranged in
      three alpha-helices, build an elongated superhelical structure. Here, we analyzed
      the curvature variations in natural ArmRPs and identified a repeat pair from
      yeast importin-alpha as having the optimal curvature geometry that is
      complementary to a peptide over its whole length. We employed a symmetric in
      silico design to obtain a uniform sequence for a stackable repeat while
      maintaining the desired curvature geometry. Computationally designed ArmRPs
      (dArmRPs) had to be stabilized by mutations to remove regions of higher
      flexibility, which were identified by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit 
      solvent. Using an N-capping repeat from the consensus-design approach, two
      different crystal structures of dArmRP were determined. Although the experimental
      structures of dArmRP deviated from the designed curvature, the insertion of the
      most conserved binding pockets of natural ArmRPs onto the surface of dArmRPs
      resulted in binders against the expected peptide with low nanomolar affinities,
      similar to the binders from the consensus-design series.

TI  - Structural Insights into the Inhibitory Mechanism of an Antibody against B7-H6, a

AB  - Antibodies have been shown to block signaling through cell surface receptors
      using several mechanisms. The two most common are binding to the ligand-binding
      site of the receptor and, conversely, binding to the receptor-binding site of the
      ligand. Here, we investigated the inhibitory mechanism of an antibody (17B1.3)
      against human B7-H6, a stress-induced cellular ligand for the natural killer (NK)
      cell receptor NKp30. Binding of this antibody to B7-H6, a transmembrane protein
      expressed on tumor and other stressed cells, but not on normal cells, prevents NK
      cell activation via NKp30. We determined the crystal structure of antibody 17B1.3
      in complex with the ectodomain of B7-H6 to 2.5A resolution. Surprisingly, 17B1.3 
      binds to a site on B7-H6 that is completely distinct from the binding site for
      NKp30, such that 17B1.3 does not block the NKp30-B7-H6 interaction. We then asked
      whether 17B1.3 prevents signaling by binding to a putative site for B7-H6
      dimerization. However, structure-based mutations designed to disrupt potential
      B7-H6 dimerization through this site did not diminish NKp30-mediated cell
      activation. We conclude that the bulky 17B1.3 antibody most likely acts by
      sterically interfering with close cell-cell contacts at the NK cell-target cell
      interface that are required for NK cell activation. A similar inhibitory
      mechanism may apply to other antibodies, including therapeutic antibodies that
      block signaling through cell surface receptors whose ligands are also cell
      surface proteins.

AB  - Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone responsible
      for the activation, maturation, and trafficking of several hundred client
      proteins in the cell. It is well known that (but not understood how) residues far
      away from Hsp90's nucleotide binding pocket can regulate its ATPase activity, a
      phenomenon called allosteric regulation. Here, the computational design of
      allosteric mutations was combined with in vitro and in vivo experiments to
      unravel nucleotide-responsive hot spots in the regulation of Hsp90. With this
      approach, we identified both activating and inhibiting regulation points and show
      that changes in those amino acids affect the conformational dynamics and ATPase
      activity of Hsp90 in vitro. Our observations that activating mutations loosen and
      inhibiting mutations rigidify the protein explain for the first time how Hsp90
      changes in response to allosteric mutations. Additionally, mutations of these
      allosteric regulation points can be controlled by the interplay with Hsp90
      co-chaperones, thus providing cells with an efficient mechanism of modifying
      Hsp90's intrinsic properties via different layers of regulation. Altogether, our 
      results show that a framework for transmitting conformational information exists 
      in the Hsp90 structure.

AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a multiprotein complex that catalyses
      toxin secretion through the bacterial cell envelope of various Gram-negative
      bacteria including important human pathogens. This machine uses a
      bacteriophage-like contractile tail to puncture the prey cell and inject harmful 
      toxins. The T6SS tail comprises an inner tube capped by the cell-puncturing spike
      and wrapped by the contractile sheath. This structure is built on an assembly
      platform, the baseplate, which is anchored to the bacterial cell envelope by the 
      TssJLM membrane complex (MC). This MC serves as both a tail docking station and a
      channel for the passage of the inner tube. The TssM transmembrane protein is a
      key component of the MC as it connects the inner and outer membranes. In this
      study, we define the TssM topology, highlighting a large but poorly studied
      35-kDa cytoplasmic domain, TssMCyto, located between two transmembrane segments. 
      Protein-protein interaction assays further show that TssMCyto oligomerises and
      makes contacts with several baseplate components. Using computer predictions, we 
      delineate two subdomains in TssMCyto, including a nucleotide triphosphatase
      (NTPase) domain, followed by a 110-aa extension. Finally, site-directed
      mutagenesis coupled to functional assays reveals the contribution of these
      subdomains and conserved motifs to the interaction with T6SS partners and to the 
      function of the secretion apparatus.

AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a multiprotein complex that delivers toxin
      effectors in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It is constituted of a long
      cytoplasmic structure-the tail-made of stacked Hcp hexamers and wrapped by a
      contractile sheath. Contraction of the sheath propels the inner tube capped by
      the VgrG spike protein toward the target cell. This tubular structure is built
      onto an assembly platform-the baseplate-that is composed of the TssEFGK-VgrG
      subunits. During the assembly process, the baseplate is recruited to a
      trans-envelope complex comprising the TssJ outer membrane lipoprotein and the
      TssL and TssM inner membrane proteins. This membrane complex serves as a docking 
      station for the baseplate/tail and as a channel for the passage of the inner tube
      during sheath contraction. The baseplate is recruited to the membrane complex
      through multiple contacts including interactions of TssG and TssK with the
      cytoplasmic loop of TssM and of TssK with the cytoplasmic domain of TssL,
      TssLCyto. Here, we show that TssLCyto interacts also with the TssE baseplate
      subunit. Based on the available TssLCyto structures, we targeted conserved
      regions and specific features of TssLCyto in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. 
      By using bacterial two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation, we further
      show that the disordered L3-L4 loop is necessary to interact with TssK and that
      the L6-L7 loop mediates the interaction with TssE, whereas the TssM cytoplasmic
      loop binds the conserved groove of TssLCyto. Finally, competition assays
      demonstrated that these interactions are physiologically important for T6SS
      function.

AB  - Autophagosomes are double membrane organelles that are formed during a process
      referred to as macroautophagy. They serve to deliver cytoplasmic material into
      the lysosome for degradation. Autophagosomes are formed in a de novo manner and
      are the result of substantial membrane remodeling processes involving numerous
      protein-lipid interactions. While most studies focus on the proteins involved in 
      autophagosome formation it is obvious that lipids including phospholipids,
      sphingolipids and sterols play an equally important role. Here we summarize the
      current knowledge about the role of lipids, especially focusing on phospholipids 
      and their interplay with the autophagic protein machinery during autophagosome
      formation and fusion.

AB  - A host of endocytic processes has been described at the plasma membrane of
      eukaryotic cells. Their categorization has most commonly referenced cytosolic
      machinery, of which the clathrin coat has occupied a preponderant position. In
      what concerns intra-membrane constituents, the focus of interest has been on
      phosphatidylinositol lipids and their capacity to orchestrate endocytic events on
      the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane. The contribution of extracellular
      determinants to the construction of endocytic pits has received much less
      attention, depite the fact that (glyco)sphingolipids are exoplasmic leaflet
      fabric of membrane domains, termed rafts, whose contributions to predominantly
      clathrin-independent internalization processes is well recognized. Furthermore,
      sugar modifications on extracellular domains of proteins, and sugar-binding
      proteins, termed lectins, have also been linked to the uptake of endocytic
      cargoes at the plasma membrane. In this review, we first summarize these
      contributions by extracellular determinants to the endocytic process. We thus
      propose a molecular hypothesis - termed the GL-Lect hypothesis - on how
      GlycoLipids and Lectins drive the formation of compositional nanoenvrionments
      from which the endocytic uptake of glycosylated cargo proteins is operated via
      clathrin-independent carriers. Finally, we position this hypothesis within the
      global context of endocytic pathway proposals that have emerged in recent years.

      Conformational Changes in the Backbone Template.

AB  - Despite the development of powerful computational tools, the full-sequence design
      of proteins still remains a challenging task. To investigate the limits and
      capabilities of computational tools, we conducted a study of the ability of the
      program Rosetta to predict sequences that recreate the authentic fold of
      thioredoxin. Focusing on the influence of conformational details in the template 
      structures, we based our study on 8 experimentally determined template structures
      and generated 120 designs from each. For experimental evaluation, we chose six
      sequences from each of the eight templates by objective criteria. The 48 selected
      sequences were evaluated based on their progressive ability to (1) produce
      soluble protein in Escherichia coli and (2) yield stable monomeric protein, and
      (3) on the ability of the stable, soluble proteins to adopt the target fold. Of
      the 48 designs, we were able to synthesize 32, 20 of which resulted in soluble
      protein. Of these, only two were sufficiently stable to be purified. An X-ray
      crystal structure was solved for one of the designs, revealing a close
      resemblance to the target structure. We found a significant difference among the 
      eight template structures to realize the above three criteria despite their high 
      structural similarity. Thus, in order to improve the success rate of
      computational full-sequence design methods, we recommend that multiple template
      structures are used. Furthermore, this study shows that special care should be
      taken when optimizing the geometry of a structure prior to computational design
      when using a method that is based on rigid conformations.

TI  - Mapping of the Communication-Mediating Interface in Nonribosomal Peptide
      Synthetases Using a Genetically Encoded Photocrosslinker Supports an Upside-Down 
      Helix-Hand Motif.

AB  - Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are large modular protein templates that
      assemble bioactive peptides, many of which possess therapeutic importance.
      Protein-protein interactions between subunits of bacterial NRPSs are essential
      for proper template formation. The structural basis of the typical subunit
      interface between epimerization (E) and condensation domains is only poorly
      understood. Conflicting helix-helix and helix-hand models were previously
      proposed. Here, the genetically encoded photocrosslinker p-benzoylphenylalanine
      (BpF) was incorporated into the C-terminal communication-mediating domain (COM)
      of GrsA. Using the partner elongation module TycB1 to form a dipeptide product,
      we could correlate the ability to form covalent crosslinks with the functional
      module interaction. Perturbation of the module interaction with the large side
      chain of BpF in a scan at 19 positions demonstrated the importance of three
      hydrophobic residues in an alpha-helical arrangement. Mapping of covalent
      crosslinks using tandem mass spectrometry revealed the residues from the interior
      of the condensation domain as part of the protein interface; a finding not
      predicted by the helix-helix model. The epimerization domain of GrsA was found to
      be important for the interaction. Together with multiple sequence analyses and
      structural modeling, our results suggest an upside-down helix-hand model in which
      the C-terminal COM-helix is embedded in a hand motif with a hydrophobic core in a
      reversed orientation compared to a previous proposal. Our results provide a more 
      detailed and the first direct structural understanding of the COM domain
      interaction and will contribute to successful biocombinatorial engineering
      attempts in the design of artificial NRPS templates.

TI  - Structure and Function of AmtR in Mycobacterium smegmatis: Implications for
      Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Urea Metabolism through a Small Antisense RNA.

AB  - Soil-dwelling bacteria of the phylum actinomycetes generally harbor either GlnR
      or AmtR as a global regulator of nitrogen metabolism. Mycobacterium smegmatis
      harbors both of these canonical regulators; GlnR regulates the expression of key 
      genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, while the function and signal transduction
      pathway of AmtR in M. smegmatis remains largely unknown. Here, we report the
      structure and function of the M. smegmatis AmtR and describe the role of AmtR in 
      the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in response to nitrogen availability. To
      determine the function of AmtR in M. smegmatis, we performed genome-wide
      expression profiling comparing the wild-type versus an amtR mutant and identified
      significant changes in the expression of 11 genes, including an operon involved
      in urea degradation. An AmtR consensus-binding motif (CTGTC-N4-GACAG) was
      identified in the promoter region of this operon, and ligand-independent,
      high-affinity AmtR binding was validated by both electrophoretic mobility shift
      assays and surface plasmon resonance measurements. We confirmed the transcription
      of a cis-encoded small RNA complementary to the gene encoding AmtR under nitrogen
      excess, and we propose a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for AmtR. The 
      three-dimensional X-ray structure of AmtR at 2.0A revealed an overall TetR-like
      dimeric structure, and the alignment of the M. smegmatis AmtR and Corynebacterium
      glutamicum AmtR regulatory domains showed poor structural conservation, providing
      a potential explanation for the lack of M. smegmatis AmtR interaction with the
      adenylylated PII protein. Taken together, our data suggest an AmtR
      (repressor)/GlnR (activator) competitive binding mechanism for transcriptional
      regulation of urea metabolism that is controlled by a cis-encoded small antisense
      RNA.

AB  - One of the major challenges in modern biophysics is observing and understanding
      conformational changes during complex molecular processes, from the fundamental
      protein folding to the function of molecular machines. Single-molecule techniques
      have been one of the major driving forces of the huge progress attained in the
      last few years. Recent advances in resolution of the experimental setups, aided
      by theoretical developments and molecular dynamics simulations, have revealed a
      much higher degree of complexity inside these molecular processes than previously
      reported using traditional ensemble measurements. This review sums up the
      evolution of these developments and gives an outlook on prospective discoveries.

AB  - In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II requires general transcription factors to
      initiate mRNA transcription. TFIIE subunits alpha and beta form a heterodimer and
      recruit TFIIH to complete the assembly of the pre-initiation complex. Here, we
      have determined the crystal structure of human TFIIE at atomic resolution. The
      N-terminal half of TFIIEalpha forms an extended winged helix (WH) domain with an 
      additional helix, followed by a zinc-finger domain. TFIIEbeta contains the WH2
      domain, followed by two coiled-coil helices intertwining with TFIIEalpha. We also
      showed that TFIIEalpha binds to TFIIEbeta with nanomolar affinity using
      isothermal titration calorimetry. In addition, mutations on the residues involved
      in the interactions resulted in severe growth defects in yeast. Lack of the
      C-terminal region of yeast TFIIEbeta causes a mild growth defect in vivo. These
      findings provide a structural basis for understanding the functional mechanisms
      of TFIIE in the context of pre-initiation complex formation and transcription
      initiation.

AB  - RanBPM and RanBP10 are non-canonical members of the Ran binding protein family
      that lack the Ran binding domain and do not associate with Ran GTPase in vivo.
      Rather, they have been shown to be scaffolding proteins that are important for a 
      variety of cellular processes, and both of these proteins contain a SPRY domain, 
      which has been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions with a
      variety of targets including the DEAD-box containing ATP-dependent RNA helicase
      (DDX-4). In this study, we have determined the crystal structures of the SPIa and
      the ryanodine receptor domain and of approximately 70 upstream residues
      (immediate upstream to SPRY motif) of both RanBPM and RanBP10. They are almost
      identical, composed of a beta-sandwich fold with a set of two helices on each
      side located at the edge of the sheets. A unique shallow binding surface is
      formed by highly conserved loops on the surface of the beta-sheet with two
      aspartates on one end, a positive patch on the opposite end, and a tryptophan
      lining at the bottom of the surface. The 20-mer peptide (residues 228-247) of
      human DDX-4, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase known to regulate germ cell
      development, binds to this surface with a KD of ~13muM. The crystal structure of 
      the peptide complex and the mutagenesis studies elucidate how RanBPM can
      recognize its interaction partners to function in gametogenesis.

TI  - Bacterial and Yeast AAA+ Disaggregases ClpB and Hsp104 Operate through Conserved 
      Mechanism Involving Cooperation with Hsp70.

AB  - Escherichia coli ClpB and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp104 are members of the
      Hsp100 family of ring-forming hexameric AAA+ chaperones that promote the
      solubilization of aggregated proteins and the propagation of prions. ClpB and
      Hsp104 cooperate with cognate Hsp70 chaperones for substrate targeting and
      activation of ATPase and substrate threading, achieved by transient Hsp70 binding
      to the repressing ClpB/Hsp104 M-domain. Fundamental differences in ATPase
      regulation and disaggregation mechanisms have been reported; however, these
      differences are raising doubts regarding the working principle of this AAA+
      chaperone. In particular, unique functional plasticity was suggested to
      specifically enable Hsp104 to circumvent Hsp70 requirement for derepression in
      protein disaggregation and prion propagation. We show here that both ClpB and
      Hsp104 cooperation with Hsp70 is crucial for efficient protein disaggregation
      and, in contrast to earlier claims, cannot be circumvented by activating M-domain
      mutations. Activation of ClpB and Hsp104 requires two signals, relief of M-domain
      repression and substrate binding, leading to increased ATPase subunit coupling.
      These data demonstrate that ClpB and Hsp104 operate by the same basic mechanism, 
      underscore a dominant function of Hsp70 in regulating ClpB/Hsp104 activity, and
      explain a plethora of in vivo studies showing a crucial function of Hsp70 in
      proteostasis and prion propagation.

AB  - The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into nucleosomes, and the organisation of these
      nucleosomes into chromatin, plays a critical role in regulating all
      DNA-associated processes. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is
      an ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling protein that is conserved throughout
      eukaryotes and has an ability to assemble and organise nucleosomes both in vitro 
      and in vivo. This activity is involved in the regulation of transcription and is 
      implicated in mammalian development and stem cell biology. CHD1 is classically
      depicted as possessing a pair of tandem chromodomains that directly precede a
      core catalytic helicase-like domain that is then followed by a SANT-SLIDE
      DNA-binding domain. Here, we have identified an additional conserved domain
      C-terminal to the SANT-SLIDE domain and determined its structure by
      multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. We have termed this domain the
      CHD1 helical C-terminal (CHCT) domain as it is comprised of five alpha-helices
      arranged in a variant helical bundle topology. CHCT has a conserved, positively
      charged surface and is able to bind DNA and nucleosomes. In addition, we have
      identified another group of proteins, the as yet uncharacterised C17orf64
      proteins, as also containing a conserved CHCT domain. Our data provide new
      structural insights into the CHD1 enzyme family.

AB  - AP205 is a single-stranded RNA bacteriophage that has a coat protein sequence not
      similar to any other known single-stranded RNA phage. Here, we report an
      atomic-resolution model of the AP205 virus-like particle based on a crystal
      structure of an unassembled coat protein dimer and a cryo-electron microscopy
      reconstruction of the assembled particle, together with secondary structure
      information from site-specific solid-state NMR data. The AP205 coat protein dimer
      adopts the conserved Leviviridae coat protein fold except for the N-terminal
      region, which forms a beta-hairpin in the other known single-stranded RNA phages.
      AP205 has a similar structure at the same location formed by N- and C-terminal
      beta-strands, making it a circular permutant compared to the other coat proteins.
      The permutation moves the coat protein termini to the most surface-exposed part
      of the assembled particle, which explains its increased tolerance to long N- and 
      C-terminal fusions.

TI  - The Kinetic Stability of a Full-Length Antibody Light Chain Dimer Determines
      whether Endoproteolysis Can Release Amyloidogenic Variable Domains.

AB  - Light chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis) appears to be caused by the
      misfolding, or misfolding and aggregation of an antibody LC or fragment thereof
      and is fatal if untreated. LCs are secreted from clonally expanded plasma cells, 
      generally as disulfide-linked dimers, with each monomer comprising one constant
      and one variable domain. The energetic contribution of each domain and the role
      of endoproteolysis in AL amyloidosis remain unclear. To investigate why only some
      LCs form amyloid and cause organ toxicity, we measured the aggregation propensity
      and kinetic stability of LC dimers and their associated variable domains from AL 
      amyloidosis patients and non-patients. All the variable domains studied readily
      form amyloid fibrils, whereas none of the full-length LC dimers, even those from 
      AL amyloidosis patients, are amyloidogenic. Kinetic stability-that is, the free
      energy difference between the native state and the unfolding transition
      state-dictates the LC's unfolding rate. Full-length LC dimers derived from AL
      amyloidosis patients unfold more rapidly than other full-length LC dimers and can
      be readily cleaved into their component domains by proteases, whereas
      non-amyloidogenic LC dimers are more kinetically stable and resistant to
      endoproteolysis. Our data suggest that amyloidogenic LC dimers are kinetically
      unstable (unfold faster) and are thus susceptible to endoproteolysis that results
      in the release amyloidogenic LC fragments, whereas other LCs are not as amenable 
      to unfolding and endoproteolysis and are therefore aggregation resistant.
      Pharmacologic kinetic stabilization of the full-length LC dimer could be a useful
      strategy to treat AL amyloidosis.

AB  - Globular proteins typically fold into tightly packed arrays of regular secondary 
      structures. We developed a model to approximate the compact parallel and
      antiparallel arrangement of alpha-helices and beta-strands, enumerated all
      possible topologies formed by up to five secondary structural elements (SSEs),
      searched for their occurrence in spatial structures of proteins, and documented
      their frequencies of occurrence in the PDB. The enumeration model grows larger
      super-secondary structure patterns (SSPs) by combining pairs of smaller patterns,
      a process that approximates a potential path of protein fold evolution. The most 
      prevalent SSPs are typically present in superfolds such as the Rossmann-like
      fold, the ferredoxin-like fold, and the Greek key motif, whereas the less
      frequent SSPs often possess uncommon structure features such as split
      beta-sheets, left-handed connections, and crossing loops. This complete SSP
      enumeration model, for the first time, allows us to investigate which
      theoretically possible SSPs are not observed in available protein structures. All
      SSPs with up to four SSEs occurred in proteins. However, among the SSPs with five
      SSEs, approximately 20% (218) are absent from existing folds. Of these unobserved
      SSPs, 80% contain two or more uncommon structure features. To facilitate future
      efforts in protein structure classification, engineering, and design, we provide 
      the resulting patterns and their frequency of occurrence in proteins at:

AB  - The molecular chaperone Hsp90 and its cofactor Cdc37 are required for the
      stability of protein kinases in the cellular environment. Upon pharmacological
      inhibition of Hsp90, the Hsp90-dependent kinases are degraded quickly by the
      proteasome. Clear physiological evidence for the formation of heterooligomeric
      complexes between the chaperone system and its kinase clients exist, but the
      mechanisms of client processing are still enigmatic. Here, we investigate the
      interaction of the chaperone system with a stabilized fragment of the
      Hsp90-dependent protein kinase B-Raf (sB-Raf). sB-Raf is aggregation prone at
      elevated temperatures. We find that nucleotide binding strongly stabilizes the
      folded state of sB-Raf and suppresses its aggregation. Also, Cdc37 and Hsp90 in
      combination can suppress sB-Raf aggregation while forming a ternary complex with 
      the kinase. The presence of nucleotides leads to the dissociation of the kinase
      from the ternary chaperone complex, implying that the stabilization of the kinase
      by nucleotides reduces its affinity toward the chaperone machinery. Human
      Cdc37-Hsp90 complexes can bind to kinase, if the NM domain of the chaperone is
      present. Nematode Cdc37, which does not require the N-terminal Hsp90 domain for
      binding, can form a ternary complex with the MC construct of Hsp90, which lacks
      the aggregation propensity of sB-Raf. Like the full-length complex, this
      interaction is sensitive to ATP binding to sB-Raf. We thus find that the
      interaction between sB-Raf and the Hsp90 chaperone system is based on contacts
      with the M domain of Hsp90, which contributes in forming the ternary complex with
      CeCdc37 as long as the kinase is not stabilized by nucleotide.

AB  - C-tailed membrane proteins insert into the bilayer post-translationally because
      the hydrophobic anchor segment leaves the ribosome at the end of translation.
      Nevertheless, we find here evidence that the targeting of SciP to the membrane of
      Escherichia coli occurs co-translationally since signal elements in the
      N-terminal part of the SciP protein sequence are present. Two short hydrophobic
      sequences were identified that targeted a green fluorescent protein-SciP fusion
      protein to the membrane involving the signal recognition particle. After
      targeting, the membrane insertion of SciP is catalyzed by YidC independent of the
      SecYEG translocase. However, when the C-terminal tail of SciP was extended to 21 
      aa residues, we found that SecYEG becomes involved and makes its membrane
      insertion more efficient.

AB  - Missense mutations that introduce or remove cysteine residues in receptor
      tyrosine kinases are believed to cause pathologies by stabilizing the active
      receptor tyrosine kinase dimers. However, the magnitude of this stabilizing
      effect has not been measured for full-length receptors. Here, we characterize the
      dimer stabilities of three full-length fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
      mutants harboring pathogenic cysteine substitutions: the C178S FGFR1 mutant, the 
      C342R FGFR2 mutant, and the C228R FGFR3 mutant. We find that the three mutations 
      stabilize the FGFR dimers. We further see that the mutations alter the
      configuration of the FGFR transmembrane dimers. Thus, both aberrant dimerization 
      and perturbed dimer structure likely contribute to the pathological phenotypes
      arising due to these mutations.

AB  - Antibodies that bind RNA represent an unrealized source of reagents for synthetic
      biology and for characterizing cellular transcriptomes. However, facile access to
      RNA-binding antibodies requires the engineering of effective Fab libraries guided
      by the knowledge of the principles that govern RNA recognition. Here, we describe
      a Fab identified from a minimalist synthetic library during phage display against
      a branched RNA target. The Fab (BRG) binds with 20nM dissociation constant to a
      single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequence adjacent to the branch site and can block
      the action of debranchase enzyme. We report the crystal structure in complex with
      RNA target at 2.38A. The Fab traps the RNA in a hairpin conformation that
      contains a 2-bp duplex capped by a tetraloop. The paratope surface consists of
      residues located in four complementarity-determining regions including a major
      contribution from H3, which adopts a helical structure that projects into a deep,
      wide groove formed by the RNA. The amino acid composition of the paratope
      reflects the library diversity, consisting mostly of tyrosine and serine residues
      and a small but significant contribution from a single arginine residue. This
      structure, involving the recognition of ssRNA via a stem-loop conformation,
      together with our two previous structures involving the recognition of an RNA
      hairpin loop and an RNA tertiary structure, reveals the capacity of minimalist
      libraries biased with tyrosine, serine, glycine, and arginine to form binding
      surfaces for specific RNA conformations and distinct levels of RNA structural
      hierarchy.

      Implication for p24 Complex Formation and Cargo Transport.

AB  - The p24 family consists of four subfamilies (p24alpha, p24beta, p24gamma, and
      p24delta), and the proteins are thought to form hetero-oligomeric complexes for
      efficient transport of cargo proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi
      apparatus. The proteins possess a conserved luminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain,
      whose functions are largely unknown. Here, we present structural and biochemical 
      studies of p24beta1 and p24delta1 GOLD domains. Use of GOLD domain-deleted
      mutants revealed that the GOLD domain of p24delta1 is required for proper p24
      hetero-oligomeric complex formation and efficient transport of GPI-anchored
      proteins. The p24beta1 and p24delta1 GOLD domains share a common beta-sandwich
      fold with a characteristic intrasheet disulfide bond. The GOLD domain of
      p24delta1 crystallized as dimers, allowing the analysis of a homophilic
      interaction site. Surface plasmon resonance and solution NMR analyses revealed
      that p24beta1 and p24delta1 GOLD domains interact weakly (Kd= ~10(-4)M).
      Bi-protein titration provided interaction site maps. We propose that the
      heterophilic interaction of p24 GOLD domains contributes to the formation of the 
      p24 hetero-oligomeric complex and to efficient cargo transport.

AB  - Monoubiquitylation of histone H2B is a post-translational mark that plays key
      roles in regulation of transcription and genome stability. In humans, attachment 
      of ubiquitin to lysine 120 of histone H2B depends on the activity of the E2
      ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ube2B, and the really interesting new gene (RING)
      E3 ligases, RING finger protein (RNF) 20 and RNF40. To better understand the
      molecular basis of this modification, we have solved the crystal structure of the
      RNF20 RING domain and show that it is a homodimer that specifically interacts
      with the Ube2B~Ub conjugate. By mutating residues at the E3-E2 and E3-ubiquitin
      interfaces, we identify key contacts required for interaction of the RNF20 RING
      domain with the Ube2B~Ub conjugate. These mutants were used to generate a
      structure-based model of the RNF20-Ube2B~Ub complex that reveals differences from
      other RING-E2~Ub complexes, and suggests how the RNF20-Ube2B~Ub complex might
      interact with its nucleosomal substrate. Additionally, we show that the RING
      domains of RNF20 and RNF40 can form a stable heterodimer that is active.
      Together, our studies provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate
      RNF20-mediated ubiquitin transfer from Ube2B.

AB  - The human pocket proteins retinoblastoma (Rb), p107, and p130 are critical
      negative regulators of the cell cycle and contribute to tumor suppression. While 
      strong structural conservation within the pocket protein family provides for some
      functional redundancy, important differences have been observed and may underlie 
      the reason that Rb is a uniquely potent tumor suppressor. It has been proposed
      that distinct pocket protein activities are mediated by their different E2F
      transcription factor binding partners. In humans, Rb binds E2F1-E2F5, whereas
      p107 and p130 almost exclusively associate with E2F4 and E2F5. To identify the
      molecular determinants of this specificity, we compared the crystal structures of
      Rb and p107 pocket domains and identified several key residues that contribute to
      E2F selectivity in the pocket family. Mutation of these residues in p107 to match
      the analogous residue in Rb results in an increase in affinity for E2F1 and E2F2 
      and an increase in the ability of p107 to inhibit E2F2 transactivation.
      Additionally, we investigated how phosphorylation by Cyclin-dependent kinase on
      distinct residues regulates p107 affinity for the E2F4 transactivation domain. We
      found that phosphorylation of residues S650 and S975 weakens the E2F4
      transactivation domain binding. Our data reveal molecular features of pocket
      proteins that are responsible for their similarities and differences in function 
      and regulation.

AB  - Linker histones bind to the nucleosome and regulate the structure and function of
      chromatin. We have previously shown that the globular domains of chicken H5 and
      Drosophila H1 linker histones bind to the nucleosome with on- or off-dyad modes, 
      respectively. To explore the determinant for the distinct binding modes, we
      investigated the binding of a mutant globular domain of H5 to the nucleosome.
      This mutant, termed GH5_pMut, includes substitutions of five globular domain
      residues of H5 with the corresponding residues in the globular domain of
      Drosophila H1. The residues at these five positions play important roles in
      nucleosome binding by either H5 or Drosophila H1. NMR and spin-labeling
      experiments showed that GH5_pMut bound to the nucleosome off the dyad. We further
      found that the nucleosome array condensed by either the GH5_pMut or the globular 
      domain of Drosophila H1 displayed a similar sedimentation coefficient, whereas
      the same nucleosome array condensed by the wild-type globular domain of H5 showed
      a much larger sedimentation coefficient. Moreover, NMR and spin-labeling results 
      from the study of the nucleosome in complex with the full-length human linker
      histone H1.0, whose globular domain shares high sequence conservation with the
      corresponding globular domain of H5, are consistent with an on-dyad binding mode.
      Taken together, our results suggest that a small number of residues in the
      globular domain of a linker histone can control its binding location on the
      nucleosome and higher-order chromatin structure.

AB  - High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is an architectural protein that
      facilitates the formation of protein-DNA assemblies involved in transcription,
      recombination, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling. Important to its function is
      the ability of HMGB1 to bend DNA non-sequence specifically. HMGB1 contains two
      HMG boxes that bind and bend DNA (the A box and the B box) and a C-terminal
      acidic tail. We investigated how these domains contribute to DNA bending by HMGB1
      using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which
      enabled us to resolve heterogeneous populations of bent and unbent DNA. We found 
      that full-length (FL) HMGB1 bent DNA more than the individual A and B boxes.
      Removing the C-terminal tail resulted in a protein that bent DNA to a greater
      extent than the FL protein. These data suggest that the A and B boxes
      simultaneously bind DNA in the absence of the C-terminal tail, but the tail
      modulates DNA binding and bending by one of the HMG boxes in the FL protein.
      Indeed, a construct composed of the B box and the C-terminal tail only bent DNA
      at higher protein concentrations. Moreover, in the context of the FL protein,
      mutating the A box such that it could not bend DNA resulted in a protein that
      bent DNA similar to a single HMG box and only at higher protein concentrations.
      We propose a model in which the HMGB1 C-terminal tail serves as an intramolecular
      damper that modulates the interaction of the B box with DNA.

AB  - Little is understood about how the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region
      (NTR) of the prion protein modulates its misfolding and aggregation, which lead
      to prion disease. In this study, two pathogenic mutations, G113V and A116V, in
      the palindromic region of the NTR are shown to have no effect on the structure,
      stability, or dynamics of native mouse prion protein (moPrP) but nevertheless
      accelerate misfolding and oligomerization. For wild-type moPrP, misfolding and
      oligomerization appear to occur concurrently, while for both mutant variants,
      oligomerization is shown to precede misfolding. Kinetic hydrogen-deuterium
      exchange-mass spectrometry experiments show that sequence segment 89-132 from the
      NTR becomes structured, albeit weakly, during the oligomerization of both mutant 
      variants. Importantly, this structure formation occurs prior to structural
      conversion in the C-terminal domain and appears to be the reason that the
      formation of misfolded oligomers is accelerated by the pathogenic mutations.

AB  - Integrins, which are heterodimeric (alpha and beta subunits) signal-transducer
      proteins, are essential for cell adhesion and migration. beta cytosolic tails
      (beta-CTs) of integrins interact with a number of cytosolic proteins including
      talin, Dok1, and 14-3-3zeta. The formation of multiprotein complexes with
      beta-CTs is involved in the activation and regulation of integrins. The
      leukocyte-specific beta2 integrins are essential for leukocyte trafficking,
      phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and proliferation. In this study, we examined
      the binding interactions between integrin beta2-CT and T758-phosphorylated
      beta2-CT with positive regulators talin and 14-3-3zeta and negative regulator
      Dok1. Residues of the F3 domain of talin belonging to the C-terminal helix,
      beta-strand 5, and the adjacent loop were found to be involved in the binding
      interactions with beta2-CT. The binding affinity between talin F3 and beta2-CT
      was reduced when beta2 T758 was phosphorylated, but this modification promoted
      14-3-3zeta binding. However, we were able to detect stable ternary complex
      formation of T758-phosphorylated beta2-CT, talin F3, and 14-3-3zeta that involved
      the repositioning of talin F3 on beta2-CT. We showed that Dok1 binding to
      beta2-CT was reduced in the presence of 14-3-3zeta and when beta2 T758 was
      phosphorylated. Based on these data, we propose a sequential model of beta2
      integrin activation involving these molecules. Our study provides for the first
      time insights toward beta2 integrin activation that involves a multiprotein
      complex.

AB  - Among the amino acids, cysteine stands apart based on its highly reactive sulfur 
      group. In general, cysteine is underrepresented in proteins. Yet, when present,
      the features of cysteine often afford unique function. We have shown previously
      that a cysteine within the ATPase domain of yeast BiP (Kar2) serves as a sensor
      of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redox environment [1, 2]. Under conditions of
      increased oxidant (oxidative stress), this cysteine becomes oxidized, changing
      Kar2 from an ATP-dependent foldase to an ATP-independent holdase. We were struck 
      by the high degree of conservation for this cysteine between BiP orthologs, and
      we sought to determine how cysteine substitution impacts Kar2 function. We
      observed that no single amino acid replacement is capable of recreating the range
      of functions that can be achieved by wild-type Kar2 with its cysteine in either
      unmodified or oxidized states. However, we were able to generate mutants that
      could selectively replicate the distinct activities exhibited by either
      unmodified or oxidized Kar2. We found that the ATPase activity displayed by
      unmodified Kar2 is fully maintained when Cys63 is replaced with Ala or Val.
      Conversely, we demonstrate that several amino acid substitutions (including His, 
      Phe, Pro, Trp, and Tyr) support an enhanced viability during oxidative stress
      associated with oxidized Kar2, although these alleles are compromised as an
      ATPase. We reveal that the range of activity demonstrated by wild-type Kar2 can
      be replicated by co-expression of Kar2 mutants that mimic either the unmodified
      or oxidized Kar2 state, allowing for growth during standard and oxidative stress 
      conditions.

AB  - Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated in the context of chromatin. Dynamic
      changes in post-translational histone modification are thought to play key roles 
      in fundamental cellular functions such as regulation of the cell cycle,
      development, and differentiation. To elucidate the relationship between histone
      modifications and cellular functions, it is important to monitor the dynamics of 
      modifications in single living cells. A genetically encoded probe called mintbody
      (modification-specific intracellular antibody), which is a single-chain variable 
      fragment tagged with a fluorescent protein, has been proposed as a useful
      visualization tool. However, the efficacy of intracellular expression of antibody
      fragments has been limited, in part due to different environmental conditions in 
      the cytoplasm compared to the endoplasmic reticulum where secreted proteins such 
      as antibodies are folded. In this study, we have developed a new mintbody
      specific for histone H4 Lys20 monomethylation (H4K20me1). The specificity of the 
      H4K20me1-mintbody in living cells was verified using yeast mutants and mammalian 
      cells in which this target modification was diminished. Expression of the
      H4K20me1-mintbody allowed us to monitor the oscillation of H4K20me1 levels during
      the cell cycle. Moreover, dosage-compensated X chromosomes were visualized using 
      the H4K20me1-mintbody in mouse and nematode cells. Using X-ray crystallography
      and mutational analyses, we identified critical amino acids that contributed to
      stabilization and/or proper folding of the mintbody. Taken together, these data
      provide important implications for future studies aimed at developing functional 
      intracellular antibodies. Specifically, the H4K20me1-mintbody provides a powerful
      tool to track this particular histone modification in living cells and organisms.

AB  - The development of drug resistance has long plagued our efforts to curtail viral 
      infections in general and influenza in particular. The problem is particularly
      challenging since the exact mode of resistance may be difficult to predict,
      without waiting for untreatable strains to evolve. Herein, a different approach
      is taken. Using a novel genetic screen, we map the resistance options of
      influenza's M2 channel against its aminoadamantane antiviral inhibitors. In the
      process, we could identify clinically known resistant mutations in a completely
      unbiased manner. Additionally, novel mutations were obtained, which, while known 
      to exist in circulating viruses, were not previously classified as drug
      resistant. Finally, we demonstrated the approach against an anti-influenza drug
      that has not seen clinical use, identifying several resistance mutations in the
      process. In conclusion, we present and employ a method to predict the resistance 
      options of influenza's M2 channel to antiviral agents ahead of clinical use and
      without medical hazard.

AB  - Divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and among
      eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs is focused in expansion segments (ESs). Eukaryotic
      ribosomes are significantly larger than prokaryotic ribosomes partly because of
      their ESs. We hypothesize that larger rRNAs of complex organisms could confer
      increased functionality to the ribosome. Here, we characterize the binding
      partners of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expansion segment 7 (ES7), which is the
      largest and most variable ES of the eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit and is
      located at the surface of the ribosome. In vitro RNA-protein pull-down
      experiments using ES7 as a bait indicate that ES7 is a binding hub for a variety 
      of non-ribosomal proteins essential to ribosomal function in eukaryotes.
      ES7-associated proteins observed here cluster into four groups based on
      biological process, (i) response to abiotic stimulus (e.g., response to external 
      changes in temperature, pH, oxygen level, etc.), (ii) ribosomal large subunit
      biogenesis, (iii) protein transport and localization, and (iv) transcription
      elongation. Seven synthetases, Ala-, Arg-, Asp-, Asn-, Leu-, Lys- and TyrRS,
      appear to associate with ES7. Affinities of AspRS, TyrRS and LysRS for ES7 were
      confirmed by in vitro binding assays. The results suggest that ES7 in S.
      cerevisiae could play a role analogous to the multi-synthetase complex present in
      higher order organisms and could be important for the appropriate function of the
      ribosome. Thermal denaturation studies and footprinting experiments confirm that 
      isolated ES7 is stable and maintains a near-native secondary and tertiary
      structure.

AB  - Tissue necrosis as a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative
      damage is a leading cause of permanent disability and death worldwide. The
      complete mechanism by which cells undergo necrosis upon oxidative stress is not
      understood. In response to an oxidative insult, wild-type p53 has been implicated
      as a central regulatory component of the mitochondrial permeability transition
      (mPT), triggering necrosis. This process is associated with cellular
      stabilization and translocation of p53 into the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we
      probe the mechanism by which p53 activates the key mPT regulator cyclophilin D
      (CypD). We explore the involvement of Trap1, an Hsp90-related mitochondrial
      matrix protein and a member of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, and
      its ability to suppress mPT in a p53-dependent manner. Our study finds that
      catalytically active CypD causes strong aggregation of wild-type p53 protein
      (both full-length and isolated DNA-binding domain) into amyloid-type fibrils in
      vitro. The responsible CypD residues for this activity were mapped by NMR to the 
      active site amino acids R55, F60, F113, and W121. The data also present a new
      proline isomerization assay for CypD by monitoring the aggregation of p53 as an
      indicator of CypD activity. Moreover, we find that the inhibition of Trap1 by the
      mitochondria-specific HSP90 ATPase antagonist Gamitrinib strongly sensitizes
      primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts to mPT and permeability transition pore
      opening in a p53- and CypD-dependent manner. We propose a mechanism by which the 
      influx of unfolded p53 into the mitochondrial matrix in response to oxidative
      stress indirectly activates the normally inhibited CypD by displacing it from
      Trap1 complexes. This activates CypD's isomerase activity. Liberated CypD then
      isomerizes multiple proteins including p53 (causing p53 aggregation) and the
      structural components of the mPTP pore, inducing pore opening. This working model
      can now be tested in the future.

AB  - The sigma factor is a functionally obligatory subunit of the bacterial
      transcription machinery, the RNA polymerase. Bacteriophage-encoded small proteins
      that either modulate or inhibit the bacterial RNAP to allow the temporal
      regulation of bacteriophage gene expression often target the activity of the
      major bacterial sigma factor, sigma(70). Previously, we showed that during
      Xanthomonas oryzae phage Xp10 infection, the phage protein P7 inhibits the host
      RNAP by preventing the productive engagement with the promoter and simultaneously
      displaces the sigma(70) factor from the RNAP. In this study, we demonstrate that 
      P7 also inhibits the productive engagement of the bacterial RNAP containing the
      major variant bacterial sigma factor, sigma(54), with its cognate promoter. The
      results suggest for the first time that the major variant form of the host RNAP
      can also be targeted by bacteriophage-encoded transcription regulatory proteins. 
      Since the major and major variant sigma factor interacting surfaces in the RNAP
      substantially overlap, but different regions of sigma(70) and sigma(54) are used 
      for binding to the RNAP, our results further underscore the importance of the
      sigma-RNAP interface in bacterial RNAP function and regulation and potentially
      for intervention by antibacterials.

AB  - Alternative cell fates represent a form of non-genetic diversity, which can
      promote adaptation and functional specialization. It is difficult to predict the 
      rate of the transition between two cell fates due to the strong effect of noise
      on feedback loops and missing parameters. We opened synthetic positive feedback
      loops experimentally to obtain open-loop functions. These functions allowed us to
      identify a deterministic model of bistability by bypassing noise and the
      requirement to resolve individual processes in the loop. Combining the open-loop 
      function with kinetic measurements and reintroducing the measured noise, we were 
      able to predict the transition rates for the feedback systems without parameter
      tuning. Noise in gene expression was the key determinant of the transition rates 
      inside the bistable range. Transitions between two cell fates were also observed 
      outside of the bistable range, evidenced by bimodality and hysteresis. In this
      case, a slow transient process was the rate-limiting step in the transitions.
      Thus, feedback opening is an effective approach to identify the determinants of
      cell fate transitions and to predict their rates.

AB  - Pupylation, the bacterial equivalent of ubiquitylation, involves the conjugation 
      of a prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) to protein targets. In contrast to 
      the ubiquitin system, where many ubiquitin ligases exist, a single bacterial
      ligase, PafA, catalyzes the conjugation of Pup to a wide array of protein
      targets. As mediators of target recognition by PafA have not been identified, it 
      would appear that PafA alone determines pupylation target selection. Previous
      studies indicated that broad specificity and promiscuity are indeed inherent PafA
      characteristics that probably dictate which proteins are selected for degradation
      by the Pup-proteasome system. Nonetheless, despite the canonical role played by
      PafA in the Pup-proteasome system, the molecular mechanism that dictates target
      binding by PafA remains uncharacterized since the discovery of this enzyme about 
      a decade ago. In this study, we report the identification of PafA residues
      involved in the binding of protein targets. Initially, docking analysis predicted
      the residues on PafA with high potential for target binding. Mutational and
      biochemical approaches subsequently confirmed these predictions and identified a 
      series of additional residues located on an extended loop at the edge of the PafA
      active site. Mutating residues in this loop rendered PafA defective in the
      pupylation of a wide variety of protein targets but not in its catalytic
      mechanism, suggesting an important role for this extended loop in the binding of 
      protein targets. As such, these findings pave the way toward an understanding of 
      the molecular determinants that dictate the broad substrate specificity of PafA.

AB  - Actin cytoskeleton remodeling requires the coordinated action of a large number
      of actin binding proteins that reorganize the actin cytoskeleton by promoting
      polymerization, stabilizing filaments, causing branching, or crosslinking
      filaments. Palladin is a key cytoskeletal actin binding protein whose normal
      function is to enable cell motility during development of tissues and organs of
      the embryo and in wound healing, but palladin is also responsible for regulating 
      the ability of cancer cells to become invasive and metastatic. The membrane
      phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] is a
      well-known precursor for intracellular signaling and a bona fide regulator of
      actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Our results show that two palladin domains
      [immunoglobulin (Ig) 3 and 34] interact with the head group of PI(4,5)P2 with
      moderate affinity (apparent Kd=17muM). Interactions with PI(4,5)P2 decrease the
      actin polymerizing activity of Ig domain 3 of palladin (Palld-Ig3). Furthermore, 
      NMR titration and docking studies show that residues K38 and K51, which are
      present on the beta-sheet C and D, form salt bridges with the head group of
      PI(4,5)P2. Moreover, charge neutralization at lysine 38 in the Palld-Ig3 domain
      severely limits the actin polymerizing and bundling activity of Palld-Ig3. Our
      results provide biochemical proof that PI(4,5)P2 functions as a moderator of
      palladin activity and have also identified residues directly involved in the
      crosslinking activity of palladin.

AB  - Plasmodium falciparum, the primary cause of malaria, contains a
      non-photosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast. The apicoplast exists in most
      members of the phylum Apicomplexa and has its own genome along with
      organelle-specific enzymes for its replication. The only DNA polymerase found in 
      the apicoplast (apPOL) was putatively acquired through horizontal gene transfer
      from a bacteriophage and is classified as an atypical A-family polymerase. Here, 
      we present its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.9A. P. falciparum apPOL,
      the first structural representative of a plastidic A-family polymerase, diverges 
      from typical A-family members in two of three previously identified signature
      motifs and in a region not implicated by sequence. Moreover, apPOL has an
      additional N-terminal subdomain, the absence of which severely diminishes its 3' 
      to 5' exonuclease activity. A compound known to be toxic to Plasmodium is a
      potent inhibitor of apPOL, suggesting that apPOL is a viable drug target. The
      structure provides new insights into the structural diversity of A-family
      polymerases and may facilitate structurally guided antimalarial drug design.

AB  - In mammals, the non-heme iron enzyme cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) helps regulate
      Cys levels through converting Cys to Cys sulfinic acid. Its activity is in part
      modulated by the formation of a Cys93-Tyr157 crosslink that increases its
      catalytic efficiency over 10-fold. Here, 21 high-resolution mammalian CDO
      structures are used to gain insight into how the Cys-Tyr crosslink promotes
      activity and how select competitive inhibitors bind. Crystal structures of
      crosslink-deficient C93A and Y157F variants reveal similar ~1.0-A shifts in the
      side chain of residue 157, and both variant structures have a new chloride ion
      coordinating the active site iron. Cys binding is also different from wild-type
      CDO, and no Cys-persulfenate forms in the C93A or Y157F active sites at pH6.2 or 
      8.0. We conclude that the crosslink enhances activity by positioning the Tyr157
      hydroxyl to enable proper Cys binding, proper oxygen binding, and optimal
      chemistry. In addition, structures are presented for homocysteine (Hcy), D-Cys,
      thiosulfate, and azide bound as competitive inhibitors. The observed binding
      modes of Hcy and D-Cys clarify why they are not substrates, and the binding of
      azide shows that in contrast to what has been proposed, it does not bind in these
      crystals as a superoxide mimic.

AB  - Autotrophic bacteria rely on various mechanisms to increase intracellular
      concentrations of inorganic forms of carbon (i.e., bicarbonate and CO2) in order 
      to improve the efficiency with which they can be converted to organic forms.
      Transmembrane bicarbonate transporters and carboxysomes play key roles in
      accumulating bicarbonate and CO2, but other regulatory elements of carbon
      concentration mechanisms in bacteria are less understood. In this study, after
      analyzing the genomic regions around alpha-type carboxysome operons, we
      characterize a protein that is conserved across these operons but has not been
      previously studied. On the basis of a series of apo- and ligand-bound crystal
      structures and supporting biochemical data, we show that this protein, which we
      refer to as the carboxysome-associated PII protein (CPII), represents a new and
      distinct subfamily within the broad superfamily of previously studied PII
      regulatory proteins, which are generally involved in regulating nitrogen
      metabolism in bacteria. CPII undergoes dramatic conformational changes in
      response to ADP binding, and the affinity for nucleotide binding is strongly
      enhanced by the presence of bicarbonate. CPII therefore appears to be a unique
      type of PII protein that senses bicarbonate availability, consistent with its
      apparent genomic association with the carboxysome and its constituents.

AB  - Structured RNAs fold through multiple pathways, but we have little understanding 
      of the molecular features that dictate folding pathways and determine rates along
      a given pathway. Here, we asked whether folding of a complex RNA can be
      understood from its structural modules. In a two-piece version of the Tetrahymena
      group I ribozyme, the separated P5abc subdomain folds to local native secondary
      and tertiary structure in a linked transition and assembles with the ribozyme
      core via three tertiary contacts: a kissing loop (P14), a metal core-receptor
      interaction, and a tetraloop-receptor interaction, the first two of which are
      expected to depend on native P5abc structure from the local transition. Native
      gel, NMR, and chemical footprinting experiments showed that mutations that
      destabilize the native P5abc structure slowed assembly up to 100-fold, indicating
      that P5abc folds first and then assembles with the core by conformational
      selection. However, rate decreases beyond 100-fold were not observed because an
      alternative pathway becomes dominant, with nonnative P5abc binding the core and
      then undergoing an induced-fit rearrangement. P14 is formed in the rate-limiting 
      step along the conformational selection pathway but after the rate-limiting step 
      along the induced-fit pathway. Strikingly, the assembly rate along the
      conformational selection pathway resembles that of an isolated kissing loop
      similar to P14, and the rate along the induced-fit pathway resembles that of an
      isolated tetraloop-receptor interaction. Our results indicate substantial
      modularity in RNA folding and assembly and suggest that these processes can be
      understood in terms of underlying structural modules.

AB  - Quantifying protein location and concentration is critical for understanding
      function in situ. Scaffold conjugated to environment-sensitive fluorophore
      (SuCESsFul) biosensors, in which a reporting fluorophore is conjugated to a
      binding scaffold, can, in principle, detect analytes of interest with high
      temporal and spatial resolution. However, their adoption has been limited due to 
      the extensive empirical screening required for their development. We sought to
      establish design principles for this class of biosensor by characterizing over
      400 biosensors based on various protein analytes, binding proteins, and
      fluorophores. We found that the brightest readouts are attained when a specific
      binding pocket for the fluorophore is present on the analyte. Also, interaction
      of the fluorophore with the binding protein it is conjugated to can raise
      background fluorescence, considerably limiting sensor dynamic range. Exploiting
      these two concepts, we designed biosensors that attain a 100-fold increase in
      fluorescence upon binding to analyte, an order of magnitude improvement over the 
      previously best-reported SuCESsFul biosensor. These design principles should
      facilitate the development of improved SuCESsFul biosensors.

AB  - The interaction between apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and rhoptry neck protein
      2 (RON2) plays a key role in the invasion of red blood cells by Plasmodium
      parasites. Disruption of this critical protein-protein interaction represents a
      promising avenue for antimalarial drug discovery. In this work, we exploited a
      13-residue beta-hairpin based on the C-terminal loop of RON2 to probe a conserved
      binding site on Plasmodium falciparum AMA1. A series of mutations was
      synthetically engineered into beta-hairpin peptides to establish
      structure-activity relationships. The best mutations improved the binding
      affinity of the beta-hairpin peptide by ~7-fold for 3D7 AMA1 and ~14-fold for FVO
      AMA1. We determined the crystal structures of several beta-hairpin peptides in
      complex with AMA1 in order to define the structural features and specific
      interactions that contribute to improved binding affinity. The same mutations in 
      the longer RON2sp2 peptide (residues 2027-2055 of RON2) increased the binding
      affinity by >30-fold for 3D7 and FVO AMA1, producing KD values of 2.1nM and
      0.4nM, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the most potent
      strain-transcending peptide reported to date and represents a valuable tool to
      characterize the AMA1-RON2 interaction.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating that protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a crucial
      role in the ability of important human bacterial pathogens to cause disease.
      While most works have concentrated on its role in the regulation of a major
      bacterial virulence factor, the polysaccharide capsule, recent studies have
      suggested a much broader role for this post-translational modification. This
      prompted us to investigate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the human pathogen
      Shigella flexneri. We first completed a tyrosine phosphoproteome, identifying 905
      unique tyrosine phosphorylation sites on at least 573 proteins (approximately 15%
      of all proteins). This is the most tyrosine-phosphorylated sites and proteins in 
      a single bacterium identified to date, substantially more than the level seen in 
      eukaryotic cells. Most had not previously been identified and included proteins
      encoded by the virulence plasmid, which is essential for S. flexneri to invade
      cells and cause disease. In order to investigate the function of these
      phosphorylation sites in important virulence factors, phosphomimetic and ablative
      mutations were constructed in the type 3 secretion system ATPase Spa47 and the
      master virulence regulator VirB. This revealed that tyrosine residues
      phosphorylated in our study are critical for Spa47 and VirB activity, and
      tyrosine phosphorylation likely regulates their functional activity and
      subsequently the virulence of this major human pathogen. This study suggests that
      tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating a wide variety of
      virulence factors in the human pathogen S. flexneri and serves as a base for
      future studies defining its complete role.

AB  - Two-component systems (TCS) comprising sensor histidine kinases and response
      regulator proteins are among the most important players in bacterial and archaeal
      signal transduction and also occur in reduced numbers in some eukaryotic
      organisms. Given their importance to cellular survival, virulence, and cellular
      development, these systems are among the most scrutinized bacterial proteins. In 
      the recent years, a flurry of bioinformatics, genetic, biochemical, and
      structural studies have provided detailed insights into many molecular mechanisms
      that underlie the detection of signals and the generation of the appropriate
      response by TCS. Importantly, it has become clear that there is significant
      diversity in the mechanisms employed by individual systems. This review discusses
      the current knowledge on common themes and divergences from the paradigm of TCS
      signaling. An emphasis is on the information gained by a flurry of recent
      structural and bioinformatics studies.

AB  - Heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) mainly
      relay the information from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the plasma
      membrane to the inside of cells to regulate various biochemical functions.
      Depending on the targeted cell types, tissues, and organs, these signals modulate
      diverse physiological functions. The basic schemes of heterotrimeric G-proteins
      have been outlined. In this review, we briefly summarize what is known about the 
      regulation, signaling, and physiological functions of G-proteins. We then focus
      on a few less explored areas such as the regulation of G-proteins by non-GPCRs
      and the physiological functions of G-proteins that cannot be easily explained by 
      the known G-protein signaling pathways. There are new signaling pathways and
      physiological functions for G-proteins to be discovered and further interrogated.
      With the advancements in structural and computational biological techniques, we
      are closer to having a better understanding of how G-proteins are regulated and
      of the specificity of G-protein interactions with their regulators.

AB  - Cellular levels of the second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate
      (c-di-GMP) are determined by the antagonistic activities of diguanylate cyclases 
      and specific phosphodiesterases. In a given bacterial organism, there are often
      multiple variants of the two enzymes, which are tightly regulated by a variety of
      external and internal cues due to the presence of specialized sensory or
      regulatory domains. Dependent on the second messenger level, specific c-di-GMP
      receptors then control fundamental cellular processes, such as bacterial life
      style, biofilm formation, and cell cycle control. Here, I review the large body
      of data on structure-function relationships in diguanylate cyclases. Although the
      catalytic GGDEF domain is related to the respective domain of adenylate cyclases,
      the catalyzed intermolecular condensation reaction of two GTP molecules requires 
      the formation of a competent GGDEF dimer with the two substrate molecules
      juxtaposed. This prerequisite appears to constitute the basis for GGDEF
      regulation with signal-induced changes within the homotypic dimer of the input
      domain (PAS, GAF, HAMP, etc.), which are structurally coupled with the
      arrangement of the GGDEF domains via a rigid coiled-coil linker. Alternatively,
      phosphorylation of a Rec input domain can drive GGDEF dimerization. Both
      mechanisms allow modular combination of input and output function that appears
      advantageous for evolution and rationalizes the striking similarities in domain
      architecture found in diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases.

AB  - S-Nitrosylation is well established as an important post-translational regulator 
      in protein function and signaling. However, relatively little is known about its 
      structural and dynamical consequences. We have investigated the effects of
      S-nitrosylation on the rhodanese domain of the Escherichia coli integral membrane
      protein YgaP by NMR, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. The results
      show that the active cysteine in the rhodanese domain of YgaP is subjected to two
      competing modifications: S-nitrosylation and S-sulfhydration, which are naturally
      occurring in vivo. It has been observed that in addition to inhibition of the
      sulfur transfer activity, S-nitrosylation of the active site residue Cys63 causes
      an increase in slow motion and a displacement of helix 5 due to a weakening of
      the interaction between the active site and the helix dipole. These findings
      provide an example of how nitrosative stress can exert action at the atomic
      level.

AB  - Signal transduction, or how cells interpret and react to external events, is a
      fundamental aspect of cellular function. Traditional study of signal transduction
      pathways involves mapping cellular signaling pathways at the population level.
      However, population-averaged readouts do not adequately illuminate the complex
      dynamics and heterogeneous responses found at the single-cell level. Recent
      technological advances that observe cellular response, computationally model
      signaling pathways, and experimentally manipulate cells now enable studying
      signal transduction at the single-cell level. These studies will enable deeper
      insights into the dynamic nature of signaling networks.

AB  - Myxococcus xanthus is an environmental bacterium that displays a complex life
      cycle that includes motility, predation, multicellular fruiting body development,
      and sporulation. Given the elaborate fruiting body development of this bacterial 
      species, M. xanthus has served as a model organism for the study of multicellular
      development of bacteria, and a remarkable number of genes have been identified
      that contribute to the regulation of this highly dynamic process. Included among 
      these developmental factors is a robust repertoire of signaling proteins, which
      have arisen from extensive gene duplication in M. xanthus and related species. In
      this review, we explore several aspects of the molecular mechanisms of signaling 
      in M. xanthus development. This includes mechanisms of kin selection, single-cell
      sensing of nutrient depletion and the stringent response, the production of and
      response to extracellular population cues, and the contribution of several
      two-component signaling systems regulating developmental transcriptional
      programs. Collectively, these signaling mechanisms function to tightly regulate
      the sensing of nutrient depletion, the aggregation of populations of cells, and
      the temporal and spatial formation of complex fruiting bodies and sporulation of 
      M. xanthus.

AB  - Progesterone receptor (PR) is a master regulator in female reproductive tissues
      that controls developmental processes and proliferation and differentiation
      during the reproductive cycle and pregnancy. PR also plays a role in progression 
      of endocrine-dependent breast cancer. As a member of the nuclear receptor family 
      of ligand-dependent transcription factors, the main action of PR is to regulate
      networks of target gene expression in response to binding its cognate steroid
      hormone, progesterone. This paper summarizes recent advances in understanding the
      structure-function properties of the receptor protein and the
      tissue/cell-type-specific PR signaling pathways that contribute to the biological
      actions of progesterone in the normal breast and in breast cancer.

TI  - Bacterial Chemoreceptor Dynamics: Helical Stability in the Cytoplasmic Domain
      Varies with Functional Segment and Adaptational Modification.

AB  - Dynamics are thought to be important features of structure and signaling in the
      cytoplasmic domain of bacterial chemoreceptors. However, little is known about
      which structural features are dynamic. For this largely helical domain,
      comprising a four-helix bundle and an extended four-helix coiled coil,
      functionally important structural dynamics likely involves helical mobility and
      stability. To investigate, we used continuous wave EPR spectroscopy and
      site-specific spin labels that directly probed, in essentially physiological
      conditions, the mobility of helical backbones in the cytoplasmic domain of intact
      chemoreceptor Tar homodimers inserted into lipid bilayers of Nanodiscs. We
      observed differences among functional regions, between companion helices in
      helical hairpins of the coiled coil and between receptor conformational states
      generated by adaptational modification. Increased adaptational modification
      decreased helical dynamics while preserving dynamics differences among functional
      regions and between companion helices. In contrast, receptor ligand occupancy did
      not have a discernable effect on dynamics to which our approach was sensitive,
      implying that the two sensory inputs alter different chemoreceptor features.
      Spectral fitting indicated that differences in helical dynamics we observed for
      ensemble spin-label mobility reflected differences in proportions of a minority
      receptor population in which the otherwise helical backbone was essentially
      disordered. We suggest that our measurements provided site-specific snapshots of 
      equilibria between a majority state of well-ordered helix and a minority state of
      locally disordered polypeptide backbone. Thus, the proportion of polypeptide
      chain that is locally and presumably transiently disordered is a structural
      feature of cytoplasmic domain dynamics that varies with functional region and
      modification-induced signaling state.

AB  - Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domains represent the photo-responsive domains of
      various blue-light photoreceptor proteins and are widely distributed in plants,
      algae, fungi, and bacteria. Here, we report the dark-state crystal structure of
      PpSB1-LOV, a slow-reverting short LOV protein from Pseudomonas putida that is
      remarkably different from our previously published "fully light-adapted"
      structure [1]. A direct comparison of the two structures provides insight into
      the light-activated signaling mechanism. Major structural differences involve
      a~11A movement of the C terminus in helix Jalpha, ~4A movement of Hbeta-Ibeta
      loop, disruption of hydrogen bonds in the dimer interface, and a~29 degrees
      rotation of chain-B relative to chain-A as compared to the light-state dimer.
      Both crystal structures and solution NMR data are suggestive of the key roles of 
      a conserved glutamine Q116 and the N-cap region consisting of A'alpha-Abeta loop 
      and the A'alpha helix in controlling the light-activated conformational changes. 
      The activation mechanism proposed here for the PpSB1-LOV supports a rotary switch
      mechanism and provides insights into the signal propagation mechanism in
      naturally existing and artificial LOV-based, two-component systems and
      regulators.

      Xanthomonas campestris Provides Clues to its Long-Range Signaling Mechanism.

AB  - Phytochromes constitute a major superfamily of light-sensing proteins that are
      reversibly photoconverted between a red-absorbing (Pr) and a far-red-absorbing
      (Pfr) state. Bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) are found among photosynthetic and
      non-photosynthetic bacteria, including pathogens. To date, several BphPs have
      been biophysically characterized. However, it is still not fully understood how
      structural changes are propagated from the photosensory module to the output
      module during the signal transduction event. Most phytochromes share a common
      architecture consisting of an N-terminal photosensor that includes the
      PAS2-GAF-PHY domain triad and a C-terminal variable output module. Here we
      present the crystal structure of the full-length BphP from the plant pathogen
      Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (XccBphP) bearing its photosensor and its
      complete output module, a PAS9 domain. In the crystals, the protein was found to 
      be in the Pr state, whereas diffraction data together with resonance Raman
      spectroscopic and theoretical results indicate a ZZZssa and a ZZEssa chromophore 
      configuration corresponding to a mixture of Pr and Meta-R state, the precursor of
      Pfr. The XccBphP quaternary assembly reveals a head-to-head dimer in which the
      output module contributes to the helical dimer interface. The photosensor, which 
      is shown to be a bathy-like BphP, is influenced in its dark reactions by the
      output module. Our structural analyses suggest that the photoconversion between
      the Pr and Pfr states in the full-length XccBphP may involve changes in the
      relative positioning of the output module. This work contributes to understand
      the light-induced structural changes propagated from the photosensor to the
      output modules in phytochrome signaling.

TI  - Differential Regulation of CXCL8 Production by Different G Protein Subunits with 
      Synergistic Stimulation by Gi- and Gq-Regulated Pathways.
PG  - 3869-84
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2016.03.026 [doi]

AB  - CXCL8 (also known as interleukin-8 or IL-8) is a proinflammatory chemokine that
      not only modulates the inflammatory and immune responses, but whose upregulation 
      is often associated with diseases including various types of cancer. Although
      numerous ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to
      stimulate the production of CXCL8, the specificity of the G protein signal
      remains undefined. By expressing the constitutively active Galpha subunits in
      HEK293 cells, CXCL8 production was herein demonstrated to be most effectively
      stimulated by Galphaq family members, while those of Galphas and Galpha12
      elicited much weaker activities, and Galphai being totally ineffective. However, 
      in cell lines such as HepG2, HeLa, and MCF-7 that endogenously express
      Gbetagamma-responsive phospholipase Cbeta isoforms (PLCbeta2/3), activation of
      the Gi-coupled alpha2-adrenoceptor significantly stimulated CXCL8 production.
      This Gi-induced CXCL8 production was apparently mediated via specific Gbetagamma 
      dimers and required the presence of PLCbeta2/3. Co-activation of Gi-coupled
      alpha2-adrenoceptor and Gq-coupled bradykinin receptor resulted in a synergistic 
      CXCL8 production, with Gbetagamma-responsive PLCbeta2/3, Src, ERK, and STAT3
      serving as critical signaling intermediates. The treatment of HepG2 and B-10
      endothelial cells with bradykinin stimulated CXCL8 production and cell
      proliferation. Interestingly, the latter response was driven by CXCL8 autocrine
      signaling because it was abolished by SB225002, an antagonist that prevents CXCL8
      from binding to CXCR2. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic basis for 
      various G protein subfamilies to regulate the production of CXCL8, which may then
      lead to paracrine and/or autocrine signaling with major implications in both
      normal physiology and pathophysiological conditions.

AB  - The Escherichia coli Tsr protein contains a periplasmic serine-binding domain
      that transmits ligand occupancy information to a cytoplasmic kinase-control
      domain to regulate the cell's flagellar motors. The Tsr input and output domains 
      communicate through conformational changes transmitted through a transmembrane
      helix (TM2), a five-residue control cable helix at the membrane-cytoplasm
      interface, and a four-helix HAMP bundle. Changes in serine occupancy are known to
      promote TM2 piston displacements in one subunit of the Tsr homodimer. We explored
      how such piston motions might be relayed through the control cable to reach the
      input AS1 helix of HAMP by constructing and characterizing mutant receptors that 
      had one-residue insertions or deletions in the TM2-control cable segment of Tsr. 
      TM2 deletions caused kinase-off output shifts; TM2 insertions caused kinase-on
      shifts. In contrast, control cable deletions caused kinase-on output, whereas
      insertions at the TM2-control cable junction caused kinase-off output. These
      findings rule out direct mechanical transmission of TM2 conformational changes to
      HAMP. Instead, we suggest that the Tsr control cable transmits input signals to
      HAMP by modulating the intensity of structural clashes between out-of-register
      TM2 and AS1 helices. Inward displacement of TM2 might alter the sidechain
      environment of control cable residues at the membrane core-headgroup interface,
      causing a break in the control cable helix to attenuate the register mismatch and
      enhance HAMP packing stability, leading to a kinase-off output response. This
      helix-clutch model offers a new perspective on the mechanism of transmembrane
      signaling in chemoreceptors.

AB  - Trigger factor (TF) is the only ribosome-associated chaperone in bacteria. It
      interacts with hydrophobic segments in nascent chain (NCs) as they emerge from
      the ribosome. TF binds via its N-terminal ribosome-binding domain (RBD) mainly to
      ribosomal protein uL23 at the tunnel exit on the large ribosomal subunit. Whereas
      earlier structural data suggested that TF binds as a rigid molecule to the
      ribosome, recent comparisons of structural data on substrate-bound,
      ribosome-bound, and TF in solution from different species suggest that this
      chaperone is a rather flexible molecule. Here, we present two cryo-electron
      microscopy structures of TF bound to ribosomes translating an mRNA coding for a
      known TF substrate from Escherichia coli of a different length. The structures
      reveal distinct degrees of flexibility for the different TF domains, a
      conformational rearrangement of the RBD upon ribosome binding, and an increase in
      rigidity within TF when the NC is extended. Molecular dynamics simulations agree 
      with these data and offer a molecular basis for these observations.

AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential components of the protein translational 
      machinery in all living species, among which the human glycyl-tRNA synthetase
      (hGlyRS) is of great research interest because of its unique species-specific
      aminoacylation properties and noncanonical roles in the Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      neurological disease. However, the molecular mechanisms of how the enzyme carries
      out its classical and alternative functions are not well understood. Here, we
      report a complex structure of the wild-type hGlyRS bound with tRNA(Gly) at 2.95A.
      In the complex, the flexible Whep-TRS domain is visible in one of the subunits of
      the enzyme dimer, and the tRNA molecule is also completely resolved. At the
      active site, a glycyl-AMP molecule is synthesized and is waiting for the transfer
      of the glycyl moiety to occur. This cocrystal structure provides us with new
      details about the recognition mechanism in the intermediate stage during
      glycylation, which was not well elucidated in the previous crystal structures
      where the inhibitor AMPPNP was used for crystallization. More importantly, the
      structural and biochemical work conducted in the current and previous studies
      allows us to build a model of the full-length hGlyRS in complex with tRNA(Gly),
      which greatly helps us to understand the roles that insertions and the Whep-TRS
      domain play in the tRNA-binding process. Finally, through structure comparison
      with other class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases bound with their tRNA substrates, 
      we found some commonalities of the aminoacylation mechanism between these
      enzymes.

TI  - The Termination Phase in Protein Synthesis is not Obligatorily Followed by the
      RRF/EF-G-Dependent Recycling Phase.

AB  - It is general wisdom that termination of bacterial protein synthesis is
      obligatorily followed by recycling governed by the factors ribosomal recycling
      factor (RRF), EF-G, and IF3, where the ribosome dissociates into its subunits. In
      contrast, a recently described 70S-scanning mode of initiation holds that after
      termination, scanning of 70S can be triggered by fMet-tRNA to the initiation site
      of a downstream cistron. Here, we analyze the apparent conflict. We constructed a
      bicistronic mRNA coding for luciferases and showed with a highly resolved in
      vitro system that the expression of the second cistron did not at all depend on
      the presence of active RRF. An in vivo analysis cannot be performed in a
      straightforward way, since RRF is essential for viability and therefore, the RRF 
      gene cannot be knocked out. However, we found an experimental window, where the
      RRF amount could be reduced to below 2.5%, and in this situation, the expression 
      of the second cistron of a bicistronic luciferase mRNA was only moderately
      reduced. Both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that RRF-dependent recycling
      is not an obligatory step after termination, in agreement with the previous
      findings concerning 70S-scanning initiation. In this view, recycling after
      termination is a special case of the general RRF function, which happens whenever
      fMet-tRNA is not available for triggering 70S scanning.

AB  - Gene expression and regulation in organisms minimally depends on transcription by
      RNA polymerase and on the stability of the RNA product (for both coding and
      non-coding RNAs). For coding RNAs, gene expression is further influenced by the
      amount of translation by the ribosome and by the stability of the protein
      product. The stabilities of these two classes of RNA, non-coding and coding, vary
      considerably: tRNAs and rRNAs tend to be long lived while mRNAs tend to be more
      short lived. Even among mRNAs, however, there is a considerable range in
      stability (ranging from seconds to hours in bacteria and up to days in
      metazoans), suggesting a significant role for stability in the regulation of gene
      expression. Here, we review recent experiments from bacteria, yeast and metazoans
      indicating that the stability of most mRNAs is broadly impacted by the actions of
      ribosomes that translate them. Ribosomal recognition of defective mRNAs triggers 
      "mRNA surveillance" pathways that target the mRNA for degradation [Shoemaker and 
      Green (2012) ]. More generally, even the stability of perfectly functional mRNAs 
      appears to be dictated by overall rates of translation by the ribosome [Herrick
      et al. (1990), Presnyak et al. (2015) ]. Given that mRNAs are synthesized for the
      purpose of being translated into proteins, it is reassuring that such intimate
      connections between mRNA and the ribosome can drive biological regulation. In
      closing, we consider the likelihood that these connections between protein
      synthesis and mRNA stability are widespread or whether other modes of regulation 
      dominate the mRNA stability landscape in higher organisms.

AB  - Eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A promotes protein synthesis by
      resolving polyproline-induced ribosomal stalling. Here, we report a 3.25-A
      resolution crystal structure of eIF5A bound to the yeast 80S ribosome. The
      structure reveals a previously unseen conformation of an eIF5A-ribosome complex
      and highlights a possible functional link between conformational changes of the
      ribosome during protein synthesis and the eIF5A-ribosome association.

AB  - Interactions between ribosomal proteins (rproteins) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
      facilitate the formation of functional ribosomes. S15 is a central domain primary
      binding protein that has been shown to trigger a cascade of conformational
      changes in 16S rRNA, forming the functional structure of the central domain.
      Previous biochemical and structural studies in vitro have revealed that S15 binds
      a three-way junction of helices 20, 21, and 22, including nucleotides 652-654 and
      752-754. All junction nucleotides except 653 are highly conserved among the
      Bacteria. To identify functionally important motifs within the junction, we
      subjected nucleotides 652-654 and 752-754 to saturation mutagenesis and selected 
      and analyzed functional mutants. Only 64 mutants with greater than 10% ribosome
      function in vivo were isolated. S15 overexpression complemented mutations in the 
      junction loop in each of the partially active mutants, although mutations that
      produced inactive ribosomes were not complemented by overexpression of S15.
      Single-molecule Forster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) was
      used to study the Mg(2+)- and S15-induced conformational dynamics of selected
      junction mutants. Comparison of the structural dynamics of these mutants with the
      wild type in the presence and absence of S15 revealed specific sequence and
      structural motifs in the central junction that are important in ribosome
      function.

      Functions in Gene Expression Independent of Splicing.

AB  - The interaction between splicing factors and the transcriptional machinery
      provides an intriguing link between the coupled processes of transcription and
      splicing. Here, we show that the two components of the SF3B complex, SF3B3 and
      SF3B5, that form part of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) 
      are also subunits of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) transcriptional
      coactivator complex in Drosophila melanogaster. Whereas SF3B3 had previously been
      identified as a human SAGA subunit, SF3B5 had not been identified as a component 
      of SAGA in any species. We show that SF3B3 and SF3B5 bind to SAGA independent of 
      RNA and interact with multiple SAGA subunits including Sgf29 and Spt7 in a yeast 
      two-hybrid assay. Through analysis of sf3b5 mutant flies, we show that SF3B5 is
      necessary for proper development and cell viability but not for histone
      acetylation. Although SF3B5 does not appear to function in SAGA's
      histone-modifying activities, SF3B5 is still required for expression of a subset 
      of SAGA-regulated genes independent of splicing. Thus, our data support an
      independent function of SF3B5 in SAGA's transcription coactivator activity that
      is separate from its role in splicing.

AB  - As high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of
      ribosomes proliferate, at resolutions that allow atomic interactions to be
      visualized, this article attempts to give a perspective on the way research on
      ribosome structure and dynamics may be headed, and particularly the new
      opportunities we have gained through recent advances in cryo-EM. It is pointed
      out that single-molecule FRET and cryo-EM form natural complements in the
      characterization of ribosome dynamics and transitions among equilibrating states 
      of in vitro translational systems.

AB  - The X-linked AIFM1 gene encodes mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), an
      FAD-containing and NADH-specific oxidoreductase critically important for energy
      metabolism and execution of the caspase-independent cell death pathway. Several
      recently identified mutations in human AIFM1 lead to neurodegenerative disorders 
      varying in severity and onset time. This study was undertaken to structurally and
      functionally characterize four pathologic variants of human AIF: V243L, G262S,
      G308E, and G338E. A strong correlation between the mutational effects on the AIF 
      function and clinical phenotype was observed only for the G308E aberration,
      drastically damaging both the redox properties of AIF and mitochondrial
      respiration. In contrast, only minimal or mild changes were detected in the
      structure/function of AIF V243L and G338E, respectively, indicating that a marked
      decrease in their cellular expression likely triggers the disease. Alterations in
      the structure and redox activity of AIF G262S, on the other hand, were more
      severe than could be predicted based on the clinical phenotype. Together, the
      results of this and previous studies allow to conclude that the phenotypic
      variability and severity of the AIFM1-related disorders depend on which AIF
      feature is predominantly affected (i.e., cellular production level, structure,
      redox or apoptogenic function) and to what extent. Only a drastic decrease in the
      expression level or/and redox activity of AIF tends to cause an early and severe 
      neurodegeneration, whereas less pronounced changes in the AIF properties could
      lead to a broad range of slowly progressive neurological disorders.

AB  - Marburg virus (MARV), a member of the Filoviridae family that also includes Ebola
      virus (EBOV), causes lethal hemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates that have 
      exceeded 50% in some outbreaks. Within an infected cell, there are numerous
      host-viral interactions that contribute to the outcome of infection. Recent
      studies identified MARV protein 24 (mVP24) as a modulator of the host
      antioxidative responses, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Using a
      combination of biochemical and mass spectrometry studies, we show that mVP24 is a
      dimer in solution that directly binds to the Kelch domain of Kelch-like
      ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) to regulate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
      2)-like 2 (Nrf2). This interaction between Keap1 and mVP24 occurs through the
      Kelch interaction loop (K-Loop) of mVP24 leading to upregulation of antioxidant
      response element transcription, which is distinct from other Kelch binders that
      regulate Nrf2 activity. N-terminal truncations disrupt mVP24 dimerization,
      allowing monomeric mVP24 to bind Kelch with higher affinity and stimulate higher 
      antioxidative stress response element (ARE) reporter activity. Mass
      spectrometry-based mapping of the interface revealed overlapping binding sites on
      Kelch for mVP24 and the Nrf2 proteins. Substitution of conserved cysteines, C209 
      and C210, to alanine in the mVP24 K-Loop abrogates Kelch binding and ARE
      activation. Our studies identify a shift in the monomer-dimer equilibrium of MARV
      VP24, driven by its interaction with Keap1 Kelch domain, as a critical
      determinant that modulates host responses to pathogenic Marburg viral infections.

AB  - The host innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against viral
      infections. Germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors detect molecular
      patterns associated with pathogens and activate innate immune responses. Of
      particular relevance to viral infections are those pattern recognition receptors 
      that activate type I interferon responses, which establish an antiviral state.
      The order Mononegavirales is composed of viruses that possess single-stranded,
      non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA genomes and are important human pathogens 
      that consistently antagonize signaling related to type I interferon responses.
      NNS viruses have limited encoding capacity compared to many DNA viruses, and as a
      likely consequence, most open reading frames encode multifunctional viral
      proteins that interact with host factors in order to evade host cell defenses
      while promoting viral replication. In this review, we will discuss the molecular 
      mechanisms of innate immune evasion by select NNS viruses. A greater
      understanding of these interactions will be critical in facilitating the
      development of effective therapeutics and viral countermeasures.

AB  - Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal recycling process, which maintains cellular
      homeostasis during stress and starvation conditions by degrading and recycling
      proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, ultimately increasing nutrient availability 
      in eukaryotes. An additional function of autophagy, termed xenophagy, is to
      detect, capture, and destroy invading microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, 
      and protozoa, providing autophagy with a role in innate immunity. Many
      intracellular pathogens have, however, developed mechanisms to avoid xenophagy
      and have evolved strategies to take advantage of select autophagic processes to
      undergo their intracellular life cycle. This review article will discuss the
      molecular mechanisms used by the intracellular bacterial pathogens Francisella
      spp. and Brucella spp. to manipulate components of the autophagic pathway,
      promoting cytosolic growth in the case of Francisella spp. and facilitating
      cellular egress and cell-to-cell spread in the case of Brucella spp. These
      examples highlight how successful, highly infectious bacterial pathogens avoid or
      subvert host autophagy mechanisms normally employed to maintain eukaryotic
      homeostasis.

AB  - In the absence of lipid envelopes and associated fusion proteins, non-enveloped
      viruses employ membrane lytic peptides to breach the limiting membranes of host
      cells. Although several of these lytic peptides have been identified and
      characterized, their manner of deployment and interaction with host membranes
      remains unclear in most cases. We are using the gamma peptide of Flock House
      Virus (FHV), a model non-enveloped virus, to understand the mechanistic details
      of non-enveloped virus interaction with host cell membranes. We utilized a
      combination of biophysical assays, molecular dynamics simulation studies, and
      single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the functional and
      structural determinants for membrane penetration by gamma in context of the FHV
      capsid. Although the amphipathic, helical N-terminal region of gamma (gamma1) was
      previously thought to be the membrane-penetrating module, with the C-terminal
      region having a supporting role in correct structural positioning of gamma1, we
      demonstrate that the C terminus of gamma directly participates in membrane
      penetration. Our studies suggest that full-length gamma, including the
      hydrophobic C terminus, forms an alpha-helical hairpin motif, and any disruption 
      in this motif drastically reduces its functionality, in spite of the correct
      positioning of amphipathic gamma1 in the virus capsid. Taken together, our data
      suggest that the most effective module for membrane disruption is a pentameric
      unit of full-length gamma, released from the virus, which associates with
      membranes via both N- and C-terminal ends.

AB  - Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (A3G) is a
      host restriction factor that impedes HIV-1 replication. Viral integrity is
      salvaged by HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif), which mediates A3G
      polyubiquitination and subsequent cellular depletion. Previous studies have
      implied that A3G polyubiquitination is essential for Vif-induced degradation.
      However, the contribution of polyubiquitination to the rate of A3G degradation
      remains unclear. Here, we show that A3G polyubiquitination is essential for
      degradation. Inhibition of ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 by PYR-41 or blocking
      the formation of ubiquitin chains by over-expressing the lysine to arginine
      mutation of ubiquitin K48 (K48R) inhibited A3G degradation. Our A3G mutagenesis
      study showed that lysine residues 297, 301, 303, and 334 were not sufficient to
      render lysine-free A3G sensitive to Vif-mediated degradation. Our data also
      confirm that Vif could induce ubiquitin chain formation on lysine residues
      interspersed throughout A3G. Notably, A3G degradation relied on the lysine
      residues involved in polyubiquitination. Although A3G and the A3G C-terminal
      mutant interacted with Vif and were modified by ubiquitin chains, the latter
      remained more resistant to Vif-induced degradation. Furthermore, the A3G
      C-terminal mutant, but not the N-terminal mutant, maintained potent antiviral
      activity in the presence of Vif. Taken together, our results suggest that the
      location of A3G ubiquitin modification is a determinant for Vif-mediated
      degradation, implying that in addition to polyubiquitination, other factors may
      play a key role in the rate of A3G degradation.

AB  - The APOBEC3 locus consists of seven genes (A3A-A3C, A3DE, A3F-A3H) that encode
      DNA cytidine deaminases. These enzymes deaminate single-stranded DNA, the result 
      being DNA peppered with CG -->TA mutations preferentially in the context of 5'TpC
      with the exception of APOBEC3G (A3G), which prefers 5'CpC dinucleotides.
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is vulnerable to genetic editing by APOBEC3 cytidine 
      deaminases, A3G being a major restriction factor. APOBEC3DE (A3DE) stands out in 
      that it is catalytically inactive due to a fixed Tyr320Cys substitution in the
      C-terminal domain. As A3DE is closely related to A3F and A3G, which can form
      homo- and heterodimers and multimers, the impact of A3DE on HBV replication via
      modulation of other APOBEC3 restriction factors was investigated. A3DE binds to
      itself, A3F, and A3G and antagonizes A3F and, to a lesser extent, A3G restriction
      of HBV replication. A3DE suppresses A3F and A3G from HBV particles, leading to
      enhanced HBV replication. Ironically, while being part of a cluster of innate
      restriction factors, the A3DE phenotype is proviral. As the gorilla genome
      encodes the same Tyr320Cys substitution, this proviral phenotype seems to have
      been selected for.

AB  - Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC/EHEC) manipulate a
      plethora of host cell processes to establish infection of the gut mucosa. This
      manipulation is achieved via the injection of bacterial effector proteins into
      host cells using a Type III secretion system. We have previously reported that
      the conserved EHEC and EPEC effector EspG disrupts recycling endosome function,
      reducing cell surface levels of host receptors through accumulation of recycling 
      cargo within the host cell. Here we report that EspG interacts specifically with 
      the small GTPases ARF6 and Rab35 during infection. These interactions target EspG
      to endosomes and prevent Rab35-mediated recycling of cargo to the host cell
      surface. Furthermore, we show that EspG has no effect on Rab35-mediated uncoating
      of newly formed endosomes, and instead leads to the formation of enlarged
      EspG/TfR/Rab11 positive, EEA1/Clathrin negative stalled recycling structures.
      Thus, this paper provides a molecular framework to explain how EspG disrupts
      recycling whilst also reporting the first known simultaneous targeting of ARF6
      and Rab35 by a bacterial pathogen.

AB  - Ebola, Marburg, and Ravn viruses, all filoviruses, are the causative agents of
      severe hemorrhagic fever. Much of what we understand about the pathogenesis of
      filovirus disease is derived from work with animal models, including nonhuman
      primates, which are considered the "gold standard" filovirus model since they
      faithfully recapitulate the clinical hallmarks of filovirus disease. However,
      rodent models, including the mouse, guinea pig, and hamster, also exist for
      Ebola, Marburg, and Ravn viruses, and although they may not reproduce all the
      clinical signs of filovirus disease, thanks to their relative ease of use and low
      cost, they are often the first choice for initial descriptions of virus
      pathogenesis and evaluation of antiviral prophylactics and therapeutics. Since
      filoviruses do not cause significant disease in adult, immunocompetent rodents,
      these models rely on "rodent-adapted" viruses that have been passaged several
      times through their host until virulence and lethality are achieved. In the
      process of adaptation, the viruses acquire numerous nucleotide/amino acid
      mutations that contribute to virulence in their rodent host. Interestingly, virus
      protein 24 (VP24) and nucleoprotein (NP) appear to be major virulence factors for
      ebolaviruses in rodents, whereas VP40 appears to be the major virulence factor
      for marburgviruses. By characterizing these mutations and understanding the
      molecular mechanisms that lead to the acquisition of virulence, we can gain
      better insight into the pathogenic processes that underlie filovirus disease in
      humans. These processes, and the viral and/or cellular proteins that contribute
      to them, will make attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics
      and counter-measures.

AB  - Cell-autonomous immunity is essential for host organisms to defend themselves
      against invasive microbes. In vertebrates, both the adaptive and the innate
      branches of the immune system operate cell-autonomous defenses as key effector
      mechanisms that are induced by pro-inflammatory interferons (IFNs). IFNs can
      activate cell-intrinsic host defenses in virtually any cell type ranging from
      professional phagocytes to mucosal epithelial cells. Much of this IFN-induced
      host resistance program is dependent on four families of IFN-inducible GTPases:
      the myxovirus resistance proteins, the immunity-related GTPases, the
      guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), and the very large IFN-inducible GTPases.
      These GTPase families provide host resistance to a variety of viral, bacterial,
      and protozoan pathogens through the sequestration of microbial proteins,
      manipulation of vesicle trafficking, regulation of antimicrobial autophagy
      (xenophagy), execution of intracellular membranolytic pathways, and the
      activation of inflammasomes. This review discusses our current knowledge of the
      molecular function of IFN-inducible GTPases in providing host resistance, as well
      as their role in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory Crohn's disease. While
      substantial advances were made in the recent past, few of the known functions of 
      IFN-inducible GTPases have been explored in any depth, and new functions await
      discovery. This review will therefore highlight key areas of future exploration
      that promise to advance our understanding of the role of IFN-inducible GTPases in
      human diseases.

AB  - Microbial pathogenesis research has, historically, focused on the study of
      infections as monomicrobial events. However, the advent of next generation
      sequencing and culture-independent identification methods has revealed that many,
      if not most, infections are polymicrobial either in origin or in manifestation.
      Polymicrobial infections are often associated with increased infection severity
      and poorer patient outcome. Multiple infecting microbes can interact
      synergistically to induce virulence traits, alter the infected niche, or modulate
      the host immune response, all of which can promote polymicrobial infection.
      Importantly, a polymicrobial environment at the time of inoculation, consisting
      of multiple pathogens or pathogens in combination with the native microbiota, can
      contribute to the pathogenic progression of a single predominant organism at the 
      time of diagnosis. Hence, in order to completely understand and elucidate the
      impact of these polymicrobial interactions on infection outcomes, a thorough
      examination of the entire microbial community present throughout the pathogenic
      cascade is required: from the time of inoculation to symptomology to resolution. 
      In this review, we highlight the themes of metabolite exploitation, immune
      modulation, niche optimization, and virulence induction that contribute to
      polymicrobial infections. We focus on recent literature about microbe-microbe and
      microbe-host interactions that promote polymicrobial infections with an emphasis 
      on understanding these interactions to identify better interventions for these
      sometimes complex infections.

AB  - Many intracellular bacterial pathogens previously thought to remain sealed within
      a vacuole can be recognized by cytosolic innate immune sensors. While a wide
      array of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors have been characterized in the context of
      viral infection, we are only now beginning to examine how these same molecules
      function in the context of bacterial infection. Interestingly, in addition to
      helping the host control the replication of some intracellular bacteria,
      cytosolic sensing of bacterial DNA has also been implicated in eliciting immune
      responses that enhance bacterial survival and promote pathogenesis, suggesting
      that activation of these host DNA sensing pathways is an evolutionarily conserved
      bacterial adaptation. Unlocking the mechanistic detail of these paradoxical
      innate immune events will be crucial for understanding how they influence the
      overall immune response during bacterial infection and how we may develop
      therapeutics to tip the balance in favor of the host.

AB  - Dengue is the leading mosquito-transmitted viral infection in the world. There
      are more than 390 million new infections annually; while the majority of infected
      individuals are asymptomatic or develop a self-limited dengue fever, up to 1
      million clinical cases develop severe manifestations, including dengue
      hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, resulting in ~25,000 deaths annually,
      mainly in children. Gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute
      to dengue infection and immunopathogenesis have hampered the development of
      vaccines and antiviral agents. Some of these limitations are highlighted by the
      explosive re-emergence of another arthropod-borne flavivirus-Zika virus-spread by
      the same vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, that also carries dengue, yellow
      fever and chikungunya viruses. This review will discuss the early virus-host
      interactions in dengue infection, with emphasis on the interrelationship between 
      oxidative stress and innate immune pathways, and will provide insight as to how
      lessons learned from dengue research may expedite therapeutic strategies for Zika
      virus.

AB  - Bacterial pathogens require the iron-containing cofactor heme to cause disease.
      Heme is essential to the function of hemoproteins, which are involved in energy
      generation by the electron transport chain, detoxification of host immune
      effectors, and other processes. During infection, bacterial pathogens must
      synthesize heme or acquire heme from the host; however, host heme is sequestered 
      in high-affinity hemoproteins. Pathogens have evolved elaborate strategies to
      acquire heme from host sources, particularly hemoglobin, and both heme
      acquisition and synthesis are important for pathogenesis. Paradoxically, excess
      heme is toxic to bacteria and pathogens must rely on heme detoxification
      strategies. Heme is a key nutrient in the struggle for survival between host and 
      pathogen, and its study has offered significant insight into the molecular
      mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis.

AB  - The number of proteins encoded in the human genome has been estimated at between 
      20,000 and 25,000, despite estimates that the entire proteome contains more than 
      a million proteins. One reason for this difference is due to many
      post-translational modifications of protein that contribute to proteome
      complexity. Among these, glycosylation is of particular relevance because it
      serves to modify a large number of cellular proteins. Glycogenomics,
      glycoproteomics, glycomics, and glycoinformatics are helping to accelerate our
      understanding of the cellular events involved in generating the glycoproteome,
      the variety of glycan structures possible, and the importance of roles that
      glycans play in therapeutics and disease. Indeed, interest in glycosylation has
      expanded rapidly over the past decade, as large amounts of experimental 'omics
      data relevant to glycosylation processing have accumulated. Furthermore, new and 
      more sophisticated glycoinformatics tools and databases are now available for
      glycan and glycosylation pathway analysis. Here, we summarize some of the recent 
      advances in both experimental profiling and analytical methods involving N- and
      O-linked glycosylation processing for biotechnological and medically relevant
      cells together with the unique opportunities and challenges associated with
      interrogating and assimilating multiple, disparate high-throughput glycosylation 
      data sets. This emerging era of advanced glycomics will lead to the discovery of 
      key glycan biomarkers linked to diseases and help establish a better
      understanding of physiology and improved control of glycosylation processing in
      diverse cells and tissues important to disease and production of recombinant
      therapeutics. Furthermore, methodologies that facilitate the integration of
      glycomics measurements together with other 'omics data sets will lead to a deeper
      understanding and greater insights into the nature of glycosylation as a complex 
      cellular process.

AB  - Carbohydrates comprise a large fraction of the typical diet, yet humans are only 
      able to directly process some types of starch and simple sugars. The remainder
      transits the large intestine where it becomes food for the commensal bacterial
      community. This is an environment of not only intense competition but also
      impressive cooperation for available glycans, as these bacteria work to maximize 
      their energy harvest from these carbohydrates during their limited transit time
      through the gut. The species within the gut microbiota use a variety of
      strategies to process and scavenge both dietary and host-produced glycans such as
      mucins. Some act as generalists that are able to degrade a wide range of
      polysaccharides, while others are specialists that are only able to target a few 
      select glycans. All are members of a metabolic network where substantial
      cross-feeding takes place, as by-products of one organism serve as important
      resources for another. Much of this metabolic activity influences host
      physiology, as secondary metabolites and fermentation end products are absorbed
      either by the epithelial layer or by transit via the portal vein to the liver
      where they can have additional effects. These microbially derived compounds
      influence cell proliferation and apoptosis, modulate the immune response, and can
      alter host metabolism. This review summarizes the molecular underpinnings of
      these polysaccharide degradation processes, their impact on human health, and how
      we can manipulate them through the use of prebiotics.

AB  - Glycoconjugates, glycans, carbohydrates, and sugars: these terms encompass a
      class of biomolecules that are diverse in both form and function ranging from
      free oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, to glycolipids that make
      up a complex glycan code that impacts normal physiology and disease. Recent data 
      suggest that one mechanism by which glycoconjugates impact physiology is through 
      the regulation of the process of autophagy. Autophagy is a degradative pathway
      necessary for differentiation, organism development, and the maintenance of cell 
      and tissue homeostasis. In this review, we will highlight what is known about the
      regulation of autophagy by glycoconjugates focusing on signaling mechanisms from 
      the extracellular surface and the regulatory roles of intracellular glycans.
      Glycan signaling from the extracellular matrix converges on "master" regulators
      of autophagy including AMPK and mTORC1, thus impacting their localization,
      activity, and/or expression. Within the intracellular milieu, gangliosides are
      constituents of the autophagosome membrane, a subset of proteins composing the
      autophagic machinery are regulated by glycosylation, and oligosaccharide exposure
      in the cytosol triggers an autophagic response. The examples discussed provide
      some mechanistic insights into glycan regulation of autophagy and reveal areas
      for future investigation.

AB  - The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is highly dependent on multiple
      metabolic nutrients including glucose, glutamine, and acetyl-CoA. Increased flux 
      through HBP leads to elevated post-translational addition of
      beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine sugars to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Increased 
      total O-GlcNAcylation is emerging as a general characteristic of cancer cells,
      and recent studies suggest that O-GlcNAcylation is a central communicator of
      nutritional status to control key signaling and metabolic pathways that regulate 
      multiple cancer cell phenotypes. This review summarizes our current understanding
      of changes of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes in cancer, the role of O-GlcNAcylation in 
      tumorigenesis, and the current challenges in targeting this pathway
      therapeutically.

AB  - Glycoproteins and glycolipids are crucial in a number of cellular processes, such
      as growth, development, and responses to external cues, among others.
      Polysaccharides, another class of sugar-containing molecules, also play important
      structural and signaling roles in the extracellular matrix. The additions of
      glycans to proteins and lipids, as well as polysaccharide synthesis, are
      processes that primarily occur in the Golgi apparatus, and the substrates used in
      this biosynthetic process are nucleotide sugars. These proteins, lipids, and
      polysaccharides are also modified by the addition of sulfate groups in the Golgi 
      apparatus in a series of reactions where nucleotide sulfate is needed. The
      required nucleotide sugar substrates are mainly synthesized in the cytosol and
      transported into the Golgi apparatus by nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs),
      which can additionally transport nucleotide sulfate. Due to the critical role of 
      NSTs in eukaryotic organisms, any malfunction of these could change glycan and
      polysaccharide structures, thus affecting function and altering organism
      physiology. For example, mutations or deletion on NST genes lead to pathological 
      conditions in humans or alter cell walls in plants. In recent years, many NSTs
      have been identified and functionally characterized, but several remain
      unanalyzed. This study examined existing information on functionally
      characterized NSTs and conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 257 NSTs predicted
      from nine animal and plant model species, as well as from protists and fungi.
      From this analysis, relationships between substrate specificity and the primary
      NST structure can be inferred, thereby advancing understandings of nucleotide
      sugar gene family functions across multiple species.

AB  - Gangliosides, sialylated glycosphingolipids, found on all vertebrate cells and
      tissues, are major molecular determinants on the surfaces of vertebrate nerve
      cells. Composed of a sialylated glycan attached to a ceramide lipid, the same
      four structures-GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b-represent the vast majority (>90%) of
      gangliosides in the brains of all mammals and birds. Primarily found on the outer
      surface of the plasma membrane with their glycans facing outward, gangliosides
      associate laterally with each other, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and select
      proteins in lipid rafts-the dynamic functional subdomains of the plasma membrane.
      The functions of gangliosides in the human nervous system are revealed by
      congenital mutations in ganglioside biosynthetic genes. Mutations in ST3GAL5,
      which codes for an enzyme early in brain ganglioside biosynthesis, result in an
      early-onset seizure disorder with profound motor and cognitive decay, whereas
      mutations in B4GALNT1, a gene encoding a later step, result in hereditary spastic
      paraplegia accompanied by intellectual deficits. The molecular functions of brain
      gangliosides include regulation of receptors in the same membrane via lateral
      (cis) associations and regulation of cell-cell recognition by trans interaction
      with ganglioside binding proteins on apposing cells. Gangliosides also affect the
      aggregation of Abeta (Alzheimer's disease) and alpha-synuclein (Parkinson's
      Disease). As analytical, biochemical, and genetic tools advance, research on
      gangliosides promises to reveal mechanisms of molecular control related to nerve 
      and glial cell differentiation, neuronal excitability, axon outgrowth after
      nervous system injury, and protein folding in neurodegenerative diseases.

      Fatty Acid Synthase.

AB  - Liver Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) is pivotal for de novo lipogenesis. Loss of
      control of this metabolic pathway contributes to the development of liver
      pathologies ranging from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which
      can lead to cirrhosis and, less frequently, to hepatocellular carcinoma.
      Therefore, deciphering the molecular mechanisms governing the expression and
      function of key enzymes such as FAS is crucial. Herein, we link the availability 
      of this lipogenic enzyme to the nutrient-dependent post-translational
      modification O-GlcNAc that is thought to be deregulated in metabolic diseases
      (diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome). We demonstrate that expression and
      activity of liver FAS correlate with O-GlcNAcylation contents in ob/ob mice and
      in mice fed with a high-carbohydrate diet both in a transcription-dependent and
      -independent manner. More importantly, inhibiting the removal of O-GlcNAc
      residues in mice intraperitoneally injected with the selective and potent
      O-GlcNAcase (OGA) inhibitor Thiamet-G increases FAS expression. FAS and O-GlcNAc 
      transferase (OGT) physically interact, and FAS is O-GlcNAc modified. Treatment of
      a liver cell line with drugs or nutrients that elevate the O-GlcNAcylation
      interferes with FAS expression. Inhibition of OGA increases the interaction
      between FAS and the deubiquitinase Ubiquitin-specific protease-2a (USP2A) in vivo
      and ex vivo, providing mechanistic insights into the control of FAS expression
      through O-GlcNAcylation. Together, these results reveal a new type of regulation 
      of FAS, linked to O-GlcNAcylation status, and advance our knowledge on
      deregulation of lipogenesis in diverse forms of liver diseases.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of a misfolded glycoprotein
      in mammalian cells requires the removal of 3-4 alpha 1,2 linked mannose residues 
      from its N-glycans. The trimming and recognition processes are ascribed to ER
      Mannosidase I, the ER-degradation enhancing mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs),
      and the lectins OS-9 and XTP3-B, all residing in the ER, the ER-derived quality
      control compartment (ERQC), or quality control vesicles (QCVs). Folded
      glycoproteins with untrimmed glycans are transported from the ER to the Golgi
      complex, where they are substrates of other alpha 1,2 mannosidases, IA, IB, and
      IC. The apparent redundancy of these enzymes has been puzzling for many years. We
      have now determined that, surprisingly, mannosidase IA is not located in the
      Golgi but resides in QCVs. We had recently described this type of vesicles, which
      carry ER alpha1,2 mannosidase I (ERManI). We show that the overexpression of
      alpha class I alpha1,2 mannosidase IA (ManIA) significantly enhances the
      degradation of ERAD substrates and its knockdown stabilizes it. Our results
      indicate that ManIA trims mannose residues from Man9GlcNAc2 down to Man5GlcNAc2, 
      acting in parallel with ERManI and the EDEMs, and targeting misfolded
      glycoproteins to ERAD.

AB  - Protein glycosylation is a post-translational modification that occurs across the
      whole tree of life. In the recent years, multiple N- and O-glycosylation
      mechanisms have been identified and characterized in diverse bacterial species,
      including human pathogens. This review focuses on bacterial protein glycosylation
      and its impact in pathogenesis. Bacteria carry N- and O-glycosylation systems
      that are mediated by an oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase). In OTase-dependent
      glycosylation mechanisms, an oligosaccharide is synthesized on a lipid carrier
      and subsequently transferred to proteins en bloc by an OTase. Multiple proteins
      are glycosylated using this mechanism. OTase-independent glycosylation refers to 
      the pathway in which Protein N- and O-glycosyltransferases (PGTases) sequentially
      add monosaccharides onto the target proteins. This pathway is employed for
      glycosylation of flagella and autotransporters. By exploiting glycosylation
      machineries, it is now possible to generate tailor-made glycoconjugates by
      attaching polysaccharides derived from lipopolysaccharide or capsule biosynthesis
      onto a protein of choice. These glycoproteins can be used in developing vaccines 
      and diagnostics of bacterial infections. Furthermore, both N- and O-glycosylation
      systems are promising targets for antibiotic development. Recently, the discovery
      of GTase toxins produced by bacterial pathogens and secreted into the host cells 
      has greatly expanded. These proteins are a key factor in host-pathogen
      interactions and are required by certain pathogenic bacteria to establish a
      successful infection. The exact functions of bacterial glycoproteins in
      pathogenesis are just starting to emerge. Understanding these roles is key for
      new opportunities in the prevention of bacterial infections, which is crucial in 
      times when antibiotic resistance continues to increase.

AB  - There are five major classes of glycan including N- and O-glycans,
      glycosaminoglycans, glycosphingolipids, and glycophosphatidylinositol anchors,
      all expressed at the molecular frontier of each mammalian cell. Numerous
      biological consequences of altering the expression of mammalian glycans are
      understood at a mechanistic level, but many more remain to be characterized.
      Mouse mutants with deleted, defective, or misexpressed genes that encode
      activities necessary for glycosylation have led the way to identifying key
      functions of glycans in biology. However, with the advent of exome sequencing,
      humans with mutations in genes involved in glycosylation are also revealing
      specific requirements for glycans in mammalian development. The aim of this
      review is to summarize glycosylation genes that are necessary for mouse embryonic
      development, pathway-specific glycosylation genes whose deletion leads to
      postnatal morbidity, and glycosylation genes for which effects are mild, but
      perturbation of the organism may reveal functional consequences. General
      strategies for generating and interpreting the phenotype of mice with
      glycosylation defects are discussed in relation to human congenital disorders of 
      glycosylation (CDG).

AB  - Along with the discovery of tumor-driven inflammatory pathways, there has been a 
      considerable progress over the past 10years in understanding the mechanisms
      leading to cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting. Several regulatory
      pathways, typically involved in immune cell homeostasis, are co-opted by cancer
      cells to thwart the development of effective antitumor responses. These
      regulatory circuits include the engagement of inhibitory checkpoint pathways
      (CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1, LAG-3 and TIM-3), secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines
      (TGF-beta, IL-10), and expansion and/or recruitment of myeloid or lymphoid
      regulatory cell populations. Elucidation of these pathways has inspired the
      design and implementation of novel immunotherapeutic modalities, which have
      already generated clinical benefits in an important number of cancer patients.
      Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins widely expressed in the tumor
      microenvironment (TME), have emerged as key players in immune evasion programs
      that differentially control the fate of effector and regulatory lymphoid and
      myeloid cell populations. How do galectins translate glycan-containing
      information into cellular programs that control immune regulatory cancer
      networks? Here, we uncover the selective roles of individual members of the
      galectin family in cancer-promoting inflammation, immunosuppression, and
      angiogenesis. Moreover, we highlight the relevance of corresponding glycosylated 
      ligands and counter-receptors and the emerging function of these lectins as
      biological liaisons connecting commensal microbiota, systemic inflammation, and
      distal tumor growth. Understanding the molecular and cellular components of
      galectin-driven regulatory circuits, the implications of different glycosylation 
      pathways in their functions and their clinical relevance in human cancer might
      lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches in a broad range of tumor
      types.

TI  - The Details of Glycolipid Glycan Hydrolysis by the Structural Analysis of a
      Family 123 Glycoside Hydrolase from Clostridium perfringens.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens is an opportunistic pathogen of humans and animals whose 
      genome encodes a wide variety of putative carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes that
      are increasingly being shown to be directed toward the cleavage of host glycans. 
      Among these putative enzymes is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 123. Here 
      we show that the recombinant enzyme (referred to as CpNga123) encoded by the gene
      cloned from C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124 (locus tag CPF_1473) is a
      beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, similar to NgaP from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. Like
      NgaP, CpNga123 was able to cleave the terminal beta-D-GalNAc-(1-->4)-D-Gal and
      beta-D-GalNAc-(1-->3)-D-Gal motifs that would be found in glycosphigolipids. The 
      X-ray crystal structure of CpNga123 revealed it to have an N-terminal
      beta-sandwich domain and a (beta/alpha)8-barrel catalytic domain with a
      C-terminal alpha-helical elaboration. The structures determined in complex with
      reaction products provide details of the -1 subsite architecture, catalytic
      residues, and a structural change in the active site that is likely required to
      enable hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by promoting engagement of the substrate
      by the catalytic residues. The features of the active site support the likelihood
      of a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism for this enzyme. The structures of an
      inactive mutant of CpNga123 in complex with intact GA2 and Gb4 glycosphingolipid 
      motifs reveal insight into aglycon recognition and suggest that the kinked or
      pleated conformation of GA2 caused by the beta-1,4-linkage between
      N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose, and the accommodation of this conformation
      by the enzyme active site, may be responsible for greater activity on GA2.

AB  - Glycosylation is a ubiquitous modification that occurs on proteins and lipids in 
      all living cells. Consistent with their high complexity, glycans play crucial
      biological roles in protein quality control and recognition events.
      Asparagine-linked protein N-glycosylation, the most complex glycosylation,
      initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum and matures in the Golgi apparatus. This
      process not only requires an accurate distribution of processing machineries,
      such as glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and nucleotide sugar transporters,
      but also needs an efficient and well-organized factory that is responsible for
      the fidelity and quality control of sugar chain processing. In addition, accurate
      glycosylation must occur in coordination with protein trafficking and sorting.
      These activities are carried out by the Golgi apparatus, a membrane organelle in 
      the center of the secretory pathway. To accomplish these tasks, the Golgi has
      developed into a unique stacked structure of closely aligned, flattened cisternae
      in which Golgi enzymes reside; in mammalian cells, dozens of Golgi stacks are
      often laterally linked into a ribbon-like structure. Here, we review our current 
      knowledge of how the Golgi structure is formed and why its formation is required 
      for accurate glycosylation, with the focus on how the Golgi stacking factors
      GRASP55 and GRASP65 generate the Golgi structure and how the conserved oligomeric
      Golgi complex maintains Golgi enzymes in different Golgi subcompartments by
      retrograde protein trafficking.

AB  - All mucins are highly O-glycosylated by variable glycans depending on species,
      histoblood group and organ. This makes the intestinal main mucin MUC2
      non-degradable by the host digestive system but well by both commensal and
      pathogenic bacteria. The MUC2 glycans are important for selection of the
      commensal bacteria and act as a nutritional source for the bacteria; this also
      helps the host to recover some of the energy spent on constantly renewing the
      protective mucus layer. Glycosylation is the most diverse and common
      posttranslational modification of cell surfaces and secreted proteins.
      N-Glycosylation is most well studied and predictable, whereas O-glycosylation is 
      more diverse and less well understood. O-Glycosylation is also often called
      mucin-type glycosylation as it is typical for mucins that often have more than
      80% of the mass as O-glycans. This review will discuss the mucin-type
      O-glycosylation and especially the O-glycosylation of human and mice intestinal
      mucin MUC2 in relation to bacteria and disease.

AB  - Bacterial microcompartments are naturally occurring subcellular organelles of
      bacteria and serve as a promising scaffold for the organization of heterologous
      biosynthetic pathways. A critical element in the design of custom biosynthetic
      organelles is quantitative control over the loading of heterologous enzymes to
      the interior of the organelles. We demonstrate that the loading of heterologous
      proteins to the 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment of Salmonella
      enterica can be controlled using two strategies: by modulating the
      transcriptional activation of the microcompartment container and by coordinating 
      the expression of the microcompartment container and the heterologous cargo.
      These strategies allow general control over the loading of heterologous proteins 
      localized by two different N-terminal targeting peptides and represent an
      important step toward tuning the catalytic activity of bacterial
      microcompartments for increased biosynthetic productivity.

      also very powerful biotechnological tools. These enzymes have been classified
      into eight different classes (A-H) based on their sequences and biochemical
      features. By combining structural and sequence analysis, and phylogenetic
      inference, we have explored the evolutionary history of classes A, B, E, F, and G
      and demonstrate that their multidomain architectures reflect their phylogenetic
      relationships, suggesting that the main evolutionary steps in their divergence
      are likely to have arisen from the recruitment of different domains.
      Additionally, the functional divergence within in each class appears to have been
      the result of other mechanisms such as a complex set of single-point mutations.
      Our results reinforce the idea that a main constraint on the evolution of
      cofactor-dependent enzymes is the functional binding of the cofactor.
      Additionally, a remarkable feature of this family is that the sequence of the key
      flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding domain is split into at least two parts in
      all classes studied here. We propose a complex set of evolutionary events that
      gave rise to the origin of the different classes within this family.

      Translocation.

AB  - Escherichia coli RecBCD is a DNA helicase/nuclease that functions in
      double-stranded DNA break repair. RecBCD possesses two motors (RecB, a 3' to 5'
      translocase, and RecD, a 5' to 3' translocase). Current DNA unwinding models
      propose that motor translocation is tightly coupled to base pair melting.
      However, some biochemical evidence suggests that DNA melting of multiple base
      pairs may occur separately from single-stranded DNA translocation. To test this
      hypothesis, we designed DNA substrates containing reverse backbone polarity
      linkages that prevent ssDNA translocation of the canonical RecB and RecD motors. 
      Surprisingly, we find that RecBCD can processively unwind DNA for at least 80bp
      beyond the reverse polarity linkages. This ability requires an ATPase active RecB
      motor, the RecB "arm" domain, and also the RecB nuclease domain, but not its
      nuclease activity. These results indicate that RecBCD can unwind duplex DNA
      processively in the absence of ssDNA translocation by the canonical motors and
      that the nuclease domain regulates the helicase activity of RecBCD.

AB  - The troponin complex is a molecular switch that ties shifting intracellular
      calcium concentration to association and dissociation of actin and myosin,
      effectively allowing excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscle. Although
      there is a long history of muscle biophysics and structural biology, many of the 
      mechanistic details that enable troponin's function remain incompletely
      understood. This review summarizes the current structural understanding of the
      troponin complex on the muscle thin filament, focusing on conformational changes 
      in flexible regions of the troponin I subunit. In particular, we focus on
      order-disorder transitions in the C-terminal domain of troponin I, which have
      important implications in cardiac disease and could also have potential as a
      model system for the study of coupled binding and folding.

TI  - Pironetin Binds Covalently to alphaCys316 and Perturbs a Major Loop and Helix of 
      alpha-Tubulin to Inhibit Microtubule Formation.

AB  - Microtubule-targeting agents are among the most powerful drugs used in
      chemotherapy to treat cancer patients. Pironetin is a natural product that
      displays promising anticancer properties by binding to and potently inhibiting
      tubulin assembly into microtubules; however, its molecular mechanism of action
      remained obscure. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the tubulin-pironetin 
      complex and found that the compound covalently binds to Cys316 of alpha-tubulin. 
      The structure further revealed that pironetin perturbs the T7 loop and helix H8
      of alpha-tubulin. Since both these elements are essential for establishing
      longitudinal tubulin contacts in microtubules, this result explains how pironetin
      inhibits the formation of microtubules. Together, our data define the molecular
      details of the pironetin binding site on alpha-tubulin and thus offer a promising
      basis for the rational design of pironetin variants with improved activity
      profiles. They further extend our knowledge on strategies evolved by natural
      products to target and perturb the microtubule cytoskeleton.

AB  - A double ring-shaped GroEL consisting of 14 ATPase subunits assists protein
      folding, together with co-chaperonin GroES. The dynamic GroEL-GroES interaction
      is actively involved in the chaperonin reaction. Therefore, revealing this
      dynamic interaction is a key to understanding the operation principle of GroEL.
      Nevertheless, how this interaction proceeds in the reaction cycle has long been
      controversial. Here, we directly imaged GroEL-GroES interaction in the presence
      of disulfide-reduced alpha-lactalbumin as a substrate protein using high-speed
      atomic force microscopy. This real-time imaging revealed the occurrence of
      primary, symmetric GroEL:GroES2 and secondary, asymmetric GroEL:GroES1 complexes.
      Remarkably, the reaction was observed to often branch into main and side
      pathways. In the main pathway, alternate binding and release of GroES occurs at
      the two rings, indicating tight cooperation between the two rings. In the side
      pathway, however, this cooperation is disrupted, resulting in the interruption of
      alternating rhythm. From various properties observed for both pathways, we
      provide mechanistic insight into the alternate and non-alternate operations of
      the two-engine system.

TI  - Monomeric Form of Peptidylarginine Deiminase Type I Revealed by X-ray
      Crystallography and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering.

AB  - Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD; EC 3.5.3.15) is a post-translational
      modification enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arginine in protein
      molecules to a citrulline residue in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In this study, we
      determined the structure of an active form of human PAD1 crystallized in the
      presence of Ca(2+) at 3.2-A resolution. Although human PAD2 and PAD4 isozymes
      were previously reported to form a head-to-tail homodimer, it is still unknown
      whether this quaternary structure is common to other PAD isozymes. The asymmetric
      unit of the crystal contained two PAD1 molecules; however, the head-to-tail
      dimeric form was not found. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses revealed PAD1
      to be a monomer in solution, while PAD3 was dimerized with a structure similar to
      PAD2 and PAD4. PAD1 was apparently different from the crystal structures of PAD2 
      and PAD4, with an elongated N-terminal loop that appears to prevent the formation
      of the homodimer. Of interest, the N-terminal loop occupied the substrate binding
      site of the adjacent PAD1 molecules in the crystal. Deimination of S100A3
      peptides in vitro implied that PAD isozymes recognize the quaternary structure of
      S100A3. The substrate-accessible monomeric structure brought about by the
      extension of its N terminus may partly account for the highest tolerant substrate
      recognition of PAD1. This is the first ever report on the molecular structure of 
      PAD1 demonstrating the unique monomeric form of the PAD isozyme.

AB  - Bacterial two-component signal transduction systems are used to adapt to
      fluctuations in the environment. YycG, a key two-component histidine kinase in
      Staphylococcus aureus, plays an essential role in cell viability and regulates
      cell wall metabolism, biofilm formation, virulence, and antibiotic resistance.
      For these reasons, YycG is considered a compelling target for the development of 
      novel antibiotics. However, to date, the signaling mechanism of YycG and its
      stimulus are poorly understood mainly because of a lack of structural information
      on YycG. To address this deficiency, we determined the crystal structure of the
      extracellular domain of S. aureus YycG (YycGex) at 2.0-A resolution. The crystal 
      structure indicated two subunits with an extracellular Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS)
      topology packed into a dimer with interloop interactions. Disulfide scanning
      using cysteine-substituted mutants revealed that YycGex possessed dimeric
      interfaces not only in the loop but also in the helix alpha1. Cross-linking
      studies using intact YycG demonstrated that it was capable of forming high
      molecular weight oligomers on the cell membrane. Furthermore, we also observed
      that two auxiliary proteins of YycG, YycH and YycI, cooperatively interfered with
      the multimerization of YycG. From these results, we propose that signaling
      through YycG is regulated by multimerization and binding of YycH and YycI. These 
      structural studies, combined with biochemical analyses, provide a better
      understanding of the signaling mechanism of YycG, which is necessary for
      developing novel antibacterial drugs targeting S. aureus.

AB  - Determining how polypeptide chain collapse initiates structure formation during
      protein folding is a long standing goal. It has been challenging to characterize 
      experimentally the dynamics of the polypeptide chain, which lead to the formation
      of a compact kinetic molten globule (MG) in about a millisecond. In this study,
      the sub-millisecond events that occur early during the folding of monellin from
      the guanidine hydrochloride-unfolded state have been characterized using multiple
      fluorescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes. The kinetic MG is
      shown to form in a noncooperative manner from the unfolded (U) state as a result 
      of at least three different processes happening during the first millisecond of
      folding. Initial chain compaction completes within the first 37mus, and further
      compaction occurs only after structure formation commences at a few milliseconds 
      of folding. The transient nonnative and native-like hydrophobic clusters with
      side chains of certain residues buried form during the initial chain collapse and
      the nonnative clusters quickly disassemble. Subsequently, partial chain
      desolvation occurs, leading to the formation of a kinetic MG. The initial chain
      compaction and subsequent chain rearrangement appear to be barrierless processes.
      The two structural rearrangements within the collapsed globule appear to prime
      the protein for the actual folding transition.

TI  - Noncanonical Myo9b-RhoGAP Accelerates RhoA GTP Hydrolysis by a
      Dual-Arginine-Finger Mechanism.

AB  - The GTP hydrolysis activities of Rho GTPases are stimulated by GTPase-activating 
      proteins (GAPs), which contain a RhoGAP domain equipped with a characteristic
      arginine finger and an auxiliary asparagine for catalysis. However, the auxiliary
      asparagine is missing in the RhoGAP domain of Myo9b (Myo9b-RhoGAP), a unique
      motorized RhoGAP that specifically targets RhoA for controlling cell motility.
      Here, we determined the structure of Myo9b-RhoGAP in complex with GDP-bound RhoA 
      and magnesium fluoride. Unexpectedly, Myo9b-RhoGAP contains two arginine fingers 
      at its catalytic site. The first arginine finger resembles the one within the
      canonical RhoGAP domains and inserts into the nucleotide-binding pocket of RhoA, 
      whereas the second arginine finger anchors the Switch I loop of RhoA and
      interacts with the nucleotide, stabilizing the transition state of GTP hydrolysis
      and compensating for the lack of the asparagine. Mutating either of the two
      arginine fingers impaired the catalytic activity of Myo9b-RhoGAP and affected the
      Myo9b-mediated cell migration. Our data indicate that Myo9b-RhoGAP accelerates
      RhoA GTP hydrolysis by a previously unknown dual-arginine-finger mechanism, which
      may be shared by other noncanonical RhoGAP domains lacking the auxiliary
      asparagine.

AB  - Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a lysosomal phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the
      hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide and phosphocholine. While other
      lysosomal sphingolipid hydrolases require a saposin activator protein for full
      activity, the ASM polypeptide incorporates a built-in N-terminal saposin domain
      and does not require an external activator protein. Here, we report the crystal
      structure of human ASM and describe the organization of the three main regions of
      the enzyme: the N-terminal saposin domain, the proline-rich connector, and the
      catalytic domain. The saposin domain is tightly associated along an edge of the
      large, bowl-shaped catalytic domain and adopts an open form that exposes a
      hydrophobic concave surface approximately 30A from the catalytic center. The
      calculated electrostatic potential of the enzyme is electropositive at the acidic
      pH of the lysosome, consistent with the strict requirement for the presence of
      acidic lipids in target membranes. Docking studies indicate that sphingomyelin
      binds with the ceramide-phosphate group positioned at the binuclear zinc center
      and molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the intrinsic flexibility of the 
      saposin domain is important for monomer-dimer exchange and for membrane
      interactions. Overall, ASM uses a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic
      interactions to cause local disruptions of target bilayers in order to bring the 
      lipid headgroup to the catalytic center in a membrane-bound reaction.

AB  - Normal cellular homeostasis depends on tight regulation of gene expression, which
      requires the modulation of transcription factors' DNA-binding specificity. That
      said, the mechanisms that allow transcription factors to distinguish between
      closely related response elements following different cellular signals are not
      fully understood. In the tumor suppressor protein p53, acetylation of loop L1
      residue Lys120 within the DNA-binding domain has been shown to promote the
      transcription of proapoptotic genes such as bax. Here, we report the crystal
      structures of Lys120-acetylated p53 DNA-binding domain in complex with a
      consensus response element and with the natural BAX response element. Our
      structural analyses reveal that Lys120 acetylation expands the conformational
      space of loop L1 in the DNA-bound state. Loop L1 flexibility is known to increase
      p53's DNA-binding specificity, and Lys120-acetylation-dependent conformational
      changes in loop L1 enable the formation of sequence-dependent DNA-binding modes
      for p53. Furthermore, binding to the natural BAX response element is accompanied 
      by global conformational changes, deformation of the DNA helical structure, and
      formation of an asymmetric tetrameric complex. Based on these findings, we
      suggest a model for p53's Lys120 acetylation-dependent DNA-binding mode.

AB  - Multiple pathways modulate the dynamic mutability of trinucleotide repeats
      (TNRs), which are implicated in neurodegenerative disease and evolution.
      Recently, we reported that environmental stresses induce TNR mutagenesis via
      stress responses and rereplication, with more than 50% of mutants carrying
      deletions or insertions-molecular signatures of DNA double-strand break repair.
      We now show that knockdown of alt-nonhomologous end joining (alt-NHEJ)
      components-XRCC1, LIG3, and PARP1-suppresses stress-induced TNR mutagenesis, in
      contrast to the components of homologous recombination and NHEJ, which have no
      effect. Thus, alt-NHEJ, which contributes to genetic mutability in cancer cells, 
      also plays a novel role in environmental stress-induced TNR mutagenesis.

AB  - ECF transporters are a family of active membrane transporters for essential
      micronutrients, such as vitamins and trace metals. Found exclusively in archaea
      and bacteria, these transporters are composed of four subunits: an integral
      membrane substrate-binding subunit (EcfS), a transmembrane coupling subunit
      (EcfT), and two ATP-binding cassette ATPases (EcfA and EcfA'). We have
      characterized the structural basis of substrate binding by the EcfS subunit for
      riboflavin from Thermotoga maritima, TmRibU. TmRibU binds riboflavin with high
      affinity, and the protein-substrate complex is exceptionally stable in solution. 
      The crystal structure of riboflavin-bound TmRibU reveals an electronegative
      binding pocket at the extracellular surface in which the substrate is completely 
      buried. Analysis of the intermolecular contacts indicates that nearly every
      available substrate hydrogen bond is satisfied. A conserved aromatic residue at
      the extracellular end of TM5, Tyr130, caps the binding site to generate a
      substrate-bound, occluded state, and non-conservative mutation of Tyr130 reduces 
      the stability of this conformation. Using a novel fluorescence binding assay, we 
      find that an aromatic residue at this position is essential for high-affinity
      substrate binding. Comparison with other S subunit structures suggests that TM5
      and Loop5-6 contain a dynamic, conserved motif that plays a key role in gating
      substrate entry and release by S subunits of ECF transporters.

AB  - Computational modeling is essential for structural characterization of
      biomolecular mechanisms across the broad spectrum of scales. Adequate
      understanding of biomolecular mechanisms inherently involves our ability to model
      them. Structural modeling of individual biomolecules and their interactions has
      been rapidly progressing. However, in terms of the broader picture, the focus is 
      shifting toward larger systems, up to the level of a cell. Such modeling involves
      a more dynamic and realistic representation of the interactomes in vivo, in a
      crowded cellular environment, as well as membranes and membrane proteins, and
      other cellular components. Structural modeling of a cell complements
      computational approaches to cellular mechanisms based on differential equations, 
      graph models, and other techniques to model biological networks, imaging data,
      etc. Structural modeling along with other computational and experimental
      approaches will provide a fundamental understanding of life at the molecular
      level and lead to important applications to biology and medicine. A cross section
      of diverse approaches presented in this review illustrates the developing shift
      from the structural modeling of individual molecules to that of cell biology.
      Studies in several related areas are covered: biological networks; automated
      construction of three-dimensional cell models using experimental data; modeling
      of protein complexes; prediction of non-specific and transient protein
      interactions; thermodynamic and kinetic effects of crowding; cellular membrane
      modeling; and modeling of chromosomes. The review presents an expert opinion on
      the current state-of-the-art in these various aspects of structural modeling in
      cellular biology, and the prospects of future developments in this emerging
      field.

AB  - The misfolding and self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) into oligomers and
      fibres is fundamental to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Alzheimer's disease is a 
      multifaceted disease. One factor that is thought to have a significant role in
      disease aetiology is Zn(2+) homeostasis, which is disrupted in the brains of
      Alzheimer's disease sufferers and has been shown to modulate Alzheimer's symptoms
      in animal models. Here, we investigate how the kinetics of Abeta fibre growth are
      affected at a range of Zn(2+) concentrations and we use transmission electron
      microscopy to characterise the aggregate assemblies formed. We demonstrate that
      for Abeta(1-40), and Abeta(1-42), as little as 0.01mol equivalent of Zn(2+)
      (100nM) is sufficient to greatly perturb the formation of amyloid fibres
      irreversibly. Instead, Abeta(1-40) assembles into short, rod-like structures that
      pack tightly together into ordered stacks, whereas Abeta(1-42) forms short,
      crooked assemblies that knit together to form a mesh of disordered tangles. Our
      data suggest that a small number of Zn(2+) ions are able to influence a great
      many Abeta molecules through the rapid exchange of Zn(2+) between Abeta peptides.
      Surprisingly, although Cu(2+) binds to Abeta 10,000 times tighter than Zn(2+),
      the effect of Zn(2+) on Abeta assembly dominates in Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) mixtures,
      suggesting that trace levels of Zn(2+) must have a profound effect on
      extracellular Abeta accumulation. Trace Zn(2+) levels profoundly influence Abeta 
      assembly even at concentrations weaker than its affinity for Abeta. These
      observations indicate that inhibitors of fibre assembly do not necessarily have
      to be at high concentration and affinity to have a profound impact.

AB  - Archaeal family-D DNA polymerases (Pol-D) comprise a small (DP1) proofreading
      subunit and a large (DP2) polymerase subunit. Pol-D is one of the least studied
      polymerase families, and this publication investigates the enzyme from
      Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Afu Pol-D). The C-terminal region of DP2 contains two
      conserved cysteine clusters, and their roles are investigated using site-directed
      mutagenesis. The cluster nearest the C terminus is essential for polymerase
      activity, and the cysteines are shown to serve as ligands for a single, critical 
      Zn(2+) ion. The cysteines farthest from the C terminal were not required for
      activity, and a role for these amino acids has yet to be defined. Additionally,
      it is shown that Afu Pol-D activity is slowed by the template strand
      hypoxanthine, extending previous results that demonstrated inhibition by uracil. 
      Hypoxanthine was a weaker inhibitor than uracil. Investigations with isolated
      DP2, which has a measurable polymerase activity, localised the deaminated base
      binding site to this subunit. Uracil and hypoxanthine slowed Afu Pol-D "in
      trans", that is, a copied DNA strand could be inhibited by a deaminated base in
      the alternate strand of a replication fork. The error rate of Afu Pol-D, measured
      in vitro, was 0.24x10(-5), typical for a polymerase that has been proposed to
      carry out genome replication in the Archaea. Deleting the 3'-5' proofreading
      exonuclease activity reduced fidelity twofold. The results presented in this
      publication considerably increase our knowledge of Pol-D.

AB  - Because of the potential link between -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting and
      response of a pseudoknot (PK) RNA to force, a number of single-molecule pulling
      experiments have been performed on PKs to decipher the mechanism of programmed
      ribosomal frameshifting. Motivated in part by these experiments, we performed
      simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the response of a PK 
      over a range of mechanical forces (fs) and monovalent salt concentrations (Cs).
      The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal
      melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy
      changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By
      varying f and C, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of
      structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states. As f and C are
      changed, the stem-loop tertiary interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding
      of the 3'-end hairpin (Iright harpoon over left harpoonF). Finally, the 5'-end
      hairpin unravels, producing an extended state (Eright harpoon over left
      harpoonI). A theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical
      force for rupture scales as (logCm)(alpha) with alpha=1(0.5) for Eright harpoon
      over left harpoonI (Iright harpoon over left harpoonF) transition. This relation 
      is used to obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be 
      quantitatively measured in single-molecule experiments, as done previously for
      DNA hairpins. A by-product of our work is the suggestion that the frameshift
      efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the 5'-end hairpin that the
      ribosome first encounters during translation.

AB  - Tumor suppressor p53 binds to the target in a genome and regulates the expression
      of downstream genes. p53 searches for the target by combining three-dimensional
      diffusion and one-dimensional sliding along the DNA. To examine the regulation
      mechanism of the target binding, we constructed the pseudo-wild type (pseudo-WT),
      activated (S392E), and inactive (R248Q) mutants of p53 and observed their target 
      binding in long DNA using single-molecule fluorescence imaging. The pseudo-WT
      sliding along the DNA showed many pass events over the target and possessed
      target recognition probability (TRP) of 7+/-2%. The TRP increased to 18+/-2% for 
      the activated mutant but decreased to 0% for the inactive mutant. Furthermore,
      the fraction of the target binding by the one-dimensional sliding among the total
      binding events increased from 63+/-9% for the pseudo-WT to 87+/-2% for the
      activated mutant. Control of TRP upon activation, as demonstrated here for p53,
      might be a general activation mechanism of transcription factors.

AB  - The members of RRNPP family of bacterial regulators sense population
      density-specific secreted oligopeptides and modulate the expression of genes
      involved in cellular processes, such as sporulation, competence, virulence,
      biofilm formation, conjugative plasmid transfer and antibiotic resistance.
      Signaling by RRNPP regulators include several steps: generation and secretion of 
      the signaling oligopeptides, re-internalization of the signaling molecules into
      the cytoplasm, signal sensing by the cytosolic RRNPP regulators, signal-specific 
      allosteric structural changes in the regulators, and interaction of the
      regulators with their respective regulatory target and gene regulation. The
      recently determined structures of the RRNPP regulators provide insight into the
      mechanistic aspects for several steps in this signaling circuit. In this review, 
      we discuss the structural principles underlying peptide specificity, regulatory
      target recognition, and ligand-induced allostery in RRNPP regulators and its
      impact on gene regulation. Despite the conserved tertiary structure of these
      regulators, structural analyses revealed unexpected diversity in the mechanism of
      activation and molecular strategies that couple the peptide-induced allostery to 
      gene regulation. Although these structural studies provide a sophisticated
      understanding of gene regulation by RRNPP regulators, much needs to be learned
      regarding the target DNA binding by yet-to-be characterized RNPP regulators and
      the several aspects of signaling by Rgg regulators.

AB  - The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex with a key
      role in targeting and insertion of membrane proteins. The two SRP GTPases, SRP54 
      (Ffh in bacteria) and FtsY (SRalpha in eukaryotes), form the core of the
      targeting complex (TC) regulating the SRP cycle. The architecture of the TC and
      its stimulation by RNA has been described for the bacterial SRP system while this
      information is lacking for other domains of life. Here, we present the crystal
      structures of the GTPase heterodimers of archaeal (Sulfolobus solfataricus),
      eukaryotic (Homo sapiens), and chloroplast (Arabidopsis thaliana) SRP systems.
      The comprehensive structural comparison combined with Brownian dynamics
      simulations of TC formation allows for the description of the general blueprint
      and of specific adaptations of the quasi-symmetric heterodimer. Our work defines 
      conserved external nucleotide-binding sites for SRP GTPase activation by RNA.
      Structural analyses of the GDP-bound, post-hydrolysis states reveal a conserved, 
      magnesium-sensitive switch within the I-box. Overall, we provide a general model 
      for SRP cycle regulation by RNA.

      F508CFTR Dysfunction: Impact in Cystic Fibrosis.

AB  - Deletion of Phe508 in the nucleotide binding domain (F508-NBD1) of the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR; a cyclic AMP-regulated chloride channel) 
      is the most frequent mutation associated with cystic fibrosis. This mutation
      affects the maturation and gating of CFTR protein. The search for new
      high-affinity ligands of CFTR acting as dual modulators (correctors/activators)
      presents a major challenge in the pharmacology of cystic fibrosis. Snake venoms
      are a rich source of natural multifunctional proteins, potential binders of ion
      channels. In this study, we identified the CB subunit of crotoxin from Crotalus
      durissus terrificus as a new ligand and allosteric modulator of CFTR. We showed
      that CB interacts with NBD1 of both wild type and F508CFTR and increases their
      chloride channel currents. The potentiating effect of CB on CFTR activity was
      demonstrated using electrophysiological techniques in Xenopus laevis oocytes, in 
      CFTR-HeLa cells, and ex vivo in mouse colon tissue. The correcting effect of CB
      was shown by functional rescue of CFTR activity after 24-h DeltaF508CFTR
      treatments with CB. Moreover, the presence of fully glycosylated CFTR was
      observed. Molecular docking allowed us to propose a model of the complex
      involving of the ABCbeta and F1-like ATP-binding subdomains of DeltaF508-NBD1.
      Hydrogen-deuterium exchange analysis confirmed stabilization in these regions,
      also showing allosteric stabilization in two other distal regions. Surface
      plasmon resonance competition studies showed that CB disrupts the
      F508CFTR-cytokeratin 8 complex, allowing for the escape of F508CFTR from
      degradation. Therefore CB, as a dual modulator of DeltaF508CFTR, constitutes a
      template for the development of new anti-CF agents.

      Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor Proteins and Modulates HIV-1 Replication.

AB  - The lens epithelium-derived growth factor p75 (LEDGF/p75) is a chromatin-bound
      protein essential for efficient lentiviral integration. Genome-wide studies have 
      located LEDGF/p75 inside actively transcribed genes where it mediates lentiviral 
      integration. Although its role in HIV-1 integration is clearly established, the
      role of LEDGF/p75-associated proteins in HIV-1 infection remains unexplored.
      Using protein-protein interaction assays, we demonstrated that LEDGF/p75
      complexes with a chromatin-remodeling complex facilitates chromatin transcription
      (FACT), a heterodimer of the structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) and
      the human homolog of suppressor of Ty 16 (hSpt16). Detailed analysis of the
      interaction of LEDGF/p75 with the FACT complex indicates that LEDGF/p75 interacts
      with SSRP1 in an hSpt16-independent manner that requires the PWWP domain of LEDGF
      proteins and the HMG domain of SSRP1. Functional characterizations demonstrate a 
      LEDGF/p75-independent role of SSRP1 in the regulation of HIV-1 replication.
      shRNA-mediated partial knockdown of SSRP1 reduces HIV-1 infection, but not Murine
      Leukemia Virus, in human CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, SSRP1 knockdown affects
      infection by HIV-1-derived viruses that express genes from the viral LTR but not 
      from an internal immediate-early CMV promoter, suggesting a role of SSRP1 in
      LTR-driven gene expression but not in viral DNA integration. Together, our data
      demonstrate for the first time the association of LEDGF proteins with the FACT
      complex and give further support to a role of SSRP1 in HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Current clinical anti-CD40 biologic agents include both antagonist molecules for 
      the treatment of autoimmune diseases and agonist molecules for immuno-oncology,
      yet the relationship between CD40 epitope and these opposing biological outcomes 
      is not well defined. This report describes the identification of potent
      antagonist domain antibodies (dAbs) that bind to a novel human CD40-specific
      epitope that is divergent in the CD40 of nonhuman primates. A similarly selected 
      anti-cynomolgus CD40 dAb recognizing the homologous epitope is also a potent
      antagonist. Mutagenesis, biochemical, and X-ray crystallography studies
      demonstrate that the epitope is distinct from that of CD40 agonists. Both the
      human-specific and cynomolgus-specific molecules remain pure antagonists even
      when formatted as bivalent Fc-fusion proteins, making this an attractive
      therapeutic format for targeting hCD40 in autoimmune indications.

AB  - The nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a highly conserved
      regulator of chromatin structure and transcription. Structural studies have shed 
      light on this and other chromatin modifying machines, but much less is known
      about how they assemble and whether stable and functional sub-modules exist that 
      retain enzymatic activity. Purification of the endogenous Drosophila NuRD complex
      shows that it consists of a stable core of subunits, while others, in particular 
      the chromatin remodeler CHD4, associate transiently. To dissect the assembly and 
      activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of
      different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and
      biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD4 in live
      mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components
      (MBD3), to show how the core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling sub-modules
      associate in vivo. Our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of NuRD via
      preformed and active sub-modules. These retain enzymatic activity and are present
      in both the nucleus and the cytosol, an outcome with important implications for
      understanding NuRD function.

AB  - Cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2s) consist of a family of calcium-sensitive
      enzymes that function to generate lipid second messengers through hydrolysis of
      membrane-associated glycerophospholipids. The GIVD cPLA2 (cPLA2delta) is a
      potential drug target for developing a selective therapeutic agent for the
      treatment of psoriasis. Here, we present two X-ray structures of human
      cPLA2delta, capturing an apo state, and in complex with a substrate-like
      inhibitor. Comparison of the apo and inhibitor-bound structures reveals
      conformational changes in a flexible cap that allows the substrate to access the 
      relatively buried active site, providing new insight into the mechanism for
      substrate recognition. The cPLA2delta structure reveals an unexpected second C2
      domain that was previously unrecognized from sequence alignments, placing
      cPLA2delta into the class of membrane-associated proteins that contain a tandem
      pair of C2 domains. Furthermore, our structures elucidate novel inter-domain
      interactions and define three potential calcium-binding sites that are likely
      important for regulation and activation of enzymatic activity. These findings
      provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing cPLA2's function
      in signal transduction.

AB  - The catalytic mechanisms underlying Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase's (AP) 
      remarkable rate enhancement have been probed extensively. Past work indicated
      that whereas the serine nucleophile (Ser102) electrostatically repels the product
      phosphate, another oxyanion, tungstate, binds more strongly in the presence of
      Ser102. These results predict a covalent bond between the serine nucleophile and 
      tungstate, a model that we test herein. The crystal structure of tungstate-bound 
      alkaline phosphatase provides evidence for a covalent adduct model and further
      shows that the ligand adopts trigonal bipyramidal geometry, which is infrequently
      observed for tungstate in small molecules and other active sites but mirrors the 
      geometry of the presumed phosphoryl transfer transition state. The AP active site
      is known to stabilize another oxyanion, vanadate, in trigonal bipyramidal
      geometry, but the extent to which binding of either ligand reproduces the
      energetics of the transition state cannot be deduced from structural inspection
      alone. To test for transition state analog behavior, we determined the
      relationship between catalytic activity and affinity for tungstate and vanadate
      for a series of 20 AP variants. Affinity and activity were highly correlated for 
      tungstate (r(2) = 0.89) but not vanadate (r(2) = 0.23), indicating that the
      tungstate*AP complex may better mimic this enzyme's transition state properties. 
      The results herein suggest that tungstate will be a valuable tool for further
      dissecting AP catalysis and may prove helpful in mechanistic studies of other
      phosphoryl transfer enzymes.

AB  - Viral protein R (Vpr) is an accessory gene product of human immunodeficiency
      virus type 1 (HIV-1) that plays multiple important roles associated with viral
      replication. Structural studies using NMR have revealed that Vpr consists of
      three alpha-helices and contains flexible N- and C-termini. However, the
      molecular mechanisms associated with Vpr function have not been elucidated. To
      investigate Vpr multifunctionality, we performed an X-ray crystallographic study 
      of Vpr complexes containing importin-alpha, a known Vpr binding partner present
      in host cells. Elucidation of the crystal structure revealed that the flexible
      C-terminus changes its conformation to a twisted beta-turn via an induced-fit
      mechanism, enabling binding to a minor nuclear localization signal (NLS) site of 
      importin-alpha. The Vpr C-terminus can also bind with major NLS sites of
      importin-alpha in an extended conformation in different ways. These results,
      which represent the first reported crystallographic analysis of Vpr, demonstrate 
      the multifunctional aspects that enable Vpr interaction with a variety of
      cellular proteins.

AB  - Nature repurposes proteins via evolutionary processes. Such adaptation can come
      at the expense of the original protein's function, which is a trade-off of
      adaptation. We sought to examine other potential adaptive trade-offs. We measured
      the effect on ampicillin resistance of ~12,500 unique single amino acid mutants
      of the TEM-1, TEM-17, TEM-19, and TEM-15 beta-lactamase alleles, which constitute
      an adaptive path in the evolution of cefotaxime resistance. These protein fitness
      landscapes were compared and used to calculate epistatic interactions between
      these mutations and the two mutations in the pathway (E104K and G238S). This
      series of protein fitness landscapes provides a systematic, quantitative
      description of pairwise/tertiary intragenic epistasis involving adaptive
      mutations. We find that the frequency of mutations exhibiting epistasis increases
      along the evolutionary pathway. Adaptation moves the protein to a region in the
      fitness landscape characterized by decreased mutational robustness and increased 
      ruggedness, as measured by fitness effects of mutations and epistatic
      interactions for TEM-1's original function. This movement to such a "fitness
      territory" has evolutionary consequences and is an important adaptive trade-off
      and cost of adaptation. Our systematic study provides detailed insight into the
      relationships between mutation, protein structure, protein stability, and
      epistasis and quantitatively depicts the different costs inherent in the

AB  - Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that reside at the ends of linear
      chromosomes and help maintain genomic integrity. Protection of telomeres 1 (POT1)
      and TPP1 are telomere-specific proteins that bind as a heterodimer to
      single-stranded telomere DNA to prevent illicit DNA damage responses and to
      enhance telomerase-mediated telomere extension. Telomere DNA is guanosine rich
      and, as such, can form highly stable secondary structures including
      G-quadruplexes. G-quadruplex DNA folds into different topologies that are
      determined by several factors including monovalent ion composition and the
      precise sequence and length of the DNA. Here, we explore the influence of DNA
      secondary structure on POT1-TPP1 binding. Equilibrium binding assays reveal that 
      the POT1-TPP1 complex binds G-quadruplex structures formed in buffers containing 
      Na(+) with an affinity that is fivefold higher than for G-quadruplex structures
      formed in the presence of K(+). However, the binding of the second heterodimer is
      insensitive to DNA secondary structure, presumably due to unfolding resulting
      from binding of the first POT1-TPP1. We further show that the rate constant for
      POT1-TPP1-induced unfolding of DNA secondary structure is substantially faster
      for G-quadruplex topologies formed in the presence of Na(+) ions. When bound to
      DNA, POT1-TPP1 forms complexes with similar CD spectra and enhances telomerase
      activity for all DNA substrates tested, regardless of the substrate secondary
      structure or solution monovalent ion composition. Together, these data indicate
      that binding of POT1-TPP1 unfolds telomere secondary structure to assist loading 
      of additional heterodimers and to ensure efficient promotion of
      telomerase-mediated extension.

TI  - Evolution under Drug Pressure Remodels the Folding Free-Energy Landscape of

AB  - Using high-pressure NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, we
      investigate the folding landscape of the mature HIV-1 protease homodimer. The
      cooperativity of unfolding was measured in the absence or presence of a symmetric
      active site inhibitor for the optimized wild type protease (PR), its inactive
      variant PRD25N, and an extremely multidrug-resistant mutant, PR20. The individual
      fit of the pressure denaturation profiles gives rise to first order, GNMR, and
      second order, VNMR (the derivative of GNMR with pressure); apparent thermodynamic
      parameters for each amide proton considered. Heterogeneity in the apparent VNMR
      values reflects departure from an ideal cooperative unfolding transition. The
      narrow to broad distribution of VNMR spanning the extremes from inhibitor-free
      PR20D25N to PR-DMP323 complex, and distinctively for PRD25N-DMP323 complex,
      indicated large variations in folding cooperativity. Consistent with this data,
      the shape of thermal unfolding transitions varies from asymmetric for PR to
      nearly symmetric for PR20, as dimer-inhibitor ternary complexes. Lack of
      structural cooperativity was observed between regions located close to the active
      site, including the hinge and tip of the glycine-rich flaps, and the rest of the 
      protein. These results strongly suggest that inhibitor binding drastically
      decreases the cooperativity of unfolding by trapping the closed flap conformation
      in a deep energy minimum. To evade this conformational trap, PR20 evolves
      exhibiting a smoother folding landscape with nearly an ideal two-state
      (cooperative) unfolding transition. This study highlights the malleability of
      retroviral protease folding pathways by illustrating how the selection of
      mutations under drug pressure remodels the free-energy landscape as a primary
      mechanism.

AB  - During the assembly of many viruses, a powerful ATP-driven motor translocates DNA
      into a preformed procapsid. A Walker-A "P-loop" motif is proposed to coordinate
      ATP binding and hydrolysis with DNA translocation. We use genetic, biochemical,
      and biophysical techniques to survey the roles of P-loop residues in
      bacteriophage lambda motor function. We identify 55 point mutations that reduce
      virus yield to below detectable levels in a highly sensitive genetic
      complementation assay and 33 that cause varying reductions in yield. Most changes
      in the predicted conserved residues K76, R79, G81, and S83 produce no detectable 
      yield. Biochemical analyses show that R79A and S83A mutant proteins fold,
      assemble, and display genome maturation activity similar to wild-type (WT) but
      exhibit little ATPase or DNA packaging activity. Kinetic DNA cleavage and ATPase 
      measurements implicate R79 in motor ring assembly on DNA, supporting recent
      structural models that locate the P-loop at the interface between motor subunits.
      Single-molecule measurements detect no translocation for K76A and K76R, while
      G81A and S83A exhibit strong impairments, consistent with their predicted roles
      in ATP binding. We identify eight residue changes spanning A78-K84 that yield
      impaired translocation phenotypes and show that Walker-A residues play important 
      roles in determining motor velocity, pausing, and processivity. The efficiency of
      initiation of packaging correlates strongly with motor velocity. Frequent pausing
      and slipping caused by changes A78V and R79K suggest that these residues are
      important for ATP alignment and coupling of ATP binding to DNA gripping. Our
      findings support recent structural models implicating the P-loop arginine in ATP 
      hydrolysis and mechanochemical coupling.

AB  - Nucleocapsid assembly is an essential process in the replication of the
      non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses (NNVs). Unassembled nucleoprotein
      (N(0)) is maintained in an RNA-free and monomeric form by its viral chaperone,
      the phosphoprotein (P), forming the N(0)-P complex. Our earlier work solved the
      structure of vesicular stomatitis virus complex formed between an N-terminally
      truncated N (NDelta21) and a peptide of P (P60) encompassing the N(0)-binding
      site, but how the full-length P interacts with N(0) remained unknown. Here, we
      combine several experimental biophysical methods including size exclusion
      chromatography with detection by light scattering and refractometry, small-angle 
      X-ray and neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with
      molecular dynamics simulation and computational modeling to characterize the
      NDelta21(0)-PFL complex formed with dimeric full-length P. We show that for
      multi-molecular complexes, simultaneous multiple-curve fitting using small-angle 
      neutron scattering data collected at varying contrast levels provides additional 
      information and can help refine structural ensembles. We demonstrate that (a)
      vesicular stomatitis virus PFL conserves its high flexibility within the
      NDelta21(0)-PFL complex and interacts with NDelta21(0) only through its
      N-terminal extremity; (b) each protomer of P can chaperone one N(0) client
      protein, leading to the formation of complexes with stoichiometries 1N:P2 and
      2N:P2; and (c) phosphorylation of residues Ser60, Thr62 and Ser64 provides no
      additional interactions with N(0) but creates a metal binding site in PNTR. A
      comparison with the structures of Nipah virus and Ebola virus N(0)-P core complex
      suggests a mechanism for the control of nucleocapsid assembly that is common to
      all NNVs.

TI  - The in vitro Biochemical Characterization of an HIV-1 Restriction Factor
      APOBEC3F: Importance of Loop 7 on Both CD1 and CD2 for DNA Binding and

AB  - APOBEC3F (A3F) is a member of the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic 
      polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family of proteins that can deaminate cytosine (C) to
      uracil (U) on nucleic acids. A3F is one of the four APOBEC members with two
      Zn-coordinated homologous cytosine deaminase (CD) domains, with the others being 
      A3G, A3D, and A3B. Here we report the in vitro characterization of DNA binding
      and deaminase activities using purified wild-type and various mutant proteins of 
      A3F from an Escherichia coli expression system. We show that even though CD1 is
      catalytically inactive and CD2 is the active deaminase domain, presence of CD1 on
      the N-terminus of CD2 enhances the deaminase activity by over an order of
      magnitude. This enhancement of CD2 catalytic activity is mainly through the
      increase of substrate single-stranded (ss) DNA binding by the N-terminal CD1
      domain. We further show that the loop 7 of both CD1 and CD2 of A3F plays an
      important role for ssDNA binding for each individual domain, as well as for the
      deaminase activity of CD2 domain in the full-length A3F.

AB  - Pre-mRNA maturation frequently occurs at the same time and place as transcription
      by RNA polymerase II. The co-transcriptionality of mRNA processing has permitted 
      the evolution of mechanisms that functionally couple transcription elongation
      with diverse events that occur on the nascent RNA. This review summarizes the
      current understanding of the relationship between transcriptional elongation
      through a chromatin template and co-transcriptional splicing including
      alternative splicing decisions that affect the expression of most human genes.

AB  - Transcription initiation requires that the promoter DNA is melted and the
      template strand is loaded into the active site of the RNA polymerase (RNAP),
      forming the open complex (OC). The archaeal initiation factor TFE and its
      eukaryotic counterpart TFIIE facilitate this process. Recent structural and
      biophysical studies have revealed the position of TFE/TFIIE within the
      pre-initiation complex (PIC) and illuminated its role in OC formation. TFE
      operates via allosteric and direct mechanisms. Firstly, it interacts with the
      RNAP and induces the opening of the flexible RNAP clamp domain, concomitant with 
      DNA melting and template loading. Secondly, TFE binds physically to
      single-stranded DNA in the transcription bubble of the OC and increases its
      stability. The identification of the beta-subunit of archaeal TFE enabled us to
      reconstruct the evolutionary history of TFE/TFIIE-like factors, which is
      characterised by winged helix (WH) domain expansion in eukaryotes and loss of
      metal centres including iron-sulfur clusters and Zinc ribbons. OC formation is an
      important target for the regulation of transcription in all domains of life. We
      propose that TFE and the bacterial general transcription factor CarD, although
      structurally and evolutionary unrelated, show interesting parallels in their
      mechanism to enhance OC formation. We argue that OC formation is used as a way to
      regulate transcription in all domains of life, and these regulatory mechanisms
      coevolved with the basal transcription machinery.

AB  - Class II gene transcription commences with the assembly of the Preinitiation
      Complex (PIC) from a plethora of proteins and protein assemblies in the nucleus, 
      including the General Transcription Factors (GTFs), RNA polymerase II (RNA pol
      II), co-activators, co-repressors, and more. TFIID, a megadalton-sized
      multiprotein complex comprising 20 subunits, is among the first GTFs to bind the 
      core promoter. TFIID assists in nucleating PIC formation, completed by binding of
      further factors in a highly regulated stepwise fashion. Recent results indicate
      that TFIID itself is built from distinct preformed submodules, which reside in
      the nucleus but also in the cytosol of cells. Here, we highlight recent insights 
      in transcription factor assembly and the regulation of transcription
      preinitiation.

AB  - TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors are essential for the normal development 
      of eukaryotes and are the downstream effectors of the Hippo tumor suppressor
      pathway. Whereas our earlier work established the three-dimensional structure of 
      the highly conserved DNA-binding domain using solution NMR spectroscopy, the
      structural basis for regulating the DNA-binding activity remains unknown. Here,
      we present the X-ray crystallographic structure and activity of a TEAD mutant
      containing a truncated L1 loop, DeltaL1 TEAD DBD. Unexpectedly, the
      three-dimensional structure of the DeltaL1 TEAD DBD reveals a helix-swapped
      homodimer wherein helix 1 is swapped between monomers. Furthermore, each
      three-helix bundle in the domain-swapped dimer is a structural homolog of
      MYB-like domains. Our investigations of the DNA-binding activity reveal that
      although the formation of the three-helix bundle by the DeltaL1 TEAD DBD is
      sufficient for binding to an isolated M-CAT-like DNA element, multimeric forms
      are deficient for cooperative binding to tandemly duplicated elements, indicating
      that the L1 loop contributes to the DNA-binding activity of TEAD. These results
      suggest that switching between monomeric and domain-swapped forms may regulate
      DNA selectivity of TEAD proteins.

AB  - Multicellular organisms must ensure genome integrity to prevent accumulation of
      mutations, cell death, and cancer. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex
      network that senses, signals, and executes multiple programs including DNA
      repair, cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. This entails regulation of 
      a variety of cellular processes: DNA replication and transcription, RNA
      processing, mRNA translation and turnover, and post-translational modification,
      degradation, and relocalization of proteins. Accumulated evidence over the past
      decades has shown that RNAs and RNA metabolism are both regulators and regulated 
      actors of the DDR. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the
      current knowledge on the many interactions between the DNA damage and RNA fields.

AB  - Transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is required to produce mRNAs and some
      noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) within mammalian cells. This coordinated process is
      precisely regulated by multiple factors, including many recently discovered
      ncRNAs. In this perspective, we will discuss newly identified ncRNAs that
      facilitate DNA looping, regulate transcription factor binding, mediate
      promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II, and/or interact with Pol II to modulate
      transcription. Moreover, we will discuss new roles for ncRNAs, as well as a novel
      Pol II RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that regulates an ncRNA inhibitor of
      transcription. As the multifaceted nature of ncRNAs continues to be revealed, we 
      believe that many more ncRNA species and functions will be discovered.

AB  - The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II contains a C-terminal domain (CTD) that 
      plays key roles in coordinating transcription with co-transcriptional events. The
      heptapeptide repeats that form the CTD are dynamically phosphorylated on serine, 
      tyrosine and threonine residues during the various steps of transcription,
      thereby regulating the recruitment of various proteins involved in gene
      expression. In this "Perspective," we review the recent literature related to the
      function of the CTD, to CTD kinases (Kin28, CDK7, CDK9, CDK12, ERK1/2 and DYRK1A)
      and to CTD phosphatases (Rtr1, RPAP2, Ssu72, Fcp1 and Gcl7). We discuss
      unresolved and controversial issues and try to provide constructive suggestions. 
      This review also highlights emerging themes in the CTD field, such as crosstalk
      and feedback mechanisms, as well as gene-specific and tissue-specific functions
      of the CTD. Finally, promising therapeutic avenues for a recently developed CTD
      kinase inhibitor are discussed.

AB  - Human mitochondrial transcription termination occurs within the leu-tRNA gene and
      is mediated by the DNA binding protein MTERF1. The crystal structure of MTERF1
      bound to the canonical termination sequence reveals a rare base flipping event
      that involves the eversion of three nucleotides. These nucleotides are stabilized
      by stacking interactions with three MTERF1 residues, which are essential not only
      for base flipping but also for termination activity. To further understand the
      mechanism of base flipping, we examined each of the individual stacking
      interactions in structural, energetic and functional detail. Individual
      substitutions of Arg162, Tyr288 and Phe243 have revealed unequal contributions to
      overall termination activity. Furthermore, our work identifies an important role 
      for Phe322 in the base flipping mechanism and we demonstrate how Phe322 and
      Phe243 are important for coupling base flipping between the heavy and light
      strand DNA chains. We propose a stepwise model for the base flipping process that
      recapitulates our observations. Finally, we show that MTERF1 has the ability to
      accommodate alternate active conformations. The adaptability of base flipping has
      implications for MTERF1 function and for the putative function of MTERF1 at
      alternative binding sites in human mitochondria.

TI  - Functional and Structural Insights of the Zinc-Finger HIT protein family members 
      Involved in Box C/D snoRNP Biogenesis.

AB  - Zf-HIT family members share the zf-HIT domain (ZHD), which is characterized by a 
      fold in "treble-clef" through interleaved CCCC and CCHC ZnF motifs that both bind
      a zinc atom. Six proteins containing ZHD are present in human and three in yeast 
      proteome, all belonging to multimodular RNA/protein complexes involved in gene
      regulation, chromatin remodeling, and snoRNP assembly. An interesting
      characteristic of the cellular complexes that ensure these functions is the
      presence of the RuvBL1/2/Rvb1/2 ATPases closely linked with zf-HIT proteins.
      Human ZNHIT6/BCD1 and its counterpart in yeast Bcd1p were previously
      characterized as assembly factors of the box C/D snoRNPs. Our data reveal that
      the ZHD of Bcd1p is necessary but not sufficient for yeast growth and that the
      motif has no direct RNA-binding capacity but helps Bcd1p maintain the box C/D
      snoRNAs level in steady state. However, we demonstrated that Bcd1p interacts
      nonspecifically with RNAs depending on their length. Interestingly, the ZHD of
      Bcd1p is functionally interchangeable with that of Hit1p, another box C/D snoRNP 
      assembly factor belonging to the zf-HIT family. This prompted us to use NMR to
      solve the 3D structures of ZHD from yeast Bcd1p and Hit1p to highlight the
      structural similarity in the zf-HIT family. We identified structural features
      associated with the requirement of Hit1p and Bcd1p ZHD for cell growth and box
      C/D snoRNA stability under heat stress. Altogether, our data suggest an important
      role of ZHD could be to maintain functional folding to the rest of the protein,
      especially under heat stress conditions.

AB  - The APOBEC3 family of DNA cytosine deaminases is capable of restricting the
      replication of HIV-1 and other pathogens. Here, we report a 1.92 A resolution
      crystal structure of the Vif-binding and catalytic domain of APOBEC3F (A3F). This
      structure is distinct from the previously published APOBEC and phylogenetically
      related deaminase structures, as it is the first without zinc in the active site.
      We determined an additional structure containing zinc in the same crystal form
      that allows direct comparison with the zinc-free structure. In the absence of
      zinc, the conserved active site residues that normally participate in zinc
      coordination show unique conformations, including a 90 degree rotation of His249 
      and disulfide bond formation between Cys280 and Cys283. We found that zinc
      coordination is influenced by pH, and treating the protein at low pH in
      crystallization buffer is sufficient to remove zinc. Zinc coordination and
      catalytic activity are reconstituted with the addition of zinc only in a reduced 
      environment likely due to the two active site cysteines readily forming a
      disulfide bond when not coordinating zinc. We show that the enzyme is active in
      the presence of zinc and cobalt but not with other divalent metals. These results
      unexpectedly demonstrate that zinc is not required for the structural integrity
      of A3F and suggest that metal coordination may be a strategy for regulating the
      activity of A3F and related deaminases.

AB  - Chaperone-mediated protein aggregate reactivation is a complex reaction that
      depends on the sequential association of molecular chaperones on their
      interaction with protein aggregates and on substrate refolding. This process
      could be modulated by the highly crowded intracellular environment, which is
      known to affect protein conformational change, enzymatic activity, and
      protein-protein interactions. Here, we report that molecular crowding shapes the 
      chaperone activity of bacterial disaggregase composed of the DnaK system (DnaK,
      DnaJ, and GrpE) and the molecular motor ClpB. A combination of biophysical and
      biochemical methods shows that the excluded volume conditions modify the
      conformation of DnaK and DnaJ without affecting that of GrpE. These
      crowding-induced conformational rearrangements activate DnaK, enhance the
      affinity of DnaK for DnaJ, but not for GrpE, and increase the sensitivity of the 
      chaperone activity to cochaperone concentration, explaining the tight control of 
      their relative intracellular amounts. Furthermore, crowding-mediated disordering 
      of the G/F domain of DnaJ facilitates the reversible formation of intermolecular 
      DnaJ conglomerates. These assemblies could drive the formation of Hsp70 clusters 
      at the aggregate surface with the consequent enhancement of the disaggregation
      efficiency through their coordinated action via entropic pulling. Finally,
      crowding helps ClpB to outcompete GrpE for DnaK binding, a key aspect of
      DnaK/ClpB cooperation given the low affinity of the disaggregase for DnaK.
      Excluded volume conditions promote the formation of the bichaperone complex that 
      disentangles aggregates, enhancing the efficiency of the disaggregation reaction.

      Integrase System.

AB  - Mycobacteriophage Brujita is an unusual temperate phage in which establishment of
      superinfection immunity is dependent on chromosomal integration. Integration is
      mediated by a non-canonical tyrosine integrase (Int) lacking an N-terminal domain
      typically associated with binding to arm-type sites within the phage attachment
      site (attP). This raises the question as to how these Ints bind their DNA
      substrates, if they form higher-order protein DNA complexes, and how site
      selection and recombinational directionality are determined. Here we show that
      Brujita Int is a simple recombinase, whose properties more closely resemble those
      of FLP and Cre than it does the canonical phage Ints. Brujita Int uses relatively
      small DNA substrates, fails to discriminate between attP and attB, cleaves
      attachment site DNA to form a 6-base overlap region, and lacks directional
      control. Brujita Int also has an unusual pattern of binding to its DNA
      substrates. It binds to two half sites (B and B') at attB, although binding to
      the B half site is strongly dependent on occupancy of B'. In contrast, binding to
      the P half site is not observed, even when Int is bound at P'. However, an
      additional Int binding site (P1) is displaced to the left of the crossover site
      at attP, is required for recombination and is predicted to facilitate binding of 
      Int to the P half site during synapsis. These simple phage Int systems may
      reflect ancestral states of phage evolution with the complexities of higher-order
      complex formation and directional control representing subsequent adaptations.

AB  - Arsenic is a ubiquitous and carcinogenic environmental element that enters the
      biosphere primarily from geochemical sources, but also through anthropogenic
      activities. Microorganisms play an important role in the arsenic biogeochemical
      cycle by biotransformation of inorganic arsenic into organic arsenicals and vice 
      versa. ArsI is a microbial non-heme, ferrous-dependent dioxygenase that
      transforms toxic methylarsenite [MAs(III)] to less toxic and carcinogenic
      inorganic arsenite [As(III)] by C-As bond cleavage. An ArsI ortholog, TcArsI,
      from the thermophilic bacterium Thermomonospora curvata was expressed, purified, 
      and crystallized. The structure was solved in both the apo form and with Ni(II), 
      Co(II), or Fe(III). The MAs(III) binding site is a vicinal cysteine pair in a
      flexible loop. A structure with the loop occupied with beta-mercaptoethanol
      mimics binding of MAs(III). The structure of a mutant protein (Y100H/V102F) was
      solved in two different crystal forms with two other orientations of the flexible
      loop. These results suggest that a loop-gating mechanism controls the catalytic
      reaction. In the ligand-free open state, the loop is exposed to solvent, where it
      can bind MAs(III). The loop moves toward the active site, where it forms a closed
      state that orients the C-As bond for dioxygen addition and cleavage. Elucidation 
      of the enzymatic mechanism of this unprecedented C-As lyase reaction will enhance
      our understanding of recycling of environmental organoarsenicals.

AB  - Cellular RNA-binding proteins incorporated into virions during human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly promote the replication efficiency
      of progeny virions. Despite its critical role in bolstering virion infectivity,
      the molecular basis for the incorporation of DHX9/RNA helicase A (RHA) to virions
      remains unclear. Here, cell-based experiments demonstrate that the truncation of 
      segments of the HIV-1 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) distinct from the core
      encapsidation sequence eliminated virion incorporation of RHA, indicating that
      RHA recruitment is mediated by specific interactions with the HIV-1 5'-UTR. In
      agreement with biological data, isothermal titration calorimetry determined that 
      the dimer conformation of the 5'-UTR binds one RHA molecule per RNA strand, and
      the interaction is independent of nucleocapsid protein binding. NMR spectra
      employing a deuterium-labeling approach enabled resolution of the dimeric 5'-UTR 
      in complex with the RHA N-terminal domain. The structure of the large molecular
      mass complex was dependent on RHA binding to a double-stranded region of the
      primer binding site (PBS)-segment of the 5'-UTR. A single A-to-C substitution was
      sufficient to disrupt biophysical conformation and attenuate virion infectivity
      in cell-based assays. Taken together, our studies demonstrate the structural
      basis for HIV-1 genomic RNA to recruit beneficial cellular cofactor to virions.
      The support of progeny virion infectivity by RHA is attributable to
      structure-dependent binding at the PBS-segment of the HIV-1 5'-UTR during virus
      assembly.

TI  - A Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Mutation in an Invariant Proline at the Myosin
      Head/Rod Junction Enhances Head Flexibility and Function, Yielding Muscle Defects
      in Drosophila.

AB  - An "invariant proline" separates the myosin S1 head from its S2 tail and is
      proposed to be critical for orienting S1 during its interaction with actin, a
      process that leads to muscle contraction. Mutation of the invariant proline to
      leucine (P838L) caused dominant restrictive cardiomyopathy in a pediatric patient
      (Karam et al., Congenit. Heart Dis. 3:138-43, 2008). Here, we use Drosophila
      melanogaster to model this mutation and dissect its effects on the biochemical
      and biophysical properties of myosin, as well as on the structure and physiology 
      of skeletal and cardiac muscles. P838L mutant myosin isolated from indirect
      flight muscles of transgenic Drosophila showed elevated ATPase and actin sliding 
      velocity in vitro. Furthermore, the mutant heads exhibited increased rotational
      flexibility, and there was an increase in the average angle between the two
      heads. Indirect flight muscle myofibril assembly was minimally affected in mutant
      homozygotes, and isolated fibers displayed normal mechanical properties. However,
      myofibrils degraded during aging, correlating with reduced flight abilities. In
      contrast, hearts from homozygotes and heterozygotes showed normal morphology,
      myofibrillar arrays, and contractile parameters. When P838L was placed in trans
      to Mhc(5), an allele known to cause cardiac restriction in flies, it did not
      yield the constricted phenotype. Overall, our studies suggest that increased
      rotational flexibility of myosin S1 enhances myosin ATPase and actin sliding.
      Moreover, instability of P838L myofibrils leads to decreased function during
      aging of Drosophila skeletal muscle, but not cardiac muscle, despite the strong
      evolutionary conservation of the P838 residue.

AB  - Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels mediate a potassium
      conductance in the brain and are involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and
      memory. SK channels show a distinct subcellular localization that is crucial for 
      their neuronal functions. However, the mechanisms that control this spatial
      distribution are unknown. We imaged SK channels labeled with fluorophore-tagged
      apamin and monitored SK channel nanoclustering at the single molecule level by
      combining atomic force microscopy and toxin (i.e., apamin) pharmacology. Using
      these two complementary approaches, we found that native SK channel distribution 
      in pyramidal neurons, across the somatodendritic domain, depends on ongoing
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) levels, strongly
      limiting SK channel expression at the pyramidal neuron soma. Furthermore, tonic
      cAMP-PKA levels also controlled whether SK channels were expressed in nanodomains
      as single entities or as a group of multiple channels. Our study reveals a new
      level of regulation of SK channels by cAMP-PKA and suggests that ion channel
      topography and nanoclustering might be under the control of second messenger
      cascades.

AB  - The SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes methylate histone H4 at K20, and they have
      overlapping and distinct biological effects. Here, by in vitro methylation
      studies we confirmed that both the murine SUV4-20H enzymes strongly favor the
      monomethylated H4K20 peptide substrate. We also show that both enzymes only
      generate dimethylated H4K20 products. We determined the substrate sequence
      recognition motif of both enzymes using SPOT peptide arrays showing that
      SUV4-20H1 recognizes an (RY)-Kme1-(IVLM)-(LFI)-X-D sequence. In contrast,
      SUV4-20H2 shows less specificity and recognizes an X-Kme1-(IVLMK)-(LVFI)-X-(DEV) 
      sequence, which is partially overlapping with SUV4-20H1 but has relaxed
      specificity at the -1 and +4 positions (if the target H4K20me1 is positon 0).
      Based on our data, we identify novel peptide substrates for SUV4-20H1 (K1423 of
      Zinc finger protein castor homolog 1) and SUV4-20H2 (K1423 of Zinc finger protein
      castor homolog 1, K215 of Protein Mis18-beta and K308 of Centromere protein U).
      All these lysine residues were already identified to be methylated in human
      cells, but the responsible PKMT was not known. In addition, we also tested the
      activity of SUV4-20H enzymes on ERK1, which was recently reported to be
      methylated by SUV4-20H1 at K302 and K361. However the sequences surrounding both 
      methylation sites do not fit to the specificity profile of SUV4-20H1 and we could
      not detect methylation of ERK1 by any of the SUV4-20H enzymes. The possible
      reasons of this discrepancy and its consequences are discussed.

AB  - Multisite phosphorylation is required for the biological function of
      serine-arginine (SR) proteins, a family of essential regulators of mRNA splicing.
      These modifications are catalyzed by serine-arginine protein kinases (SRPKs) that
      phosphorylate numerous serines in arginine-serine-rich (RS) domains of SR
      proteins using a directional, C-to-N-terminal mechanism. The present studies
      explore how SRPKs govern this highly biased phosphorylation reaction and
      investigate biological roles of the observed directional phosphorylation
      mechanism. Using NMR spectroscopy with two separately expressed domains of SRSF1,
      we showed that several residues in the RNA-binding motif 2 interact with the
      N-terminal region of the RS domain (RS1). These contacts provide a structural
      framework that balances the activities of SRPK1 and the protein phosphatase PP1, 
      thereby regulating the phosphoryl content of the RS domain. Disruption of the
      implicated intramolecular RNA-binding motif 2-RS domain interaction impairs both 
      the directional phosphorylation mechanism and the nuclear translocation of SRSF1 
      demonstrating that the intrinsic phosphorylation bias is obligatory for SR
      protein biological function.

AB  - Prefoldin is a molecular chaperone that captures an unfolded protein substrate
      and transfers it to a group II chaperonin. Previous studies have shown that the
      interaction sites for prefoldin are located in the helical protrusions of group
      II chaperonins. However, it does not exclude the possibility of the existence of 
      other interaction sites. In this study, we constructed C-terminal truncation
      mutants of a group II chaperonin and examined the effects of these mutations on
      the chaperone's function and interaction with prefoldin. Whereas the mutants with
      up to 6 aa truncation from the C-terminus retained more than 90% chaperone
      activities for protecting citrate synthase from thermal aggregation and refolding
      of green fluorescent protein and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, the truncation
      mutants showed decreased affinities for prefoldin. Consequently, the truncation
      mutants showed reduced transfer efficiency of the denatured substrate protein
      from prefoldin and subsequent chaperonin-dependent refolding. The results clearly
      show that the C-terminal region of group II chaperonins contributes to their
      interactions with prefoldin, the transfer of the substrate protein from prefoldin
      and its refolding.

AB  - The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) facilitates roles in
      membrane remodeling, such as multivesicular body biogenesis, enveloped virus
      budding and cell division. In yeast, Vps4 plays a crucial role in intraluminal
      vesicle formation by disassembling ESCRT proteins. Vps4 is recruited by ESCRT-III
      proteins to the endosomal membrane through the interaction between the
      microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain of Vps4 and the C-terminal
      MIT-interacting motif (MIM) of ESCRT-III proteins. Here, we have determined the
      crystal structure of Vps4-MIT in a complex with Vps20, a member of ESCRT-III, and
      revealed that Vps20 adopts a unique MIM2 conformation. Based on structural
      comparisons with other known MIM2s, we have refined the consensus sequence of
      MIM2. We have shown that another ESCRT-III protein, Ist1, binds to Vps4-MIT via
      its C-terminal MIM1 with higher affinity than Vps2, but lacks MIM2 by surface
      plasmon resonance. Surprisingly, the Ist1 MIM1 competed with the MIM2 of Vfa1, a 
      regulator of Vps4, for binding to Vps4-MIT, even though these MIMs bind in
      non-overlapping sites on the MIT. These findings provide insight into the
      allosteric recognition of MIMs of ESCRT-III by Vps4 and also the regulation of
      ESCRT machinery at the last step of membrane remodeling.

AB  - A key contributor to HIV-1 genetic variation is reverse transcriptase errors.
      Some mutations result because reverse transcriptase (RT) lacks 3' to 5'
      proofreading exonuclease and can extend mismatches. However, RT also excises
      terminal nucleotides to a limited extent, and this activity contributes to AZT
      resistance. Because HIV-1 mismatch resolution has been studied in vitro but only 
      indirectly during replication, we developed a novel system to study mismatched
      base pair resolution during HIV-1 replication in cultured cells using vectors
      that force template switching at defined locations. These vectors generated
      mismatched reverse transcription intermediates, with proviral products diagnostic
      of mismatch resolution mechanisms. Outcomes for wild-type (WT) RT and an
      AZT-resistant (AZT(R)) RT containing a thymidine analog mutation set-D67N, K70R, 
      D215F, and K219Q-were compared. AZT(R) RT did not excise terminal nucleotides
      more frequently than WT, and for the majority of tested mismatches, both WT and
      AZT(R) RTs extended mismatches in more than 90% of proviruses. However, striking 
      enzyme-specific differences were observed for one mispair, with WT RT
      preferentially resolving dC-rC pairs either by excising the mismatched base or
      switching templates prematurely, while AZT(R) RT primarily misaligned the primer 
      strand, causing deletions via dislocation mutagenesis. Overall, the results
      confirmed HIV-1 RT's high capacity for mismatch extension during virus
      replication and revealed dramatic differences in aberrant intermediate resolution

AB  - The eukaryotic transcription factor Pax5 or B-cell specific activator protein
      (BSAP) is central to B-cell development and has been implicated in a large number
      of cellular malignancies resulting from loss- or gain-of-function mutations. In
      this study, we characterized the DNA-binding Paired domain (PD) of Pax5 in its
      free and DNA-bound forms using NMR spectroscopy. In isolation, the PD folds as
      two independent helical bundle subdomains separated by a conformationally
      disordered linker. The two subdomains differ in stability, with the C-terminal
      subdomain (CTD) being ~10-fold more protected from amide hydrogen exchange (HX)
      than the N-terminal subdomain (NTD). Upon binding DNA, the linker and an induced 
      N-terminal beta-hairpin become ordered with significantly dampened motions and
      increased HX protection. Both subdomains of the PD contribute to specific DNA
      binding, resulting in an equilibrium dissociation constant more than three orders
      of magnitude lower than exhibited by the separate subdomains for their respective
      half-sites (nM versus muM). The isolated CTD binds non-specific DNA sequences
      with only ~10-fold weaker affinity than cognate sequences. In contrast, the NTD
      associates very poorly with non-specific DNA. We propose that the more stable CTD
      has evolved to provide relatively low affinity non-specific contacts with DNA. In
      contrast, the more dynamic NTD discriminates between cognate and non-specific
      sites. The distinct roles of the PD subdomains may enable efficient searching of 
      genomic DNA by Pax5 while retaining specificity for functional regulatory sites.

TI  - The Knotted Protein UCH-L1 Exhibits Partially Unfolded Forms under Native
      Conditions that Share Common Structural Features with Its Kinetic Folding
      Intermediates.

AB  - The human ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, UCH-L1, is an abundant neuronal
      deubiquitinase that is associated with Parkinson's disease. It contains a complex
      Gordian knot topology formed by the polypeptide chain alone. Using a combination 
      of fluorescence-based kinetic measurements, we show that UCH-L1 has two distinct 
      kinetic folding intermediates that are transiently populated on parallel pathways
      between the denatured and native states. NMR hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX)
      experiments indicate the presence of partially unfolded forms (PUFs) of UCH-L1
      under native conditions. HDX measurements as a function of urea concentration
      were used to establish the structure of the PUFs and pulse-labelled HDX NMR was
      used to show that the PUFs and the folding intermediates are likely the same
      species. In both cases, a similar stable core encompassing most of the central
      beta-sheet is highly structured and alpha-helix 3, which is partially formed,
      packs against it. In contrast to the stable beta-sheet core, the peripheral
      alpha-helices display significant local fluctuations leading to rapid exchange.
      The results also suggest that the main difference between the two kinetic
      intermediates is structure and packing of alpha-helices 3 and 7 and the degree of
      structure in beta-strand 5. Together, the fluorescence and NMR results establish 
      that UCH-L1 neither folds through a continuum of pathways nor by a single
      discrete pathway. Its folding is complex, the beta-sheet core forms early and is 
      present in both intermediate states, and the rate-limiting step which is likely
      to involve the threading of the chain to form the 52-knot occurs late on the
      folding pathway.

      G9a and G9a-Like Protein in Myoblasts.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2016.03.029 [doi]
AB  - Lysine methyltransferases G9a and GLP (G9a-like protein) are highly homologous
      and form functional heterodimeric complexes that establish mono- and
      dimethylation on histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1, H3K9me2) in euchromatin. Here, we 
      describe unexpected distinct roles for G9a and GLP in skeletal muscle terminal
      differentiation. Indeed, gain- or loss-of-function assays in myoblasts showed, in
      agreement with previous reports, that G9a inhibits terminal differentiation.
      While GLP plays a more intricate role in muscle differentiation,in one hand, both
      GLP gain and loss of function inhibit late steps of differentiation; on the other
      hand, in contrast to G9a, GLP overexpression promotes abnormal precocious
      expression of muscle differentiation-specific genes already in proliferating
      myoblasts. In agreement, transcriptomic analysis indicates that G9a and GLP
      regulate different sets of genes. Thus, GLP, but not G9a, inhibits proteasome
      subunit-encoding genes expression, resulting in an inhibition of the proteasome
      activities. Subsequently, GLP, but not G9a, overexpression stabilizes MyoD that
      is likely to be responsible for muscle markers expression in proliferating
      myoblasts.

      Gram-Positive Bacteria.

AB  - The Sm-protein Hfq facilitates interactions between small non-coding RNA (sRNA)
      and target mRNAs. In enteric Gram-negative bacteria, Hfq is required for sRNA
      regulation, and hfq deletion results in stress intolerance and reduced virulence.
      By contrast, the role of Hfq in Gram-positive is less established and varies
      among species. The RNA binding and RNA annealing activity of Hfq from Escherichia
      coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, and
      Staphylococcus aureus were compared using minimal RNAs and fluorescence
      spectroscopy. The results show that RNA annealing activity increases with the
      number of arginines in a semi-conserved patch on the rim of the Hfq hexamer and
      correlates with the previously reported requirement for Hfq in sRNA regulation.
      Thus, the amino acid sequence of the arginine patch can predict the chaperone
      function of Hfq in sRNA regulation in different organisms.

AB  - The peptide hormone endothelin, produced by the vascular endothelium, is involved
      in several physiological functions, including maintenance of vascular tone and
      humoral homeostasis. Endothelin transmits signals through the endothelin
      receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor. Structural studies of the endothelin type
      B receptor (ETBR) have been unsuccessful due to its structural flexibility and
      instability in detergent-solubilized solution. To overcome these problems, we
      explored thermostabilization of human ETBR by establishing an ETBR expression
      system in Escherichia coli, followed by systematic alanine scanning mutagenesis. 
      Among 297 point mutations, 11 thermostabilizing residues were selected and
      further mutated to other amino acids. The thermostability indices of these
      residues, represented by the ratios of endothelin-1 (ET-1) binding activities
      with or without heat treatment at 27 degrees C for 30min in a ligand-free form,
      were compared. The ligand affinity and apparent melting temperature (Tm) of the
      five most thermostable mutants, R124Y, D154A, K270A, S342A, and I381A, were then 
      examined. The apparent Tm of three single mutants, R124Y, D154A, and K270A, was
      approximately 7 degrees C higher than that of the wild type. The apparent Tm
      value of a combination of the five residues, named the Y5 ETBR mutant, was 17
      degrees C higher than that of the wild type. The Y5 ETBR mutant exhibited an
      affinity for ET-1 and activated Gq similar to the wild type. Further
      investigation of the pharmacological properties affected by combinatorial
      mutations of ET-1, ET-3, TxET-1, and K8794 suggested that Y5 ETBR is highly
      suitable for representing a ligand-free form of ETBR and is potentially
      applicable for studying an ET-1-bound form.

AB  - Oligomerization has been suggested to be an important mechanism for increasing or
      maintaining the thermostability of proteins. Although it is evident that
      protein-protein contacts can result in substantial stabilization in many extant
      proteins, evidence for evolutionary selection for oligomerization is largely
      indirect and little is understood of the early steps in the evolution of
      oligomers. A laboratory-directed evolution experiment that selected for increased
      thermostability in the alphaE7 carboxylesterase from the Australian sheep
      blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, resulted in a thermostable variant, LcalphaE7-4a, that 
      displayed increased levels of dimeric and tetrameric quaternary structure. A
      trade-off between activity and thermostability was made during the evolution of
      thermostability, with the higher-order oligomeric species displaying the greatest
      thermostability and lowest catalytic activity. Analysis of monomeric and dimeric 
      LcalphaE7-4a crystal structures revealed that only one of the
      oligomerization-inducing mutations was located at a potential protein-protein
      interface. This work demonstrates that by imposing a selective pressure demanding
      greater thermostability, mutations can lead to increased oligomerization and
      stabilization, providing support for the hypothesis that oligomerization is a
      viable evolutionary strategy for protein stabilization.

AB  - There is now substantial evidence that soluble oligomers are primary toxic agents
      in amyloid diseases. The development of an antibody recognizing the toxic soluble
      oligomeric forms of different and unrelated amyloid species suggests a common
      conformational intermediate during amyloidogenesis. We previously observed a
      common occurrence of a novel secondary structure element, which we call
      alpha-sheet, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of various amyloidogenic
      proteins, and we hypothesized that the toxic conformer is composed of alpha-sheet
      structure. As such, alpha-sheet may represent a conformational signature of the
      misfolded intermediates of amyloidogenesis and a potential unique binding target 
      for peptide inhibitors. Recently, we reported the design and characterization of 
      a novel hairpin peptide (alpha1 or AP90) that adopts stable alpha-sheet structure
      and inhibits the aggregation of the beta-Amyloid Peptide Abeta42 and
      transthyretin. AP90 is a 23-residue hairpin peptide featuring alternating D- and 
      L-amino acids with favorable conformational propensities for alpha-sheet
      formation, and a designed turn. For this study, we reverse engineered AP90 to
      identify which of its design features is most responsible for conferring
      alpha-sheet stability and inhibitory activity. We present experimental
      characterization (CD and FTIR) of seven peptides designed to accomplish this. In 
      addition, we measured their ability to inhibit aggregation in three unrelated
      amyloid species: Abeta42, transthyretin, and human islet amylin polypeptide. We
      found that a hairpin peptide featuring alternating L- and D-amino acids,
      independent of sequence, is sufficient for conferring alpha-sheet structure and
      inhibition of aggregation. Additionally, we show a correlation between
      alpha-sheet structural stability and inhibitory activity.

AB  - In order to colonize a niche and compete for scarce resources, microorganisms
      have evolved means to adjust the expression levels of their biosynthetic enzymes 
      in response to the changing levels of metabolites available to them. To do so,
      they often rely on transcription factors or structured RNAs that directly sense
      the concentration of metabolites and turn genes on or off accordingly. In some
      instances, however, a metabolite can be sensed by an actively translating
      ribosome bearing a nascent polypeptide whose specific amino acid sequence
      interferes with translation. These "arrest peptides" lead to the formation of
      stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes on the mRNA that can regulate the
      expression of downstream genes through transcriptional or translational
      mechanisms. Although this process was discovered over three and a half decades
      ago, the extent to which arrest peptides regulate gene expression in response to 
      cell metabolites is unknown. Here, we examine the physical constraints imposed by
      the ribosome on peptide-mediated ligand sensing and review attempts to assess the
      diversity of arrest peptides to date. In addition, we outline a possible way
      forward to establish how pervasive metabolite sensing by arrest peptides is in
      nature.

AB  - Pseudouridylation of messenger RNA emerges as an abundant modification involved
      in gene expression regulation. Pseudouridylation of stop codons in eukaryotic and
      bacterial cells results in stop-codon read through. The structural mechanism of
      this phenomenon is not known. Here we present a 3.1-A crystal structure of
      Escherichia coli release factor 1 (RF1) bound to the 70S ribosome in response to 
      the PsiAA codon. The structure reveals that recognition of a modified stop codon 
      does not differ from that of a canonical stop codon. Our in vitro biochemical
      results support this finding by yielding nearly identical rates for peptide
      release from E. coli ribosomes programmed with pseudouridylated and canonical
      stop codons. The crystal structure also brings insight into E. coli RF1-specific 
      interactions and suggests involvement of L27 in bacterial translation
      termination. Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which read through of
      a pseudouridylated stop codon in bacteria results from increased decoding by
      near-cognate tRNAs (miscoding) rather than from decreased efficiency of
      termination.

AB  - Stationary-phase bacterial cells are characterized by vastly reduced metabolic
      activities yielding a dormant-like phenotype. Several hibernation programs ensure
      the establishment and maintenance of this resting growth state. Some of the
      stationary phase-specific modulations affect the ribosome and its translational
      activity directly. In stationary-phase Escherichia coli, we observed the
      appearance of a 16S rRNA fragmentation event at the tip of helix 6 within the
      small ribosomal subunit (30S). Stationary-phase 30S subunits showed markedly
      reduced activities in protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, the functional
      performance of stationary-phase large ribosomal subunits (50S) was
      indistinguishable from particles isolated from exponentially growing cells.
      Introduction of the 16S rRNA cut in vitro at helix 6 of exponential phase 30S
      subunits renders them less efficient in protein biosynthesis. This indicates that
      the helix 6 fragmentation is necessary and sufficient to attenuate translational 
      activities of 30S ribosomal subunits. These results suggest that stationary
      phase-specific cleavage of 16S rRNA within the 30S subunit is an efficient means 
      to reduce global translation activities under non-proliferating growth
      conditions.

AB  - Elongation factor G (EF-G) is a universally conserved translational GTPase that
      promotes the translocation of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome. EF-G binds to
      the ribosome in a GTP-bound form and subsequently catalyzes GTP hydrolysis. The
      contribution of the ribosome-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by EF-G to tRNA/mRNA
      translocation remains debated. Here, we show that while EF-G*GDP does not stably 
      bind to the ribosome and induce translocation, EF-G*GDP in complex with phosphate
      group analogs BeF3(-) and AlF4(-) promotes the translocation of tRNA and mRNA.
      Furthermore, the rates of mRNA translocation induced by EF-G in the presence of
      GTP and a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, GDP*BeF3(-) are similar. Our results
      are consistent with the model suggesting that GTP hydrolysis is not directly
      coupled to mRNA/tRNA translocation. Hence, GTP binding is required to induce the 
      activated, translocation-competent conformation of EF-G while GTP hydrolysis
      triggers EF-G release from the ribosome.

AB  - During translation, the two eukaryotic ribosomal subunits remain associated
      through 17 intersubunit bridges, five of which are eukaryote specific. These are 
      mainly localized to the peripheral regions and are believed to stabilize the
      structure of the ribosome. The functional importance of these bridges remains
      largely unknown. Here, the essentiality of the eukaryote-specific bridge eB12 has
      been investigated. The main component of this bridge is ribosomal protein eL19
      that is composed of an N-terminal globular domain, a middle region, and a long
      C-terminal alpha-helix. The analysis of deletion mutants demonstrated that the
      globular domain and middle region of eL19 are essential for cell viability, most 
      likely functioning in ribosome assembly. The eB12 bridge, formed by contacts
      between the C-terminal alpha-helix of eL19 and 18S rRNA in concert with
      additional stabilizing interactions involving either eS7 or uS17, is dispensable 
      for viability. Nevertheless, eL19 mutants impaired in eB12 bridge formation
      displayed slow growth phenotypes, altered sensitivity/resistance to translational
      inhibitors, and enhanced hyperosmotic stress tolerance. Biochemical analyses
      determined that the eB12 bridge contributes to the stability of ribosome subunit 
      interactions in vitro. 60S subunits containing eL19 variants defective in eB12
      bridge formation failed to form 80S ribosomes regardless of Mg(2+) concentration.
      The reassociation of 40S and mutant 60S subunits was markedly improved in the
      presence of deacetylated tRNA, emphasizing the importance of tRNAs during the
      subunit association. We propose that the eB12 bridge plays an important role in
      subunit joining and in optimizing ribosome functionality.

AB  - The elongation phase of protein synthesis defines the overall speed and fidelity 
      of protein synthesis and affects protein folding and targeting. The mechanisms of
      reactions taking place during translation elongation remain important questions
      in understanding ribosome function. The ribosome-guided by signals in the
      mRNA-can recode the genetic information, resulting in alternative protein
      products. Co-translational protein folding and interaction of ribosomes and
      emerging polypeptides with associated protein biogenesis factors determine the
      quality and localization of proteins. In this review, we summarize recent
      findings on mechanisms of translation elongation in bacteria, including decoding 
      and recoding, peptide bond formation, tRNA-mRNA translocation, co-translational
      protein folding, interaction with protein biogenesis factors and targeting of
      ribosomes synthesizing membrane proteins to the plasma membrane. The data provide
      insights into how the ribosome shapes composition and quality of the cellular
      proteome.

AB  - The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the principal gateway for molecular exchange
      between nucleus and cytoplasm across the nuclear envelope. Due to its sheer size 
      of estimated 50-112MDa and its complex buildup from about 500-1000 individual
      proteins, it is a difficult object to study for structural biologists. Here, I
      review the extensive ensemble of high-resolution structures of the building
      blocks of the NPC. Concurrent with the increase in size and complexity, these
      latest, large structures and assemblies can now be used as the basis for hybrid
      approaches, primarily in combination with cryo-electron microscopic analysis,
      generating the first structure-based assembly models of the NPC. Going forward,
      the structures will be critically important for a detailed analysis of the NPC,
      including function, evolution, and assembly.

AB  - Due to its central role in macromolecular trafficking and nucleocytoplasmic
      information transfer, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) has been studied in great
      detail using a wide spectrum of methods. Consequently, many aspects of its
      architecture, general function, and role in the life cycle of a cell are well
      understood. Over the last decade, fluorescence microscopy methods have enabled
      the real-time visualization of single molecules interacting with and transiting
      through the NPC, allowing novel questions to be examined with nanometer
      precision. While initial single-molecule studies focused primarily on import
      pathways using permeabilized cells, it has recently proven feasible to
      investigate the export of mRNAs in living cells. Single-molecule assays can
      address questions that are difficult or impossible to answer by other means, yet 
      the complexity of nucleocytoplasmic transport requires that interpretation be
      based on a firm genetic, biochemical, and structural foundation. Moreover,
      conceptually simple single-molecule experiments remain technically challenging,
      particularly with regard to signal intensity, signal-to-noise ratio, and the
      analysis of noise, stochasticity, and precision. We discuss nuclear transport
      issues recently addressed by single-molecule microscopy, evaluate the limits of
      existing assays and data, and identify open questions for future studies. We
      expect that single-molecule fluorescence approaches will continue to be applied
      to outstanding nucleocytoplasmic transport questions, and that the approaches
      developed for NPC studies are extendable to additional complex systems and
      pathways within cells.

AB  - The ribosome has been described as a ribozyme in which ribosomal RNA is
      responsible for peptidyl-transferase reaction catalysis. The W255C mutation of
      the universally conserved ribosomal protein uL3 has diverse effects on ribosome
      function (e.g., increased affinities for transfer RNAs, decreased rates of
      peptidyl-transfer), and cells harboring this mutation are resistant to
      peptidyl-transferase inhibitors (e.g., anisomycin). These observations beg the
      question of how a single amino acid mutation may have such wide ranging
      consequences. Here, we report the structure of the vacant yeast uL3 W255C mutant 
      ribosome by X-ray crystallography, showing a disruption of the A-site side of the
      peptidyl-transferase center (PTC). An additional X-ray crystallographic structure
      of the anisomycin-containing mutant ribosome shows that high concentrations of
      this inhibitor restore a "WT-like" configuration to this region of the PTC,
      providing insight into the resistance mechanism of the mutant. Globally, our data
      demonstrate that ribosomal protein uL3 is structurally essential to ensure an
      optimal and catalytically efficient organization of the PTC, highlighting the
      importance of proteins in the RNA-centered ribosome.

AB  - The ribosome is a large two-subunit ribonucleoprotein machine that translates the
      genetic code in all cells, synthesizing proteins according to the sequence of the
      mRNA template. During translation, the primary substrates, transfer RNAs, pass
      through binding sites formed between the two subunits. Multiple interactions
      between the ribosomal subunits, termed intersubunit bridges, keep the ribosome
      intact and at the same time govern dynamics that facilitate the various steps of 
      translation such as transfer RNA-mRNA movement. Here, we review the molecular
      nature of these intersubunit bridges, how they change conformation during
      translation, and their functional roles in the process.

AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum type G (XPG) proteins are involved in DNA lesion
      recognition and promotion of nucleotide excision repair. Specific mutations in
      these proteins may lead to Cockayne syndrome, in which the patients may display
      severe developmental retardation and neurological abnormalities. No structural
      information is available for their spacer region or the C-terminal domain, which 
      are important, respectively, for specific nucleotide excision repair activity and
      substrate specificity, as well as nuclear translocation. Immunofluorescence
      studies suggested two specific regions of the XPG C-terminus as potential
      bipartite nuclear localization sequences, which would be responsible for its
      translocation to the nucleus by the classical nuclear import pathway mediated by 
      the importin-alpha (Impalpha). Thus, in order to test these hypotheses and gain
      insight into the structural basis for the nuclear import process for the XPG
      protein, we solved the crystal structures of complexes formed by the Impalpha and
      peptides corresponding to both putative nuclear localization signal (NLS)
      sequences (XPG1 and XPG2) and performed isothermal titration calorimetry assays
      to determine their binding affinities. Structural experiments confirm the binding
      of both NLS peptides to Impalpha but, unexpectedly, they bind to the receptor as 
      monopartite NLSs. The isothermal titration calorimetry assays demonstrated that
      XPG1 and XPG2 peptides bind to two separate binding sites, but with high affinity
      to the major NLS-binding site of the Impalpha, resembling classical monopartite
      SV40 TAg NLS. The results lead to insights about what distinguishes monopartite
      and bipartite NLSs, as well as the differential roles of XPG1 and XPG2 NLSs in
      the nuclear localization of XPG.

AB  - An evolutionary advantage of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is their
      ability to bind a variety of folded proteins-a paradigm that is central to the
      nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism, in which nuclear transport receptors
      mediate the translocation of various cargo through the nuclear pore complex by
      binding disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins (FG-Nups). FG-Nups are
      highly dynamic, which poses a substantial problem when trying to determine
      precisely their function using common experimental approaches. FG-Nups have been 
      studied under a variety of conditions, ranging from those that constitute
      single-molecule measurements to physiological concentrations at which they can
      form supramolecular structures. In this review, I describe the physicochemical
      properties of FG-Nups and compare them to those of other disordered systems,
      including well-studied IDPs. From this comparison, it is apparent that FG-Nups
      not only share some properties with IDPs in general but also possess unique
      characteristics that might be key to their central role in the nucleocytoplasmic 
      transport machinery.

AB  - Determining the structure of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) imposes an enormous
      challenge due to its size, intricate composition and membrane-embedded nature. In
      vertebrates, about 1000 protein building blocks assemble into a 110-MDa complex
      that fuses the inner and outer membranes of a cell's nucleus. Here, we review the
      recent progress in understanding the in situ architecture of the NPC with a
      specific focus on approaches using three-dimensional cryo electron microscopy. We
      discuss technological benefits and limitations and give an outlook toward
      obtaining a high-resolution structure of the NPC.

AB  - "Specialized ribosomes" is a topic of intense debate and research whose
      provenance can be traced to the earliest days of molecular biology. Here, the
      history of this idea is reviewed, and critical literature in which the
      specialized ribosomes have come to be presently defined is discussed. An argument
      supporting the evolution of a variety of ribosomes with specialized functions as 
      a consequence of selective pressures acting on a near-infinite set of possible
      ribosomes is presented, leading to a discussion of how this may also serve as a
      biological buffering mechanism. The possible relationship between specialized
      ribosomes and human health is explored. A set of criteria and possible approaches
      are also presented to help guide the definitive identification of "specialized"
      ribosomes, and this is followed by a discussion of how synthetic biology
      approaches might be used to create new types of special ribosomes.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is ubiquitously present in the RNA of living organisms
      from Escherichia coli to humans. Methyltransferases that catalyze adenosine
      methylation are drastically different in specificity from modification of single 
      residues in bacterial ribosomal or transfer RNA to modification of thousands of
      residues spread among eukaryotic mRNA. Interactions that are formed by m(6)A
      residues range from RNA-RNA tertiary contacts to RNA-protein recognition.
      Consequences of the modification loss might vary from nearly negligible to
      complete reprogramming of regulatory pathways and lethality. In this review, we
      summarized current knowledge on enzymes that introduce m(6)A modification, ways
      to detect m(6)A presence in RNA and the functional role of this modification
      everywhere it is present, from bacteria to humans.

AB  - Proteins are translated in the cytoplasm, but many need to access the nucleus to 
      perform their functions. Understanding how these nuclear proteins are transported
      through the nuclear envelope and how the import processes are regulated is
      therefore an important aspect of understanding cell function. Structural biology 
      has played a key role in understanding the molecular events during the transport 
      processes and their regulation, including the recognition of nuclear targeting
      signals by the corresponding receptors. Here, we review the structural basis of
      the principal nuclear import pathways and the molecular basis of their
      regulation. The pathways involve transport factors that are members of the
      beta-karyopherin family, which can bind cargo directly (e.g., importin-beta,
      transportin-1, transportin-3, importin-13) or through adaptor proteins (e.g.,
      importin-alpha, snurportin-1, symportin-1), as well as unrelated transport
      factors such as Hikeshi, involved in the transport of heat-shock proteins, and
      NTF2, involved in the transport of RanGDP. Solenoid proteins feature prominently 
      in these pathways. Nuclear transport factors recognize nuclear targeting signals 
      on the cargo proteins, including the classical nuclear localization signals,
      recognized by the adaptor importin-alpha, and the PY nuclear localization
      signals, recognized by transportin-1. Post-translational modifications,
      particularly phosphorylation, constitute key regulatory mechanisms operating in
      these pathways.

AB  - Many DNA and a few RNA viruses use the host cell nucleus for virion formation
      and/or genome replication. To this end, the nuclear envelope (NE) barrier has to 
      be overcome for entry into and egress from the intranuclear replication
      compartment. Different virus families have devised ingenious ways of entering and
      leaving the nucleus usurping cellular transport pathways through the nuclear pore
      complex but also translocating directly through both membranes of the NE. This
      intriguing diversity in nuclear entry and egress of viruses also highlights
      different ways nucleocytoplasmic transport can occur. Thus, the study of
      interactions between viruses and the NE also helps to unravel hitherto unknown
      cellular pathways such as vesicular nucleocytoplasmic transfer.

AB  - Understanding how macromolecules are rapidly exchanged between the nucleus and
      the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes is a fundamental problem in biology.
      Exportins are Ran-GTPase-dependent nuclear transport factors that belong to the
      karyopherin-beta family and mediate nuclear export of a plethora of proteins and 
      RNAs, except for bulk mRNA nuclear export. Exportins bind cargo macromolecules in
      a Ran-GTP-dependent manner in the nucleus, forming exportin-cargo-Ran-GTP
      complexes (nuclear export complexes). Transient weak interactions between
      exportins and nucleoporins containing characteristic FG (phenylalanine-glycine)
      repeat motifs facilitate nuclear pore complex passage of nuclear export
      complexes. In the cytoplasm, nuclear export complexes are disassembled, thereby
      releasing the cargo. GTP hydrolysis by Ran promoted in the cytoplasm makes the
      disassembly reaction virtually irreversible and provides thermodynamic driving
      force for the overall export reaction. In the past decade, X-ray crystallography 
      of some of the exportins in various functional states coupled with functional
      analyses, single-particle electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations,
      and small-angle solution X-ray scattering has provided rich insights into the
      mechanism of cargo binding and release and also begins to elucidate how exportins
      interact with the FG repeat motifs. The knowledge gained from structural analyses
      of nuclear export is being translated into development of clinically useful
      inhibitors of nuclear export to treat human diseases such as cancer and
      influenza.

AB  - RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) play key roles in mediating and
      regulating gene expression. In eukaryotes, most RNAs are transcribed, processed
      and assembled with proteins in the nucleus and then either function in the
      cytoplasm or also undergo a cytoplasmic phase in their biogenesis. This
      compartmentalization ensures that sequential steps in gene expression and RNP
      production are performed in the correct order and it allows important quality
      control mechanisms that prevent the involvement of aberrant RNAs/RNPs in these
      cellular pathways. The selective exchange of RNAs/RNPs between the nucleus and
      cytoplasm is enabled by nuclear pore complexes, which function as gateways
      between these compartments. RNA/RNP transport is facilitated by a range of
      nuclear transport receptors and adaptors, which are specifically recruited to
      their cargos and mediate interactions with nucleoporins to allow directional
      translocation through nuclear pore complexes. While some transport factors are
      only responsible for the export/import of a certain class of RNA/RNP, others are 
      multifunctional and, in the case of large RNPs, several export factors appear to 
      work together to bring about export. Recent structural studies have revealed
      aspects of the mechanisms employed by transport receptors to enable specific
      cargo recognition, and genome-wide approaches have provided the first insights
      into the diverse composition of pre-mRNPs during export. Furthermore, the
      regulation of RNA/RNP export is emerging as an important means to modulate gene
      expression under stress conditions and in disease.

AB  - Cells have developed highly sophisticated ways to accurately pass on their
      genetic information to the daughter cells. In animal cells, which undergo open
      mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down at the beginning of mitosis and the
      chromatin massively condenses to be captured and segregated by the mitotic
      spindle. These events have to be reverted in order to allow the reformation of a 
      nucleus competent for DNA transcription and replication, as well as all other
      nuclear processes occurring in interphase. Here, we summarize our current
      knowledge of how, in animal cells, the highly compacted mitotic chromosomes are
      decondensed at the end of mitosis and how a nuclear envelope, including
      functional nuclear pore complexes, reassembles around these decondensing
      chromosomes.

AB  - Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway highly conserved in eukaryotic 
      species. It is characterized by selective or bulk trafficking of cytosolic
      structures-ranging from single proteins to cell organelles-to the vacuole or a
      lysosome, in which the autophagic cargo is degraded. Autophagy fulfils a large
      set of roles, including nutrient mobilization in starvation conditions, clearance
      of protein aggregates and host defence against intracellular pathogens. Not
      surprisingly, autophagy has been linked to several human diseases, among them
      neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Autophagy is coordinated by the action of
      the Atg1/ULK1 kinase, which is the target of several important stress signaling
      cascades. In this review, we will discuss the available information on both
      upstream regulation and downstream effectors of Atg1/ULK1, with special focus on 
      reported and proposed kinase substrates.

AB  - Gyrase is a molecular motor that harnesses the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to
      perform mechanical work on DNA. The enzyme specifically introduces negative
      supercoiling in a process that must coordinate fuel consumption with DNA cleavage
      and religation and with numerous conformational changes in both the protein and
      DNA components of a large nucleoprotein complex. Here we present a current
      understanding of mechanochemical coupling in this essential molecular machine,
      with a focus on recent diverse biophysical approaches that have revealed details 
      of molecular architectures, new conformational intermediates, structural
      transitions modulated by ATP binding, and the influence of mechanics on motor
      function. Recent single-molecule assays have also illuminated the reciprocal
      relationships between supercoiling and transcription, an illustration of
      mechanical interactions between gyrase and other molecular machines at the heart 
      of chromosomal biology.

AB  - The type V secretion system is a macromolecular machine employed by a number of
      bacteria to secrete virulence factors into the environment. The human pathogen
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa employs the newly described type Vd secretion system to
      secrete a soluble variant of PlpD, a lipase of the patatin-like family
      synthesized as a single macromolecule that also carries a polypeptide
      transport-associated domain and a 16-stranded beta-barrel. Here we report the
      crystal structure of the secreted form of PlpD in its biologically active state. 
      PlpD displays a classical lipase alpha/beta hydrolase fold with a catalytic site 
      located within a highly hydrophobic channel that entraps a lipidic molecule. The 
      active site is covered by a flexible lid, as in other lipases, indicating that
      this region in PlpD must modify its conformation in order for catalysis at the
      water-lipid interface to occur. PlpD displays phospholipase A1 activity and is
      able to recognize a number of phosphatidylinositols and other phosphatidyl
      analogs. PlpD is the first example of an active phospholipase secreted through
      the type V secretion system, for which there are more than 200 homologs,
      revealing details of the lipid destruction arsenal expressed by P. aeruginosa in 
      order to establish infection.

AB  - We report the engineering of a new reversibly switching chromogenic protein,
      Dathail. Dathail was evolved from the extremely thermostable fluorescent proteins
      thermal green protein (TGP) and eCGP123 using directed evolution and ratiometric 
      sorting. Dathail has two spectrally distinct chromogenic states with low quantum 
      yields, corresponding to absorbance in a ground state with a maximum at 389nm,
      and a photo-induced metastable state with a maximum at 497nm. In contrast to all 
      previously described photoswitchable proteins, both spectral states of Dathail
      are non-fluorescent. The photo-induced chromogenic state of Dathail has a
      lifetime of ~50min at 293K and pH7.5 as measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometry,
      returning to the ground state through thermal relaxation. X-ray crystallography
      provided structural insights supporting a change in conformation and coordination
      in the chromophore pocket as being responsible for Dathail's photoswitching.
      Neutron crystallography, carried out for the first time on a protein from the
      green fluorescent protein family, showed a distribution of hydrogen atoms
      revealing protonation of the chromophore 4-hydroxybenzyl group in the ground
      state. The neutron structure also supports the hypothesis that the photo-induced 
      proton transfer from the chromophore occurs through water-mediated proton relay
      into the bulk solvent. Beyond its spectroscopic curiosity, Dathail has several
      characteristics that are improvements for applications, including low background 
      fluorescence, large spectral separation, rapid switching time, and the ability to
      switch many times. Therefore, Dathail is likely to be extremely useful in the
      quickly developing fields of imaging and biosensors, including photochromic
      Forster resonance energy transfer, high-resolution microscopy, and live tracking 
      within the cell.

AB  - Human peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) Pin1 plays key roles in developmental
      processes, cell proliferation, and neuronal function. Extensive phosphorylation
      of the microtubule binding protein tau has been implicated in neurodegeneration
      and Alzheimer's disease. For the past 15years, these two players have been the
      focus of an enormous research effort to unravel the biological relevance of their
      interplay in health and disease, resulting in a series of proposed molecular
      mechanism of how Pin1 catalysis of tau results in biological phenotypes. Our
      results presented here refute these mechanisms of Pin1 action. Using NMR,
      isothermal calorimetry (ITC), and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), we dissect
      binding and catalysis on multiple phosphorylated tau with particular emphasis
      toward the Alzheimer's associated AT180 tau epitope containing phosphorylated
      THR231 and SER235. We find that phosphorylated (p-) SER235-PRO, but not
      pTHR231-PRO, is exclusively catalyzed by full-length Pin1 and isolated PPIase
      domain. Importantly, site-specific measurements of Pin1-catalysis of
      CDK2/CycA-phosphorylated full-length tau reveal a number of sites that are
      catalyzed simultaneously with different efficiencies. Furthermore, we show that
      the turnover efficiency at pSER235 by Pin1 is independent of both the WW domain
      and phosphorylation on THR231. Our mechanistic results on site-specific binding
      and catalysis together with the lack of an increase of dephosphorylation rates by
      PP2A counter a series of previously published models for the role of Pin1
      catalysis of tau in Alzheimer's disease. Together, our data reemphasize the
      complicated scenario between binding and catalysis of multiple phosphorylated tau
      by Pin1 and the need for directly linking biological phenotypes and
      residue-specific turnover in Pin1 substrates.

AB  - The molecular mechanism by which the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau
      regulates the formation of microtubules (MTs) is poorly understood. The activity 
      of tau is controlled via phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr sites. Of those
      phosphorylation sites, 17 precede a proline, making them potential recognition
      sites for the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 binding and catalysis of
      phosphorylated tau at the AT180 epitope, which was implicated in Alzheimer's
      disease, has been reported to be crucial for restoring tau's ability to promote
      MT polymerization in vitro and in vivo [1]. Surprisingly, we discover that Pin1
      does not promote phosphorylated tau-induced MT formation in vitro, refuting the
      commonly accepted model in which Pin1 binding and catalysis on the A180 epitope
      restores the function of the Alzheimer's associated phosphorylated tau in tubulin
      assembly [1, 2]. Using turbidity assays, time-resolved small angle X-ray
      scattering (SAXS), and time-resolved negative stain electron microscopy (EM), we 
      investigate the mechanism of tau-mediated MT assembly and the role of the Thr231 
      and Ser235 phosphorylation on this process. We discover novel GTP-tubulin
      ring-shaped species, which are detectable in the earliest stage of tau-induced
      polymerization and may play a crucial role in the early nucleation phase of MT
      assembly. Finally, by NMR and SAXS experiments, we show that the tau molecules
      must be located on the surface of MTs and tubulin rings during the polymerization
      reaction. The interaction between tau and tubulin is multipartite, with a high
      affinity interaction of the four tubulin-binding repeats, and a weaker
      interaction with the proline-rich sequence and the termini of tau.

AB  - Selective autophagy is critical for regulating cellular homeostasis by mediating 
      lysosomal turnover of a wide variety of substrates including proteins,
      aggregates, organelles, and pathogens via a growing class of molecules termed
      selective autophagy receptors. The molecular mechanisms of selective autophagy
      receptor action and regulation are complex. Selective autophagy receptors link
      their bound cargo to the autophagosomal membrane by interacting with lipidated
      ATG8 proteins (LC3/GABARAP) that are intimately associated with the autophagosome
      membrane. The cargo signals that selective autophagy receptors recognize are
      diverse but their recognition can be broadly grouped into two classes,
      ubiquitin-dependent cargo recognition versus ubiquitin-independent. The roles of 
      post-translational modification of selective autophagy receptors in regulating
      these pathways in response to stimuli are an active area of research. Here we
      will review recent advances in the identification of selective autophagy
      receptors and their regulatory mechanisms. Given its importance in maintaining
      cellular homeostasis, disruption of autophagy can lead to disease including
      neurodegeneration and cancer. The role of autophagy in cancer is complex as
      autophagy can mediate promotion or inhibition of tumorigenesis. Here we will also
      review the importance of autophagy in cancer with a specific focus on the role of
      selective autophagy receptors.

AB  - Repeat proteins are formed from units of 20-40 aa that stack together into quasi 
      one-dimensional non-globular structures. This modular repetitive construction
      means that, unlike globular proteins, a repeat protein's equilibrium folding and 
      thus thermodynamic stability can be analysed using linear Ising models.
      Typically, homozipper Ising models have been used. These treat the repeat protein
      as a series of identical interacting subunits (the repeated motifs) that couple
      together to form the folded protein. However, they cannot describe subunits of
      differing stabilities. Here we show that a more sophisticated heteropolymer Ising
      model can be constructed and fitted to two new helix deletion series of consensus
      tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (CTPRs). This analysis, showing an asymmetric
      spread of stability between helices within CTPR ensembles, coupled with the Ising
      model's predictive qualities was then used to guide reprogramming of the
      unfolding pathway of a variant CTPR protein. The designed behaviour was
      engineered by introducing destabilising mutations that increased the
      thermodynamic asymmetry within a CTPR ensemble. The asymmetry caused the terminal
      alpha-helix to thermodynamically uncouple from the rest of the protein and
      preferentially unfold. This produced a specific, highly populated stable
      intermediate with a putative dimerisation interface. As such it is the first step
      in designing repeat proteins with function regulated by a conformational switch.

AB  - Autophagy is a fundamental cellular mechanism responsible for bulk turnover of
      cytoplasmic components. It is broadly related to many cellular activities,
      physiological processes, and pathological conditions. Autophagy entails a
      spatiotemporal interaction between cytosolic factors and membranes that are
      remodeled to encapsulate autophagic cargo within an autophagosome. Although
      majority of the factors [autophagy-related gene (Atg) proteins] involved in
      autophagy have been identified by genetic studies, the mechanism accounting for
      how these factors act upon the membrane to remodel it and efficiently recruit
      cargo for degradation is unclear. In vitro reconstitution of several different
      aspects of autophagy has provided important insights into the understanding of
      the mechanistic details underlying autophagic membrane remodeling and cargo
      recruitment. Here, we highlight these efforts toward studying autophagy through
      in vitro approaches.

AB  - Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved dynamic pathway that functions
      primarily in a degradative manner. A basal level of macroautophagy occurs
      constitutively, but this process can be further induced in response to various
      types of stress including starvation, hypoxia and hormonal stimuli. The general
      principle behind macroautophagy is that cytoplasmic contents can be sequestered
      within a transient double-membrane organelle, an autophagosome, which
      subsequently fuses with a lysosome or vacuole (in mammals, or yeast and plants,
      respectively), allowing for degradation of the cargo followed by recycling of the
      resulting macromolecules. Through this basic mechanism, macroautophagy has a
      critical role in cellular homeostasis; however, either insufficient or excessive 
      macroautophagy can seriously compromise cell physiology, and thus, it needs to be
      properly regulated. In fact, a wide range of diseases are associated with
      dysregulation of macroautophagy. There has been substantial progress in
      understanding the regulation and molecular mechanisms of macroautophagy in
      different organisms; however, many questions concerning some of the most
      fundamental aspects of macroautophagy remain unresolved. In this review, we
      summarize current knowledge about macroautophagy mainly in yeast, including the
      mechanism of autophagosome biogenesis, the function of the core macroautophagic
      machinery, the regulation of macroautophagy and the process of cargo recognition 
      in selective macroautophagy, with the goal of providing insights into some of the
      key unanswered questions in this field.

AB  - Selective autophagy contributes to intracellular homeostasis by mediating the
      degradation of cytoplasmic material such as aggregated proteins, damaged or
      over-abundant organelles, and invading pathogens. The molecular machinery for
      selective autophagy must ensure efficient recognition and sequestration of the
      cargo within autophagosomes. Cargo specificity can be mediated by autophagic
      cargo receptors that specifically bind the cargo material and the autophagosomal 
      membrane. Here we review the recent insights into the mechanisms that enable
      cargo receptors to confer selectivity and exclusivity to the autophagic process. 
      We also discuss their different roles during starvation-induced and selective
      autophagy. We propose to classify autophagic events into cargo-independent and
      cargo-induced autophagosome formation events.

AB  - The MCM motor of the CMG helicase powers ahead of the eukaryotic replication
      machinery to unwind DNA, in a process that requires ATP hydrolysis. The
      reconstitution of DNA replication in vitro has established the succession of
      events that lead to replication origin activation by the MCM and recent studies
      have started to elucidate the structural basis of duplex DNA unwinding. Despite
      the exciting progress, how the MCM translocates on DNA remains a matter of
      debate.

      diversity of myosins accounts for the variety and complexity of the underlying
      allosteric regulatory mechanisms that determine the activation or inhibition of
      myosin motor activity and enable precise timing and spatial aspects of myosin
      function at the cellular level. This review focuses on the molecular basis of
      posttranslational regulation of eukaryotic myosins from different classes across 
      species by allosteric intrinsic and extrinsic effectors. First, we highlight the 
      impact of heavy and light chain phosphorylation. Second, we outline
      intramolecular regulatory mechanisms such as autoinhibition and subsequent
      activation. Third, we discuss diverse extramolecular allosteric mechanisms
      ranging from actin-linked regulatory mechanisms to myosin:cargo interactions. At 
      last, we briefly outline the allosteric regulation of myosins with synthetic
      compounds.

AB  - The ability of cells to detect and repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is
      dependent on reorganization of the surrounding chromatin structure by chromatin
      remodeling complexes. These complexes promote access to the site of DNA damage,
      facilitate processing of the damaged DNA and, importantly, are essential to
      repackage the repaired DNA. Here, we will review the chromatin remodeling steps
      that occur immediately after DSB production and that prepare the damaged
      chromatin template for processing by the DSB repair machinery. DSBs promote rapid
      accumulation of repressive complexes, including HP1, the NuRD complex, H2A.Z and 
      histone methyltransferases at the DSB. This shift to a repressive chromatin
      organization may be important to inhibit local transcription and limit mobility
      of the break and to maintain the DNA ends in close contact. Subsequently, the
      repressive chromatin is rapidly dismantled through a mechanism involving dynamic 
      exchange of the histone variant H2A.Z. H2A.Z removal at DSBs alters the acidic
      patch on the nucleosome surface, promoting acetylation of the H4 tail (by the
      NuA4-Tip60 complex) and shifting the chromatin to a more open structure. Further,
      H2A.Z removal promotes chromatin ubiquitination and recruitment of additional DSB
      repair proteins to the break. Modulation of the nucleosome surface and nucleosome
      function during DSB repair therefore plays a vital role in processing of DNA
      breaks. Further, the nucleosome surface may function as a central hub during DSB 
      repair, directing specific patterns of histone modification, recruiting DNA
      repair proteins and modulating chromatin packing during processing of the damaged
      DNA template.

AB  - The AAA+ Cdc48 ATPase (alias p97 or VCP) is a key player in multiple
      ubiquitin-dependent cell signaling, degradation, and quality control pathways.
      Central to these broad biological functions is the ability of Cdc48 to interact
      with a large number of adaptor proteins and to remodel macromolecular proteins
      and their complexes. Different models have been proposed to explain how Cdc48
      might couple ATP hydrolysis to forcible unfolding, dissociation, or remodeling of
      cellular clients. In this review, we provide an overview of possible mechanisms
      for substrate unfolding/remodeling by this conserved and essential AAA+ protein
      machine and their adaption and possible biological function throughout evolution.

      Hsp104.

AB  - Hsp104 is a dynamic ring translocase and hexameric AAA+ protein found in yeast,
      which couples ATP hydrolysis to disassembly and reactivation of proteins trapped 
      in soluble preamyloid oligomers, disordered protein aggregates, and stable
      amyloid or prion conformers. Here, we highlight advances in our structural
      understanding of Hsp104 and how Hsp104 deconstructs Sup35 prions. Although the
      atomic structure of Hsp104 hexamers remains uncertain, volumetric reconstruction 
      of Hsp104 hexamers in ATPgammaS, ADP-AlFx (ATP hydrolysis transition-state
      mimic), and ADP via small-angle x-ray scattering has revealed a peristaltic
      pumping motion upon ATP hydrolysis. This pumping motion likely drives directional
      substrate translocation across the central Hsp104 channel. Hsp104 initially
      engages Sup35 prions immediately C-terminal to their cross-beta structure.
      Directional pulling by Hsp104 then resolves N-terminal cross-beta structure in a 
      stepwise manner. First, Hsp104 fragments the prion. Second, Hsp104 unfolds
      cross-beta structure. Third, Hsp104 releases soluble Sup35. Deletion of the
      Hsp104 N-terminal domain yields a hypomorphic disaggregase, Hsp104(N), with an
      altered pumping mechanism. Hsp104(N) fragments Sup35 prions without unfolding
      cross-beta structure or releasing soluble Sup35. Moreover, Hsp104(N) activity
      cannot be enhanced by mutations in the middle domain that potentiate disaggregase
      activity. Thus, the N-terminal domain is critical for the full repertoire of
      Hsp104 activities.

AB  - Dynein is a large microtubule-based motor complex that requires tight coupling of
      intra-molecular ATP hydrolysis with the generation of mechanical force and
      track-binding activity. However, the microtubule-binding domain is structurally
      separated by about 15nm from the nucleotide-binding sites by a coiled-coil stalk.
      Thus, long-range two-way communication is necessary for coordination between the 
      catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis and dynein's track-binding affinities. To
      investigate the structural changes that occur in the dynein stalk region to
      produce two different microtubule affinities, here we improve the resolution
      limit of the previously reported structure of the entire stalk region and we
      investigate structural changes in the dynein stalk and strut/buttress regions by 
      comparing currently available X-ray structures. In the light of recent crystal
      structures, the basis of the transition from the low-affinity to the
      high-affinity coiled-coil registry is discussed. A concerted movement model
      previously reported by Carter and Vale is modified more specifically, and we
      proposed it as the open zipper model.

AB  - Meiotic clade AAA ATPases (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities), 
      which were initially grouped on the basis of phylogenetic classification of their
      AAA ATPase cassette, include four relatively well characterized family members,
      Vps4, spastin, katanin and fidgetin. These enzymes all function to disassemble
      specific polymeric protein structures, with Vps4 disassembling the ESCRT-III
      polymers that are central to the many membrane-remodeling activities of the ESCRT
      (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) pathway and spastin, katanin
      p60 and fidgetin affecting multiple aspects of cellular dynamics by severing
      microtubules. They share a common domain architecture that features an N-terminal
      MIT (microtubule interacting and trafficking) domain followed by a single AAA
      ATPase cassette. Meiotic clade AAA ATPases function as hexamers that can cycle
      between the active assembly and inactive monomers/dimers in a regulated process, 
      and they appear to disassemble their polymeric substrates by translocating
      subunits through the central pore of their hexameric ring. Recent studies with
      Vps4 have shown that nucleotide-induced asymmetry is a requirement for substrate 
      binding to the pore loops and that recruitment to the protein lattice via MIT
      domains also relieves autoinhibition and primes the AAA ATPase cassettes for
      substrate binding. The most striking, unifying feature of meiotic clade AAA
      ATPases may be their MIT domain, which is a module that is found in a wide
      variety of proteins that localize to ESCRT-III polymers. Spastin also displays an
      adjacent microtubule binding sequence, and the presence of both ESCRT-III and
      microtubule binding elements may underlie the recent findings that the ESCRT-III 
      disassembly function of Vps4 and the microtubule-severing function of spastin, as
      well as potentially katanin and fidgetin, are highly coordinated.

AB  - N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), first discovered in 1988, is a key
      factor for eukaryotic trafficking, including protein and hormone secretion and
      neurotransmitter release. It is a member of the AAA+ family (ATPases associated
      with diverse cellular activities). NSF disassembles soluble
      N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes
      in conjunction with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein 
      (SNAP). Structural studies of NSF and its complex with SNAREs and SNAPs (known as
      20S supercomplex) started about 20years ago. Crystal structures of individual N
      and D2 domains of NSF and low-resolution electron microscopy structures of
      full-length NSF and 20S supercomplex have been reported over the years.
      Nevertheless, the molecular architecture of the 20S supercomplex and the
      molecular mechanism of NSF-mediated SNARE complex disassembly remained unclear
      until recently. Here we review recent atomic-resolution or near-atomic resolution
      structures of NSF and of the 20S supercomplex, as well as recent insights into
      the molecular mechanism and energy requirements of NSF. We also compare NSF with 
      other known AAA+ family members.

AB  - Dynamic remodeling and turnover of cellular actin networks requires actin
      filament severing by actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/Cofilin proteins. Mammals 
      express three different ADF/Cofilins (Cof1, Cof2, and ADF), and genetic studies
      suggest that in vivo they perform both overlapping and unique functions. To gain 
      mechanistic insights into their different roles, we directly compared their
      G-actin and F-actin binding affinities, and quantified the actin filament
      severing activities of human Cof1, Cof2, and ADF using in vitro total internal
      reflection fluorescence microscopy. All three ADF/Cofilins had similar affinities
      for G-actin and F-actin. However, Cof2 and ADF severed filaments much more
      efficiently than Cof1 at both lower and higher concentrations and using either
      muscle or platelet actin. Furthermore, Cof2 and ADF were more effective than Cof1
      in promoting "enhanced disassembly" when combined with actin disassembly
      co-factors Coronin-1B and actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1), and these
      differences were observed on both preformed and actively growing filaments. To
      probe the mechanism underlying these differences, we used multi-wavelength total 
      internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to directly observe Cy3-Cof1 and
      Cy3-Cof2 interacting with actin filaments in real time during severing. Cof1 and 
      Cof2 each bound to filaments with similar kinetics, yet Cof2 induced severing
      much more rapidly than Cof1, decreasing the time interval between initial binding
      on a filament and severing at the same location. These differences in ADF/Cofilin
      activities and mechanisms may be used in cells to tune filament turnover rates,
      which can vary widely for different actin structures.

AB  - Many bacterial pathogens modulate their metabolic activity, virulence and
      pathogenicity through so-called "toxin-antitoxin" (TA) modules. The genome of the
      human pathogen Escherichia coli O157 contains two three-component TA modules
      related to the known parDE module. Here, we show that the toxin EcParE2 maps in a
      branch of the RelE/ParE toxin superfamily that is distinct from the branches that
      contain verified gyrase and ribosome inhibitors. The structure of EcParE2 closely
      resembles that of Caulobacter crescentus ParE but shows a distinct pattern of
      conserved surface residues, in agreement with its apparent inability to interact 
      with GyrA. The antitoxin EcPaaA2 is characterized by two alpha-helices (H1 and
      H2) that serve as molecular recognition elements to wrap itself around EcParE2.
      Both EcPaaA2 H1 and H2 are required to sustain a high-affinity interaction with
      EcParE2 and for the inhibition of EcParE2-mediated killing in vivo. Furthermore, 
      evidence demonstrates that EcPaaA2 H2, but not H1, determines specificity for
      EcParE2. The initially formed EcPaaA2-EcParE2 heterodimer then assembles into a
      hetero-hexadecamer, which is stable in solution and is formed in a highly
      cooperative manner. Together these findings provide novel data on quaternary
      structure, TA interactions and activity of a hitherto poorly characterized family
      of TA modules.

AB  - Assembly of HIV-1 particles is initiated by the trafficking of viral Gag
      polyproteins from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, where they co-localize
      and bud to form immature particles. Membrane targeting is mediated by the
      N-terminally myristoylated matrix (MA) domain of Gag and is dependent on the
      plasma membrane marker phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. Recent 
      studies revealed that PI(4,5)P2 molecules containing truncated acyl chains
      [tr-PI(4,5)P2] are capable of binding MA in an "extended lipid" conformation and 
      promoting myristoyl exposure. Here we report that tr-PI(4,5)P2 molecules also
      readily bind to non-membrane proteins, including HIV-1 capsid, which prompted us 
      to re-examine MA-PI(4,5)P2 interactions using native lipids and membrane mimetic 
      liposomes and bicelles. Liposome binding trends observed using a recently
      developed NMR approach paralleled results of flotation assays, although the
      affinities measured under the equilibrium conditions of NMR experiments were
      significantly higher. Native PI(4,5)P2 enhanced MA binding to liposomes designed 
      to mimic non-raft-like regions of the membrane, suggesting the possibility that
      binding of the protein to disordered domains may precede Gag association with, or
      nucleation of, rafts. Studies with bicelles revealed a subset of surface and
      myr-associated MA residues that are sensitive to native PI(4,5)P2, but cleft
      residues that interact with the 2'-acyl chains of tr-PI(4,5)P2 molecules in
      aqueous solution were insensitive to native PI(4,5)P2 in bicelles. Our findings
      call to question extended-lipid MA:membrane binding models, and instead support a
      model put forward from coarse-grained simulations indicating that binding is
      mediated predominantly by dynamic, electrostatic interactions between conserved
      basic residues of MA and multiple PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine molecules.

AB  - DARPin libraries, based on a Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein consensus framework,
      are a rich source of binding partners for a wide variety of proteins. Their
      modular structure, stability, ease of in vitro selection and high production
      yields make DARPins an ideal starting point for further engineering. The X-ray
      structures of around 30 different DARPin complexes demonstrate their ability to
      facilitate crystallization of their target proteins by restricting flexibility
      and preventing undesired interactions of the target molecule. However, their
      small size (18 kDa), very hydrophilic surface and repetitive structure can limit 
      the DARPins' ability to provide essential crystal contacts and their usefulness
      as a search model for addressing the crystallographic phase problem in molecular 
      replacement. To optimize DARPins for their application as crystallization
      chaperones, rigid domain-domain fusions of the DARPins to larger proteins, proven
      to yield high-resolution crystal structures, were generated. These fusions were
      designed in such a way that they affect only one of the terminal capping repeats 
      of the DARPin and do not interfere with residues involved in target binding,
      allowing to exchange at will the binding specificities of the DARPin in the
      fusion construct. As a proof of principle, we designed rigid fusions of a
      stabilized version of Escherichia coli TEM-1 beta-lactamase to the C-terminal
      capping repeat of various DARPins in six different relative domain orientations. 
      Five crystal structures representing four different fusion constructs, alone or
      in complex with the cognate target, show the predicted relative domain
      orientations and prove the validity of the concept.

AB  - Sickle cell disease is fundamentally a kinetic disorder, in which cells
      containing the mutated hemoglobin (hemoglobin S; HbS) will cause occlusion if
      they sickle in the microvasculature, but have minimal (or no) consequences if
      they sickle in the venous return. Physiologically, sickling always occurs when
      some ligands are present; nonetheless, the kinetics in the presence of ligands
      are virtually unstudied. Sickling arises from nucleation-controlled polymer
      formation, triggered when the HbS loses ligands (e.g., oxygen). Thus,
      understanding how nucleation responds to the presence of oxygen is the key to
      understanding how sickling proceeds in a physiological context. We have measured 
      the rate of nucleus formation in HbS partially liganded with NO or CO, which we
      find have equivalent effects in reducing the nucleation rates. We find that
      hemoglobin must be in the T (tense) quaternary structure for nucleation, but the 
      presence of ligands inhibits nucleus formation even when the correct quaternary
      structure is present. From these results, we can predict the fraction of cells
      that will sickle at any given partial ligand saturations. The ability to make
      such predictions may prove especially useful in designing future therapies,
      particularly those where the oxygen affinity is perturbed.

AB  - Human phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) plays a central role in cellular glucose
      homeostasis, mediating the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis through 
      the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate. Recent clinical
      studies have identified mutations in this enzyme as the cause of PGM1 deficiency,
      an inborn error of metabolism classified as both a glycogen storage disease and a
      congenital disorder of glycosylation. Reported here are the first crystal
      structures of two disease-related missense variants of PGM1, along with the
      structure of the wild-type enzyme. Two independent glycine-to-arginine
      substitutions (G121R and G291R), both affecting key active site loops of PGM1,
      are found to induce regions of structural disorder, as evidenced by a nearly
      complete loss of electron density for as many as 23 aa. The disordered regions
      are not contiguous in sequence to the site of mutation, and even cross domain
      boundaries. Other structural rearrangements include changes in the conformations 
      of loops and side chains, some of which occur nearly 20 A away from the site of
      mutation. The induced structural disorder is correlated with increased
      sensitivity to proteolysis and lower-resolution diffraction, particularly for the
      G291R variant. Examination of the multi-domain effects of these GR mutations
      establishes a correlation between interdomain interfaces of the enzyme and
      missense variants of PGM1 associated with disease. These crystal structures
      provide the first insights into the structural basis of enzyme dysfunction in
      PGM1 deficiency and highlight a growing role for biophysical characterization of 
      proteins in the field of precision medicine.

AB  - The mitochondrial inner membrane consists of two morphologically distinct
      domains, the inner boundary membrane and large invaginations termed cristae.
      Narrow membrane structures, the crista junctions, link these two domains.
      Maintenance of this elaborate architecture depends on the evolutionarily
      conserved mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), a
      multisubunit inner membrane protein complex. MICOS consists of two functional
      modules, a Mic60-Mic19 subcomplex that forms Mic60-mediated contact sites with
      the outer mitochondrial membrane and a Mic10-Mic12-Mic26-Mic27 membrane-sculpting
      subcomplex that contains large Mic10 oligomers. Deletion of MIC10 or MIC60
      results in the loss of most crista junctions. Distinct views have been discussed 
      about how the MICOS modules cooperate with each other. We searched for components
      required for the structural organization of MICOS and identified Mic12 and Mic27 
      as crucial factors with specific roles in MICOS complex formation. Mic27 promotes
      the stability of the Mic10 oligomers in the membrane-sculpting subcomplex,
      whereas Mic12 is required for the coupling of the two MICOS subcomplexes. We
      conclude that in addition to the MICOS core components Mic10 and Mic60, Mic12 and
      Mic27 play specific roles in the organization of the MICOS complex.

AB  - During the cold adaptation that follows a cold stress, bacterial cells undergo
      many physiological changes and extensive reprogramming of their gene expression
      pattern. Bulk gene expression is drastically reduced, while a set of cold shock
      genes is selectively and transiently expressed. The initial stage of cold
      acclimation is characterized by the establishment of a stoichiometric imbalance
      of the translation initiation factors (IFs)/ribosomes ratio that contributes to
      the preferential translation of cold shock transcripts. Whereas de novo synthesis
      of the IFs following cold stress has been documented, nothing was known
      concerning the activity of the rrn operons during the cold acclimation period. In
      this work, we focus on the expression of the rrn operons and the fate of rRNA
      after temperature downshift. We demonstrate that in Escherichia coli, rRNA
      synthesis does not stop during the cold acclimation phase, but continues with
      greater contribution of the P2 compared to the P1 promoter and all seven rrn
      operons are active, although their expression levels change with respect to
      pre-stress conditions. Eight hours after the 37 degrees -->10 degrees C
      temperature downshift, the newly transcribed rRNA represents up to 20% of total
      rRNA and is preferentially found in the polysomes. However, with respect to the
      de novo synthesis of the IFs, both rRNA transcription and maturation are slowed
      down drastically by cold stress, thereby accounting in part for the
      stoichiometric imbalance of the IFs/ribosomes. Overall, our data indicate that
      new ribosomes, which are possibly suitable to function at low temperature, are
      slowly assembled during cold acclimation.

AB  - Set8 is the only mammalian monomethyltransferase responsible for H4K20me1, a
      methyl mark critical for genomic integrity of eukaryotic cells. We present here a
      structural model for how Set8 uses multivalent interactions to bind and methylate
      the nucleosome based on crystallographic and solution studies of the
      Set8/nucleosome complex. Our studies indicate that Set8 employs its i-SET and
      c-SET domains to engage nucleosomal DNA 1 to 1.5 turns from the nucleosomal dyad 
      and in doing so, it positions the SET domain for catalysis with H4 Lys20.
      Surprisingly, we find that a basic N-terminal extension to the SET domain plays
      an even more prominent role in nucleosome binding, possibly by making an arginine
      anchor interaction with the nucleosome H2A/H2B acidic patch. We further show that
      proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the nucleosome compete for binding to Set8
      through this basic extension, suggesting a mechanism for how nucleosome binding
      protects Set8 from proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent degradation
      during the cell cycle.

TI  - Regulatory Implications of Non-Trivial Splicing: Isoform 3 of Rab1A Shows
      Enhanced Basal Activity and Is Not Controlled by Accessory Proteins.
PG  - 1544-57

AB  - Alternative splicing often affects structured and highly conserved regions of
      proteins, generating so called non-trivial splicing variants of unknown structure
      and cellular function. The human small G-protein Rab1A is involved in the
      regulation of the vesicle transfer from the ER to Golgi. A conserved non-trivial 
      splice variant lacks nearly 40% of the sequence of the native Rab1A, including
      most of the regulatory interaction sites. We show that this variant of Rab1A
      represents a stable and folded protein, which is still able to bind nucleotides
      and co-localizes with membranes. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that
      compared to other wild-typeRabGTPases, the measured nucleotide binding affinities
      are dramatically reduced in the variant studied. Furthermore, the Rab1A variant
      forms hetero-dimers with wild-type Rab1A and its presence in the cell enhances
      the efficiency of alkaline phosphatase secretion. However, this variant shows no 
      specificity for GXP nucleotides, a constantly enhanced GTP hydrolysis activity
      and is no longer controlled by GEF or GAP proteins, indicating a new regulatory
      mechanism for the Rab1A cycle via alternative non-trivial splicing.

TI  - Autoinhibition of ETV6 DNA Binding Is Established by the Stability of Its
      Inhibitory Helix.
PG  - 1515-30
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2016.02.020 [doi]
LID - S0022-2836(16)00136-4 [pii]
AB  - The ETS transcriptional repressor ETV6 (or TEL) is autoinhibited by an
      alpha-helix that sterically blocks its DNA-binding ETS domain. The inhibitory
      helix is marginally stable and unfolds when ETV6 binds to either specific or
      non-specific DNA. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that folding of the inhibitory 
      helix requires a buried charge-dipole interaction with helix H1 of the ETS
      domain. This interaction also contributes directly to autoinhibition by
      precluding a highly conserved dipole-enhanced hydrogen bond between the
      phosphodiester backbone of bound DNA and the N terminus of helix H1. To probe
      further the thermodynamic basis of autoinhibition, ETV6 variants were generated
      with amino acid substitutions introduced along the solvent exposed surface of the
      inhibitory helix. These changes were designed to increase the intrinsic helical
      propensity of the inhibitory helix without perturbing its packing interactions
      with the ETS domain. NMR-monitored amide hydrogen exchange measurements confirmed
      that the stability of the folded inhibitory helix increases progressively with
      added helix-promoting substitutions. This also results in progressively
      reinforced autoinhibition and decreased DNA-binding affinity. Surprisingly,
      locking the inhibitory helix onto the ETS domain by a disulfide bridge severely
      impairs, but does not abolish DNA binding. Weak interactions still occur via an
      interface displaced from the canonical ETS domain DNA-binding surface.
      Collectively, these studies establish a direct thermodynamic linkage between
      inhibitory helix stability and ETV6 autoinhibition, and demonstrate that helix
      unfolding does not strictly precede DNA binding. Modulating inhibitory helix
      stability provides a potential route for the in vivo regulation of ETV6 activity.

AB  - Fast-folding WW domains are among the best-characterized systems for comparing
      experiments and simulations of protein folding. Recent microsecond-resolution
      experiments and long duration (totaling milliseconds) single-trajectory modeling 
      have shown that even mechanistic changes in folding kinetics due to mutation can 
      now be analyzed. Thus, a comprehensive set of experimental data would be helpful 
      to benchmark the predictions made by simulations. Here, we use T-jump relaxation 
      in conjunction with protein engineering and report mutational Phi-values (Phi(M))
      as indicators for folding transition-state structure of 65 side chain, 7 backbone
      hydrogen bond, and 6 deletion and /or insertion mutants within loop 1 of the
      34-residue hPin1 WW domain. Forty-five cross-validated consensus mutants could be
      identified that provide structural constraints for transition-state structure
      within all substructures of the WW domain fold (hydrophobic core, loop 1, loop 2,
      beta-sheet). We probe the robustness of the two hydrophobic clusters in the
      folding transition state, discuss how local backbone disorder in the native-state
      can lead to non-classical Phi(M)-values (Phi(M) > 1) in the rate-determining loop
      1 substructure, and conclusively identify mutations and positions along the
      sequence that perturb the folding mechanism from loop 1-limited toward loop
      2-limited folding.

AB  - Complex organisms are faced with the challenge of generating and maintaining
      diverse cell types, ranging from simple epithelia to neurons and motile immune
      cells [1-3]. To meet this challenge, a complex set of regulatory pathways
      controls nearly every aspect of cell growth and function, including genetic and
      epigenetic programming, cytoskeleton dynamics, and protein trafficking. The far
      reach of cell fate specification pathways makes it particularly catastrophic when
      they malfunction, both during development and for tissue homeostasis in adult
      organisms. Furthermore, the therapeutic promise of stem cells derives from their 
      ability to deftly navigate the multitude of pathways that control cell fate [4]. 
      How the molecular components making up these pathways function to specify cell
      fate is beginning to become clear. Work from diverse systems suggests that the
      atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) is a key regulator of cell fate decisions in
      metazoans [5-7]. Here, we examine some of the diverse physiological outcomes of
      aPKC's function in differentiation, along with the molecular pathways that
      control aPKC and those that are responsive to changes in its catalytic activity.

AB  - Direct cell conversion developed into an important paradigm for generating cells 
      with enhanced differentiation capability. We combined a
      transcription-factor-based cell fate conversion strategy with the use of
      pharmacological compounds to derive early neuroepithelial progenitor cells from
      developmentally more restricted radial glia-type neural stem cells. By combining 
      the small molecules CHIR99021, Tranylcypromine, SB431542 and valproic acid with
      viral transduction of the transcription factor c-Myc and the POU domain
      transcription factor Brn2, we dedifferentiated radial glia-type neural stem cells
      into an early neuroepithelial progenitor cell state within 6 days. Reverse
      transcription PCR analyses showed a rapid down-regulation of the radial glia
      markers Olig2 and Vimentin during conversion, whereas the neuroepithelial markers
      Dach1 and Sox1 were fastly up-regulated. Furthermore, a switch from N-Cadherin to
      E-Cadherin indicates a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. The differentiation 
      of cells converted by Brn2/c-Myc yielded smooth muscle actin- and
      Peripherin-positive cells in addition to the neuronal marker TUJ1 and cells that 
      are positive for the glial marker GFAP. This differentiation potential suggests
      that the applied reprogramming strategy induced an early neuroepithelial cell
      population, which might resemble cells of the neural border or even more
      primitive neuroepithelial cells.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are sensitive to DNA damage and undergo
      rapid apoptosis compared to their differentiated progeny cells. Here, we explore 
      the underlying mechanisms for the increased apoptotic sensitivity of hPSCs that
      helps to determine pluripotent stem cell fate. Apoptosis was induced by exposure 
      to actinomycin D, etoposide, or tunicamycin, with each agent triggering a
      distinct apoptotic pathway. We show that hPSCs are more sensitive to all three
      types of apoptosis induction than are lineage-non-specific,
      retinoic-acid-differentiated hPSCs. Also, Bax activation and pro-apoptotic
      mitochondrial intermembrane space protein release, which are required to initiate
      the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway, are more rapid in hPSCs than in
      retinoic-acid-differentiated hPSCs. Surprisingly, Bak and not Bax is essential
      for actinomycin-D-induced apoptosis in human embryonic stem cells. Finally, P53
      is degraded rapidly in an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway in hPSCs at
      steady state but quickly accumulates and induces apoptosis when Mdm2 function is 
      impaired. Rapid degradation of P53 ensures the survival of healthy hPSCs but
      avails these cells for immediate apoptosis upon cellular damage by P53
      stabilization. Altogether, we provide an underlying, interconnected molecular
      mechanism that primes hPSCs for quick clearance by apoptosis to eliminate hPSCs
      with unrepaired genome alterations and preserves organismal genomic integrity
      during the early critical stages of human embryonic development.

AB  - Hair and feathers are unique because (1) their stem cells are contained within a 
      follicle structure, (2) they undergo cyclic regeneration repetitively throughout 
      life, (3) regeneration occurs physiologically in healthy individuals and (4)
      regeneration is also induced in response to injury. Precise control of this
      cyclic regeneration process is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of
      living organisms. While stem cells are regulated by the intra-follicle-adjacent
      micro-environmental niche, this niche is also modulated dynamically by
      extra-follicular macro-environmental signals, allowing stem cells to adapt to a
      larger changing environment and physiological needs. Here we review several
      examples of macro-environments that communicate with the follicles: intradermal
      adipose tissue, innate immune system, sex hormones, aging, circadian rhythm and
      seasonal rhythms. Related diseases are also discussed. Unveiling the mechanisms
      of how stem cell niches are modulated provides clues for regenerative medicine.
      Given that stem cells are hard to manipulate, focusing translational therapeutic 
      applications at the environments appears to be a more practical approach.

AB  - Mesendoderm (ME) refers to the primitive streak in mammalian embryos, which has
      the ability to further differentiate into mesoderm and endoderm. A better
      understanding on the regulatory networks of ME differentiation of embryonic stem 
      (ES) cells would provide important insights on early embryo patterning and a
      possible guidance for ES applications in regenerative medicine. Studies on
      developmental biology and embryology have offered a great deal of knowledge about
      key signaling pathways involved in primitive streak formation. Recently, various 
      chemically defined recipes have been formulated to induce differentiation of ES
      cells toward ME in vitro, which greatly facilitate the elucidation of the
      regulatory mechanisms of different signals involved in ME specification. Among
      the extrinsic signals, transforming growth factor-beta/Activin signaling and Wnt 
      signaling have been shown to be the most critical ones. On another side,
      intrinsic epigenetic regulation has been indicated to be important in ME
      determination. In this review, we summarize the current understanding on the
      extrinsic and intrinsic regulations of ES cells-to-ME differentiation and the
      crosstalk among them, aiming to get a general overview on ME specification and
      primitive streak formation.

AB  - Skeletal muscle, the most abundant and widespread tissue in the human body,
      contracts upon receiving electrochemical signals from the nervous system to
      support essential functions such as thermoregulation, limb movement, blinking,
      swallowing and breathing. Reconstruction of adult muscle tissue relies on a pool 
      of mononucleate, resident muscle stem cells, known as "satellite cells",
      expressing the paired-box transcription factor Pax7 necessary for their
      specification during embryonic development and long-term maintenance during adult
      life. Satellite cells are located around the myofibres in a niche at the
      interface of the basal lamina and the host fibre plasma membrane (i.e.,
      sarcolemma), at a very low frequency. Upon damage to the myofibres, quiescent
      satellite cells are activated and give rise to a population of transient
      amplifying myogenic progenitor cells, which eventually exit the cell cycle
      permanently and fuse to form new myofibres and regenerate the tissue. A
      subpopulation of satellite cells self-renew and repopulate the niche, poised to
      respond to future demands. Harnessing the potential of satellite cells relies on 
      a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding their regulation in 
      vivo. Over the past several decades, studies revealed many signal transduction
      pathways responsible for satellite cell fate decisions, but the niche cues
      driving the activation and silencing of these pathways are less clear. Here we
      explore the scintillating possibility that considering the dynamic changes in the
      biophysical properties of the skeletal muscle, namely stiffness, and the stretch 
      and shear forces to which a myofibre can be subjected to may provide missing
      information necessary to gain a full understanding of satellite cell niche
      regulation.

TI  - A Monomer of Pif1 Unwinds Double-Stranded DNA and It Is Regulated by the Nature
      of the Non-Translocating Strand at the 3'-End.

AB  - Using a DNA polymerase coupled assay and FRET (Forster resonance energy
      transfer)-based helicase assays, in this work, we show that a monomer of
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 can unwind dsDNA (double-stranded DNA). The
      helicase activity of a Pif1 monomer is modulated by the nature of the 3'-ssDNA
      (single-stranded DNA) tail of the substrate and its effect on a Pif1-dependent
      re-winding activity that is coupled to the opening of dsDNA. We propose that, in 
      addition to the ssDNA site on the protein that interacts with the translocating
      strand, Pif1 has a second site that binds the 3'-ssDNA of the substrate.
      Interaction of DNA with this site modulates the degree to which re-winding
      counteracts unwinding. Depending on the nature of the 3'-tail and the length of
      the duplex DNA to be unwound, this activity is sufficiently strong to mask the
      helicase activity of a monomer. In excess Pif1 over the DNA, the Pif1-dependent
      re-winding of the opened DNA strongly limits unwinding, independent of the
      3'-tail. We propose that, in this case, binding of DNA to the second site is
      precluded and modulation of the Pif1-dependent re-winding activity is largely
      lost.

AB  - Cotranslational protein folding can generate pulling forces on the nascent chain 
      that can affect the instantaneous translation rate and thereby possibly feed back
      on the folding process. Such feedback would represent a new way of coupling
      translation and folding, different from coupling based on, for example, codon
      usage. However, to date, we have carried out the experiments used to measure
      pulling forces generated by cotranslational protein folding either in
      reconstituted in vitro translation systems lacking chaperones, in ill-defined
      cell lysates, or in vivo; hence, the effects of chaperones on force generation by
      folding are unknown. Here, we have studied the cotranslational folding of
      dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in the absence and in the presence of the
      chaperones trigger factor (TF) and GroEL/ES. DHFR was tethered to the ribosome
      via a C-terminal linker of varying length, ending with the SecM translational
      arrest peptide that serves as an intrinsic force sensor reporting on the force
      generated on the nascent chain when DHFR folds. We find that DHFR folds into its 
      native structure only when it has emerged fully outside the ribosome and that TF 
      and GroEL alone substantially reduces the force generated on the nascent chain by
      the folding of DHFR, while GroEL/ES has no effect. TF therefore weakens the
      possible coupling between cotranslational folding and translation.

AB  - The production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli frequently results in 
      the formation of insoluble protein aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs). The 
      determinants of IB formation remain poorly understood and are of much interest
      for biotechnological and research applications, as well as offering insight into 
      disease-related in vivo protein aggregation. Here we investigate a set of
      engineered target-binding proteins based upon the fibronectin type III domain,
      and we find that variations in sequence at just three positions in a
      solvent-exposed loop greatly alter the extent of IB formation. The loop is
      analogous to the third complementarity-determining region of immunoglobulin
      variable domains and has been shown to be conformationally mobile. In contrast to
      studies of other proteins, the extent of IB formation is not explained by
      differences in thermal stability measured by differential scanning calorimetry.
      Instead, IB formation is correlated with the average local stability of the FG
      loop, as modeled by an ensemble of structures generated using Rosetta's kinematic
      closure loop reconstruction method. This correlation suggests that loop
      instability may promote local unfolding, exposing aggregation-prone surfaces.
      Consistent with this mechanism, sequence-based predictions of aggregation
      propensity produced by Zyggregator are also correlated with IB formation, though 
      not with modeled loop stability. The combination of average model energy scores
      with sequence-based aggregation predictions accounts for the variation in IB
      formation remarkably well (R(2)=0.8). The comparison with experimental data
      validates the ensemble modeling approach, which may be applicable to dynamic
      protein loops involved in a wide range of phenomena.

AB  - The aggregation of the neuronal Tau protein is one molecular hallmark of
      Alzheimer's disease and other related tauopathies, but the precise molecular
      mechanisms of the aggregation process remain unclear. The FK506 binding protein
      FKBP52 is able to induce oligomers in the pathogenic Tau P301L mutant and in a
      truncated form of the wild-type human Tau protein. Here, we investigate whether
      FKBP52's capacity to induce Tau oligomers depends on its prolyl cis/trans
      isomerase activity. We find that FKBP52 indeed can isomerize selected prolyl
      bonds in the different Tau proteins, and that this activity is carried solely by 
      its first FK506 binding domain. Its capacity to oligomerize Tau is, however, not 
      linked to this peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. In addition, we identified a
      novel molecular interaction implying the PHF6 peptide of Tau and the FK1/FK2
      domains of FKBP52 independent of FK506 binding; these data point toward a
      non-catalytic molecular interaction that might govern the effect of FKBP52 on
      Tau.

AB  - Innexins are invertebrate-specific gap junction proteins with four transmembrane 
      helices. These proteins oligomerize to constitute intercellular channels that
      allow for the passage of small signaling molecules associated with neural and
      muscular electrical activity. In contrast to the large number of structural and
      functional studies of connexin gap junction channels, few structural studies of
      recombinant innexin channels are reported. Here we show the three-dimensional
      structure of two-dimensionally crystallized Caenorhabditis elegans innexin-6
      (INX-6) gap junction channels. The N-terminal deleted INX-6 proteins are
      crystallized in lipid bilayers. The three-dimensional reconstruction determined
      by cryo-electron crystallography reveals that a single INX-6 gap junction channel
      comprises 16 subunits, a hexadecamer, in contrast to chordate connexin channels, 
      which comprise 12 subunits. The channel pore diameters at the cytoplasmic
      entrance and extracellular gap region are larger than those of connexin26. Two
      bulb densities are observed in each hemichannel, one in the pore and the other at
      the cytoplasmic side of the hemichannel in the channel pore pathway. These
      findings imply a structural diversity of gap junction channels among
      multicellular organisms.

AB  - Protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) is unique among PRMTs, as it is
      specifically expressed in brain and localized to the plasma membrane via
      N-terminal myristoylation. Here, we describe the crystal structure of human PRMT8
      (hPRMT8) at 3.0-A resolution. The crystal structure of hPRMT8 exhibited a novel
      helical assembly. Biochemical, biophysical and mutagenesis experiments
      demonstrated that hPRMT8 forms an octamer in solution. This octameric structure
      is necessary for proper localization to the plasma membrane and efficient
      methyltransferase activity. The helical assembly might be a relevant quaternary
      form for hPRMT1, which is the predominant PRMT in mammalian cells and most
      closely related to hPRMT8.

TI  - Homo-trimeric Structure of the Type IVb Minor Pilin CofB Suggests Mechanism of
      CFA/III Pilus Assembly in Human Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1209-1226

AB  - In gram-negative bacteria, the assembly of type IV pilus (T4P) and the
      evolutionally related pseudopilus of type II secretion system involves
      specialized structural proteins called pilins and pseudopilins, respectively, and
      is dynamically regulated to promote bacterial pathogenesis. Previous studies have
      suggested that a structural "tip"-like hetero-complex formed through the
      interaction of at least three minor (pseudo) pilins plays an important role in
      this process, while some members of the pathogenic type IVb subfamily are known
      to have only one such minor pilin subunit whose function is still unknown. Here, 
      we determined the crystal structure of the type IVb minor pilin CofB of
      colonization factor antigen/III from human enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli at
      1.88-A resolution. The crystal structure, in conjunction with physicochemical
      analysis in solution, reveals a symmetrical homo-trimeric arrangement distinct
      from the hetero-complexes of minor (pseudo) pilins observed in other T4P and type
      II secretion systems. Each CofB monomer adopts a unique three-domain
      architecture, in which the C-terminal beta-sheet-rich lectin domain can
      effectively initiate trimer association of its pilin-like N-terminal domain
      through extensive hydrophobic interactions followed by domain swapping at the
      central hinge-like domain. Deletion of cofB produces a phenotype with no
      detectable pili formation on the cell surface, while molecular modeling indicates
      that the characteristic homo-trimeric structure of CofB is well situated at the
      pilus tip of colonization factor antigen/III formed by the major pilin CofA,
      suggesting a role for the minor pilin in the efficient initiation of T4P
      assembly.

      Helicase Dbp2 at Actively Transcribed Chromatin.

AB  - RNA helicases play fundamental roles in modulating RNA structures and
      facilitating RNA-protein (RNP) complex assembly in vivo. Previously, our
      laboratory demonstrated that the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp2 in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae is required to promote efficient assembly of the co-transcriptionally 
      associated mRNA-binding proteins Yra1, Nab2, and Mex67 onto poly(A)(+)RNA. We
      also found that Yra1 associates directly with Dbp2 and functions as an inhibitor 
      of Dbp2-dependent duplex unwinding, suggestive of a cycle of unwinding and
      inhibition by Dbp2. To test this, we undertook a series of experiments to shed
      light on the order of events for Dbp2 in co-transcriptional mRNP assembly. We now
      show that Dbp2 is recruited to chromatin via RNA and forms a large, RNA-dependent
      complex with Yra1 and Mex67. Moreover, single-molecule fluorescence resonance
      energy transfer and bulk biochemical assays show that Yra1 inhibits unwinding in 
      a concentration-dependent manner by preventing the association of Dbp2 with
      single-stranded RNA. This inhibition prevents over-accumulation of Dbp2 on mRNA
      and stabilization of a subset of RNA polymerase II transcripts. We propose a
      model whereby Yra1 terminates a cycle of mRNP assembly by Dbp2.

AB  - Structure validation is a key component of all steps in the structure
      determination process, from structure building, refinement, deposition, and
      evaluation all the way to post-deposition optimisation of structures in the
      Protein Data Bank (PDB) by re-refinement and re-building. Today, many aspects of 
      protein structures are understood better than 10years ago, and combined with
      improved software and more computing power, the automated PDB_REDO procedure can 
      significantly improve about 85% of all X-ray structures ever deposited in the
      PDB. We review structure validation, structure improvement, and a series of
      validation resources and facilities that give access to improved PDB files and to
      reports on the quality of the original and the improved structures.
      Post-deposition optimisation generally leads to improved protein structures and a
      series of examples will illustrate how that, in turn, leads to improved or even
      novel biological insights.

AB  - Histone pre-mRNAs are cleaved at the 3' end by a complex that contains U7 snRNP, 
      the FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH) and histone pre-mRNA cleavage complex
      (HCC) consisting of several polyadenylation factors. Within the complex, the N
      terminus of FLASH interacts with the N terminus of the U7 snRNP protein Lsm11,
      and together they recruit the HCC. FLASH through its distant C terminus
      independently interacts with the C-terminal SANT/Myb-like domain of nuclear
      protein, ataxia-telangiectasia locus (NPAT), a transcriptional co-activator
      required for expression of histone genes in S phase. To gain structural
      information on these interactions, we used mass spectrometry to monitor
      hydrogen/deuterium exchange in various regions of FLASH, Lsm11 and NPAT alone or 
      in the presence of their respective binding partners. Our results indicate that
      the FLASH-interacting domain in Lsm11 is highly dynamic, while the more
      downstream region required for recruiting the HCC exchanges deuterium slowly and 
      likely folds into a stable structure. In FLASH, a stable structure is adopted by 
      the domain that interacts with Lsm11 and this domain is further stabilized by
      binding Lsm11. Notably, both hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments and in vitro
      binding assays demonstrate that Lsm11, in addition to interacting with the
      N-terminal region of FLASH, also contacts the C-terminal SANT/Myb-like domain of 
      FLASH, the same region that binds NPAT. However, while NPAT stabilizes this
      domain, Lsm11 causes its partial relaxation. These competing reactions may play a
      role in regulating histone gene expression in vivo.

AB  - Many cellular processes including cell division and cell migration require
      coordination between the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons. This
      coordination is as-yet poorly understood, but proteins such as formins and IQGAP1
      are known to be involved. We show that the MT binding protein EB1 (end-binding
      protein 1), a key regulator of MT dynamics, can bind directly to filamentous
      actin (F-actin) F-actin. We determined that the EB1:F-actin interaction is salt
      sensitive and weak under physiological salt concentrations but might be relevant 
      in contexts where the local concentration of actin is high. Using bioinformatics 
      and mutagenesis, we found that the EB1:F-actin binding site partially overlaps
      the well-characterized EB1:MT binding interface. Congruently, competition
      experiments indicate that EB1 can bind to F-actin or MTs but not both
      simultaneously. These observations suggest that EB1:F-actin interactions may
      negatively regulate EB1:MT interactions, and we speculate that this interaction
      may assist cells in differentially regulating MT stability in the actin-rich
      cortex as opposed to the cell interior.

AB  - The misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) to aggregated forms is linked to
      several neurodegenerative diseases. Misfolded oligomeric forms of PrP are
      associated with neurotoxicity and/or infectivity, but the molecular mechanism by 
      which they form is still poorly understood. A reduction in pH is known to be a
      key factor that triggers misfolded oligomer formation by PrP, but the residues
      whose protonation is linked with misfolding remain unidentified. The structural
      consequences of the protonation of these residues also remain to be determined.
      In the current study, amino acid residues whose protonation is critical for PrP
      misfolding and oligomerization have been identified using site-directed
      mutagenesis and misfolding/oligomerization assays. It is shown that the
      protonation of either H186 or D201, which mimics the effects of pathogenic
      mutations (H186R and D201N) at both residue sites, is critically linked to the
      stability, misfolding and oligomerization of PrP. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange
      studies coupled with mass spectrometry show that the protonation of either H186
      or D201 leads to the same common structural change: increased structural dynamics
      in helix 1 and that in the loop between helix 1 and beta-strand 2. It is shown
      that the protonation of either of these residues is sufficient for accelerating
      misfolded oligomer formation, most likely because the protonation of either
      residue causes the same structural perturbation. Hence, the increased structural 
      dynamics in helix 1 and that in the loop between helix 1 and beta-strand 2 appear
      to play an early critical role in acid-induced misfolding of PrP.

AB  - In response to light, as part of a two-component system, the Brucella blue
      light-activated histidine kinase (LOV-HK) increases its autophosphorylation,
      modulating the virulence of this microorganism. The Brucella histidine kinase
      (HK) domain belongs to the HWE family, for which there is no structural
      information. The HWE family is exclusively present in proteobacteria and usually 
      coupled to a wide diversity of light sensor domains. This work reports the
      crystal structure of the Brucella HK domain, which presents two different dimeric
      assemblies in the asymmetric unit: one similar to the already described canonical
      parallel homodimers (C) and the other, an antiparallel non-canonical (NC) dimer, 
      each with distinct relative subdomain orientations and dimerization interfaces.
      Contrary to these crystallographic structures and unlike other HKs, in solution, 
      the Brucella HK domain is monomeric and still active, showing an astonishing
      instability of the dimeric interface. Despite this instability, using
      cross-linking experiments, we show that the C dimer is the functionally relevant 
      species. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the autophosphorylation activity
      occurs in cis. The different relative subdomain orientations observed for the NC 
      and C states highlight the large conformational flexibility of the HK domain.
      Through the analysis of these alternative conformations by means of molecular
      dynamics simulations, we also propose a catalytic mechanism for Brucella LOV-HK.

      Explaining Tarantula Muscle Super-Relaxed State Structural Basis.

AB  - Tarantula striated muscle is an outstanding system for understanding the
      molecular organization of myosin filaments. Three-dimensional reconstruction
      based on cryo-electron microscopy images and single-particle image processing
      revealed that, in a relaxed state, myosin molecules undergo intramolecular
      head-head interactions, explaining why head activity switches off. The filament
      model obtained by rigidly docking a chicken smooth muscle myosin structure to the
      reconstruction was improved by flexibly fitting an atomic model built by mixing
      structures from different species to a tilt-corrected 2-nm three-dimensional map 
      of frozen-hydrated tarantula thick filament. We used heavy and light chain
      sequences from tarantula myosin to build a single-species homology model of two
      heavy meromyosin interacting-heads motifs (IHMs). The flexibly fitted model
      includes previously missing loops and shows five intramolecular and five
      intermolecular interactions that keep the IHM in a compact off structure, forming
      four helical tracks of IHMs around the backbone. The residues involved in these
      interactions are oppositely charged, and their sequence conservation suggests
      that IHM is present across animal species. The new model, PDB 3JBH, explains the 
      structural origin of the ATP turnover rates detected in relaxed tarantula muscle 
      by ascribing the very slow rate to docked unphosphorylated heads, the slow rate
      to phosphorylated docked heads, and the fast rate to phosphorylated undocked
      heads. The conservation of intramolecular interactions across animal species and 
      the presence of IHM in bilaterians suggest that a super-relaxed state should be
      maintained, as it plays a role in saving ATP in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth
      muscles.

AB  - The Dlx5 homeodomain is a transcription factor related to the Drosophila
      distal-less gene that is associated with breast and lung cancer, lymphoma, Rett
      syndrome and osteoporosis in humans. Mutations in the DLX5 gene have been linked 
      to deficiencies in craniofacial and limb development in higher eukaryotes,
      including split hand and foot malformation 1 in humans. Our characterization of a
      Dlx5 homeodomain:(CGACTAATTAGTCG)2 complex by NMR spectroscopy paved the way for 
      determination of its crystal structure at 1.85A resolution that enabled
      rationalization of the effects of disease-related mutations on the protein
      function. A Q186H mutation linked to split hand and foot malformation 1 likely
      affects affinity of DNA binding by disrupting water-mediated interactions with
      the DNA major groove. A more subtle effect is implicated for the Q178P mutation, 
      which is not in direct contact with the DNA. Our data indicate that these
      mutations diminish the ability of the Dlx5 homeodomain to recognize and bind
      target DNAs, and they likely destabilize the formation of functional complexes.

AB  - The highly organized mitochondrial inner membrane harbors enzymes that produce
      the bulk of cellular ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. The majority of inner
      membrane protein precursors are synthesized in the cytosol. Precursors with a
      cleavable presequence are imported by the presequence translocase (TIM23
      complex), while other precursors containing internal targeting signals are
      imported by the carrier translocase (TIM22 complex). Both TIM23 and TIM22 are
      activated by the transmembrane electrochemical potential. Many small inner
      membrane proteins, however, do not resemble canonical TIM23 or TIM22 substrates
      and their mechanism of import is unknown. We report that subunit e of the
      F1Fo-ATP synthase, a small single-spanning inner membrane protein that is
      critical for inner membrane organization, is imported by TIM23 in a process that 
      does not require activation by the membrane potential. Absence of positively
      charged residues at the matrix-facing amino-terminus of subunit e facilitates
      membrane potential-independent import. Instead, engineered positive charges
      establish a dependence of the import reaction on the electrochemical potential.
      Our results have two major implications. First, they reveal an unprecedented
      pathway of protein import into the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is
      mediated by TIM23. Second, they directly demonstrate the role of the membrane
      potential in driving the electrophoretic transport of positively charged protein 
      segments across the inner membrane.

AB  - The aggregation of mostly antibody light chain variable (VL) domains into amyloid
      fibrils in various tissues is the main cause of death in systemic amyloid light
      chain amyloidosis. Point mutations within the domain are important to shift the
      VL into the fibrillar pathway, but why and how only some site-specific mutations 
      achieve this still remains elusive. We show here that both destabilizing and
      surprisingly stable mutants readily predispose an amyloid-resistant VL domain to 
      amyloid formation. The decreased thermodynamic stability of the destabilizing
      mutant results in the accumulation of non-native intermediates that readily
      populate the amyloid state. Interestingly, the stable mutants establish
      site-specific non-native interactions with especially nearby serine/threonine
      residues that unexpectedly do not affect the folding behavior of the VL domain
      but rather readily induce and stabilize the fibril structure, a previously
      unrecognized mechanism. These findings provide a new concept for the molecular
      mechanism of amyloid fibril formation.

AB  - Bacterial translation termination is triggered when a stop codon arrives at the
      ribosomal A site. Stop codons are recognized by class I release factors (RF1 and 
      RF2 in Escherichia coli), which bind to the ribosome and catalyze the release of 
      the newly synthesized protein. Crystal structures showed that RF1 and RF2 are in 
      an open conformation when bound to the ribosome but are in a closed conformation 
      when not bound to the ribosome. It is not clear whether only the open form of RF1
      and RF2 binds to the ribosome. Alternatively, the closed form of RF1 and RF2 may 
      bind to the ribosome and undergo a conformational change to the open state upon
      binding. We used transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer
      experiments to monitor precisely the conformation of RF1 in the absence and
      presence of the ribosome. Our results indicate that RF1 undergoes a large
      conformational change from a closed to an open form upon binding to the ribosome.
      Our results are consistent with the mechanism, in which high termination fidelity
      is achieved by linking stop codon recognition by RF1 to the change in
      conformation from closed to open state.

AB  - While the gene for p53 is mutated in many human cancers causing loss of function,
      many others maintain a wild-type gene but exhibit reduced p53 tumor suppressor
      activity through overexpression of the negative regulators, Mdm2 and/or MdmX. For
      the latter mechanism of loss of function, the activity of endogenous p53 can be
      restored through inhibition of Mdm2 or MdmX with small molecules. We previously
      reported a series of compounds based upon the Nutlin-3 chemical scaffold that
      bind to both MdmX and Mdm2 [Vara, B. A. et al. (2014) Organocatalytic, diastereo-
      and enantioselective synthesis of nonsymmetric cis-stilbene diamines: A platform 
      for the preparation of single-enantiomer cis-imidazolines for protein-protein
      inhibition. J. Org. Chem. 79, 6913-6938]. Here we present the first solution
      structures based on data from NMR spectroscopy for MdmX in complex with four of
      these compounds and compare them with the MdmX:p53 complex. A p53-derived peptide
      binds with high affinity (Kd value of 150nM) and causes the formation of an
      extensive network of hydrogen bonds within MdmX; this constitutes the induction
      of order within MdmX through ligand binding. In contrast, the compounds bind more
      weakly (Kd values from 600nM to 12muM) and induce an incomplete hydrogen bond
      network within MdmX. Despite relatively weak binding, the four compounds
      activated p53 and induced p21(Cip1) expression in retinoblastoma cell lines that 
      overexpress MdmX, suggesting that they specifically target MdmX and/or Mdm2. Our 
      results document structure-activity relationships for lead-like small molecules
      targeting MdmX and suggest a strategy for their further optimization in the
      future by using NMR spectroscopy to monitor small-molecule-induced protein order 
      as manifested through hydrogen bond formation.

      Replication Initiation and Replication Fork Reloading.

AB  - Replicative helicases play central roles in chromosome duplication and their
      assembly onto DNA is regulated via initiators and helicase loader proteins. The
      Escherichia coli replicative helicase DnaB and the helicase loader DnaC form a
      DnaB6-DnaC6 complex that is required for loading DnaB onto single-stranded DNA.
      Overexpression of dnaC inhibits replication by promoting continual rebinding of
      DnaC to DnaB and consequent prevention of helicase translocation. Here we show
      that overexpression of dnaB also inhibits growth and chromosome duplication. This
      inhibition is countered by co-overexpression of wild-type DnaC but not of a DnaC 
      mutant that cannot interact with DnaB, indicating that a reduction in DnaB6-DnaC6
      concentration is responsible for the phenotypes associated with elevated DnaB
      concentration. Partial defects in the oriC-specific initiator DnaA and in
      PriA-specific initiation away from oriC during replication repair sensitise cells
      to dnaB overexpression. Absence of the accessory replicative helicase Rep,
      resulting in increased replication blockage and thus increased reinitiation away 
      from oriC, also exacerbates DnaB-induced defects. These findings indicate that
      elevated levels of helicase perturb replication initiation not only at origins of
      replication but also during fork repair at other sites on the chromosome. Thus,
      imbalances in levels of the replicative helicase and helicase loader can inhibit 
      replication both via inhibition of DnaB6-DnaC6 complex formation with excess
      DnaB, as shown here, and promotion of formation of DnaB6-DnaC6 complexes with

AB  - Fluorescent probes constitute a valuable toolbox to address a variety of
      biological questions and they have become irreplaceable for imaging methods.
      Commonly, such probes consist of fluorescent proteins or small organic
      fluorophores coupled to biological molecules of interest. Recently, a novel class
      of fluorescence-based probes, fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs), has been
      reported. These binding proteins are based on antibody single-chain variable
      fragments and activate fluorogenic dyes, which only become fluorescent upon
      activation and do not fluoresce when free in solution. Here we present a novel
      class of fluorogen activators, termed FADAs, based on the very robust designed
      ankyrin repeat protein scaffold, which also readily folds in the reducing
      environment of the cytoplasm. The FADA generated in this study was obtained by
      combined selections with ribosome display and yeast surface display. It enhances 
      the fluorescence of malachite green (MG) dyes by a factor of more than 11,000 and
      thus activates MG to a similar extent as FAPs based on single-chain variable
      fragments. As shown by structure determination and in vitro measurements, this
      FADA was evolved to form a homodimer for the activation of MG dyes. Exploiting
      the favorable properties of the designed ankyrin repeat protein scaffold, we
      created a FADA biosensor suitable for imaging of proteins on the cell surface, as
      well as in the cytosol. Moreover, based on the requirement of dimerization for
      strong fluorogen activation, a prototype FADA biosensor for in situ detection of 
      a target protein and protein-protein interactions was developed. Therefore, FADAs
      are versatile fluorescent probes that are easily produced and suitable for
      diverse applications and thus extend the FAP technology.

AB  - Protein engineering and characterisation of non-synonymous single nucleotide
      variants (SNVs) require accurate prediction of protein stability changes
      (DeltaDeltaGu) induced by single amino acid substitutions. Here, we have
      developed a new prediction method called Evolutionary, Amino acid, and Structural
      Encodings with Multiple Models (EASE-MM), which comprises five specialised
      support vector machine (SVM) models and makes the final prediction from a
      consensus of two models selected based on the predicted secondary structure and
      accessible surface area of the mutated residue. The new method is applicable to
      single-domain monomeric proteins and can predict DeltaDeltaGu with a protein
      sequence and mutation as the only inputs. EASE-MM yielded a Pearson correlation
      coefficient of 0.53-0.59 in 10-fold cross-validation and independent testing and 
      was able to outperform other sequence-based methods. When compared to
      structure-based energy functions, EASE-MM achieved a comparable or better
      performance. The application to a large dataset of human germline non-synonymous 
      SNVs showed that the disease-causing variants tend to be associated with larger
      magnitudes of DeltaDeltaGu predicted with EASE-MM. The EASE-MM web-server is
      available at http://sparks-lab.org/server/ease.

AB  - DAHP synthase and chorismate mutase catalyze key steps in the shikimate
      biosynthetic pathway en route to aromatic amino acids. In Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis, chorismate mutase (MtCM; Rv0948c), located at the branch point
      toward phenylalanine and tyrosine, has poor activity on its own. However, it is
      efficiently activated by the first enzyme of the pathway, DAHP synthase (MtDS;
      Rv2178c), through formation of a non-covalent MtCM-MtDS complex. Here, we show
      how MtDS serves as an allosteric platform for feedback regulation of both
      enzymes, using X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering,
      size-exclusion chromatography, and multi-angle light scattering. Crystal
      structures of the fully inhibited MtDS and the allosterically down-regulated
      MtCM-MtDS complex, solved at 2.8 and 2.7A, respectively, reveal how effector
      binding at the internal MtDS subunit interfaces regulates the activity of MtDS
      and MtCM. While binding of all three metabolic end products to MtDS shuts down
      the entire pathway, the binding of phenylalanine jointly with tyrosine releases
      MtCM from the MtCM-MtDS complex, hence suppressing MtCM activation by
      'inter-enzyme allostery'. This elegant regulatory principle, invoking a transient
      allosteric enzyme interaction, seems to be driven by dynamics and is likely a
      general strategy used by nature.

AB  - The eukaryotic DNA polymerase sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen
      or PCNA, is a ring-shaped protein complex that surrounds DNA to act as a sliding 
      platform for increasing processivity of cellular replicases and for coordinating 
      various cellular pathways with DNA replication. A single point mutation,
      Ser228Ile, in the human PCNA gene was recently identified to cause a disease
      whose symptoms resemble those of DNA damage and repair disorders. The mutation
      lies near the binding site for most PCNA-interacting proteins. However, the
      structural consequences of the S228I mutation are unknown. Here, we describe the 
      structure of the disease-causing variant, which reveals a large conformational
      change that dramatically transforms the binding pocket for PCNA client proteins. 
      We show that the mutation markedly alters the binding energetics for some client 
      proteins, while another, p21(CIP1), is only mildly affected. Structures of the
      disease variant bound to peptides derived from two PCNA partner proteins reveal
      that the binding pocket can adjust conformation to accommodate some ligands,
      indicating that the binding site is dynamic and pliable. Our work has
      implications for the plasticity of the binding site in PCNA and reveals how a
      disease mutation selectively alters interactions to a promiscuous binding site
      that is critical for DNA metabolism.

AB  - Primary sequence motifs, with millimolar affinities for binding partners, are
      abundant in disordered protein regions. In multivalent interactions, such weak
      linear motifs can cooperate to recruit binding partners via avidity effects. If
      linear motifs recruit modifying enzymes, optimal placement of weak motifs may
      regulate access to modification sites. Weak motifs may thus exert physiological
      relevance stronger than that suggested by their affinities, but molecular
      mechanisms of their function are still poorly understood. Herein, we use the
      N-terminal disordered region of the Hedgehog transcriptional regulator Gli3
      (Gli3(1-90)) to determine the role of weak motifs encoded in its primary sequence
      for the recruitment of its ubiquitin ligase CRL3(SPOP) and the subsequent effect 
      on ubiquitination efficiency. The substrate adaptor SPOP binds linear motifs
      through its MATH (meprin and TRAF homology) domain and forms higher-order
      oligomers through its oligomerization domains, rendering SPOP multivalent for its
      substrates. Gli3 has multiple weak SPOP binding motifs. We map three such motifs 
      in Gli3(1-90), the weakest of which has a millimolar dissociation constant.
      Multivalency of ligase and substrate for each other facilitates enhanced ligase
      recruitment and stimulates Gli3(1-90) ubiquitination in in vitro ubiquitination
      assays. We speculate that the weak motifs enable processivity through avidity
      effects and by providing steric access to lysine residues that are otherwise not 
      prioritized for polyubiquitination. Weak motifs may generally be employed in
      multivalent systems to act as gatekeepers regulating post-translational
      modification.

TI  - The PRE-Derived NMR Model of the 38.8-kDa Tri-Domain IsdH Protein from
      Staphylococcus aureus Suggests That It Adaptively Recognizes Human Hemoglobin.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a medically important bacterial pathogen that, during
      infections, acquires iron from human hemoglobin (Hb). It uses two closely related
      iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins to capture and extract the
      oxidized form of heme (hemin) from Hb, IsdH and IsdB. Both receptors rapidly
      extract hemin using a conserved tri-domain unit consisting of two NEAT (near iron
      transporter) domains connected by a helical linker domain. To gain insight into
      the mechanism of extraction, we used NMR to investigate the structure and
      dynamics of the 38.8-kDa tri-domain IsdH protein (IsdH(N2N3), A326-D660 with a
      Y642A mutation that prevents hemin binding). The structure was modeled using
      long-range paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) distance restraints,
      dihedral angle, small-angle X-ray scattering, residual dipolar coupling and
      inter-domain NOE nuclear Overhauser effect data. The receptor adopts an extended 
      conformation wherein the linker and N3 domains pack against each other via a
      hydrophobic interface. In contrast, the N2 domain contacts the linker domain via 
      a hydrophilic interface and, based on NMR relaxation data, undergoes inter-domain
      motions enabling it to reorient with respect to the body of the protein. Ensemble
      calculations were used to estimate the range of N2 domain positions compatible
      with the PRE data. A comparison of the Hb-free and Hb-bound forms reveals that Hb
      binding alters the positioning of the N2 domain. We propose that binding occurs
      through a combination of conformational selection and induced-fit mechanisms that
      may promote hemin release from Hb by altering the position of its F helix.

AB  - Genetic circuits, composed of complex networks of interacting molecular machines,
      enable living systems to sense their dynamic environments, perform computation on
      the inputs, and formulate appropriate outputs. By rewiring and expanding these
      circuits with novel parts and modules, synthetic biologists have adapted living
      systems into vibrant substrates for engineering. Diverse paradigms have emerged
      for designing, modeling, constructing, and characterizing such artificial genetic
      systems. In this paper, we first provide an overview of recent advances in the
      development of genetic parts and highlight key engineering approaches. We then
      review the assembly of these parts into synthetic circuits from the perspectives 
      of digital and analog logic, systems biology, and metabolic engineering, three
      areas of particular theoretical and practical interest. Finally, we discuss
      notable challenges that the field of synthetic biology still faces in achieving
      reliable and predictable forward-engineering of artificial biological circuits.

AB  - Designing RNAs that form specific secondary structures is enabling better
      understanding and control of living systems through RNA-guided silencing, genome 
      editing and protein organization. Little is known, however, about which RNA
      secondary structures might be tractable for downstream sequence design,
      increasing the time and expense of design efforts due to inefficient secondary
      structure choices. Here, we present insights into specific structural features
      that increase the difficulty of finding sequences that fold into a target RNA
      secondary structure, summarizing the design efforts of tens of thousands of human
      participants and three automated algorithms (RNAInverse, INFO-RNA and RNA-SSD) in
      the Eterna massive open laboratory. Subsequent tests through three independent
      RNA design algorithms (NUPACK, DSS-Opt and MODENA) confirmed the hypothesized
      importance of several features in determining design difficulty, including
      sequence length, mean stem length, symmetry and specific difficult-to-design
      motifs such as zigzags. Based on these results, we have compiled an Eterna100
      benchmark of 100 secondary structure design challenges that span a large range in
      design difficulty to help test future efforts. Our in silico results suggest new 
      routes for improving computational RNA design methods and for extending these
      insights to assess "designability" of single RNA structures, as well as of
      switches for in vitro and in vivo applications.

AB  - RNA virus genomes are reservoirs of a wide diversity of RNA structural elements. 
      In particular, specific regions of the viral genome have evolved to adopt
      specialized three-dimensional (3D) structures, which can act in concert with host
      factors and/or viral proteins to recruit the translation machinery on viral RNA
      using a mechanism that is independent on the 5' end. This strategy relies on
      cis-acting RNA sequences designated as internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
      elements. IRES elements that are found in the genome of different groups of RNA
      viruses perform the same function despite differing in primary sequence and
      secondary RNA structure and host factor requirement to recruit the translation
      machinery internally. Evolutionarily conserved motifs tend to preserve sequences 
      in each group of RNA viruses impacting on RNA structure and RNA-protein
      interactions important for IRES function. However, due to the lack of sequence
      homology among genetically distant IRES elements, accurate modeling of 3D IRES
      structure is currently a challenging task. In addition, as a universal RNA motif 
      unique to IRES elements has not been found, a better understanding of viral IRES 
      structural motifs could greatly assist in the detection of IRES-like motifs
      hidden in genome sequences. The focus of this review is to describe recent
      advances in modeling viral IRES tertiary structural motifs and also novel
      approaches to detect sequences potentially folding as IRES-like motifs.

AB  - In order to explore the possibility of adding new functions to preexisting genes,
      we considered a framework of riboregulation. We created a new riboregulator
      consisting of the reverse complement of a known riboregulator. Using
      computational design, we engineered a cis-repressing 5' untranslated region that 
      can be activated by this new riboregulator. As a result, both RNAs can
      orthogonally trans-activate translation of their cognate, independent targets.
      The two riboregulators can also repress each other by antisense interaction,
      although not symmetrically. Our work highlights that antisense small RNAs can
      work as regulatory agents beyond the antisense paradigm and that, hence, they
      could be interfaced with other circuits used in synthetic biology.

AB  - The essential aspects of the ribosome's mechanism can be extracted from
      coarse-grained simulations, including the ratchet motion, the movement together
      of critical bases at the decoding center, and movements of the peptide tunnel
      lining that assist in the expulsion of the synthesized peptide. Because of its
      large size, coarse graining helps to simplify and to aid in the understanding of 
      its mechanism. Results presented here utilize coarse-grained elastic network
      modeling to extract the dynamics, and both RNAs and proteins are coarse grained. 
      We review our previous results, showing the well-known ratchet motions and the
      motions in the peptide tunnel and in the mRNA tunnel. The motions of the lining
      of the peptide tunnel appear to assist in the expulsion of the growing peptide
      chain, and clamps at the ends of the mRNA tunnel with three proteins ensure that 
      the mRNA is held tightly during decoding and essential for the helicase activity 
      at the entrance. The entry clamp may also assist in base recognition to ensure
      proper selection of the incoming tRNA. The overall precision of the ribosome
      machine-like motions is remarkable.

AB  - NMR and SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering)/WAXS (wide-angle X-ray scattering)
      are highly complementary approaches for the analysis of RNA structure in
      solution. Here we describe an efficient NMR-SAXS/WAXS approach for structural
      investigation of multi-helical RNAs. We illustrate this approach by determining
      the overall fold of a 92-nt 3-helix junction from the U4/U6 di-snRNA. The U4/U6
      di-snRNA is conserved in eukaryotes and is part of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a
      large ribonucleoprotein complex that comprises a major subunit of the assembled
      spliceosome. Helical orientations can be determined by X-ray scattering data
      alone, but the addition of NMR RDC (residual dipolar coupling) restraints
      improves the structure models. RDCs were measured in two different external
      alignment media and also by magnetic susceptibility anisotropy. The resulting
      alignment tensors are collinear, which is a previously noted problem for nucleic 
      acids. Including WAXS data in the calculations produces models with significantly
      better fits to the scattering data. In solution, the U4/U6 di-snRNA forms a
      3-helix junction with a planar Y-shaped structure and has no detectable tertiary 
      interactions. Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer data support the 
      observed topology. A comparison with the recently determined cryo-electron
      microscopy structure of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP illustrates how proteins scaffold 
      the RNA and dramatically alter the geometry of the U4/U6 3-helix junction.

AB  - We assessed whether in vivo mRNA structural reactivity and the structure of the
      encoded protein are related. This is the first investigation of such a
      relationship that utilizes information on RNA structure obtained in living cells.
      Based on our recent genome-wide Structure-seq analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana,
      we report that, as a meta property, regions of individual mRNAs that code for
      protein domains generally have higher reactivity to DMS (dimethyl sulfate), a
      chemical that covalently modifies accessible As and Cs, than regions that encode 
      protein domain junctions. This relationship is prominent for proteins annotated
      for catalytic activity and reversed in proteins annotated for binding and
      transcription regulatory activity. Upon analyzing intrinsically disordered
      proteins, we found a similar pattern for disordered regions as compared to
      ordered regions: regions of individual mRNAs that code for ordered regions have
      significantly higher DMS reactivity than regions that code for intrinsically
      disordered regions. Based on these effects, we hypothesize that the decreased DMS
      reactivity of RNA regions that encode protein domain junctions or intrinsically
      disordered regions may reflect increased RNA structure that may slow translation,
      allowing time for the nascent protein domain or ordered region of the protein to 
      fold, thereby reducing protein misfolding. In addition, a drop in DMS reactivity 
      was observed on portions of mRNA sequences that correspond to the C-termini of
      protein domains, suggesting ribosome protection at these mRNA regions. Structural
      relationships between mRNAs and their encoded proteins may have evolved to allow 
      efficient and accurate protein folding.

AB  - Recent breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing technologies have led to the
      discovery of several classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). It is now apparent that
      RNA molecules are not only just carriers of genetic information but also key
      players in many cellular processes. While there has been a rapid increase in the 
      number of ncRNA sequences deposited in various databases over the past decade,
      the biological functions of these ncRNAs are largely not well understood. Similar
      to proteins, RNA molecules carry out a function by forming specific
      three-dimensional structures. Understanding the function of a particular RNA
      therefore requires a detailed knowledge of its structure. However, determining
      experimental structures of RNA is extremely challenging. In fact, RNA-only
      structures represent just 1% of the total structures deposited in the PDB. Thus, 
      computational methods that predict three-dimensional RNA structures are in high
      demand. Computational models can provide valuable insights into
      structure-function relationships in ncRNAs and can aid in the development of
      functional hypotheses and experimental designs. In recent years, a set of diverse
      RNA structure prediction tools have become available, which differ in
      computational time, input data and accuracy. This review discusses the recent
      progress and challenges in RNA structure prediction methods.

AB  - Genome engineering benefits from the availability of DNA modifying enzymes that
      have different target specificities and have optimized performance in different
      cell types. This variety of site-specific enzymes can be used to develop complex 
      genome engineering applications at multiple loci. Although eight yeast
      site-specific tyrosine recombinases are known, only Flp is actively used in
      genome engineering. To expand the pool of the yeast site-specific tyrosine
      recombinases capable of mediating genome manipulations in mammalian cells, we
      engineered and analyzed variants of two tyrosine recombinases: R and TD. The
      activity of the evolved variants, unlike the activity of the native R and TD
      recombinases, is suitable for genome engineering in Escherichia coli and
      mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, we found that R recombinase benefits from the
      shortening of its C-terminus. We also found that the activity of wild-type R can 
      be modulated by its non-consensus "head" sequence but this modulation became not 
      apparent in the evolved R variants. The engineered recombinase variants were
      found to be active in all recombination reactions tested: excision, integration, 
      and dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. The analysis of the latter
      reaction catalyzed by the R/TD recombinase pair shows that the condition
      supporting the most efficient replacement reaction favors efficient TD-mediated
      integration reaction while favoring efficient R-mediated integration and deletion
      reactions.

AB  - Significant advances have been made in synthetic biology to program information
      processing capabilities in cells. While these designs can function predictably in
      controlled laboratory environments, the reliability of these devices in complex, 
      temporally changing environments has not yet been characterized. As human society
      faces global challenges in agriculture, human health and energy, synthetic
      biology should develop predictive design principles for biological systems
      operating in complex environments. Natural biological systems have evolved
      mechanisms to overcome innumerable and diverse environmental challenges.
      Evolutionary design rules should be extracted and adapted to engineer stable and 
      predictable ecological function. We highlight examples of natural biological
      responses spanning the cellular, population and microbial community levels that
      show promise in synthetic biology contexts. We argue that synthetic circuits
      embedded in host organisms or designed ecologies informed by suitable measurement
      of biotic and abiotic environmental parameters could be used as engineering
      substrates to achieve target functions in complex environments. Successful
      implementation of these methods will broaden the context in which synthetic
      biological systems can be applied to solve important problems.

AB  - As the indispensable role of natural microbial communities in many aspects of
      life on Earth is uncovered, the bottom-up engineering of synthetic microbial
      consortia with novel functions is becoming an attractive alternative to
      engineering single-species systems. Here, we summarize recent work on synthetic
      microbial communities with a particular emphasis on open challenges and
      opportunities in environmental sustainability and human health. We next provide a
      critical overview of mathematical approaches, ranging from phenomenological to
      mechanistic, to decipher the principles that govern the function, dynamics and
      evolution of microbial ecosystems. Finally, we present our outlook on key aspects
      of microbial ecosystems and synthetic ecology that require further developments, 
      including the need for more efficient computational algorithms, a better
      integration of empirical methods and model-driven analysis, the importance of
      improving gene function annotation, and the value of a standardized library of
      well-characterized organisms to be used as building blocks of synthetic
      communities.

AB  - Kink turns (k-turns) are widespread structural elements that introduce an axial
      bend into duplex RNA with an included angle of 50 degrees . These mediate key
      tertiary interactions and bind specific proteins including members of the L7Ae
      family. The standard k-turn comprises a three-nucleotide bulge followed by G.A
      and A.G pairs. The RNA kinks by an association of the two minor grooves,
      stabilized by the formation of a number of key cross-strand hydrogen bonds mostly
      involving the adenine bases of the G.A and A.G pairs. The k-turns may be divided 
      into two conformational classes, depending on the receptor for one of these
      hydrogen bonds. k-turns become folded by one of three different processes. Some, 
      but not all, k-turns become folded in the presence of metal ions. Whether or not 
      a given k-turn is folded under these conditions is determined by its sequence. We
      present a set of rules for the prediction of folding properties and the structure
      adopted on local sequence.

AB  - Genome engineering with programmable nucleases depends on cellular responses to a
      targeted double-strand break (DSB). The first truly targetable reagents were the 
      zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) showing that arbitrary DNA sequences could be
      addressed for cleavage by protein engineering, ushering in the breakthrough in
      genome manipulation. ZFNs resulted from basic research on zinc finger proteins
      and the FokI restriction enzyme (which revealed a bipartite structure with a
      separable DNA-binding domain and a non-specific cleavage domain). Studies on the 
      mechanism of cleavage by 3-finger ZFNs established that the preferred substrates 
      were paired binding sites, which doubled the size of the target sequence
      recognition from 9 to 18bp, long enough to specify a unique genomic locus in
      plant and mammalian cells. Soon afterwards, a ZFN-induced DSB was shown to
      stimulate homologous recombination in cells. Transcription activator-like
      effector nucleases (TALENs) that are based on bacterial TALEs fused to the FokI
      cleavage domain expanded this capability. The fact that ZFNs and TALENs have been
      used for genome modification of more than 40 different organisms and cell types
      attests to the success of protein engineering. The most recent technology
      platform for delivering a targeted DSB to cellular genomes is that of the
      RNA-guided nucleases, which are based on the naturally occurring Type II
      prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system. Unlike ZFNs and TALENs that use protein motifs
      for DNA sequence recognition, CRISPR-Cas9 depends on RNA-DNA recognition. The
      advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system-the ease of RNA design for new targets and
      the dependence on a single, constant Cas9 protein-have led to its wide adoption
      by research laboratories around the world. These technology platforms have
      equipped scientists with an unprecedented ability to modify cells and organisms
      almost at will, with wide-ranging implications across biology and medicine.
      However, these nucleases have also been shown to cut at off-target sites with
      mutagenic consequences. Therefore, issues such as efficacy, specificity and
      delivery are likely to drive selection of reagents for particular purposes. Human
      therapeutic applications of these technologies will ultimately depend on risk
      versus benefit analysis and informed consent.

AB  - An analysis and expansion of our resource for classifying, predicting, and
      designing RNA structures, RAG (RNA-As-Graphs), is presented, with the goal of
      understanding features of RNA-like and non-RNA-like motifs and exploiting this
      information for RNA design. RAG was first reported in 2004 for cataloging RNA
      secondary structure motifs using graph representations. In 2011, the RAG resource
      was updated with the increased availability of RNA structures and was improved by
      utilities for analyzing RNA structures, including substructuring and search
      tools. We also classified RNA structures as graphs up to 10 vertices (~200
      nucleotides) into three classes: existing, RNA-like, and non-RNA-like using
      clustering approaches. Here, we focus on the tree graphs and evaluate the newly
      founded RNAs since 2011, which also support our refined predictions of RNA-like
      motifs. We expand the RAG resource for large tree graphs up to 13 vertices (~260 
      nucleotides), thereby cataloging more than 10 times as many secondary structures.
      We apply clustering algorithms based on features of RNA secondary structures
      translated from known tertiary structures to suggest which hypothetical large RNA
      motifs can be considered "RNA-like". The results by the PAM (Partitioning Around 
      Medoids) approach, in particular, reveal good accuracy, with small error for the 
      largest cases. The RAG update here up to 13 vertices offers a useful graph-based 
      tool for exploring RNA motifs and suggesting large RNA motifs for design.

AB  - Synthetic biologists aim to construct novel genetic circuits with useful
      applications through rational design and forward engineering. Given the
      complexity of signal processing that occurs in natural biological systems,
      engineered microbes have the potential to perform a wide range of desirable tasks
      that require sophisticated computation and control. Realising this goal will
      require accurate predictive design of complex synthetic gene circuits and
      accompanying large sets of quality modular and orthogonal genetic parts. Here we 
      present a current overview of the versatile components and tools available for
      engineering gene circuits in microbes, including recently developed RNA-based
      tools that possess large dynamic ranges and can be easily programmed. We
      introduce design principles that enable robust and scalable circuit performance
      such as insulating a gene circuit against unwanted interactions with its context,
      and we describe efficient strategies for rapidly identifying and correcting
      causes of failure and fine-tuning circuit characteristics.

AB  - Compartmentalization is one of the defining features of life. Through
      intracellular spatial control, cells are able to organize and regulate their
      metabolism. One of the most broadly used organizational principles in nature is
      encapsulation. Cellular processes can be encapsulated within either
      membrane-bound organelles or proteinaceous compartments that create distinct
      microenvironments optimized for a given task. Further challenges addressed
      through intracellular compartmentalization are toxic or volatile pathway
      intermediates, slow turnover rates and competing side reactions. This review
      highlights a selection of naturally occurring membrane- and protein-based
      encapsulation systems in microbes and their recent applications and emerging
      opportunities in synthetic biology. We focus on examples that use engineered
      cellular organization to control metabolic pathway flux for the production of
      useful compounds and materials.

AB  - Withstanding 3.5 billion years of genetic drift, the canonical genetic code
      remains such a fundamental foundation for the complexity of life that it is
      highly conserved across all three phylogenetic domains. Genome engineering
      technologies are now making it possible to rationally change the genetic code,
      offering resistance to viruses, genetic isolation from horizontal gene transfer, 
      and prevention of environmental escape by genetically modified organisms. We
      discuss the biochemical, genetic, and technological challenges that must be
      overcome in order to engineer the genetic code.

TI  - N(6)-Methyladenosine Modification in a Long Noncoding RNA Hairpin Predisposes Its
      Conformation to Protein Binding.

AB  - N(6)-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is a reversible and abundant internal modification
      of messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) with roles in RNA
      processing, transport, and stability. Although m(6)A does not preclude
      Watson-Crick base pairing, the N(6)-methyl group alters the stability of RNA
      secondary structure. Since changes in RNA structure can affect diverse cellular
      processes, the influence of m(6)A on mRNA and lncRNA structure has the potential 
      to be an important mechanism for m(6)A function in the cell. Indeed, an m(6)A
      site in the lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1
      (MALAT1) was recently shown to induce a local change in structure that increases 
      the accessibility of a U5-tract for recognition and binding by heterogeneous
      nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC). This m(6)A-dependent regulation of protein 
      binding through a change in RNA structure, termed "m(6)A-switch", affects
      transcriptome-wide mRNA abundance and alternative splicing. To further
      characterize this first example of an m(6)A-switch in a cellular RNA, we used
      nuclear magnetic resonance and Forster resonance energy transfer to demonstrate
      the effect of m(6)A on a 32-nucleotide RNA hairpin derived from the m(6)A-switch 
      in MALAT1. The observed imino proton nuclear magnetic resonance resonances and
      Forster resonance energy transfer efficiencies suggest that m(6)A selectively
      destabilizes the portion of the hairpin stem where the U5-tract is located,
      increasing the solvent accessibility of the neighboring bases while maintaining
      the overall hairpin structure. The m(6)A-modified hairpin has a predisposed
      conformation that resembles the hairpin conformation in the RNA-HNRNPC complex
      more closely than the unmodified hairpin. The m(6)A-induced structural changes in
      the MALAT1 hairpin can serve as a model for a large family of m(6)A-switches that
      mediate the influence of m(6)A on cellular processes.

AB  - Higher multicellular organisms have evolved sophisticated intracellular and
      intercellular biological networks that enable cell growth and survival to fulfill
      an organism's needs. Although such networks allow the assembly of complex tissues
      and even provide healing and protective capabilities, malfunctioning cells can
      have severe consequences for an organism's survival. In humans, such events can
      result in severe disorders and diseases, including metabolic and immunological
      disorders, as well as cancer. Dominating the therapeutic frontier for these
      potentially lethal disorders, cell and gene therapies aim to relieve or eliminate
      patient suffering by restoring the function of damaged, diseased, and aging cells
      and tissues via the introduction of healthy cells or alternative genes. However, 
      despite recent success, these efforts have yet to achieve sufficient therapeutic 
      effects, and further work is needed to ensure the safe and precise control of
      transgene expression and cellular processes. In this review, we describe the
      biological tools and devices that are at the forefront of synthetic biology and
      discuss their potential to advance the specificity, efficiency, and safety of the
      current generation of cell and gene therapies, including how they can be used to 
      confer curative effects that far surpass those of conventional therapeutics. We
      also highlight the current therapeutic delivery tools and the current limitations
      that hamper their use in human applications.

TI  - CryptoSite: Expanding the Druggable Proteome by Characterization and Prediction
      of Cryptic Binding Sites.

AB  - Many proteins have small-molecule binding pockets that are not easily detectable 
      in the ligand-free structures. These cryptic sites require a conformational
      change to become apparent; a cryptic site can therefore be defined as a site that
      forms a pocket in a holo structure, but not in the apo structure. Because many
      proteins appear to lack druggable pockets, understanding and accurately
      identifying cryptic sites could expand the set of drug targets. Previously,
      cryptic sites were identified experimentally by fragment-based ligand discovery
      and computationally by long molecular dynamics simulations and fragment docking. 
      Here, we begin by constructing a set of structurally defined apo-holo pairs with 
      cryptic sites. Next, we comprehensively characterize the cryptic sites in terms
      of their sequence, structure, and dynamics attributes. We find that cryptic sites
      tend to be as conserved in evolution as traditional binding pockets but are less 
      hydrophobic and more flexible. Relying on this characterization, we use machine
      learning to predict cryptic sites with relatively high accuracy (for our
      benchmark, the true positive and false positive rates are 73% and 29%,
      respectively). We then predict cryptic sites in the entire structurally
      characterized human proteome (11,201 structures, covering 23% of all residues in 
      the proteome). CryptoSite increases the size of the potentially "druggable" human
      proteome from ~40% to ~78% of disease-associated proteins. Finally, to
      demonstrate the utility of our approach in practice, we experimentally validate a
      cryptic site in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B using a covalent ligand and NMR
      spectroscopy. The CryptoSite Web server is available at
      http://salilab.org/cryptosite.

AB  - BlastKOALA and GhostKOALA are automatic annotation servers for genome and
      metagenome sequences, which perform KO (KEGG Orthology) assignments to
      characterize individual gene functions and reconstruct KEGG pathways, BRITE
      hierarchies and KEGG modules to infer high-level functions of the organism or the
      ecosystem. Both servers are made freely available at the KEGG Web site
      (http://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/). In BlastKOALA, the KO assignment is performed
      by a modified version of the internally used KOALA algorithm after the BLAST
      search against a non-redundant dataset of pangenome sequences at the species,
      genus or family level, which is generated from the KEGG GENES database by
      retaining the KO content of each taxonomic category. In GhostKOALA, which
      utilizes more rapid GHOSTX for database search and is suitable for metagenome
      annotation, the pangenome dataset is supplemented with Cd-hit clusters including 
      those for viral genes. The result files may be downloaded and manipulated for
      further KEGG Mapper analysis, such as comparative pathway analysis using multiple
      BlastKOALA results.

AB  - The identification of structurally similar proteins can provide a range of
      biological insights, and accordingly, the alignment of a query protein to a
      database of experimentally determined protein structures is a technique commonly 
      used in the fields of structural and evolutionary biology. The PhyreStorm Web
      server has been designed to provide comprehensive, up-to-date and rapid
      structural comparisons against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) combined with a rich
      and intuitive user interface. It is intended that this facility will enable
      biologists inexpert in bioinformatics access to a powerful tool for exploring
      protein structure relationships beyond what can be achieved by sequence analysis 
      alone. By partitioning the PDB into similar structures, PhyreStorm is able to
      quickly discard the majority of structures that cannot possibly align well to a
      query protein, reducing the number of alignments required by an order of
      magnitude. PhyreStorm is capable of finding 93+/-2% of all highly similar
      (TM-score>0.7) structures in the PDB for each query structure, usually in less
      than 60s. PhyreStorm is available at http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyrestorm/.

TI  - ResQ: An Approach to Unified Estimation of B-Factor and Residue-Specific Error in
      Protein Structure Prediction.

AB  - Computer-based structure prediction becomes a major tool to provide large-scale
      structure models for annotating biological function of proteins. Information of
      residue-level accuracy and thermal mobility (or B-factor), which is critical to
      decide how biologists utilize the predicted models, is however missed in most
      structure prediction pipelines. We developed ResQ for unified residue-level model
      quality and B-factor estimations by combining local structure assembly variations
      with sequence-based and structure-based profiling. ResQ was tested on 635
      non-redundant proteins with structure models generated by I-TASSER, where the
      average difference between estimated and observed distance errors is 1.4A for the
      confidently modeled proteins. ResQ was further tested on structure decoys from
      CASP9-11 experiments, where the error of local structure quality prediction is
      consistently lower than or comparable to other state-of-the-art predictors.
      Finally, ResQ B-factor profile was used to assist molecular replacement, which
      resulted in successful solutions on several proteins that could not be solved
      from constant B-factor settings.

AB  - Exosomes are membranous vesicles that are released by a variety of cells into the
      extracellular microenvironment and are implicated in intercellular communication.
      As exosomes contain RNA, proteins and lipids, there is a significant interest in 
      characterizing the molecular cargo of exosomes. Here, we describe ExoCarta
      (http://www.exocarta.org), a manually curated Web-based compendium of exosomal
      proteins, RNAs and lipids. Since its inception, the database has been highly
      accessed (>54,000 visitors from 135 countries). The current version of ExoCarta
      hosts 41,860 proteins, >7540 RNA and 1116 lipid molecules from more than 286
      exosomal studies annotated with International Society for Extracellular Vesicles 
      minimal experimental requirements for definition of extracellular vesicles.
      Besides, ExoCarta features dynamic protein-protein interaction networks and
      biological pathways of exosomal proteins. Users can download most often
      identified exosomal proteins based on the number of studies. The downloaded files
      can further be imported directly into FunRich (http://www.funrich.org) tool for
      additional functional enrichment and interaction network analysis.

AB  - Protein families evolve functional variation by accumulating point mutations at
      functionally important amino acid positions. Homologs in the LacI/GalR family of 
      transcription regulators have evolved to bind diverse DNA sequences and
      allosteric regulatory molecules. In addition to playing key roles in bacterial
      metabolism, these proteins have been widely used as a model family for
      benchmarking structural and functional prediction algorithms. We have collected
      manually curated sequence alignments for >3000 sequences, in vivo phenotypic and 
      biochemical data for >5750 LacI/GalR mutational variants, and noncovalent residue
      contact networks for 65 LacI/GalR homolog structures. Using this rich data
      resource, we compared the noncovalent residue contact networks of the LacI/GalR
      subfamilies to design and experimentally validate an allosteric mutant of a
      synthetic LacI/GalR repressor for use in biotechnology. The AlloRep database
      (freely available at www.AlloRep.org) is a key resource for future evolutionary
      studies of LacI/GalR homologs and for benchmarking computational predictions of
      functional change.

AB  - The prediction of the quaternary structure of biomolecular macromolecules is of
      paramount importance for fundamental understanding of cellular processes and drug
      design. In the era of integrative structural biology, one way of increasing the
      accuracy of modeling methods used to predict the structure of biomolecular
      complexes is to include as much experimental or predictive information as
      possible in the process. This has been at the core of our information-driven
      docking approach HADDOCK. We present here the updated version 2.2 of the HADDOCK 
      portal, which offers new features such as support for mixed molecule types,
      additional experimental restraints and improved protocols, all of this in a
      user-friendly interface. With well over 6000 registered users and 108,000 jobs
      served, an increasing fraction of which on grid resources, we hope that this
      timely upgrade will help the community to solve important biological questions
      and further advance the field. The HADDOCK2.2 Web server is freely accessible to 
      non-profit users at http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2.

AB  - The structurally defined ubiquitin-like homology fold (UBL) can engage in several
      unique protein-protein interactions and many of these complexes have been
      characterized with high-resolution techniques. Using Rosetta's structural
      classification tools, we have created the Ubiquitin Structural Relational
      Database (UbSRD), an SQL database of features for all 509 UBL-containing
      structures in the PDB, allowing users to browse these structures by
      protein-protein interaction and providing a platform for quantitative analysis of
      structural features. We used UbSRD to define the recognition features of
      ubiquitin (UBQ) and SUMO observed in the PDB and the orientation of the UBQ tail 
      while interacting with certain types of proteins. While some of the interaction
      surfaces on UBQ and SUMO overlap, each molecule has distinct features that aid in
      molecular discrimination. Additionally, we find that the UBQ tail is malleable
      and can adopt a variety of conformations upon binding. UbSRD is accessible as an 
      online resource at rosettadesign.med.unc.edu/ubsrd.

      Recognition of tRNA(Asn).

AB  - Synthesis of asparaginyl-tRNA (Asn-tRNA(Asn)) in bacteria can be formed either by
      directly ligating Asn to tRNA(Asn) using an asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS)
      or by synthesizing Asn on the tRNA. In the latter two-step indirect pathway, a
      non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-AspRS) attaches Asp to tRNA(Asn) 
      and the amidotransferase GatCAB transamidates the Asp to Asn on the tRNA. GatCAB 
      can be similarly used for Gln-tRNA(Gln) formation. Most bacteria are predicted to
      use only one route for Asn-tRNA(Asn) formation. Given that Bacillus halodurans
      and Bacillus subtilis encode AsnRS for Asn-tRNA(Asn) formation and Asn
      synthetases to synthesize Asn and GatCAB for Gln-tRNA(Gln) synthesis, their AspRS
      enzymes were thought to be specific for tRNA(Asp). However, we demonstrate that
      the AspRSs are non-discriminating and can be used with GatCAB to synthesize Asn. 
      The results explain why B. subtilis with its Asn synthetase genes knocked out is 
      still an Asn prototroph. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that this may be
      common among Firmicutes and 30% of all bacteria. In addition, the phylogeny
      revealed that discrimination toward tRNA(Asp) by AspRS has evolved independently 
      multiple times. The retention of the indirect pathway in B. subtilis and B.
      halodurans likely reflects the ancient link between Asn biosynthesis and its use 
      in translation that enabled Asn to be added to the genetic code.

AB  - Bacteria have developed a variety of mechanisms for surviving harsh environmental
      conditions, nutrient stress and overpopulation. Paenibacillus dendritiformis
      produces a lethal protein (Slf) that is able to induce cell death in neighbouring
      colonies and a phenotypic switch in more distant ones. Slf is derived from the
      secreted precursor protein, DfsB, after proteolytic processing. Here, we present 
      new crystal structures of DfsB homologues from a variety of bacterial species and
      a surprising version present in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Adopting a
      four-helix bundle decorated with a further three short helices within intervening
      loops, DfsB belongs to a non-enzymatic class of the DinB fold. The structure
      suggests that the biologically active Slf fragment may possess a C-terminal helix
      rich in basic and aromatic residues that suggest a functional mechanism akin to
      that for cationic antimicrobial peptides.

AB  - Cerberus is a key regulator of vertebrate embryogenesis. Its biological function 
      has been studied extensively in frog and mouse embryos. Its ability to bind and
      antagonize the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family ligand Nodal is 
      well established. Strikingly, the molecular function of Cerberus remains poorly
      understood. The underlying reason is that Cerberus is a complex, multifunctional 
      protein: It binds and inhibits multiple TGF-beta family ligands, it may bind and 
      inhibit some Wnt family members, and two different forms with distinct activities
      have been described. In addition, sequence homology between frog and mammalian
      Cerberus is low, suggesting that previous studies, which analyzed frog Cerberus
      function, may not accurately describe the function of mammalian Cerberus. We
      therefore undertook to determine the molecular activities of human Cerberus in
      TGF-beta family signaling. Using purified proteins, surface plasmon resonance,
      and reporter gene assays, we discovered that human Cerberus bound and inhibited
      the TGF-beta family ligands Activin B, BMP-6, and BMP-7, but not the frog
      Cerberus ligand BMP-2. Notably, full-length Cerberus successfully blocked ligand 
      binding to type II receptors, but the short form was less effective. In addition,
      full-length Cerberus suppressed breast cancer cell migration but the short form
      did not. Thus, our findings expand the roles of Cerberus as TGF-beta family
      signaling inhibitor, provide a molecular rationale for the function of the
      N-terminal region, and support the idea that Cerberus could have regulatory
      activities beyond direct inhibition of TGF-beta family signaling.

AB  - Holliday junctions (HJs) constitute important intermediate structures for many
      cell functions such as DNA recombination and DNA repair. They derive from a 10-nt
      degenerate sequence, with a 3-nt core motif. In this study, we explored the human
      genome whether the HJ degenerate sequence associates with transposable elements
      (TEs) and mainly with those of the active and inactive ALU, LINE, SVA and HERV
      families. We identified six different forms of the HJ sequence motif, and we
      located the genomic coordinates of sequences containing both HJs and TEs. From
      2982 total HJs, a significant number of 1319 TE-associated HJs were found, with a
      median distribution of 1 per 2.4 Mb. The HJs with higher GC content were observed
      more frequently at the genome. A high percentage of HJs were associated with all 
      main TE families, with specificity for particular active or inactive elements:
      DNA elements and the retroelements ALUs, LINEs and HERVs up to 41.94%, 72.72%,
      42.94% and 84.5%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HJs occur in 
      both active and inactive TEs. Furthermore, the TE-associated HJs were almost
      exclusively found within a distance less than 1 Mb from human genes, while only
      23 were not associated with any genes. This is the first report associating human
      HJs, with mobile elements. Our data pinpoint that particular HJ forms show
      preference for specific active retrotransposon families of ALUs and LINEs,
      suggesting that retrotransposon-incorporated HJs may relocate or replicate in the
      genome through retrotransposition, contributing to recombination, genome
      plasticity and DNA repair.

TI  - Comparison of the aggregation of homologous beta2-microglobulin variants reveals 
      protein solubility as a key determinant of amyloid formation.

AB  - The mouse and human beta2-microglobulin protein orthologs are 70% identical in
      sequence and share 88% sequence similarity. These proteins are predicted by
      various algorithms to have similar aggregation and amyloid propensities. However,
      whilst human beta2m (hbeta2m) forms amyloid-like fibrils in denaturing conditions
      (e.g. pH2.5) in the absence of NaCl, mouse beta2m (mbeta2m) requires the addition
      of 0.3M NaCl to cause fibrillation. Here, the factors which give rise to this
      difference in amyloid propensity are investigated. We utilise structural and
      mutational analyses, fibril growth kinetics and solubility measurements under a
      range of pH and salt conditions, to determine why these two proteins have
      different amyloid propensities. The results show that, although other factors
      influence the fibril growth kinetics, a striking difference in the solubility of 
      the proteins is a key determinant of the different amyloidogenicity of hbeta2m
      and mbeta2m. The relationship between protein solubility and lag time of amyloid 
      formation is not captured by current aggregation or amyloid prediction
      algorithms, indicating a need to better understand the role of solubility on the 
      lag time of amyloid formation. The results demonstrate the key contribution of
      protein solubility in determining amyloid propensity and lag time of amyloid
      formation, highlighting how small differences in protein sequence can have
      dramatic effects on amyloid formation.

TI  - Domain Structure of the Redbeta Single-Strand Annealing Protein: the C-terminal
      Domain is Required for Fine-Tuning DNA-binding Properties, Interaction with the
      Exonuclease Partner, and Recombination in vivo.

AB  - Redbeta is a component of the Red recombination system of bacteriophage lambda
      that promotes a single strand annealing (SSA) reaction to generate end-to-end
      concatemers of the phage genome for packaging. Redbeta interacts with lambda
      exonuclease (lambdaexo), the other component of the Red system, to form a
      "synaptosome" complex that somehow integrates the end resection and annealing
      steps of the reaction. Previous work using limited proteolysis and chemical
      modification revealed that Redbeta consists of an N-terminal DNA binding domain, 
      residues 1-177, and a flexible C-terminal "tail", residues 178-261. Here, we
      quantitatively compare the binding of the full-length protein (Redbeta(FL)) and
      the N-terminal domain (Redbeta(177)) to different lengths of ssDNA substrate and 
      annealed duplex product. We find that in general, Redbeta(FL) binds more tightly 
      to annealed duplex product than to ssDNA substrate, while Redbeta(177) binds more
      tightly to ssDNA. In addition, the C-terminal region of Redbeta corresponding to 
      residues 182-261 was purified and found to fold into an alpha-helical domain that
      is required for the interaction with lambdaexo to form the synaptosome complex.
      Deletion analysis of Redbeta revealed that removal of just eleven residues from
      the C-terminus disrupts the interaction with lambdaexo as well as ssDNA and dsDNA
      recombination in vivo. By contrast, the determinants for self-oligomerization of 
      Redbeta appear to reside solely within the N-terminal domain. The subtle but
      significant differences in the relative binding of Redbeta(FL) and Redbeta(177)
      to ssDNA substrate and annealed duplex product may be important for Redbeta to
      function as a SSA protein in vivo.

AB  - Context-independent anti-hypusine antibodies that bind to the post-translational 
      modification (PTM), hypusine, with minimal dependence on flanking amino acid
      sequences, were identified. The antibodies bind to both hypusine and
      deoxyhypusine or selectively to hypusine but not to deoxyhypusine. Phage display 
      was used to further enhance the affinity of the antibodies. Affinity maturation
      of these anti-hypusine antibodies improved their performance in affinity capture 
      of the only currently known hypusinated protein, eukaryotic translation
      initiation factor 5A. These anti-hypusine antibodies may have utility in the
      identification of novel hypusinated proteins. Crystal structures of the
      corresponding Fab fragments were determined in complex with hypusine- or
      deoxyhypusine-containing peptides. The hypusine or deoxyhypusine moiety was found
      to reside in a deep pocket formed between VH and VL domains of the Fab fragments.
      Interaction between the antibodies and hypusine includes an extensive hydrogen
      bond network. These are, to our knowledge, the first reported structures of
      context-independent anti-PTM antibodies in complex with the corresponding PTM.

AB  - STAT3 is a member of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)
      transcription activators. Aberration in STAT3 activity due to constitutive
      activation or mutations leads to diseases such as cancer and hyper-immunoglobulin
      E syndrome (HIES). STAT3 contains several structured domains including the Src
      homology 2 domain (SH2), linker domain (LD), DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the
      coiled-coil domain. Here we report the discovery of inter-domain allosteric
      communications in STAT3 from studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
      other methods. We found that pTyr-peptide interactions with SH2 cause structural 
      and dynamics changes in LD and DBD. The inter-domain allosteric effect is likely 
      mediated by the flexibility in the hydrophobic core. In addition, a mutation in
      LD found in HIES (I568F) induces NMR chemical shift perturbation in SH2, DBD and 
      the coiled-coil domain, suggesting conformational changes in these domains.
      Consistent with conformational changes in SH2, the I568F mutant reduces SH2's
      binding affinity to a pTyr-containing peptide. This study provides an example of 
      dynamics-dependent allosteric effects, and due to the structural conservation of 
      the STAT family of proteins, the inter-domain allosteric communication observed
      in STAT3 likely occurs in other STATs.

AB  - Secondary multidrug efflux transporters play a key role in the bacterial
      resistance phenotype. One of the major questions concerns the polyspecific
      recognition of substrates by these efflux pumps. To understand the molecular
      basis of this promiscuous recognition, we compared the substrate specificity of
      the well-studied Escherichia coli small multidrug resistance protein EmrE with
      that of the poorly studied Acinetobacter baumannii homologue AbeS. The latter
      drug/H(+) antiporter is a 109-amino-acid membrane protein with predicted four
      transmembrane helices. It effectively confers resistance toward ethidium,
      acriflavine and benzalkonium in an E. coli DeltaemrEDeltamdfA background.
      Purified AbeS and the substrate-specific hyperactive variant A16G bind
      tetraphenylphosphonium with nanomolar affinity and exhibit electrogenic transport
      of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium after reconstitution into liposomes. A16G
      hyperactivity was apparent toward acriflavine and ethidium, resulting in 7- to
      10-fold higher normalized IC50 values, respectively, but not toward substrates
      1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and benzalkonium. Substitution of Y3 and A42 with Ala
      or Ser, respectively, also displayed a substrate-dependent phenotype, as these
      variants were strongly affected in their properties to confer resistance against 
      acriflavine and ethidium, but not against benzalkonium. The size and planarity of
      the conjugated aromatic moieties appear to be a critical and subtle criterion for
      substrate recognition by these transporters. Rather moderate changes in the
      property of side chains postulated to be part of the substrate binding site
      result in a large phenotypical difference. These observations provide indications
      for the molecular basis of specificity within the binding pocket of polyspecific 
      transporters.

AB  - The therapeutic benefits of the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor oseltamivir are
      dampened by the emergence of drug resistance mutations in influenza A virus
      (IAV). To investigate the mechanistic features that underlie resistance, we
      developed an approach to quantify the effects of all possible single-nucleotide
      substitutions introduced into important regions of NA. We determined the
      experimental fitness effects of 450 nucleotide mutations encoding positions both 
      surrounding the active site and at more distant sites in an N1 strain of IAV in
      the presence and absence of oseltamivir. NA mutations previously known to confer 
      oseltamivir resistance in N1 strains, including H275Y and N295S, were adaptive in
      the presence of drug, indicating that our experimental system captured salient
      features of real-world selection pressures acting on NA. We identified mutations,
      including several at position 223, that reduce the apparent affinity for
      oseltamivir in vitro. Position 223 of NA is located adjacent to a hydrophobic
      portion of oseltamivir that is chemically distinct from the substrate, making it 
      a hotspot for substitutions that preferentially impact drug binding relative to
      substrate processing. Furthermore, two NA mutations, K221N and Y276F, each reduce
      susceptibility to oseltamivir by increasing NA activity without altering drug
      binding. These results indicate that competitive expansion of IAV in the face of 
      drug pressure is mediated by a balance between inhibitor binding and substrate
      processing.

AB  - Pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) induced by paramagnetic lanthanides produce
      pronounced effects in nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, which are easily
      measured and which deliver valuable long-range structure restraints. Even sparse 
      PCS data greatly enhance the success rate of 3D (3-dimensional) structure
      predictions of proteins by the modeling program Rosetta. The present work extends
      this approach to 3D structures of larger proteins, comprising more than 200
      residues, which are difficult to model by Rosetta without additional experimental
      restraints. The new algorithm improves the fragment assembly method of Rosetta by
      utilizing PCSs generated from paramagnetic lanthanide ions attached at four
      different sites as the only experimental restraints. The sparse PCS data are
      utilized at multiple stages, to identify native-like local structures, to rank
      the best structural models and to rebuild the fragment libraries. The fragment
      libraries are refined iteratively until convergence. The PCS-driven iterative
      resampling algorithm is strictly data dependent and shown to generate accurate
      models for a benchmark set of eight different proteins, ranging from 100 to 220
      residues, using solely PCSs of backbone amide protons.

AB  - Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has become an invaluable, powerful
      approach to study biomolecular dynamics and interactions via selective labeling
      and observation of specific molecules in living cells, tissues and even entire
      organisms. In this perspective, we present a brief overview of the main
      techniques and their application to cellular biophysics. We place special
      emphasis on super-resolution imaging via single-molecule localization microscopy 
      and stimulated emission depletion/reversible saturable optical fluorescence
      transitions microscopy, and we also briefly address fluorescence fluctuation
      approaches, notably raster image correlation spectroscopy, as tools to record
      fast diffusion and transport.

      Protein 5 (Dbp5).

AB  - mRNA export from the nucleus depends on the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box
      protein Dbp5/DDX19. Although Dbp5 has measurable ATPase activity alone, several
      regulatory factors (e.g., RNA, nucleoporin proteins, and the endogenous small
      molecule InsP6) modulate catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo to facilitate
      mRNA export. An analysis of the intrinsic and regulator-activated Dbp5 ATPase
      cycle is necessary to define how these factors control Dbp5 and mRNA export.
      Here, we report a kinetic and equilibrium analysis of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae Dbp5 ATPase cycle, including the influence of RNA on Dbp5 activity.
      These data show that ATP binds Dbp5 weakly in rapid equilibrium with a binding
      affinity (KT~4 mM) comparable to the KM for steady-state cycling, while ADP binds
      an order of magnitude more tightly (KD~0.4 mM). The overall intrinsic
      steady-state cycling rate constant (kcat) is limited by slow, near-irreversible
      ATP hydrolysis and even slower subsequent phosphate release. RNA increases kcat
      and rate-limiting Pi release 20-fold, although Pi release continues to limit
      steady-state cycling in the presence of RNA, in conjunction with RNA binding.
      Together, this work identifies RNA binding and Pi release as important
      biochemical transitions within the Dbp5 ATPase cycle and provides a framework for
      investigating the means by which Dbp5 and mRNA export is modulated by regulatory 
      factors.

AB  - Functional residues can modulate the folding mechanisms of proteins. In some
      proteins, mutations to such residues can radically change the primary folding
      route. Is it possible then to learn more about the functional regions of a
      protein by investigating just its choice of folding route? The folding and the
      function of the protein Escherichia coli ribonuclease H (ecoRNase-H) have been
      extensively studied and its folding route is known to near-residue resolution.
      Here, we computationally study the folding of ecoRNase-H using molecular dynamics
      simulations of structure-based models of increasing complexity. The differences
      between a model that correctly predicts the experimentally determined folding
      route and a simpler model that does not can be attributed to a set of six
      aromatic residues clustered together in a region of the protein called CORE. This
      clustering, which we term "specific" packing, drives CORE to fold early and
      determines the folding route. Both the residues involved in specific packing and 
      their packing are largely conserved across E. coli-like RNase-Hs from diverse
      species. Residue conservation is usually implicated in function. Here, the
      identified residues either are known to bind substrate in ecoRNase-H or pack
      against the substrate in the homologous human RNase-H where a substrate-bound
      crystal structure exists. Thus, the folding mechanism of ecoRNase-H is a
      byproduct of functional demands upon its sequence. Using our observations on
      specific packing, we suggest mutations to an engineered HIV RNase-H to make its
      function better. Our results show that understanding folding route choice in
      proteins can provide unexpected insights into their function.

AB  - Initiation of RNA synthesis by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) requires melting
      of promoter DNA, which is nucleated by the sigma subunit during formation of the 
      "open" promoter complex (RPo). The antibiotic lipiarmycin (Lpm) inhibits promoter
      melting by blocking access of the template DNA strand to the RNAP active-site
      cleft. Here we show that Escherichia coli RNAP holoenzymes containing either
      housekeeping sigma(70), with a deletion in the region 3.2, or the stationary
      phase sigma(S) subunits exhibited hypersensitivity to Lpm and increased cold
      sensitivity of RPo formation. Similar effects were produced by mutation located
      ~60 A away from the Lpm binding site within sigma(70) region 1.2, controlling -10
      promoter element recognition. Our data suggested that template strand
      single-stranded DNA competes with Lpm for binding to RNAP and that sigma(70)
      regions 1.2 and 3.2 attenuate Lpm action by promoting DNA duplex opening.

AB  - Viruses and bacteriophages recognize cell surface proteins using receptor-binding
      proteins. In most tailed bacteriophages, receptor-binding proteins are located on
      the bacteriophage tail. The gene transfer agent of Rhodobacter capsulatus, RcGTA,
      morphologically resembles a tailed bacteriophage and binds to a capsular
      polysaccharide covering R. capsulatus cells. Here, we report that the RcGTA
      capsid (head) is decorated by spikes that are needed for binding to the capsule. 
      The triangular spikes measured ~12nm and appeared to be attached at the capsid
      vertices. Head spike production required the putative carbohydrate-binding
      protein ghsB (rcc01080) previously thought to encode a side tail fiber protein.
      We found that ghsB is likely co-transcribed with ghsA (rcc01079) and that
      ghsA/ghsB is regulated by the CckA-ChpT-CtrA phosphorelay homologues and a
      quorum-sensing system. GhsA and GhsB were found to be CckA-dependent RcGTA
      maturation factors, as GhsA- and GhsB-deficient particles were found to have
      altered native-gel electrophoresis migration. Additionally, we provide electron
      microscopy images showing that RcGTA contains side tail fibers and a
      baseplate-like structure near the tip of the tail, which are independent of ghsB.

AB  - The bacterial single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein SSB is a strictly
      conserved and essential protein involved in diverse functions of DNA metabolism, 
      including replication and repair. SSB comprises a well-characterized tetrameric
      core of N-terminal oligonucleotide binding OB folds that bind ssDNA and four
      intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains of unknown structure that interact
      with partner proteins. The generally accepted, albeit speculative, mechanistic
      model in the field postulates that binding of ssDNA to the OB core induces the
      flexible, undefined C-terminal arms to expand outwards encouraging functional
      interactions with partner proteins. In this structural study, we show that the
      opposite is true. Combined small-angle scattering with X-rays and neutrons
      coupled to coarse-grained modeling reveal that the intrinsically disordered
      C-terminal arms are relatively collapsed around the tetrameric OB core and
      collapse further upon ssDNA binding. This implies a mechanism of action, in which
      the disordered C-terminal domain collapse traps the ssDNA and pulls functional
      partners onto the ssDNA.

AB  - In the past several decades solution NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful
      technique for the study of the structure and dynamics of proteins, providing
      detailed insights into biomolecular function. Herein, I provide a summary of two 
      important areas of application, focusing on NMR studies of (i) supramolecular
      systems with aggregate molecular masses in the hundreds of kilodaltons and of
      (ii) sparsely populated and transiently formed protein states that are thermally 
      accessible from populated ground-state conformers. The critical role of molecular
      dynamics in function is emphasized, highlighting the utility of the NMR technique
      in providing such often elusive information.

AB  - The structural features and dynamics of biological macromolecules underlie the
      molecular biology and correct functioning of cells. However, heterogeneity and
      other complexity of these molecules and their interactions often lead to loss of 
      important information in traditional biophysical experiments. Single-molecule
      methods have dramatically altered the conceptual thinking and experimental tests 
      available for such studies, leveraging their ability to avoid ensemble averaging.
      Here, I discuss briefly the rise of fluorescence single-molecule methods over the
      past two decades, a few key applications, and end with a view to challenges and
      future prospects.

AB  - Designing and producing novel proteins that fold into stable structures and
      provide essential biological functions are key goals in synthetic biology. In
      initial steps toward achieving these goals, we constructed a combinatorial
      library of de novo proteins designed to fold into 4-helix bundles. As described
      previously, screening this library for sequences that function in vivo to rescue 
      conditionally lethal mutants of Escherichia coli (auxotrophs) yielded several de 
      novo sequences, termed SynRescue proteins, which rescued four different E. coli
      auxotrophs. In an effort to understand the structural requirements necessary for 
      auxotroph rescue, we investigated the biophysical properties of the SynRescue
      proteins, using both computational and experimental approaches. Results from
      circular dichroism, size-exclusion chromatography, and NMR demonstrate that the
      SynRescue proteins are alpha-helical and relatively stable. Surprisingly,
      however, they do not form well-ordered structures. Instead, they form dynamic
      structures that fluctuate between monomeric and dimeric states. These findings
      show that a well-ordered structure is not a prerequisite for life-sustaining
      functions, and suggests that dynamic structures may have been important in the
      early evolution of protein function.

AB  - Interactions between naturally occurring proteins are highly specific, with
      protein-network imbalances associated with numerous diseases. For designed
      protein-protein interactions (PPIs), required specificity can be notoriously
      difficult to engineer. To accelerate this process, we have derived peptides that 
      form heterospecific PPIs when combined. This is achieved using software that
      generates large virtual libraries of peptide sequences and searches within the
      resulting interactome for preferentially interacting peptides. To demonstrate
      feasibility, we have (i) generated 1536 peptide sequences based on the parallel
      dimeric coiled-coil motif and varied residues known to be important for stability
      and specificity, (ii) screened the 1,180,416 member interactome for predicted Tm 
      values and (iii) used predicted Tm cutoff points to isolate eight peptides that
      form four heterospecific PPIs when combined. This required that all 32
      hypothetical off-target interactions within the eight-peptide interactome be
      disfavoured and that the four desired interactions pair correctly. Lastly, we
      have verified the approach by characterising all 36 pairs within the interactome.
      In analysing the output, we hypothesised that several sequences are capable of
      adopting antiparallel orientations. We subsequently improved the software by
      removing sequences where doing so led to fully complementary electrostatic
      pairings. Our approach can be used to derive increasingly large and therefore
      complex sets of heterospecific PPIs with a wide range of potential downstream
      applications from disease modulation to the design of biomaterials and peptides
      in synthetic biology.

AB  - Using cross-linking coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
      spectrometry and CLIP-Seq sequencing, we determined the peptide and
      oligonucleotide sequences at the interfaces between the capsid proteins and the
      genomic RNA of bacteriophage MS2. The results suggest that the same coat protein 
      (CP)-RNA and maturation protein (MP)-RNA interfaces are used in every viral
      particle. The portions of the viral RNA in contact with CP subunits span the
      genome, consistent with a large number of discrete and similar contacts within
      each particle. Many of these sites match previous predictions of the locations of
      multiple, dispersed and degenerate RNA sites with cognate CP affinity termed
      packaging signals (PSs). Chemical RNA footprinting was used to compare the
      secondary structures of protein-free genomic fragments and the RNA in the virion.
      Some PSs are partially present in protein-free RNA but others would need to
      refold from their dominant solution conformations to form the contacts identified
      in the virion. The RNA-binding peptides within the MP map to two sections of the 
      N-terminal half of the protein. Comparison of MP sequences from related phages
      suggests a similar arrangement of RNA-binding sites, although these N-terminal
      regions have only limited sequence conservation. In contrast, the sequences of
      the C-termini are highly conserved, consistent with them encompassing
      pilin-binding domains required for initial contact with host cells. These results
      provide independent and unambiguous support for the assembly of MS2 virions via a
      PS-mediated mechanism involving a series of induced-fit viral protein
      interactions with RNA.

AB  - Classical molecular genetics uses stringent selective conditions to identify
      mutants with distinct phenotypic responses. Mutations giving rise to less
      pronounced phenotypes are often missed. However, to gain systems-level insights
      into complex genetic interaction networks requires genome-wide assignment of
      quantitative phenotypic traits. In this paper, we present a quantitative
      selection approach coupled with transposon sequencing (QS-TnSeq) to globally
      identify the cellular components that orchestrate susceptibility of the cell
      cycle model bacterium Caulobacter crescentus toward bacteriophage phiCbK
      infection. We found that 135 genes representing 3.30% of the Caulobacter genome
      exhibit significant accumulation of transposon insertions upon phiCbK selection. 
      More than 85% thereof consist of new factors not previously associated with phage
      phiCbK susceptibility. Using hierarchical clustering of dose-dependent TnSeq
      datasets, we grouped these genes into functional modules that correlate with
      different stages of the phiCbK infection process. We assign phiCbK susceptibility
      to eight new genes that represent novel components of the pilus secretion
      machinery. Further, we demonstrate that, from 86 motility genes, only seven genes
      encoding structural and regulatory components of the flagellar hook increase
      phage resistance when disrupted by transposons, suggesting a link between
      flagellar hook assembly and pili biogenesis. In addition, we observe high
      recovery of Tn5 insertions within regulatory sequences of the genes encoding the 
      essential NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex indicating that intact proton
      motive force is crucial for effective phage propagation. In sum, QS-TnSeq is
      broadly applicable to perform quantitative and genome-wide systems-genetics
      analysis of complex phenotypic traits.

AB  - Enzymes, as biological catalysts, form the basis of all forms of life. How these 
      proteins have evolved their functions remains a fundamental question in biology. 
      Over 100 years of detailed biochemistry studies, combined with the large volumes 
      of sequence and protein structural data now available, means that we are able to 
      perform large-scale analyses to address this question. Using a range of
      computational tools and resources, we have compiled information on all
      experimentally annotated changes in enzyme function within 379 structurally
      defined protein domain superfamilies, linking the changes observed in functions
      during evolution to changes in reaction chemistry. Many superfamilies show
      changes in function at some level, although one function often dominates one
      superfamily. We use quantitative measures of changes in reaction chemistry to
      reveal the various types of chemical changes occurring during evolution and to
      exemplify these by detailed examples. Additionally, we use structural information
      of the enzymes active site to examine how different superfamilies have changed
      their catalytic machinery during evolution. Some superfamilies have changed the
      reactions they perform without changing catalytic machinery. In others, large
      changes of enzyme function, in terms of both overall chemistry and substrate
      specificity, have been brought about by significant changes in catalytic
      machinery. Interestingly, in some superfamilies, relatives perform similar
      functions but with different catalytic machineries. This analysis highlights
      characteristics of functional evolution across a wide range of superfamilies,
      providing insights that will be useful in predicting the function of
      uncharacterised sequences and the design of new synthetic enzymes.

      Apolipoprotein A-I: What Makes the Protein Amyloidogenic?

AB  - ApoA-I, the major protein of plasma high-density lipoprotein, removes cellular
      cholesterol and protects against atherosclerosis. ApoA-I mutations can cause
      familial amyloidosis, a life-threatening disease wherein N-terminal protein
      fragments form fibrils in vital organs. To unveil the protein misfolding
      mechanism and to understand why some mutations cause amyloidosis while others do 
      not, we analyzed the structure, stability, and lipid-binding properties of
      naturally occurring mutants of full-length human apoA-I causing either
      amyloidosis (G26R, W50R, F71Y, and L170P) or aberrant lipid metabolism (L159R).
      Global and local protein conformation and dynamics in solution were assessed by
      circular dichroism, fluorescence, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass
      spectrometry. All mutants showed increased deuteration in residues 14-22,
      supporting our hypothesis that decreased protection of this major amyloid "hot
      spot" can trigger protein misfolding. In addition, L159R showed local helical
      unfolding near the mutation site, consistent with cleavage of this mutant in
      plasma to generate the labile 1-159 fragment. Together, the results suggest that 
      reduced protection of the major amyloid "hot spot", combined with the structural 
      integrity of the native helix bundle conformation, shifts the balance from
      protein clearance to beta-aggregation. A delicate balance between the overall
      structural integrity of a globular protein and the local destabilization of its
      amyloidogenic segments may be a fundamental determinant of this and other amyloid
      diseases. Furthermore, mutation-induced conformational changes observed in the
      helix bundle, which comprises the N-terminal 75% of apoA-I, and its flexible
      C-terminal tail suggest the propagation of structural perturbations to distant
      sites via an unexpected template-induced ensemble-based mechanism, challenging
      the classical structure-based view.

AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are highly potent bacterial proteins that block
      neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction by cleaving SNAREs
      (soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors).
      However, their serotype A (BoNT/A) that cleaves SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated 
      protein of 25 kDa) has also been an established pharmaceutical for treatment of
      medical conditions that rely on hyperactivity of cholinergic nerve terminals for 
      25 years. The expansion of its use to a variety of further medical conditions
      associated with hypersecretion components is prevented partly because the
      involved SNARE isoforms are not cleaved. Therefore, we examined by mutational
      analyses the reason for the resistance of human SNAP-23, an isoform of SNAP-25.
      We show that replacement of 10 SNAP-23 residues with their SNAP-25 counterparts
      effects SNAP-25-like cleavability. Conversely, transfer of each of the replaced
      SNAP-23 residues to SNAP-25 drastically decreased the cleavability of SNAP-25. By
      means of the existing SNAP-25-toxin co-crystal structure, molecular dynamics
      simulations, and corroborative mutagenesis studies, the appropriate binding
      pockets for these residues in BoNT/A were characterized. Systematic mutagenesis
      of two major BoNT/A binding pockets was conducted in order to adapt these pockets
      to corresponding amino acids of human SNAP-23. Human SNAP-23 cleaving mutants
      were isolated using a newly established yeast-based screening system. This method
      may be useful for engineering novel BoNT/A pharmaceuticals for the treatment of
      diseases that rely on SNAP-23-mediated hypersecretion.

AB  - The mapping of folding landscapes remains an important challenge in protein
      chemistry. Pulsed oxidative labeling of exposed residues and their detection via 
      mass spectrometry provide new means of taking time-resolved "snapshots" of the
      structural changes that occur during protein folding. However, such experiments
      have been so far only interpreted qualitatively. Here, we report the detailed
      structural interpretation of mass spectrometry data from fast photochemical
      oxidation of proteins (FPOP) experiments at atomic resolution in a biased
      molecular dynamics approach. We are able to calculate structures of the early
      folding intermediate of the model system barstar that are fully consistent with
      FPOP data and Phi values. Furthermore, structures calculated with both FPOP data 
      and Phi values are significantly less compact and have fewer helical residues
      than intermediate structures calculated with Phi values only. This improves the
      agreement with the experimental beta-Tanford value and CD measurements. The
      restraints that we introduce facilitate the structural interpretation of FPOP
      data and provide new means for refined structure calculations of transiently
      sampled states on protein folding landscapes.

AB  - Translation initiation in eukaryotes requires the interplay of at least 10
      initiation factors that interact at the different steps of this phase of gene
      expression. The interactions of initiation factors and related proteins are in
      general controlled by phosphorylation, which serves as a regulatory switch to
      turn protein translation on or off. The structures of initiation factors and a
      complete description of their post-translational modification (PTM) status are
      therefore required in order to fully understand these processes. In recent years,
      mass spectrometry has contributed considerably to provide this information and
      nowadays is proving to be indispensable when studying dynamic heterogeneous
      protein complexes such as the eukaryotic initiation factors. Herein, we highlight
      mass spectrometric approaches commonly applied to identify interacting subunits
      and their PTMs and the structural techniques that allow the architecture of
      protein complexes to be assessed. We present recent structural investigations of 
      initiation factors and their interactions with other factors and with ribosomes
      and we assess the models generated. These models allow us to locate PTMs within
      initiation factor complexes and to highlight possible roles for phosphorylation
      sites in regulating interaction interfaces.

AB  - Cryo-electron tomography is a powerful technique that can faithfully image the
      native cellular environment at nanometer resolution. Unlike many other imaging
      approaches, cryo-electron tomography provides a label-free method of detecting
      biological structures, relying on the intrinsic contrast of frozen cellular
      material for direct identification of macromolecules. Recent advances in sample
      preparation, detector technology, and phase plate imaging have enabled the
      structural characterization of protein complexes within intact cells. Here, we
      review these technical developments and outline a detailed computational workflow
      for in situ structural analysis. Two recent studies are described to illustrate
      how this workflow can be adapted to examine both known and unknown cellular
      complexes. The stage is now set to realize the promise of visual proteomics--a
      complete structural description of the cell's native molecular landscape.

TI  - Charge Detection Mass Spectrometry Identifies Preferred Non-Icosahedral
      Polymorphs in the Self-Assembly of Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Capsids.

AB  - Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is prone to aberrant assembly in vitro and can
      form a broad distribution of oversized particles. Characterizing aberrant
      assembly products is challenging because they are both large and heterogeneous.
      In this work, charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) is used to measure the
      distribution of WHV assembly products. CDMS is a single-particle technique where 
      the masses of individual ions are determined from simultaneous measurement of
      each ion's charge and m/z (mass-to-charge) ratio. Under relatively aggressive,
      assembly promoting conditions, roughly half of the WHV assembly products are T=4 
      capsids composed of exactly 120 dimers while the other half are a broad
      distribution of larger species that extends to beyond 210 dimers. There are
      prominent peaks at around 132 dimers and at 150 dimers. In part, the 150 dimer
      complex can be attributed to elongating a T=4 capsid along its 5-fold axis by
      adding a ring of hexamers. However, most of the other features cannot be
      explained by existing models for hexameric defects. Cryo-electron microscopy
      provides evidence of elongated capsids. However, image analysis reveals that many
      of them are not closed but have "spiral-like" morphologies. The CDMS data
      indicate that oversized capsids have a preference for growth by addition of 3 or 
      4 dimers, probably by completion of hexameric vertices.

TI  - C-Terminal Threonine Reduces Abeta43 Amyloidogenicity Compared with Abeta42.
PG  - 274-291
LID - S0022-2836(15)00348-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2015.06.008 [doi]
AB  - Abeta43, a product of the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein APP, is
      related to Abeta42 by an additional Thr residue at the C-terminus. Abeta43 is
      typically generated at low levels compared with the predominant Abeta42 and
      Abeta40 forms, but it has been suggested that this longer peptide might have an
      impact on amyloid-beta aggregation and Alzheimer's disease that is out of
      proportion to its brain content. Here, we report that both Abeta42 and Abeta43
      spontaneously aggregate into mature amyloid fibrils via sequential appearance of 
      the same series of oligomeric and protofibrillar intermediates, the earliest of
      which appears to lack beta-structure. In spite of the additional beta-branched
      amino acid at the C-terminus, Abeta43 fibrils have fewer strong backbone H-bonds 
      than Abeta42 fibrils, some of which are lost at the C-terminus. In contrast to
      previous reports, we found that Abeta43 spontaneously aggregates more slowly than
      Abeta42. In addition, Abeta43 fibrils are very inefficient at seeding Abeta42
      amyloid formation, even though Abeta42 fibrils efficiently seed amyloid formation
      by Abeta43 monomers. Finally, mixtures of Abeta42 and Abeta43 aggregate more
      slowly than Abeta42 alone. Both in this Abeta42/Abeta43 co-aggregation reaction
      and in cross-seeding by Abeta42 fibrils, the structure of the Abeta43 in the
      product fibrils is influenced by the presence of Abeta42. The results provide new
      details of amyloid structure and assembly pathways, an example of structural
      plasticity in prion-like replication, and data showing that low levels of Abeta43
      in the brain are unlikely to favorably impact the aggregation of Abeta42.

AB  - Solvation and hydration are key factors for determining the stability and folding
      of proteins, as well as the formation of amyloid fibrils and related polypeptide 
      aggregates. Using attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared and
      solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we find that the Abeta peptide experiences a
      remarkable conformational switch from beta to alpha secondary structure upon
      solvent removal by lyophilization of oligomers. This transition is, contrary to
      Abeta fibrils, independent of concentration of organic co-solvents or co-solutes 
      and is reversible upon re-addition of the solvent. Our data illuminate a
      previously unnoted secondary structural plasticity of the Abeta peptide in
      amyloid oligomers that could bear relevance for Abeta's interactions with
      cellular structures of low polarity.

AB  - Determining the composition of viral populations is becoming increasingly
      important in the field of medical virology. While recently developed
      computational tools for viral haplotype analysis allow for correcting sequencing 
      errors, they do not always allow for the removal of errors occurring in the
      upstream experimental protocol, such as PCR errors. Primer IDs (pIDs) are one
      method to address this problem by harnessing redundant template resampling for
      error correction. By using a reference mixture of five HIV-1 strains, we show how
      pIDs can be useful for estimating key experimental parameters, such as the
      substitution rate of the PCR process and the reverse transcription (RT) error
      rate. In addition, we introduce a hidden Markov model for determining the
      recombination rate of the RT PCR process. We found no strong sequence-specific
      bias in pID abundances (the same RT efficiencies as compared to commonly used
      short, specific RT primers) and no effects of pIDs on the estimated distribution 
      of the references viruses.

TI  - The Structural Basis of Asymmetry in DNA Binding and Cleavage as Exhibited by the

AB  - LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases ("meganucleases") are highly specific DNA cleaving
      enzymes that are used for genome engineering. Like other enzymes that act on DNA 
      targets, meganucleases often display binding affinities and cleavage activities
      that are dominated by one protein domain. To decipher the underlying mechanism of
      asymmetric DNA recognition and catalysis, we identified and characterized a new
      monomeric meganuclease (I-SmaMI), which belongs to a superfamily of homologous
      enzymes that recognize divergent DNA sequences. We solved a series of crystal
      structures of the enzyme-DNA complex representing a progression of sequential
      reaction states, and we compared the structural rearrangements and surface
      potential distributions within each protein domain against their relative
      contribution to binding affinity. We then determined the effects of equivalent
      point mutations in each of the two enzyme active sites to determine whether
      asymmetry in DNA recognition is translated into corresponding asymmetry in DNA
      cleavage activity. These experiments demonstrate the structural basis for
      "dominance" by one protein domain over the other and provide insights into this
      enzyme's conformational switch from a nonspecific search mode to a more specific 
      recognition mode.

TI  - Coupling between Histone Conformations and DNA Geometry in Nucleosomes on a
      Microsecond Timescale: Atomistic Insights into Nucleosome Functions.

AB  - An octamer of histone proteins wraps about 200bp of DNA into two superhelical
      turns to form nucleosomes found in chromatin. Although the static structure of
      the nucleosomal core particle has been solved, details of the dynamic
      interactions between histones and DNA remain elusive. We performed extensively
      long unconstrained, all-atom microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of
      nucleosomes including linker DNA segments and full-length histones in explicit
      solvent. For the first time, we were able to identify and characterize the
      rearrangements in nucleosomes on a microsecond timescale including the coupling
      between the conformation of the histone tails and the DNA geometry. We found that
      certain histone tail conformations promoted DNA bulging near its entry/exit
      sites, resulting in the formation of twist defects within the DNA. This led to a 
      reorganization of histone-DNA interactions, suggestive of the formation of
      initial nucleosome sliding intermediates. We characterized the dynamics of the
      histone tails upon their condensation on the core and linker DNA and showed that 
      tails may adopt conformationally constrained positions due to the insertion of
      "anchoring" lysines and arginines into the DNA minor grooves. Potentially, these 
      phenomena affect the accessibility of post-translationally modified histone
      residues that serve as important sites for epigenetic marks (e.g., at H3K9,
      H3K27, H4K16), suggesting that interactions of the histone tails with the core
      and linker DNA modulate the processes of histone tail modifications and binding
      of the effector proteins. We discuss the implications of the observed results on 
      the nucleosome function and compare our results to different experimental
      studies.

AB  - Antibody therapies currently target only extracellular antigens. A strategy to
      recognize intracellular antigens is to target peptides presented by immune HLA
      receptors. ESK1 is a human, T-cell receptor (TCR)-mimic antibody that binds with 
      subnanomolar affinity to the RMF peptide from the intracellular Wilms tumor
      oncoprotein WT1 in complex with HLA-A*02:01. ESK1 is therapeutically effective in
      mouse models of WT1(+) human cancers. TCR-based therapies have been presumed to
      be restricted to one HLA subtype. The mechanism for the specificity and high
      affinity of ESK1 is unknown. We show in a crystal structure that ESK1 Fab binds
      to RMF/HLA-A*02:01 in a mode different from that of TCRs. From the structure, we 
      predict and then experimentally confirm high-affinity binding with multiple other
      HLA-A*02 subtypes, broadening the potential patient pool for ESK1 therapy. Using 
      the crystal structure, we also predict potential off-target binding that we
      experimentally confirm. Our results demonstrate how protein structure information
      can contribute to personalized immunotherapy.

AB  - The conformational state of distinct prolines can determine the folding of a
      protein but equally other biological processes when coupled to a
      conformation-sensitive secondary reaction. For the neuronal tau protein, the
      importance of proline conformation is underscored by its interaction with
      different prolyl cis/trans isomerases. The proline conformation would gain even
      further importance after phosphorylation of the preceding residue by various
      proline-directed kinases. A number of molecular diseases including Alzheimer's
      disease and traumatic brain injury were thereby recently qualified as
      "cistauosis", as they would imply a cis conformation for the pThr231-Pro232
      prolyl bond. We here investigate by NMR spectroscopy the conformation of all
      prolines in a functional Tau fragment, Tau[208-324]. Although we can detect and
      identify some minor conformers in the cis form, we show that all prolines are for
      over 90% in the trans conformation. Phosphorylation by CDK2/CycA3, which notably 
      leads to complete modification of the Thr231 residue, does not change this
      conclusion. Our data hence disagree with the notion that specific prolyl bonds in
      tau would adopt preferentially the cis conformation.

AB  - The DNA topoisomerase I enzyme of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtTOP1) is
      essential for the viability of the organism and survival in a murine model. This 
      topoisomerase is being pursued as a novel target for the discovery of new
      therapeutic agents for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. In this
      study, we succeeded in obtaining a structure of MtTOP1 by first predicting that
      the C-terminal region of MtTOP1 contains four repeated domains that do not
      involve the Zn-binding tetracysteine motifs seen in the C-terminal domains of
      Escherichia coli topoisomerase I. A construct (amino acids A2-T704), MtTOP1-704t,
      that includes the N-terminal domains (D1-D4) and the first predicted C-terminal
      domain (D5) of MtTOP1 was expressed and found to retain DNA cleavage-religation
      activity and catalyze single-stranded DNA catenation. MtTOP1-704t was
      crystallized, and a structure of 2.52A resolution limit was obtained. The
      structure of the MtTOP1 N-terminal domains has features that have not been
      observed in other previously available bacterial topoisomerase I crystal
      structures. The first C-terminal domain D5 forms a novel protein fold of a
      four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet stabilized by a crossing-over alpha-helix. 
      Since there is only one type IA topoisomerase present in Mycobacteriaceae and
      related Actinobacteria, this subfamily of type IA topoisomerase may be required
      for multiple functions in DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and
      repair. The unique structural features observed for MtTOP1 may allow these
      topoisomerase I enzymes to carry out physiological functions associated with
      topoisomerase III enzyme in other bacteria.

AB  - Protein-only RNase Ps (PRORPs) are a recently discovered class of RNA processing 
      enzymes that catalyze maturation of the 5' end of precursor tRNAs in Eukaryotes. 
      PRORPs are found in the nucleus and/or organelles of most eukaryotic organisms.
      Arabidopsis thaliana is a representative organism that contains PRORP enzymes
      (PRORP1, PRORP2 and PRORP3) in both its nucleus and its organelles; PRORP2 and
      PRORP3 localize to the nucleus and PRORP1 localizes to the chloroplast and the
      mitochondria. Apart from their identification, almost nothing is known about the 
      structure and function of PRORPs that act in the nucleus. Here, we use a
      combination of biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography to characterize A.
      thaliana PRORP2. We solved the crystal structure of PRORP2 (3.2A) revealing an
      overall V-shaped protein and conserved metallonuclease active-site structure. Our
      biochemical studies indicate that PRORP2 requires Mg(2+) for catalysis and
      catalyzes the maturation of nuclear encoded substrates up to 10-fold faster than 
      mitochondrial encoded precursor nad6 t-element under single-turnover conditions. 
      We also demonstrate that PRORP2 preferentially binds precursor tRNAs containing
      short 5' leaders and 3' trailers; however, leader and trailer lengths do not
      significantly alter the observed rate constants of PRORP2 in single-turnover
      cleavage assays. Our data provide a biochemical and structural framework to begin
      understanding how nuclear localized PRORPs recognize and cleave their substrates.

TI  - Correct Assembly of the Bacteriophage T5 Procapsid Requires Both the Maturation
      Protease and the Portal Complex.

AB  - The 90-nm-diameter capsid of coliphage T5 is organized with T=13 icosahedral
      geometry and encloses a double-stranded DNA genome that measures 121kbp. Its
      assembly follows a path similar to that of phage HK97 but yielding a larger
      structure that includes 775 subunits of the major head protein, 12 subunits of
      the portal protein and 120 subunits of the decoration protein. As for phage HK97,
      T5 encodes the scaffold function as an N-terminal extension (-domain) to the
      major head protein that is cleaved by the maturation protease after assembly of
      the initial prohead I form and prior to DNA packaging and capsid expansion.
      Although the major head protein alone is sufficient to assemble capsid-like
      particles, the yield is poor and includes many deformed structures. Here we
      explore the role of both the portal and the protease in capsid assembly by
      generating constructs that include the major head protein and a combination of
      protease (wild type or an inactive mutant) and portal proteins and overexpressing
      them in Escherichia coli. Our results show that the inactive protease mutant acts
      to trigger assembly of the major head protein, probably through binding to the
      -domain, while the portal protein regulates assembly into the correct T=13
      geometry. A cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of prohead I including
      inactivated protease reveals density projecting from the prohead interior surface
      toward its center that is compatible with the -domain, as well as additional
      internal density that we assign as the inactivated protease. These results reveal
      complexity in T5 beyond that of the HK97 system.

AB  - Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a premature aging disorder characterized by
      developmental defects, multisystem progressive degeneration and sensitivity to
      ultraviolet light. CS is divided into two primary complementation groups, A and
      B, with the CSA and CSB proteins presumably functioning in DNA repair and
      transcription. Using laser microirradiation and confocal microscopy, we
      characterized the nature and regulation of the CS protein response to oxidative
      DNA damage, double-strand breaks (DSBs), angelicin monoadducts and trioxsalen
      interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Our data indicate that CSB recruitment is
      influenced by the type of DNA damage and is most rapid and robust as follows:
      ICLs>DSBs>monoadducts>oxidative lesions. Transcription inhibition reduced
      accumulation of CSB at sites of monoadducts and ICLs, but it did not affect
      recruitment to (although slightly affected retention at) oxidative damage.
      Inhibition of histone deacetylation altered the dynamics of CSB assembly,
      suggesting a role for chromatin status in the response to DNA damage, whereas the
      proteasome inhibitor MG132 had no effect. The C-terminus of CSB and, in
      particular, its ubiquitin-binding domain were critical to recruitment, while the 
      N-terminus and a functional ATPase domain played a minor role at best in
      facilitating protein accumulation. Although the absence of CSA had no effect on
      CSB recruitment, CSA itself localized at sites of ICLs, DSBs and monoadducts but 
      not at oxidative lesions. Our results reveal molecular components of the CS
      protein response and point to a major involvement of complex lesions in the
      pathology of CS.

AB  - Many bacteria employ a protein organelle, the carboxysome, to catalyze carbon
      dioxide fixation in the Calvin Cycle. Only 10 genes from Halothiobacillus
      neapolitanus are sufficient for heterologous expression of carboxysomes in
      Escherichia coli, opening the door to detailed mechanistic analysis of the
      assembly process of this complex (more than 200MDa). One of these genes, csoS2,
      has been implicated in assembly but ascribing a molecular function is confounded 
      by the observation that the single csoS2 gene yields expression of two gene
      products and both display an apparent molecular weight incongruent with the
      predicted amino acid sequence. Here, we elucidate the co-translational mechanism 
      responsible for the expression of the two protein isoforms. Specifically, csoS2
      was found to possess -1 frameshifting elements that lead to the production of the
      full-length protein, CsoS2B, and a truncated protein, CsoS2A, which possesses a
      C-terminus translated from the alternate frame. The frameshifting elements
      comprise both a ribosomal slippery sequence and a 3' secondary structure, and
      ablation of either sequence is sufficient to eliminate the slip. Using these
      mutants, we investigated the individual roles of CsoS2B and CsoS2A on carboxysome
      formation. In this in vivo formation assay, cells expressing only the CsoS2B
      isoform were capable of producing intact carboxysomes, while those with only
      CsoS2A were not. Thus, we have answered a long-standing question about the nature
      of CsoS2 in this model microcompartment and demonstrate that CsoS2B is
      functionally distinct from CsoS2A in the assembly of alpha-carboxysomes.

AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER or
      ErbB) family transduce biochemical signals across plasma membrane, playing a
      significant role in vital cellular processes and in various cancers. Inactive
      HER/ErbB receptors exist in equilibrium between the monomeric and unspecified
      pre-dimerized states. After ligand binding, the receptors are involved in strong 
      lateral dimerization with proper assembly of their extracellular ligand-binding, 
      single-span transmembrane, and cytoplasmic kinase domains. The dimeric
      conformation of the HER2 transmembrane domain that is believed to support the
      cytoplasmic kinase domain configuration corresponding to the receptor active
      state was previously described in lipid bicelles. Here we used high-resolution
      NMR spectroscopy in another membrane-mimicking micellar environment and
      identified an alternative HER2 transmembrane domain dimerization coupled with
      self-association of membrane-embedded cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region. Such a
      dimerization mode appears to be capable of effectively inhibiting the receptor
      kinase activity. This finding refines the molecular mechanism regarding the
      signal propagation steps from the extracellular to cytoplasmic domains of
      HER/ErbB receptors.

TI  - The Type 2 dUTPase of Bacteriophage varphiNM1 Initiates Mobilization of
      Staphylococcus aureus Bovine Pathogenicity Island 1.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) are genetic elements that are
      mobilized by specific helper phages. The initial step in mobilization is the
      derepression of the SaPI by the interaction of a phage protein with the SaPI
      master repressor Stl. Stl proteins are highly divergent between different SaPIs
      and respond to different phage-encoded derepressors. One such SaPI, SaPIbov1, is 
      derepressed by the dUTPase (Dut) of bacteriophage 80alpha (Dut80alpha) and its
      phage varphi11 homolog, Dut11. We previously showed that SaPIbov1 could also be
      mobilized by phage varphiNM1, even though its dut gene is not homologous with
      that of 80alpha. Here, we show that varphiNM1 dut encodes a type 2 dUTPase
      (DutNM1), which has an alpha-helical structure that is distinct from the type 1
      trimeric, beta-sheet structure of Dut80alpha. Deletion of dutNM1 abolishes the
      ability of varphiNM1 to mobilize SaPIbov1. Like Dut80alpha, DutNM1 forms a direct
      interaction with SaPIbov1 Stl both in vivo and in vitro, leading to inhibition of
      the dUTPase activity and Stl release from its target DNA. This work provides
      novel insights into the diverse mechanisms of genetic mobilization in S. aureus.

AB  - Diacylglycerol (DAG) activates the eight conventional and novel isozymes of
      protein kinase C (PKC) by binding to their C1 domains. The crystal structure of
      PKCbetaII in a partially activated conformation showed how the C1B domain
      regulates activity by clamping a helix in the C-terminal AGC extension of the
      kinase domain. Here we show that the global three-dimensional shape of the
      conventional and novel PKCs is conserved despite differences in the order of the 
      domains in their primary sequences. The membrane translocation phenotypes of
      mutants in the C1B clamp are consistent across all DAG-activated PKCs,
      demonstrating conservation of this regulatory interface. We now identify a novel 
      interface that sequesters the C1A domain in PKCbetaII in a membrane-inaccessible 
      state and we generalize this to all DAG-activated PKCs. In the conventional PKCs,
      we identify a novel element of their C2 domains that additionally contributes to 
      the stability of the inactive conformation. We demonstrate that the interdomain
      linkers play important roles in permitting and stabilizing this state. We propose
      a multi-step activation mechanism in which the sequential and cooperative binding
      of the regulatory domains to the membrane is coupled to allosteric activation of 
      the kinase domain by DAG and that acquisition of full catalytic activity requires
      DAG binding to the C1B domain. In light of the conservation of shape and
      intramolecular architecture, we propose that this mechanism is common to all
      DAG-activated PKCs.

AB  - Eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess fatty acid synthase (FAS) biosynthetic
      pathways that comprise iterative chain elongation, reduction, and dehydration
      reactions. The bacterial FASII pathway differs significantly from human FAS
      pathways and is a long-standing target for antibiotic development against
      Gram-negative bacteria due to differences from the human FAS, and several
      existing antibacterial agents are known to inhibit FASII enzymes.
      N-Acetylcysteamine (NAC) fatty acid thioesters have been used as mimics of the
      natural acyl carrier protein pathway intermediates to assay FASII enzymes, and we
      now report an assay of FabV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa using (E)-2-decenoyl-NAC.
      In addition, we have converted an existing UV absorbance assay for FabA, the
      bifunctional dehydration/epimerization enzyme and key target in the FASII
      pathway, into a high-throughput enzyme coupled fluorescence assay that has been
      employed to screen a library of diverse small molecules. With this approach,
      N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-3-(2-furyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-amine (N42FTA) was found to
      competitively inhibit (pIC50=5.7+/-0.2) the processing of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-NAC
      by P. aeruginosa FabA. N42FTA was shown to be potent in blocking crosslinking of 
      Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein and FabA, a direct mimic of the biological 
      process. The co-complex structure of N42FTA with P. aeruginosa FabA protein
      rationalises affinity and suggests future design opportunities. Employing NAC
      fatty acid mimics to develop further high-throughput assays for individual
      enzymes in the FASII pathway should aid in the discovery of new antimicrobials.

AB  - The enteric protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, is the causative agent of 
      amoebic dysentery, liver abscess and colitis in human. Vesicular trafficking
      plays a key role in the survival and virulence of the protozoan and is regulated 
      by various Rab GTPases. EhRabX3 is a catalytically inefficient amoebic Rab
      protein, which is unique among the eukaryotic Ras superfamily by virtue of its
      tandem domain organization. Here, we report the crystal structures of GDP-bound
      fast hydrolyzing mutant (V71A/K73Q) and GTP-bound wild type EhRabX3 at 3.1 and
      2.8A resolutions, respectively. Though both G-domains possess "phosphate binding 
      loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases fold", only the N-terminal
      domain binds to guanine nucleotide. The relative orientation of the N-terminal
      domain and C-terminal domain is stabilized by numerous inter-domain interactions.
      Compared to other Ras superfamily members, both the GTPase domains displayed
      large deviation in switch II perhaps due to non-conservative substitutions in
      this region. As a result, entire switch II is restructured and moved away from
      the nucleotide binding pocket, providing a rationale for the diminished GTPase
      activity of EhRabX3. The N-terminal GTPase domain possesses unusually large
      number of cysteine residues. X-ray crystal structure of the fast hydrolyzing
      mutant of EhRabX3 revealed that C39 and C163 formed an intra-molecular disulfide 
      bond. Subsequent mutational and biochemical studies suggest that C39 and C163 are
      critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of EhRabX3.
      Structure-guided functional investigation of cysteine mutants could provide the
      physiological implications of the disulfide bond and could allow us to design
      potential inhibitors for the better treatment of intestinal amebiasis.

AB  - Vinculin is an essential adhesion protein that links membrane-bound integrin and 
      cadherin receptors through their intracellular binding partners to filamentous
      actin, facilitating mechanotransduction. Here we present an 8.5-A-resolution
      cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction and pseudo-atomic model of the vinculin
      tail (Vt) domain bound to F-actin. Upon actin engagement, the N-terminal "strap" 
      and helix 1 are displaced from the Vt helical bundle to mediate actin bundling.
      We find that an analogous conformational change also occurs in the H1' helix of
      the tail domain of metavinculin (MVt) upon actin binding, a muscle-specific
      splice isoform that suppresses actin bundling by Vt. These data support a model
      in which metavinculin tunes the actin bundling activity of vinculin in a
      tissue-specific manner, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding
      metavinculin mutations associated with hereditary cardiomyopathies.

AB  - Cullin3 (Cul3)-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes catalyze the transfer of
      ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to target substrate proteins. In these assemblies,
      the C-terminal region of Cul3 binds Rbx1/E2-ubiquitin, while the N-terminal
      region interacts with various BTB (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex) domain 
      proteins that serve as substrate adaptors. Previous crystal structures of the
      homodimeric BTB proteins KLHL3, KLHL11 and SPOP in complex with the N-terminal
      domain of Cul3 revealed the features required for Cul3 recognition in these
      proteins. A second class of BTB-domain-containing proteins, the KCTD proteins, is
      also Cul3 substrate adaptors, but these do not share many of the previously
      identified determinants for Cul3 binding. We report the pentameric crystal
      structures of the KCTD1 and KCTD9 BTB domains and identify plasticity in the
      KCTD1 rings. We find that the KCTD proteins 5, 6, 9 and 17 bind to Cul3 with high
      affinity, while the KCTD proteins 1 and 16 do not have detectable binding.
      Finally, we confirm the 5:5 assembly of KCTD9/Cul3 complexes by cryo-electron
      microscopy and provide a molecular rationale for BTB-mediated Cul3 binding
      specificity in the KCTD family.
