AB  - Translation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression and one of the
      most energy consuming processes in the cell. In response to various stimuli,
      multiple signaling pathways converge on the translational machinery to regulate
      its function. To date, the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the regulation of translation
      is among the best understood. Both pathways engage the mechanistic target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) to regulate a variety of components of the translational
      machinery. While these pathways regulate protein synthesis in homeostasis, their 
      dysregulation results in aberrant translation leading to human diseases,
      including diabetes, neurological disorders and cancer. Herein, we review the role
      of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways in the regulation of mRNA translation. We also 
      highlight additional signaling mechanisms that have recently emerged as
      regulators of the translational apparatus.

TI  - NTH1 is a new target for ubiquitylation-dependent regulation by TRIM26 required
      for the cellular response to oxidative stress.
LID - MCB.00616-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00616-17 [doi]
AB  - Endonuclease III-like protein 1 (NTH1) is a DNA glycosylase required for the
      repair of oxidised bases, such as thymine glycol, during the base excision repair
      pathway. We examined regulation of NTH1 protein by the ubiquitin proteasome
      pathway and have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif 26 (TRIM26) 
      as the major enzyme targeting NTH1 for polyubiquitylation. We demonstrate that
      TRIM26 catalyses ubiquitylation of NTH1 predominantly on lysine 67 present within
      the N-terminus of the protein in vitro In addition, the stability of a
      ubiquitylation-deficient protein mutant of NTH1 (lysine to arginine) at this
      specific residue is significantly increased in comparison to the wild type
      protein when transiently expressed in cultured cells. We also demonstrate that
      cellular NTH1 protein is induced in response to oxidative stress following
      hydrogen peroxide treatment of cells, and that accumulation of NTH1 on chromatin 
      is exacerbated in the absence of TRIM26 through siRNA depletion. Stabilisation of
      NTH1 following TRIM26 siRNA also causes a significant acceleration in the
      kinetics of DNA damage repair and cellular resistance to oxidative stress, which 
      can be recapitulated by overexpression of NTH1. This demonstrates the importance 
      of TRIM26 in regulating the cellular levels of NTH1, particularly under
      conditions of oxidative stress.

TI  - Multi-level differential control of hormone gene expression programs by hnRNP L
      and LL in pituitary cells.
LID - MCB.00651-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00651-17 [doi]
AB  - The pituitary-derived somatolactotrophe GH3 cells secrete both growth hormone
      (GH) and prolactin (PRL). We have found that the hnRNP L and L-like (LL) paralogs
      differentially regulate alternative splicing of genes in these cells. Here we
      show that hnRNP L is essential for PRL only, but LL for both PRL and GH
      production. Transcriptome-wide RNA-seq analysis indicates that they
      differentially control groups of hormone or hormone-related genes involved in
      hormone production/regulation at total transcript and alternative exon levels.
      Interestingly, hnRNP L also specifically binds and prevents the aberrant usage of
      a non-conserved CA-rich intron piece of Prl pre-mRNA transcripts, and many others
      involved in endocrine functions, to prevent mostly cryptic last exons and mRNA
      truncation. Essential for the full hnRNP L effect on specific exons is a
      proline-rich region emerged during evolution in vertebrate hnRNP L only, but not 
      LL. Together our data demonstrate that the hnRNP L and its paralog LL
      differentially control hormone gene expression programs at multiple levels, and
      particularly hnRNP L is critical for protecting the transcriptome from aberrant
      usage of intronic sequences. The multi-level differential control by hnRNPs
      likely tailors the transcriptome to help refine and safeguard the different gene 
      expression programs for different hormones.

TI  - MafB Is Critical for Glucagon Production and Secretion in Mouse Pancreatic alpha 
      Cells In Vivo.
LID - e00504-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00504-17 [doi]
AB  - The MafB transcription factor is expressed in pancreatic alpha and beta cells
      during development but becomes exclusive to alpha cells in adult rodents.
      Mafb-null (Mafb(-/-) ) mice were reported to have reduced alpha- and beta-cell
      numbers throughout embryonic development. To further analyze the postnatal
      function of MafB in the pancreas, we generated endocrine cell-specific
      (Mafb(Delta)(Endo) ) and tamoxifen-dependent (Mafb(Delta)(TAM) ) Mafb knockout
      mice. Mafb(Delta)(Endo) mice exhibited reduced populations of insulin-positive
      (insulin(+)) and glucagon(+) cells at postnatal day 0, but the insulin(+) cell
      population recovered by 8 weeks of age. In contrast, the Arx(+) glucagon(+) cell 
      fraction and glucagon expression remained decreased even in adulthood.
      Mafb(Delta)(TAM) mice, with Mafb deleted after pancreas maturation, also
      demonstrated diminished glucagon(+) cells and glucagon content without affecting 
      beta cells. A decreased Arx(+) glucagon(+) cell population in Mafb(Delta)(Endo)
      mice was compensated for by an increased Arx(+) pancreatic polypeptide(+) cell
      population. Furthermore, gene expression analyses from both Mafb(Delta)(Endo) and
      Mafb(Delta)(TAM) islets revealed that MafB is a key regulator of glucagon
      expression in alpha cells. Finally, both mutants failed to respond to arginine,
      likely due to impaired arginine transporter gene expression and glucagon
      production ability. Taken together, our findings reveal that MafB is critical for
      the functional maintenance of mouse alpha cells in vivo, including glucagon
      production and secretion, as well as in development.

TI  - Cation-Independent Mannose 6-Phosphate Receptor Deficiency Enhances beta-Cell
      Susceptibility to Palmitate.
LID - e00680-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00680-17 [doi]
AB  - Palmitate attenuates insulin secretion and reduces the viability of
      insulin-producing cells. Previous studies identified the aberrant palmitoylation 
      or mispalmitoylation of proteins as one mechanism by which palmitate causes
      beta-cell damage. In this report, we identify a role for lysosomal protein
      degradation as a mechanism by which beta cells defend themselves against excess
      palmitate. The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) is
      responsible for the trafficking of mannose 6-phosphate-tagged proteins to
      lysosomes via Golgi sorting and from extracellular locations through endocytosis.
      RINm5F cells, which are highly sensitive to palmitate, lack CI-MPR. The
      reconstitution of CI-MPR expression attenuates the induction of endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) stress and the toxic effects of palmitate on RINm5F cell
      viability. INS832/13 cells express CI-MPR and are resistant to the
      palmitate-mediated loss of cell viability. The reduction of CI-MPR expression
      increases the sensitivity of INS832/13 cells to the toxic effects of palmitate
      treatment. The inhibition of lysosomal acid hydrolase activity by weak base
      treatment of islets under glucolipotoxic conditions causes islet degeneration
      that is prevented by the inhibition of protein palmitoylation. These findings
      indicate that defects in lysosomal function lead to the enhanced sensitivity of
      insulin-producing cells to palmitate and support a role for normal lysosomal
      function in the protection of beta cells from excess palmitate.

TI  - 53BP1 Mediates ATR-Chk1 Signaling and Protects Replication Forks under Conditions
      of Replication Stress.
LID - e00472-17 [pii]

AB  - Complete replication of the genome is an essential prerequisite for normal cell
      division, but a variety of factors can block the replisome, triggering
      replication stress and potentially causing mutation or cell death. The cellular
      response to replication stress involves recruitment of proteins to stabilize the 
      replication fork and transmit a stress signal to pause the cell cycle and allow
      fork restart. We find that the ubiquitously expressed DNA damage response factor 
      53BP1 is required for the normal response to replication stress. Using primary,
      ex vivo B cells, we showed that a population of 53BP1(-/-) cells in early S phase
      is hypersensitive to short-term exposure to three different agents that induce
      replication stress. 53BP1 localizes to a subset of replication forks following
      induced replication stress, and an absence of 53BP1 leads to defective
      ATR-Chk1-p53 signaling and caspase 3-mediated cell death. Nascent replicated DNA 
      additionally undergoes degradation in 53BP1(-/-) cells. These results show that
      53BP1 plays an important role in protecting replication forks during the cellular
      response to replication stress, in addition to the previously characterized role 
      of 53BP1 in DNA double-strand break repair.

TI  - RBM4 modulates radial migration via alternative splicing of Dab1 during cortex
      development.
LID - MCB.00007-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00007-18 [doi]
AB  - The RNA-binding motif 4 (RBM4) protein participates in cell differentiation via
      its role in regulating the expression of or tissue-specific or developmentally
      regulated mRNA splice isoforms. RBM4 is expressed in embryonic brain during
      development; it is initially enriched in the ventricular zone/subventricular zone
      and subsequently distributed throughout the cortical cortex. Rbm4a knockout brain
      exhibited delayed migration of late-born neurons. Using in utero electroporation,
      we confirmed that knockdown of RBM4 impaired cortical neuronal migration. RNA
      immunoprecipitation-sequencing identified Disabled-1 (Dab1), which encodes a
      critical Reelin signaling adaptor, as a potential target of RBM4. Rbm4a knockout 
      embryonic brain showed altered Dab1 isoform ratios. Overexpression of RBM4
      promoted the inclusion of Dab1 exons 7 and 8 (7/8), whereas its antagonist PTBP1 
      acted in an opposite manner. RBM4 directly counteracted the effect of PTBP1 on
      exon 7/8 selection. Finally, we showed that the full-length Dab1, but not exon
      7/8-truncated Dab1, rescued neuronal migration defects in RBM4-depleted neurons, 
      indicating that RBM4 plays a role in neuronal migration via modulating the
      expression of Dab1 splice isoforms. Our findings imply that RBM4 is necessary
      during brain development and that its deficiency may lead to developmental brain 
      abnormality.

TI  - The phosphatase PTPL1 is required for PTEN-mediated regulation of apical membrane
      size.
LID - MCB.00102-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00102-18 [doi]
AB  - PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently lost in epithelial malignancies. Part of
      the tumor suppressive properties of PTEN is attributed to its function in cell
      polarization and consequently its role in maintaining epithelial tissue
      integrity. However, surprisingly little is known about the function and
      regulation of PTEN during epithelial cell polarization.We used
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption to delete PTEN in intestinal epithelial
      Ls174T:W4 cells, which upon differentiation form a microvilli-covered apical
      membrane (brush border) on a part of the cell cortex, independent of cell-cell
      junctions. We show that loss of PTEN results in the formation of a larger brush
      border that, in a fraction of the cells, even spans the entire plasma membrane,
      revealing that PTEN functions in the regulation of apical membrane size.
      Depletion of the phosphatase PTPL1 resulted in a similar defect. PTPL1 interacts 
      with PTEN, and this interaction is necessary for apical membrane enrichment of
      PTEN. Importantly, phosphatase activity of PTPL1 is not required, indicating that
      PTPL1 functions as an anchor protein in this process.Our work thus demonstrates a
      novel function for PTEN during cell polarization in controlling apical membrane
      size and identifies PTPL1 as a critical apical membrane anchor for PTEN in this
      process.

TI  - The C-terminal extension unique to the long isoform of the shelterin component
      TIN2 enhances its interaction with TRF2 in a phosphorylation- and dyskeratosis
      congenita-cluster-dependent fashion.
LID - MCB.00025-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00025-18 [doi]
AB  - TIN2 is central to the shelterin complex, linking the telomeric proteins TRF1 and
      TRF2 with TPP1/POT1. Mutations in TINF2, which encodes TIN2, that are found in
      dyskeratosis congenita (DC) result in very short telomeres and cluster in a
      region shared by the two TIN2 isoforms, TIN2S (short) and TIN2L (long). Here we
      show that TIN2L, but not TIN2S, is phosphorylated. TRF2 interacts more with TIN2L
      than TIN2S, and both the DC-cluster and phosphorylation promote this enhanced
      interaction. The binding of TIN2L, but not TIN2S, is affected by TRF2-F120, which
      is also required for TRF2's interaction with end processing factors such as
      Apollo. Conversely, TRF1 interacts more with TIN2S than with TIN2L. A
      DC-associated mutation further reduces TIN2L-TRF1, but not TIN2S-TRF1,
      interaction. Cells overexpressing TIN2L or phosphomimetic-TIN2L are permissive to
      telomere elongation, whereas cells overexpressing TIN2S or phosphodead-TIN2L are 
      not. Telomere lengths are unchanged in cell lines in which TIN2L expression has
      been eliminated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation. These results indicate that
      TIN2 isoforms are biochemically and functionally distinguishable, and that
      shelterin composition could be fundamentally altered in patients with TINF2
      mutations.

TI  - Loss of the hematopoietic stem cell factor GATA2 in the osteogenic lineage
      impairs trabecularization and mechanical strength of bone.
LID - MCB.00599-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00599-17 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor GATA2 is required for expansion and differentiation of
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) GATA2 blocks
      adipogenesis, but its biological relevance and underlying genomic events are
      unknown. We report a dual function of GATA2 in bone homeostasis. GATA2 in MSCs
      binds near genes involved in skeletal system development and co-localizes with
      motifs for FOX and HOX transcription factors, known regulators of skeletal
      development. Ectopic GATA2 blocks osteoblastogenesis by interfering with
      SMAD1/5/8 activation. MSC-specific deletion of GATA2 in mice increases numbers
      and differentiation capacity of bone-derived precursors, resulting in elevated
      bone formation. Surprisingly, MSC-specific GATA2 deficiency impairs
      trabecularization and mechanical strength of bone, involving reduced MSC
      expression of the osteoclast inhibitor osteoprotegerin and increased osteoclast
      numbers. Thus, GATA2 affects bone turnover via MSC-autonomous and indirect
      effects. By regulating bone trabecularization, GATA2 expression in the osteogenic
      lineage may contribute to the anatomical and cellular microenvironment of the HSC
      niche required for hematopoiesis.

TI  - MiR-199a-5p attenuates retrograde transport and protects against toxin-induced
      inhibition of protein biosynthesis.

AB  - Retrograde transport (RT) allows cells the retrieval of receptors and other
      cellular cargoes to the Golgi contributing to the maintenance of cellular
      homeostasis. This transport route is also commonly used by several bacterial
      toxins to exert their deleterious actions on eukaryotic cells. While the
      retrograde transport process has been well characterized, the contribution of
      microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating this cellular transport mechanism remains
      unknown. Here, we identified that the intronic miRNA family, miR-199a/b,
      coordinate genes regulating RT and endosome trafficking. We demonstrate that
      miR-199a-5p attenuates the expression of Vps26A, Rab9B and M6PR, thereby
      controlling RT from endosomes to Trans Golgi network (TGN). Importantly, we found
      that overexpression of Vps26A construct resistant to miR-199a-5p inhibitory
      action abrogates the effect of miR-199a-5p on RT. Finally, we demonstrate that
      miR-199-5p overexpression attenuates Shiga toxin (STx-1)-mediated inhibition of
      protein biosynthesis. In summary, our work identifies the first non-coding RNA
      that influences RT and reduces protein biosynthesis inhibition caused by
      bacterial toxins.

TI  - alpha4 coordinates small intestinal epithelium homeostasis by regulating
      stability of HuR.
LID - MCB.00631-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00631-17 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue in the body
      and its homeostasis depends on a dynamic balance among proliferation, migration, 
      apoptosis, and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The
      PP2A-associated protein alpha4 controls the activity and specificity of
      serine/threonine phosphatases and is thus implicated in many cellular processes. 
      Here we investigated the mechanisms whereby alpha4 controls the homeostasis of
      the intestinal epithelium using a genetic approach. In mice with ablated alpha4, 
      the small intestinal mucosa exhibited crypt hyperplasia, villus shrinkage,
      defective differentiation of Paneth cells, and reduced IEC migration along the
      crypt/villus axis. The alpha4-deficient intestinal epithelium also displayed
      decreased expression of different intercellular junction proteins and abnormal
      epithelial permeability. In addition, alpha4 deficiency decreased the levels of
      the RNA-binding protein HuR in the mucosal tissue. In cultured IECs, ectopic
      overexpression of HuR in alpha4-deficient cells rescued the production of these
      intercellular junction proteins and restored the epithelial barrier function to a
      nearly normal level. Mechanistically, alpha4 silencing destabilized HuR through a
      process involving HuR phosphorylation by IkappaB kinase alpha leading to
      ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of HuR. These findings indicate that the critical 
      impact of alpha4 upon the barrier function and homeostasis of the intestinal
      epithelium depends largely on its ability to regulate the stability of HuR.

TI  - Regulation of Cholesterol Sulfotransferase SULT2B1b by Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 
      4alpha Constitutes a Negative Feedback Control of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis.
LID - e00654-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00654-17 [doi]
AB  - The cholesterol sulfotransferase SULT2B1b converts cholesterol to cholesterol
      sulfate (CS). We previously reported that SULT2B1b inhibits hepatic
      gluconeogenesis by antagonizing the gluconeogenic activity of hepatocyte nuclear 
      factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha). In this study, we showed that the SULT2B1b gene is a
      transcriptional target of HNF4alpha, which led to our hypothesis that the
      induction of SULT2B1b by HNF4alpha represents a negative feedback to limit the
      gluconeogenic activity of HNF4alpha. Indeed, downregulation of Sult2B1b enhanced 
      the gluconeogenic activity of HNF4alpha, which may have been accounted for by the
      increased acetylation of HNF4alpha as a result of decreased expression of the
      HNF4alpha deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). The expression of Sult2B1b was also
      induced by HNF4alpha upon fasting, and the Sult2B1b null (Sult2B1b(-/-)) mice
      showed increased gluconeogenic gene expression and an elevated fasting glucose
      level, suggesting that SULT2B1b also plays a restrictive role in
      HNF4alpha-mediated fasting-responsive gluconeogenesis. We also developed
      thiocholesterol, a hydrolysis-resistant derivative of CS, which showed superior
      activity to that of the native CS in inhibiting gluconeogenesis and improving
      insulin sensitivity in high-fat-diet-induced diabetic mice. We conclude that the 
      HNF4alpha-SULT2B1b-CS axis represents a key endogenous mechanism to prevent
      uncontrolled gluconeogenesis. Thiocholesterol may be used as a therapeutic agent 
      to manage hyperglycemia.

TI  - Cilium Length and Intraflagellar Transport Regulation by Kinases PKG-1 and GCK-2 
      in Caenorhabditis elegans Sensory Neurons.
LID - e00612-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00612-17 [doi]
AB  - To understand how ciliopathies such as polycystic kidney disease or Bardet-Biedl 
      syndrome develop, we need to understand the basic molecular mechanisms underlying
      cilium development. Cilium growth depends on the presence of functional
      intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, and we hypothesized that various
      kinases and phosphatases might be involved in this regulatory process. A
      candidate screen revealed two kinases, PKG-1 (a cGMP-dependent protein kinase)
      and GCK-2 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 3 [MAP4K3]
      kinase involved in mTOR signaling), significantly affecting dye filling,
      chemotaxis, cilium morphology, and IFT component distribution. PKG-1 and GCK-2
      show similar expression patterns in Caenorhabditis elegans cilia and colocalize
      with investigated IFT machinery components. In pkg-1 mutants, a high level of
      accumulation of kinesin-2 OSM-3 in distal segments was observed in conjunction
      with an overall reduction of anterograde and retrograde IFT particle A transport,
      likely as a function of reduced tubulin acetylation. In contrast, in gck-2
      mutants, both kinesin-2 motility and IFT particle A motility were significantly
      elevated in the middle segments, in conjunction with increased tubulin
      acetylation, possibly the cause of longer cilium growth. Observed effects in
      mutants can be also seen in manipulating upstream and downstream effectors of the
      respective cGMP and mTOR pathways. Importantly, transmission electron microscopy 
      (TEM) analysis revealed no structural changes in cilia of pkg-1 and gck-2
      mutants.

TI  - Homeostatic Response of Mouse renin Gene Transcription in a Hypertensive
      Environment Is Mediated by a Novel 5' Enhancer.
LID - e00566-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00566-17 [doi]
AB  - The renin-angiotensin system plays an essential role in blood pressure
      homeostasis. Because renin activity is reflected as a blood pressure phenotype,
      its gene expression in the kidney is tightly regulated by a feedback mechanism;
      i.e., renin gene transcription is suppressed in a hypertensive state. To address 
      the molecular mechanisms controlling hypertension-responsive mouse renin (mRen)
      gene regulation, we deleted either 5' (17-kb) or 3' (78-kb) regions of the
      endogenous mRen gene and placed the animals in a hypertensive environment. While 
      the mRen gene bearing the 3' deletion was appropriately downregulated, the one
      bearing the 5' deletion lost this hypertension responsiveness. Because the 17-kb 
      sequence exhibited enhancer activity in vivo and in vitro, we narrowed down the
      enhancer to a 2.3-kb core using luciferase assays in As4.1 cells. When this
      2.3-kb sequence was removed from the endogenous mRen gene in the mouse, its basal
      expression was dramatically reduced, and the hypertension responsiveness was
      significantly attenuated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the angiotensin II
      signal played an important role in mRen gene suppression. We propose that in a
      hypertensive environment, the activity of this novel enhancer is attenuated, and,
      as a consequence, mRen gene transcription is suppressed to maintain blood
      pressure.

TI  - Endosomal-lysosomal Cholesterol Sequestration by U18666A Differentially Regulates
      APP Metabolism in Normal and APP Overexpressing Cells.
LID - MCB.00529-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00529-17 [doi]
AB  - Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a
      critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence
      indicates that altered levels/subcellular distribution of cholesterol can
      regulate Abeta production/clearance, but it remains unclear how cholesterol
      sequestration within the endosomal-lysosomal (EL) system can influence APP
      metabolism. Thus, we evaluated the effects of U18666A, which triggers cholesterol
      redistribution within EL system, on mouse N2a cells expressing different levels
      of APP in the presence or absence of extracellular cholesterol/lipids provided by
      fetal bovine serum (FBS). Our results reveal that U18666A and FBS differentially 
      increase the levels of APP and its cleaved products alpha/beta/eta-C-terminal
      fragments in N2a cells expressing normal levels of mouse APP (N2awt) or higher
      levels of human wild-type APP (APPwt) or "Swedish" mutant APP (APPsw). The
      cellular levels of Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 were markedly increased in U18666A-treated
      APPwt and APPsw cells. Our studies further demonstrate that APP and its cleaved
      products are partly accumulated in the lysosomes possibly due to decreased
      clearance. Finally, we show that autophagy inhibition plays a role in mediating
      U18666A effects. Collectively, these results suggest that altered
      levels/distribution of cholesterol/lipids can differentially regulate APP
      metabolism depending on the nature of APP expression.

TI  - Regulation of HIF-1alpha during Hypoxia by DAP5-Induced Translation of PHD2.
LID - MCB.00647-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00647-17 [doi]
AB  - Death associated protein 5 (DAP5) is an atypical isoform of the translation
      initiation scaffolds eukaryotic initiation factors 4GI and II (eIF4GI/II), which 
      recruit mRNAs to ribosomes in mammals. Unlike eIF4GI/II, DAP5 binds eIF2beta, a
      subunit of the eIF2 complex that delivers methionyl-tRNA to ribosomes. We
      discovered that DAP5:eIF2beta binding depends on specific stimuli, e.g. protein
      kinase C (PKC)-Raf-ERK1/2 signals, and determines DAP5's influence on global and 
      template-specific translation. DAP5 depletion caused an unanticipated surge of
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), the transcription factor and master
      switch of the hypoxia response. Physiologically, the hypoxia response is tempered
      through HIF-1alpha hydroxylation by the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase-domain 
      protein 2 (PHD2), and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. We found that
      DAP5 regulates HIF-1alpha abundance through DAP5:eIF2beta-dependent translation
      of PHD2. DAP5:eIF2-induced PHD2 translation occurred during hypoxia-associated
      protein synthesis repression, indicating a role as a safeguard to reverse
      HIF-1alpha accumulation and curb the hypoxic response.

TI  - Depletion of Mediator kinase module subunits represses super-enhancer associated 
      genes in colon cancer cells.
LID - MCB.00573-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00573-17 [doi]
AB  - In cancer, oncogene activation is partly mediated by acquired super-enhancers
      therefore representing potential targets for inhibition. Super-enhancers are
      enriched for BRD4 and Mediator and both BRD4 and the Mediator MED12 subunit are
      disproportionally required for expression of super-enhancer associated genes in
      stem cells. Here, we find that depletion of Mediator kinase module subunits
      MED12, and MED13 with MED13L, can be used to reduce expression of cancer acquired
      super-enhancer genes such as MYC in colon cancer cells with a concomitant
      decrease in proliferation. Whereas depletion of MED12 or MED13/MED13L caused
      disproportional decrease of super-enhancer gene expression, this was not seen
      with depletion of the kinases CDK8 and CDK19. MED12-MED13/MED13L-dependent
      super-enhancer genes were co-regulated by beta-catenin, which has previously been
      shown to associate with MED12. Importantly, beta-catenin depletion caused reduced
      binding of MED12 at the MYC super-enhancer. The effect of MED12 or MED13/MED13L
      depletion on cancer-acquired super-enhancer gene expression was more specific and
      partially distinct compared to BRD4 depletion with most efficient inhibition in
      combined targeting. These results identify requirement of MED12 and MED13/MED13L 
      for expression of acquired super-enhancer genes in colon cancer, implicating
      these Mediator subunits as potential therapeutic targets for colon cancer, alone 
      or together with BRD4.

      dysfunction.
LID - MCB.00595-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00595-17 [doi]
AB  - Environmental exposure to arsenic is linked to adverse health effects including
      cancer and diabetes. Pleiotropic cellular effects are observed with arsenic
      exposure. Previously, we demonstrated that arsenic dysregulated the autophagy
      pathway at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. Here, we show that
      arsenic blocks autophagy by preventing autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
      Specifically, arsenic disrupts formation of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE complex,
      where SNAP29 mediates vesicle fusion through bridging STX17-containing
      autophagosomes to VAMP8-bearing lysosomes. Mechanistically, arsenic inhibits
      SNARE complex formation, at least in part, by enhancing O-GlcNAcylation of
      SNAP29. Transfection of O-GlcNAcylation defective, but not wild type, SNAP29 into
      CRISPR-mediated SNAP29 knockout cells abolishes arsenic-mediated autophagy
      inhibition. These findings reveal a mechanism by which low-levels of arsenic
      perturb proteostasis through inhibition of SNARE complex formation, providing a
      possible therapeutic target for disease intervention in the more than 200 million
      people exposed to unsafe levels of arsenic.

      inflammation, particularly in macrophages. However, the transcriptional responses
      controlled by LXRs in other myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells (DC), are
      still poorly understood. Here we used gain- and loss-of-function models to
      characterize the impact of LXR deficiency on DC activation programs. Our results 
      identified an LXR-dependent pathway that is important for DC chemotaxis.
      LXR-deficient mature DCs are defective in stimulus-induced migration in vitro and
      in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that LXRs facilitate DC chemotactic signaling
      by regulating the expression of CD38, an ectoenzyme important for leukocyte
      trafficking. Pharmacological or genetic inactivation of CD38 activity abolished
      LXR-dependent induction of DC chemotaxis. Using the LDLR-/- mouse model of
      atherosclerosis, we also demonstrated that hematopoietic CD38 expression is
      important for the accumulation of lipid-laden myeloid cells in lesions,
      suggesting that CD38 is a key factor in leukocyte migration during atherogenesis.
      Collectively, our results demonstrate that LXRs are required for efficient
      emigration of DCs in response to chemotactic signals during inflammation.

AB  - The major surfactant protein, SP-A (product of SFTPA gene), serves as a marker of
      type II pneumocyte differentiation and surfactant synthesis. SFTPA expression in 
      cultured human fetal lung (HFL) epithelial cells is upregulated by hormones that 
      increase cAMP and activate TTF-1/NKX2.1 and NF-kappaB. To further define
      mechanisms for type II cell differentiation and induction of SP-A, we
      investigated roles of miRNAs. Using microarray to identify differentially
      expressed miRNAs in HFL epithelial cells during type II cell differentiation in
      culture, we observed that members of the miR-199a/-214 cluster were significantly
      downregulated during differentiation. Validated and predicted targets of
      miR-199a-3p/-5p and miR-214, which serve roles in type II cell differentiation
      (COX-2, NF-kappaB p50/p65, CREB1), and CREB1 target, C/EBPbeta, were coordinately
      upregulated. Accordingly, overexpression of miR-199a-5p, -3p or -214 mimics in
      cultured HFL epithelial cells decreased COX-2, NF-kappaB p50/p65, CREB1 and
      C/EBPbeta proteins, with an associated inhibition of SP-A expression.
      Interestingly, overexpression of the EMT factor, ZEB1, which declines during
      cAMP-induced type II cell differentiation, increased pri-miR-199a and reduced
      expression of targets, NF-kappaB/p50 and COX-2. Collectively, these findings
      suggest that the developmental decline in miR-199a/-214 in HFL causes increased
      expression of critical targets that enhance type II cell differentiation and SP-A
      expression.

TI  - AMPK inhibits ULK1-dependent autophagosome formation and lysosomal acidification 
      via distinct mechanisms.
LID - MCB.00023-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00023-18 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy maintains metabolism in response to starvation but each nutrient is
      sensed distinctly. Amino acid deficiency suppresses mechanistic target of
      rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) while glucose deficiency promotes AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK). MTORC1 and AMPK signalling pathways converge onto the
      ULK1/2 autophagy initiation complex. Here, we show that amino acid starvation
      promoted formation of ULK1- and Sequestosome1/p62-positive early autophagosomes. 
      Autophagosome initiation was controlled by MTORC1 sensing glutamine, leucine and 
      arginine levels together. By contrast, glucose starvation promoted AMPK activity,
      phosphorylation of ULK1 Ser 555 and LC3-II accumulation, but with dynamics
      consistent with a block in autophagy flux. We studied the flux pathway and found 
      that starvation of amino acid, but not of glucose, activated lysosomal
      acidification, which occurred independently of autophagy and ULK1. Further to
      lack of activation, glucose starvation inhibited the ability of amino acid
      starvation to activate both autophagosome formation and the lysosome. Activation 
      of AMPK and phosphorylation of ULK1 were determined to specifically inhibit
      autophagosome formation. AMPK activation also was sufficient to prevent lysosome 
      acidification. These results indicate concerted but distinct AMPK-dependent
      mechanisms to suppress early and late phases of autophagy.

TI  - Transcription activation domains of the yeast factors Met4 and Ino2: tandem
      activation domains with properties similar to the yeast Gcn4 activator.
LID - MCB.00038-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00038-18 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic transcription activation domains (ADs) are intrinsically disordered
      polypeptides that typically interact with coactivator complexes, leading to
      stimulation of transcription initiation, elongation and chromatin modifications. 
      Here we examine the properties of two strong and conserved yeast ADs: Met4 and
      Ino2. Both factors have tandem ADs that were identified by conserved sequence and
      functional studies. While AD function from both factors depends on hydrophobic
      residues, Ino2 further requires key conserved acidic and polar residues for
      optimal function. Binding studies show that the ADs bind multiple Med15 activator
      binding domains (ABDs) with a similar order of micromolar affinity, and similar
      but distinct thermodynamic properties. Protein crosslinking shows that no unique 
      complex is formed upon Met4-Med15 binding. Rather, we observed heterogeneous
      AD-ABD contacts with nearly every possible AD-ABD combination. Many of these
      properties are similar to those observed with the yeast activator Gcn4, which
      forms a large heterogeneous, dynamic, and fuzzy complex with Med15. We suggest
      that this molecular behavior is common among eukaryotic activators.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00491-17 [doi]
AB  - Propionic acidemia is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme propionyl coenzyme A
      carboxylase (PCC) located in the mitochondrial matrix. Cell-penetrating peptides,
      including transactivator of transcription (TAT), offer a potential to deliver a
      cargo into the mitochondrion. Here, we investigated the delivery of an
      alpha6beta6 PCC enzyme into mitochondria using the HIV TAT peptide at several
      levels: into isolated mitochondria, in patient fibroblast cells, and in a mouse
      model. Results from Western blots and enzyme activity assays confirmed the import
      of TAT-PCC into mitochondria, as well as into patient fibroblasts, where the
      colocalization of imported TAT-PCC and mitochondria was also confirmed by
      confocal fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, a single-dose intraperitoneal
      injection into PCC-deficient mice decreased the
      propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) ratio toward the normal level. These
      results show that a cell-penetrating peptide can deliver active multimeric enzyme
      into mitochondria in vitro, in situ, and in vivo and push the size limit of
      intracellular delivery achieved so far. Our results are promising for other
      mitochondrion-specific deficiencies.

TI  - MOF Suppresses Replication Stress and Contributes to Resolution of Stalled
      Replication Forks.
LID - e00484-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00484-17 [doi]
AB  - The human MOF (hMOF) protein belongs to the MYST family of histone
      acetyltransferases and plays a critical role in transcription and the DNA damage 
      response. MOF is essential for cell proliferation; however, its role during
      replication and replicative stress is unknown. Here we demonstrate that cells
      depleted of MOF and under replicative stress induced by cisplatin, hydroxyurea,
      or camptothecin have reduced survival, a higher frequency of S-phase-specific
      chromosome damage, and increased R-loop formation. MOF depletion decreased
      replication fork speed and, when combined with replicative stress, also increased
      stalled replication forks as well as new origin firing. MOF interacted with PCNA,
      a key coordinator of replication and repair machinery at replication forks, and
      affected its ubiquitination and recruitment to the DNA damage site. Depletion of 
      MOF, therefore, compromised the DNA damage repair response as evidenced by
      decreased Mre11, RPA70, Rad51, and PCNA focus formation, reduced DNA end
      resection, and decreased CHK1 phosphorylation in cells after exposure to
      hydroxyurea or cisplatin. These results support the argument that MOF plays an
      important role in suppressing replication stress induced by genotoxic agents at
      several stages during the DNA damage response.

TI  - Clb6-Cdc28 Promotes Ribonucleotide Reductase Subcellular Redistribution during S 
      Phase.
LID - e00497-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00497-17 [doi]
AB  - A tightly controlled cellular deoxyribonucleotide (deoxynucleoside triphosphate
      [dNTP]) pool is critical for maintenance of genome integrity. One mode of dNTP
      pool regulation is through subcellular localization of ribonucleotide reductase
      (RNR), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of dNTP biosynthesis. In 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RNR small subunit, Rnr2-Rnr4, is localized to the
      nucleus, whereas the large subunit, Rnr1, is cytoplasmic. As cells enter S phase 
      or encounter DNA damage, Rnr2-Rnr4 relocalizes to the cytoplasm to form an active
      holoenzyme complex with Rnr1. Although the DNA damage-induced relocalization
      requires the checkpoint kinases Mec1-Rad53-Dun1, the S-phase-specific
      redistribution does not. Here, we report that the S-phase cyclin-cyclin-dependent
      kinase (CDK) complex Clb6-Cdc28 controls Rnr2-Rnr4 relocalization in S phase.
      Rnr2 contains a consensus CDK site and exhibits Clb6-dependent phosphorylation in
      S phase. Deletion of CLB6 or removal of the CDK site results in an increased
      association of Rnr2 with its nuclear anchor Wtm1, nuclear retention of Rnr2-Rnr4,
      and an enhanced sensitivity to the RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea. Thus, we propose
      that Rnr2-Rnr4 redistribution in S phase is triggered by Clb6-Cdc28-mediated
      phosphorylation of Rnr2, which disrupts the Rnr2-Wtm1 interaction and promotes
      the release of Rnr2-Rnr4 from the nucleus.

LID - MCB.00608-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00608-17 [doi]
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a common cytosolic adaptor molecule
      involved in signal transduction from insulin and IGF-1 receptors. IRS-1 can also 
      be found in the nucleus. We report here a new finding of unique IRS-1 nuclear
      structures, which we observed initially in glioblastoma biopsies and glioblastoma
      xenografts. These nuclear structures can be reproduced in vitro by ectopic
      expression of IRS-1 cDNA cloned in frame with nuclear localization signal
      (NLS-IRS-1). In these structures, IRS-1 localizes at the periphery while the
      center harbors a key autophagy protein, LC3. These new nuclear structures are
      highly dynamic, rapidly exchange IRS-1 molecules with the surrounding
      nucleoplasm, disassemble during mitosis and require growth stimulus for their
      reassembly and maintenance. In tumor cells engineered to express NLS-IRS-1, the
      IRS-1/LC3 nuclear structures repress autophagy induced either by amino acid
      starvation or rapamycin treatment. In this process, IRS-1 nuclear structures
      sequester LC3 inside the nucleus, possibly preventing its cytosolic translocation
      and the formation of new autophagosomes. This novel mechanism provides a quick
      and reversible way of inhibiting autophagy, which could counteract
      autophagy-induced cancer cell death under severe stress including anticancer
      therapies.

      Insulin Sensitization.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00677-17 [doi]
AB  - Adipose tissue is a dynamic organ that makes critical contributions to whole body
      metabolic homeostasis. Although recent studies have revealed that different fat
      depots have distinct molecular signatures, metabolic functions and adipogenic
      mechanisms, PPARgamma is still widely viewed as the master regulator of
      adipogenesis and critical for maintaining mature adipocyte function. Using an
      inducible, adipocyte-specific knockout system, we explored the role of PPARgamma 
      in mature adipocytes in vivo Short-term PPARgamma deficiency in adipocytes
      reduces whole body insulin sensitivity, but adipocytes are viable both in vitro
      and in vivo However, after high fat diet exposure, even short-term PPARgamma
      deficiency leads to rapid adipocyte death. When mature adipocytes are depleted
      for both PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha, they are rapidly depleted of lipids and
      undergo adipocyte death, both in vitro and in vivo Surprisingly, although
      thiazolidinediones (TZDs -- PPARgamma agonists) are thought to act mainly on
      PPARgamma, PPARgamma in adipocytes is not required for the whole-body
      insulin-sensitizing effect of TZDs. This offers new mechanistic aspects of
      PPARgamma/TZD action and its effect on whole body metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - Transcription-factor-induced reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency is
      mediated via profound alterations in the epigenetic landscape. The histone
      variant macroH2A1 (mH2A1) is a barrier to the cellular reprogramming process. We 
      demonstrate here that mH2A1 blocks reprogramming and contributes to the
      preservation of cell identity by trapping cells at the very early stages of the
      process, namely at the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). We provided a 
      comprehensive analysis of the genomic sites occupied by the mH2A1 nucleosomes in 
      human fibroblasts and Embryonic Stem Cells and how they affect the reprogramming 
      of fibroblasts to pluripotency. We have integrated ChIP-seq data with RNA-seq
      data using cells containing reduced levels of mH2A1 and have inferred
      mH2A1-centered gene regulatory networks that support the fibroblast and ES cell
      fates. We found that the exact position of mH2A1 nucleosomes at regulatory
      regions of specific network genes with key regulatory roles guarantees the
      functional robustness of the regulatory networks. Using the reconstructed
      networks, we can predict and validate several components and their interactions
      in the establishment of stable cell types by limiting progression to alternative 
      cell fates.

TI  - Induction of the p53 tumor suppressor in cancer cells through inhibition of
      cap-dependent translation.
LID - MCB.00367-17 [pii]

AB  - The p53 tumor suppressor plays a critical role in protecting normal cells from
      malignant transformation. Development of small molecules to reactivate p53 in
      cancer cells has been an area of intense research. We previously identified an
      internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) within the 5' -untranslated region of p53
      mRNA that mediates translation of the p53 mRNA independent of cap-dependent
      translation. Our results also show that in response to DNA damage, cells switch
      from cap-dependent translation to cap-independent translation of p53 mRNA. In the
      present study, we discovered a specific inhibitor of cap-dependent translation,
      4EGI-1, that is capable of inducing the accumulation of p53 in cancer cells
      retaining wild-type p53. Our results show that 4EGI-1 causes an increase in p53
      IRES activity, leading to increased translation of p53 mRNA. We also observed
      that 4EGI-1 induces cancer cell apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore,
      4EGI-1 induces p53 in cancer cells without causing DNA double strand breaks. In
      conclusion, we discovered a mechanistic link between inhibition of cap-dependent 
      translation and enhanced p53 accumulation. This leads to apoptosis of cancer
      cells without causing collateral damage to normal cells, thus providing a novel
      and effective therapeutic strategy for cancer.

      Coactivator.

AB  - The nuclear receptor Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)
      is an essential regulator of placental development. To gain deeper insights into 
      placental PPARgamma signaling, we dissected its regulation of the Muc1 promoter. 
      We find that unlike prototypic target activation by heterodimeric receptors,
      which is either stimulated by or refractory to Retinoid X receptor (RXR) ligands 
      (rexinoids), induction of Muc1 by liganded PPARgamma requires RXRalpha, but is
      inhibited by rexinoids. We demonstrate that this inhibition is mediated by the
      activation function 2 (AF2) domain of RXRalpha and that Muc1 activation entails
      altered AF2 structures of both PPARgamma and RXRalpha. This unique regulation of 
      Muc1 reflects specific coactivation of PPARgamma-RXRalpha heterodimers by the
      transcription cofactor Ligand-dependent corepressor (LCoR), corroborated by
      significant down-regulation of Muc1 in Lcor-null placentas. LCoR interacts with
      PPARgamma and RXRalpha in a synergistic fashion via adjacent non-canonical
      protein motifs, and the AF2 domain of ligand-bound RXRalpha inhibits this
      interaction. We further identify the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 6
      (KLF6) as a critical regulator of placental development and a component of Muc1
      regulation in cooperation with PPARgamma, RXRalpha and LCoR. Combined, these
      studies reveal new principles and players in nuclear receptor function in general
      and placental PPARgamma signaling in particular.

AB  - The cellular components and function of the gastrointestinal epithelium exhibit
      distinct characteristics depending on the region, e.g., stomach or intestine. How
      these region-specific epithelial characteristics are generated during development
      remains poorly understood. Here, we report on the involvement of the
      helix-loop-helix inhibitor Id2 in establishing the specific characteristics of
      the intestinal epithelium. Id2(-/-) mice developed tumors in the small intestine.
      Histological analysis indicated that the intestinal tumors were derived from
      gastric metaplasia formed in the small intestine during development. Heterotopic 
      Id2 expression in developing gastric epithelium induced a fate change to
      intestinal epithelium. Gene expression analysis revealed that foregut-enriched
      genes encoding Irx3/5 were highly induced in the midgut of Id2(-/-) embryos, and 
      transgenic mice expressing Irx5 in the midgut endoderm developed tumors
      recapitulating the characteristics of Id2(-/-) mice. Altogether, our results
      demonstrate that Id2 plays a crucial role in the development of regional
      specificity in the gastrointestinal epithelium.

TI  - beta1-integrin impacts Rad51 stability and DNA double-strand break repair by
      homologous recombination.
LID - MCB.00672-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00672-17 [doi]
AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to radiotherapy in breast cancer
      cells remain elusive. Previously, we reported that elevated beta1-integrin is
      associated with enhanced breast cancer cell survival post-irradiation, but how
      beta1-integrin conferred radioresistance was unclear. Ionizing radiation (IR)
      induced cell killing correlates with the efficiency of DNA DSB repair and we
      found that non-malignant breast epithelial (S1) cells with low beta1-integrin
      expression have a higher frequency of S-phase specific IR-induced chromosomal
      aberrations as compared to the derivative malignant breast (T4-2) cells with high
      beta1-integrin expression. In addition, there was an increased frequency of
      IR-induced homologous recombination (HR) repairosome foci formation in T4-2 cells
      as compared with S1 cells. Cellular levels of Rad51 in T4-2 cells, a critical
      factor in HR-mediated DSB repair, were significantly higher. Blocking or
      depleting beta1-integrin activity in T4-2 cells reduced Rad51 levels while
      ectopic expression of beta1-integrin in S1 cells correspondingly increased Rad51 
      levels, suggesting that Rad51 is regulated by beta1-integrin. The low level of
      Rad51 protein in S1 cells was found to be due to rapid degradation by the
      ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP). Furthermore, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING1
      was highly upregulated in S1 cells compared to T4-2 cells. Ectopic beta1-integrin
      expression in S1 cells reduced RING1 levels and increased Rad51 accumulation. In 
      contrast, beta1-integrin depletion in T4-2 cells significantly increased RING1
      protein levels and potentiated Rad51 ubiquitination. These data suggest for the
      first time that elevated levels of the extracellular matrix receptor
      beta1-integrin can increase tumor cell radioresistance by decreasing Rad51
      degradation through a RING1-mediated proteasomal pathway.

      expression.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00001-18 [doi]
AB  - Gain-of-function mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase1 (IDH1) affects
      immune-surveillance in gliomas. As elevated CD47 is associated with immune
      evasion in cancers, its status in gliomas harboring IDH1-MT was investigated.
      Decreased CD47 expression in IDH1-R132H overexpressing cells was accompanied by
      diminished nuclear beta-catenin, PKM2 and TCF4 levels as compared to IDH1-WT.
      Inhibition of beta-catenin in IDH1-WT abrogated CD47 expression,
      beta-catenin-TCF4 interaction and transactivational activity of
      beta-catenin/TCF4. Reverse effect was observed in IDH1-MT upon pharmacologically 
      elevating nuclear beta-catenin levels. Genetic and pharmacological manipulation
      of nuclear PKM2 levels in IDH1-WT and IDH1-MT, suggested PKM2 as positive
      regulator of beta-catenin-TCF4 interaction. TCGA datasets indicated diminished
      CD47, PKM2 and beta-catenin levels in IDH1-MT gliomas as compared to IDH1-WT.
      Also, elevated BRG1 levels with mutations in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
      site were observed in IDH1-MT. Ectopic expression of ATPase deficient BRG1
      diminished CD47 expression as well as TCF4 occupancy on its promoter. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by reChIP revealed recruitment of
      PKM2/beta-catenin/BRG1/TCF4 complex to TCF4 site on CD47 promoter. This occupancy
      translated into CD47 transcription as diminished recruitment of this complex was 
      observed in glioma cells bearing IDH1-R132H. In addition to its involvement in
      CD47 transcriptional regulation, PKM2/beta-catenin/BRG1 crosstalk affected the
      phagocytosis of IDH1-MT by microglia.

      question requires a comprehensive understanding of NuA4's molecular architecture 
      and subunit organization. We have determined the structure of fully assembled
      native yeast NuA4 by single-particle electron microscopy. Our data revealed that 
      NuA4 adopts a trilobal overall architecture, with each of the three lobes
      constituted by one or two functional modules. By performing crosslinking coupled 
      to mass spectrometry analysis and in vitro protein interaction studies, we
      further mapped novel intermolecular interfaces within NuA4. Finally, we combined 
      these new data with other known structural information of NuA4 subunits and
      subassemblies to construct a multi-scale model to illustrate how the different
      NuA4 subunits and modules are spatially arranged. This model shows that the
      multiple chromatin reader domains are clustered together around the catalytic
      core, suggesting that NuA4's multi-modular architecture enables it to engage in
      multivalent interactions with its nucleosome substrate.

AB  - Half of the genes in the human genome contain alternative promoters, some of
      which generate products with opposing functions. Aberrant silencing or activation
      of such alternative promoters is associated with multiple diseases including
      cancer, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that control
      alternative promoter choice. The SHC1 gene encodes p46(Shc)/p52(Shc) and
      p66(Shc), proteins oppositely regulating anchorage independent growth that are
      produced respectively by transcription initiated from the upstream and downstream
      tandem promoters of SHC1 Here we demonstrate that activation of these promoters
      is mutually exclusive on separate alleles in single primary endothelial cells in 
      a heritable fashion, assuring expression of both transcripts by the cell.
      Peripheral blood lymphocytes that do not transcribe p66(Shc) transcribed p52(Shc)
      biallelically. This distinct monoallelic transcription pattern is established by 
      allele-specific chromosomal looping between tandem promoters, which silences the 
      upstream promoter. Our results reveal a new mechanism to control alternative
      promoter usage through higher order chromatin structure.

TI  - Asp1 bi-functional activity modulates spindle function via controlling cellular
      inositol pyrophosphate levels in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
LID - MCB.00047-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00047-18 [doi]
AB  - The generation of two daughter cells with the same genetic information requires
      error-free chromosome segregation during mitosis. Chromosome transmission
      fidelity is dependent on spindle structure/function which requires Asp1 in the
      fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Asp1 belongs to the PPIP5Ks/Vip1 family 
      which generates high energy inositol pyrophosphate (IPP) molecules. Here we show 
      that Asp1 is a bi-functional enzyme in vivo: Asp1 kinase generates specific IPPs 
      which are the substrates of the Asp1 pyrophosphatase. Intracellular levels of
      these IPPs directly correlate with microtubule stability: pyrophosphatase
      loss-of-function mutants raised Asp1-made IPP levels twofold thus increasing
      microtubule stability while overexpression of the pyrophosphatase decreased
      microtubule stability. Absence of Asp1-generated IPPs resulted in an aberrant
      increased spindle association of the S. pombe kinesin-5 family member Cut7 which 
      led to spindle collapse. Thus, chromosome transmission is controlled via
      intracellular IPP levels. Intriguingly, identification of the
      mitochondria-associated Met10 protein as the first pyrophosphatase inhibitor
      revealed that IPPs also regulate mitochondrial distribution.

TI  - TAB1-Induced Autoactivation of p38alpha Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Is
      Crucially Dependent on Threonine 185.
LID - e00409-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00409-17 [doi]
AB  - p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase is essential to cellular homeostasis.
      Two principal mechanisms to activate p38alpha exist. The first relies on
      dedicated dual-specificity kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase
      kinase (MAP2K) 3 (MKK3) or 6 (MKK6), which activate p38alpha by phosphorylating
      Thr180 and Tyr182 within the activation segment. The second is by
      autophosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 in cis, mediated by p38alpha binding the
      scaffold protein TAB1. The second mechanism occurs during myocardial ischemia,
      where it aggravates myocardial infarction. Based on the crystal structure of the 
      p38alpha-TAB1 complex we replaced threonine 185 of p38alpha with glycine (T185G) 
      to prevent an intramolecular hydrogen bond with Asp150 from being formed. This
      mutation did not interfere with TAB1 binding to p38alpha. However, it disrupted
      the consequent long-range effect of this binding event on the distal activation
      segment, releasing the constraint on Thr180 that oriented its hydroxyl for
      phosphotransfer. Based on assays performed in vitro and in vivo, the
      autoactivation of p38alpha(T185G) was disabled, while its ability to be activated
      by upstream MAP2Ks and to phosphorylate downstream substrates remained intact.
      Furthermore, myocardial cells expressing p38alpha(T185G) were resistant to
      injury. These findings reveal a mechanism to selectively disable p38alpha
      autoactivation and its consequences, which may ultimately circumvent the toxicity
      associated with strategies that inhibit p38alpha kinase activity under all
      circumstances, such as with ATP-competitive inhibitors.

TI  - The N-Terminal CCHC Zinc Finger Motif Mediates Homodimerization of Transcription 
      Factor BCL11B.
LID - e00368-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00368-17 [doi]
AB  - The BCL11B gene encodes a Kruppel-like, sequence-specific zinc finger (ZF)
      transcription factor that acts as either a repressor or an activator, depending
      on its posttranslational modifications. The importance of BCL11B in numerous
      biological processes in multiple organs has been well established in mouse
      knockout models. The phenotype of the first de novo monoallelic germ line
      missense mutation in the BCL11B gene (encoding N441K) strongly implies that the
      mutant protein acts in a dominant-negative manner by neutralizing the unaffected 
      protein through the formation of a nonfunctional dimer. Using a Forster resonance
      energy transfer-assisted fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS-FRET) assay
      and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we show that the
      N-terminal CCHC zinc finger motif is necessary and sufficient for the formation
      of the BCL11B dimer. Mutation of the CCHC ZF in BCL11B abolishes its
      transcription-regulatory activity. In addition, unlike wild-type BCL11B, this
      mutant is incapable of inducing cell cycle arrest and protecting against DNA
      damage-driven apoptosis. Our results confirm the BCL11B dimerization hypothesis
      and prove its importance for BCL11B function. By mapping the relevant regions to 
      the CCHC domain, we describe a previously unidentified mechanism of transcription
      factor homodimerization.

TI  - Nuclear Phosphatidylinositol-Phosphate Type I Kinase alpha-Coupled Star-PAP
      Polyadenylation Regulates Cell Invasion.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00457-17 [doi]
AB  - Star-PAP, a nuclear phosphatidylinositol (PI) signal-regulated poly(A) polymerase
      (PAP), couples with type I PI phosphate kinase alpha (PIPKIalpha) and controls
      gene expression. We show that Star-PAP and PIPKIalpha together regulate 3'-end
      processing and expression of pre-mRNAs encoding key anti-invasive factors
      (KISS1R, CDH1, NME1, CDH13, FEZ1, and WIF1) in breast cancer. Consistently, the
      endogenous Star-PAP level is negatively correlated with the cellular invasiveness
      of breast cancer cells. While silencing Star-PAP or PIPKIalpha increases cellular
      invasiveness in low-invasiveness MCF7 cells, Star-PAP overexpression decreases
      invasiveness in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells in a cellular Star-PAP
      level-dependent manner. However, expression of the PIPKIalpha-noninteracting
      Star-PAP mutant or the phosphodeficient Star-PAP (S6A mutant) has no effect on
      cellular invasiveness. These results strongly indicate that PIPKIalpha
      interaction and Star-PAP S6 phosphorylation are required for Star-PAP-mediated
      regulation of cancer cell invasion and give specificity to target anti-invasive
      gene expression. Our study establishes Star-PAP-PIPKIalpha-mediated 3'-end
      processing as a key anti-invasive mechanism in breast cancer.

TI  - Transforming Growth Factor beta-Induced Proliferative Arrest Mediated by
      TRIM26-Dependent TAF7 Degradation and Its Antagonism by MYC.
LID - e00449-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00449-17 [doi]
AB  - Recognition of gene promoters by RNA polymerase II is mediated by general
      transcription factor IID (TFIID), which has been thought to be a static complex
      and to play a passive role in the regulation of gene expression under the
      instruction of gene-specific transcription factors. Here we show that
      transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) induced degradation of the TFIID
      subunit TAF7 in cultured mouse mammary epithelial cells and that this effect was 
      required for proliferative arrest in response to TGF-beta stimulation. TGF-beta
      stimulated transcription of the gene for the ubiquitin ligase TRIM26, which was
      shown to ubiquitylate TAF7 and thereby to target it for proteasomal degradation. 
      Sustained exposure of cells to TGF-beta resulted in recovery from proliferative
      arrest in association with amplification of the Myc proto-oncogene, with MYC
      inhibiting TRIM26 induction by TGF-beta. Our data thus show that TFIID is not
      simply a general mediator of transcription but contributes to the regulation of
      transcription in response to cell stimulation, playing a key role in the
      cytostatic function of TGF-beta.

TI  - Probing Dominant Negative Behavior of Glucocorticoid Receptor beta through a
      Hybrid Structural and Biochemical Approach.
LID - MCB.00453-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00453-17 [doi]
AB  - Glucocorticoid receptor beta (GRbeta) is associated with glucocorticoid
      resistance via dominant negative regulation of GRalpha. To better understand how 
      GRbeta functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of GRalpha at a molecular
      level, we determined the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of GRbeta
      complexed with antagonist RU-486. The structure reveals that RU-486 binds in the 
      same ligand binding pocket as in GRalpha and the unique C-terminal amino acids of
      GRbeta are mostly disordered. Binding energy analysis suggests that these
      C-terminal residues of GRbeta do not contribute to RU-486 binding. Intriguingly, 
      the GRbeta/RU-486 complex binds corepressor peptide with similar affinity as
      GRalpha/RU-486 complex, despite the lack of helix 12. Our biophysical and
      biochemical analysis reveals that in the presence of RU-486, GRbeta is found in a
      conformation that favors corepressor binding, potentially antagonizing GRalpha
      function. This study thus presents an unexpected molecular mechanism by which
      GRbeta could repress transcription.

TI  - Membrane Trafficking Protein CDP138 Regulates Fat Browning and Insulin
      Sensitivity through Controlling Catecholamine Release.
LID - MCB.00153-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00153-17 [doi]
AB  - CDP138 is a calcium- and lipid-binding protein that is involved in membrane
      trafficking. Here we report mice without CDP138 develop obesity under normal chow
      diet (NCD) or high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. CDP138(-/-) mice have lower energy 
      expenditure, oxygen consumption and body temperature in comparison with wild-type
      (WT) mice. CDP138 is exclusively expressed in adrenal medulla and is co-localized
      with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of sympathetic nervous terminals, in the
      inguinal fat. In comparison with WT controls, CDP138(-/-) mice had altered
      catecholamine levels in the circulation, adrenal grand, and inguinal fat.
      Adrenergic signaling on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation and
      hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation induced by cold challenge, but not
      by an exogenous beta3 adrenoceptor against CL316243, were decreased in adipose
      tissues of CDP138(-/-) mice. Cold-induced beige fat browning, fatty acid
      oxidation, thermogenesis, and related gene expression were reduced in CDP138(-/-)
      mice. CDP138(-/-) mice are also prone to HFD-induced insulin resistance assessed 
      by Akt phosphorylation and glucose transport in skeletal muscles. Our data
      indicates that CDP138 is a regulator of stress response and plays a significant
      role in adipose tissue browning, energy balance, and insulin sensitivity through 
      regulating catecholamine secretion from the sympathetic nervous terminals and
      adrenal gland.

TI  - Shp2-Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Drives Proliferation during
      Zebrafish Embryo Caudal Fin Fold Regeneration.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00515-17 [doi]
AB  - Regeneration of the zebrafish caudal fin following amputation occurs through
      wound healing, followed by formation of a blastema, which produces cells to
      replace the lost tissue in the final phase of regenerative outgrowth. We show
      that ptpn11a(-/-) ptpn11b(-/-) zebrafish embryos, lacking functional Shp2, fail
      to regenerate their caudal fin folds. Rescue experiments indicated that Shp2a has
      a functional signaling role, requiring its catalytic activity and SH2 domains but
      not the two C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Surprisingly, expression
      of Shp2a variants with increased and reduced catalytic activity, respectively,
      rescued caudal fin fold regeneration to similar extents. Expression of mmp9 and
      junbb, indicative of formation of the wound epidermis and distal blastema,
      respectively, suggested that these processes occurred in ptpn11a(-/-)
      ptpn11b(-/-) zebrafish embryos. However, cell proliferation and MAPK
      phosphorylation were reduced. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK1 in wild-type
      zebrafish embryos phenocopied loss of Shp2. Our results suggest an essential role
      for Shp2a-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in promoting cell
      proliferation during zebrafish embryo caudal fin fold regeneration.

TI  - A Knock-In Tristetraprolin (TTP) Zinc Finger Point Mutation in Mice: Comparison
      with Complete TTP Deficiency.
LID - e00488-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00488-17 [doi]
AB  - Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein that can bind to
      AU-rich element-containing mRNAs and promote their decay. TTP knockout mice
      develop a severe inflammatory syndrome, largely due to excess tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF), whose mRNA is a direct target of TTP binding and destabilization.
      TTP's RNA binding activity and its ability to promote mRNA decay are lost when
      one of the zinc-coordinating residues of either zinc finger is mutated. To
      address several long-standing questions about TTP activity in intact animals, we 
      developed a knock-in mouse with a cysteine-to-arginine mutation within the first 
      zinc finger. Homozygous knock-in mice developed a severe inflammatory syndrome
      that was essentially identical to that of complete TTP deficiency, suggesting
      that TTP's critical anti-inflammatory role in mammalian physiology is secondary
      to its ability to bind RNA. In addition, there was no evidence for a
      "dominant-negative" effect of the mutant allele in heterozygotes, as suggested by
      previous experiments. Finally, mRNA decay experiments in mutant macrophages
      demonstrated that TTP can regulate the stability of its own mRNA, albeit to a
      minor extent. These studies suggest that RNA binding is an essential first step
      in the physiological activities of members of this protein family.

TI  - Functions of the TFIIE-Related Tandem Winged-Helix Domain of Rpc34 in RNA
      Polymerase III Initiation and Elongation.
LID - e00105-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00105-17 [doi]
AB  - Rpc34 is a subunit of the Rpc82/34/31 subcomplex residing on the DNA-binding
      cleft of RNA polymerase (Pol) III. Rpc34 contains a structurally flexible
      N-terminal tandem winged-helix (tWH) domain related to the TFIIE transcription
      factor. While the second WH (WH2) fold of the tWH domain is known to function in 
      DNA melting activity during transcription initiation, the functional role of the 
      WH1 fold is unknown. In this study, we generated a series of new Rpc34 tWH
      mutants conferring a cold-sensitive growth phenotype. We found that the tWH
      mutations severely compromised in vitro transcription activity due to
      destabilization of the preinitiation complex (PIC). Site-specific protein
      photo-cross-linking analysis indicated that the tWH domain persistently interacts
      with protein subunits of the Pol III cleft in the PIC and the ternary elongation 
      complex (TEC). Furthermore, purified Pol III proteins with tWH mutations also
      showed reduced efficiency in RNA elongation. Our study results suggest that the
      tWH domain is an important protein module above the Pol III cleft that integrates
      protein and nucleic acid interactions for initiation and elongation.

TI  - mRNA Processing Factor CstF-50 and Ubiquitin Escort Factor p97 Are BRCA1/BARD1
      Cofactors Involved in Chromatin Remodeling during the DNA Damage Response.
LID - e00364-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00364-17 [doi]
AB  - The cellular response to DNA damage is an intricate mechanism that involves the
      interplay among several pathways. In this study, we provide evidence of the roles
      of the polyadenylation factor cleavage stimulation factor 50 (CstF-50) and the
      ubiquitin (Ub) escort factor p97 as cofactors of BRCA1/BARD1 E3 Ub ligase,
      facilitating chromatin remodeling during the DNA damage response (DDR). CstF-50
      and p97 formed complexes with BRCA1/BARD1, Ub, and some BRCA1/BARD1 substrates,
      such as RNA polymerase (RNAP) II and histones. Furthermore, CstF-50 and p97 had
      an additive effect on the activation of the ubiquitination of these BRCA1/BARD1
      substrates during DDR. Importantly, as a result of these functional interactions,
      BRCA1/BARD1/CstF-50/p97 had a specific effect on the chromatin structure of genes
      that were differentially expressed. This study provides new insights into the
      roles of RNA processing, BRCA1/BARD1, the Ub pathway, and chromatin structure
      during DDR.

TI  - The Actin-Binding Protein PPP1r18 Regulates Maturation, Actin Organization, and
      Bone Resorption Activity of Osteoclasts.
LID - e00425-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00425-17 [doi]
AB  - Osteoclasts resorb bone by attaching on the bone matrix and forming a sealing
      zone. In Src-deficient mice, osteoclasts cannot form the actin ring, a
      characteristic actin structure that seals the resorbed area, and resorb hardly
      any bone as a result. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of Src
      in the regulation and organization of the actin ring is still unclear. We
      identified an actin-regulatory protein, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 
      18 (PPP1r18), as an Src-binding protein in an Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient
      fibroblast (SYF) cell line overexpressing a constitutively active form of Src.
      PPP1r18 was localized in the nucleus and actin ring. PPP1r18 overexpression in
      osteoclasts inhibited terminal differentiation, actin ring formation, and
      bone-resorbing activity. A mutation of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding
      domain of PPP1r18 rescued these phenotypes. In contrast, PPP1r18 knockdown
      promoted terminal differentiation and actin ring formation. In summary, we showed
      that PPP1r18 likely plays a role in podosome organization and bone resorption.

TI  - TCF7/TCF1 feedback controls osteocalcin signaling in brown adipocytes independent
      of canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway.
LID - MCB.00562-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00562-17 [doi]
AB  - Osteocalcin has recently been shown to regulate energy homeostasis through
      multiple pathways. Adipose tissue is a main organ of energy metabolism, and
      administration of recombinant osteocalcin in mice promoted energy consumption,
      thus counteracting obesity and glucose intolerance. The regulation of osteocalcin
      in islet beta cells has been well documented; however, it is unknown whether
      osteocalcin can also act on adipocytes, and if does, how it functions. Here, we
      provided evidence to demonstrate a specific role for osteocalcin in brown
      adipocyte thermogenesis. Importantly, expression of Gprc6a gene encoding a G
      protein-coupled receptor as osteocalcin receptor was activated by brown-fat-like 
      differentiation. Moreover, Gprc6a expression could be further potentiated by
      osteocalcin. Meanwhile, overexpression and knockdown experiments validated its
      crucial role in osteocalcin-mediated thermogenic genes' activation. For the first
      time, we identified Tcf7 and Wnt3a as putative targets for osteocalcin signaling.
      TCF7 belongs to TCF/LEF1 family DNA binding factors crucial for canonical
      WNT/beta-catenin pathway; however, TCF7 modulates Gprc6a and Ucp1 promoter
      activation independent of beta-catenin. Further studies revealed that
      thermogenesis coactivator PRDM16 and histone demethylase LSD1 might be required
      for TCF7 activity. Hence, our study described a TCF7-dependent feedback control
      of osteocalcin-GPRC6A axis in brown adipocyte physiologies.

TI  - Corrected and Republished from: The COP9 Signalosome Interacts with and Regulates
      Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 Protein Stability.
LID - e00493-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00493-17 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) exerts crucial
      functions in the regulation of host immunity against extracellular pathogens, DNA
      damage-induced apoptosis, death receptor signaling, and macrophage polarization. 
      Tight regulation of IRF5 is thus warranted for an efficient response to
      extracellular stressors and for limiting autoimmune and inflammatory responses.
      Here we report that the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a general modulator of diverse
      cellular and developmental processes, associates constitutively with IRF5 and
      promotes its protein stability. The constitutive CSN/IRF5 interaction was
      identified using proteomics and confirmed by endogenous immunoprecipitations. The
      CSN/IRF5 interaction occurred on the carboxyl and amino termini of IRF5; a single
      internal deletion (Delta455-466) was found to significantly reduce IRF5 protein
      stability. CSN3 was identified as a direct interacting partner of IRF5, and
      knockdown of this subunit with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) resulted in
      enhanced degradation. Degradation was further augmented by knockdown of CSN1 and 
      CSN3 together. The ubiquitin E1 inhibitor UBEI-41 or the proteasome inhibitor
      MG132 prevented IRF5 degradation, supporting that its stability is regulated by
      the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Importantly, activation of IRF5 by the death
      receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
      (TRAIL) resulted in enhanced degradation via loss of the CSN/IRF5 interaction.
      This study defines the CSN as a new interacting partner of IRF5 that controls its
      stability.

TI  - Negative regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway by a p62/Sqstm1 splicing variant.
LID - MCB.00642-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00642-17 [doi]
AB  - A key anti-oxidant pathway, the Keap1-Nrf2 system, is regulated by p62/Sqstm1 via
      multiple mechanisms, including gene expression, post-translational modifications 
      such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, and autophagic degradation of
      p62/Sqstm1 and Keap1. Herein, we demonstrate a novel mode of regulation of the
      Keap1-Nrf2 system, mediated by a splicing variant of p62/Sqstm1 pre-mRNA. Ensembl
      database search and subsequent biochemical analyses in mice revealed the presence
      of an mRNA that encodes p62/Sqstm1 protein lacking the Keap1-interacting region
      (KIR), which is essential for the interaction with Keap1. Like full-length p62,
      the variant was induced under conditions in which Nrf2 was activated (e.g.,
      impairment of autophagy), oligomerized with itself and/or full-length protein,
      and was degraded by autophagy. However, the variant failed to interact with Keap1
      and sequester it into variant-positive aggregates. Remarkably, while full-length 
      p62 stabilized Nrf2 and induced the gene expression of Nrf2 targets, the variant 
      increased the amount of Keap1 and enhanced ubiquitination of Nrf2, thereby
      suppressing the induction of Nrf2 targets. Hepatocytes isolated from genetically 
      modified mice that express full-length p62, but not the variant, were susceptible
      to activation of Nrf2 in response to stress. Collectively, our results suggest
      that splicing of p62/Sqstm1 pre-mRNA negatively regulates the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.

TI  - RAD51C/XRCC3 Facilitates Mitochondrial DNA Replication and Maintains Integrity of
      the Mitochondrial Genome.
LID - e00489-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00489-17 [doi]
AB  - Mechanisms underlying mitochondrial genome maintenance have recently gained wide 
      attention, as mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lead to inherited muscular
      and neurological diseases, which are linked to aging and cancer. It was
      previously reported that human RAD51, RAD51C, and XRCC3 localize to mitochondria 
      upon oxidative stress and are required for the maintenance of mtDNA stability.
      Since RAD51 and RAD51 paralogs are spontaneously imported into mitochondria,
      their precise role in mtDNA maintenance under unperturbed conditions remains
      elusive. Here, we show that RAD51C/XRCC3 is an additional component of the
      mitochondrial nucleoid having nucleus-independent roles in mtDNA maintenance.
      RAD51C/XRCC3 localizes to the mtDNA regulatory regions in the D-loop along with
      the mitochondrial polymerase POLG, and this recruitment is dependent upon Twinkle
      helicase. Moreover, upon replication stress, RAD51C and XRCC3 are further
      enriched at the mtDNA mutation hot spot region D310. Notably, the absence of
      RAD51C/XRCC3 affects the stability of POLG on mtDNA. As a consequence,
      RAD51C/XRCC3-deficient cells exhibit reduced mtDNA synthesis and increased
      lesions in the mitochondrial genome, leading to overall unhealthy mitochondria.
      Together, these findings lead to the proposal of a mechanism for a direct role of
      RAD51C/XRCC3 in maintaining mtDNA integrity under replication stress conditions.

TI  - Elevated HuR in Pancreas Promotes a Pancreatitis-Like Inflammatory
      Microenvironment That Facilitates Tumor Development.
LID - e00427-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00427-17 [doi]
AB  - Human antigen R (ELAVL1; HuR) is perhaps the best-characterized RNA-binding
      protein. Through its overexpression in various tumor types, HuR promotes
      posttranscriptional regulation of target genes in multiple core signaling
      pathways associated with tumor progression. The role of HuR overexpression in
      pancreatic tumorigenesis is unknown and led us to explore the consequences of HuR
      overexpression using a novel transgenic mouse model that has a >2-fold elevation 
      of pancreatic HuR expression. Histologically, HuR-overexpressing pancreas
      displays a fibroinflammatory response and other pathological features
      characteristic of chronic pancreatitis. This pathology is reflected in changes in
      the pancreatic gene expression profile due, in part, to genes whose expression
      changes as a consequence of direct binding of their respective mRNAs to HuR.
      Older mice develop pancreatic steatosis and severe glucose intolerance. Elevated 
      HuR cooperated with mutant K-ras(G12D) to result in a 3.4-fold increase in
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) incidence compared to PDAC presence in
      K-ras(G12D) alone. These findings implicate HuR as a facilitator of pancreatic
      tumorigenesis, especially in the setting of inflammation, and a novel therapeutic
      target for pancreatitis treatment.

TI  - Ubiquitin-Binding Protein CG5445 Suppresses Aggregation and Cytotoxicity of
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Linked TDP-43 in Drosophila.
LID - e00195-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00195-17 [doi]
AB  - Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation plays essential roles in proteostasis and 
      is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases in which
      ubiquitin-positive aberrant proteins accumulate. However, how such aberrant
      proteins are processed inside cells has not been fully explored. Here, we show
      that the product of CG5445, a previously uncharacterized Drosophila gene,
      prevents the accumulation of aggregate-prone ubiquitinated proteins. We found
      that ubiquitin conjugates were associated with CG5445, the knockdown of which
      caused the accumulation of detergent-insoluble ubiquitinated proteins.
      Furthermore, CG5445 rescued eye degeneration caused by the amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutant TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), which
      often forms ubiquitin-positive aggregates in cells through the capacity of CG5445
      to bind to ubiquitin chains. Biochemically, CG5445 inhibited the accumulation of 
      insoluble forms and promoted their clearance. Our results demonstrate a new
      possible mechanism by which cells maintain ubiquitinated aggregation-prone
      proteins in a soluble form to decrease their cytotoxicity until they are
      degraded.

TI  - SUMO Modification of the RNA-Binding Protein La Regulates Cell Proliferation and 
      STAT3 Protein Stability.
LID - e00129-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00129-17 [doi]
AB  - The cancer-associated RNA-binding protein La is posttranslationally modified by
      phosphorylation and sumoylation. Sumoylation of La regulates not only the
      trafficking of La in neuronal axons but also its association with specific mRNAs.
      Depletion of La in various types of cancer cell lines impairs cell proliferation;
      however, the molecular mechanism whereby La supports cell proliferation is not
      clearly understood. In this study, we address the question of whether sumoylation
      of La contributes to cell proliferation of HEK293 cells. We show that HEK293
      cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type La
      (GFP-La(WT)) grow faster than cells expressing a sumoylation-deficient mutant La 
      (GFP-La(SD)), suggesting a proproliferative function of La in HEK293 cells.
      Further, we found that STAT3 protein levels were reduced in GFP-La(SD) cells due 
      to an increase in STAT3 ubiquitination and that overexpression of STAT3 partially
      restored cell proliferation. Finally, we present RNA sequencing data from RNA
      immunoprecipitations (RIPs) and report that mRNAs associated with the cell cycle 
      and ubiquitination are preferentially bound by GFP-La(WT) and are less enriched
      in GFP-La(SD) RIPs. Taken together, results of our study support a novel
      mechanism whereby sumoylation of La promotes cell proliferation by averting
      ubiquitination-mediated degradation of the STAT3 protein.

TI  - Creation of Stable Heterothallic Strains of Komagataella phaffii Enables
      Dissection of Mating Gene Regulation.
LID - e00398-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00398-17 [doi]
AB  - The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) is homothallic
      and has been reported to switch mating type by an ancient inversion mechanism.
      Two mating-type (MAT) loci include homologs of the MATa and MATalpha
      transcription factor genes, with the expression from one locus downregulated by
      telomere position effects. However, not much is known about mating gene
      regulation, since the mixture of mating types complicates detailed
      investigations. In this study, we developed K. phaffii strains with stable mating
      types by deletion of the inverted-repeat region required for mating-type
      switching. These heterothallic strains retain their ability to mate with cells of
      the opposite mating type and were used to further elucidate mating gene
      regulation. Functional analysis of MAT mutant strains revealed the essential role
      of MATa2 and MATalpha1 in diploid cell formation. Disruption of MATa1 or
      MATalpha2 did not affect mating; however, in diploid cells, both genes are
      required for sporulation and the repression of shmoo formation. The heterothallic
      strains generated in this study allowed the first detailed characterization of
      mating gene regulation in K. phaffii They will be a valuable tool for further
      studies investigating cell-type-specific behavior and will enable in-depth
      genetic analyses and strain hybridization in this industrially relevant yeast
      species.

TI  - Sld5 Ensures Centrosomal Resistance to Congression Forces by Preserving
      Centriolar Satellites.
LID - e00371-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00371-17 [doi]
AB  - The migration of chromosomes during mitosis is mediated primarily by kinesins
      that bind to the chromosomes and move along the microtubules, exerting pulling
      and pushing forces on the centrosomes. We report that a DNA replication protein, 
      Sld5, localizes to the centrosomes, resisting the microtubular pulling forces
      experienced during chromosome congression. In the absence of Sld5, centriolar
      satellites, which normally cluster around the centrosomes, are dissipated
      throughout the cytoplasm, resulting in the loss of their known function of
      recruiting the centrosomal protein, pericentrin. We observed that Sld5-deficient 
      centrosomes lacking pericentrin were unable to endure the CENP-E- and
      Kid-mediated microtubular forces that converge on the centrosomes during
      chromosome congression, resulting in monocentriolar and acentriolar spindle
      poles. The minus-end-directed kinesin-14 motor protein, HSET, sustains the
      traction forces that mediate centrosomal fragmentation in Sld5-depleted cells.
      Thus, we report that a DNA replication protein has an as yet unknown function of 
      ensuring spindle pole resistance to traction forces exerted during chromosome
      congression.

TI  - Ubiquitin-Specific Protease USP6 Regulates the Stability of the c-Jun Protein.
LID - e00320-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00320-17 [doi]
AB  - The c-Jun gene encodes a transcription factor that has been implicated in many
      physiological and pathological processes. c-Jun is a highly unstable protein that
      is degraded through a ubiquitination/proteasome-dependent mechanism. However, the
      deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that regulates the stability of the c-Jun protein
      requires further investigation. Here, by screening a DUB expression library, we
      identified ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP6) and showed that it regulates the 
      stability of the c-Jun protein in a manner depending on its enzyme activity. USP6
      interacts with c-Jun and antagonizes its ubiquitination. USP6 overexpression
      upregulates the activity of the downstream signaling pathway mediated by
      c-Jun/AP-1 and promotes cell invasion. Moreover, many aberrant genes that are
      upregulated in USP6 translocated nodular fasciitis are great potential targets
      regulated by c-Jun. Based on our data, USP6 is an enzyme that deubiquitinates
      c-Jun and regulates its downstream cellular functions.

AB  - The transcription factor MYC is important in breast cancer and its mRNA is
      maintained at a high level even in the absence of gene amplification. The
      mechanism(s) underlying increased MYC mRNA expression are unknown. Here we
      demonstrate that MYC mRNA was stabilized upon estrogen stimulation of estrogen
      receptor-positive breast cancer cells, via SRC-dependent effects on a recently
      described RNA-binding protein DeltaN-IMP1. We also show that loss of the tumor
      suppressor p53 increased MYC mRNA levels, even in the absence of estrogen
      stimulation. However, in cells with wildtype p53, SRC acted to overcome
      p53-mediated inhibition of estrogen-stimulated cell cycle entry and progression. 
      SRC thus promotes cell proliferation in two ways: stabilizing MYC mRNA and
      inhibiting p53 function. Since estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers
      typically express wild-type p53, these studies establish a rationale for p53
      status to be predictive for effective SRC inhibitor treatment in this subtype of 
      breast cancer.

TI  - Protein Kinase A/CREB Signaling Prevents Adriamycin-Induced Podocyte Apoptosis
      via Upregulation of Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Complexes.
LID - e00181-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00181-17 [doi]
AB  - Previous work showed that the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling
      promoted mitochondrial fusion and prevented podocyte apoptosis. The cAMP response
      element binding protein (CREB) is the main downstream transcription factor of PKA
      signaling. Here we show that the PKA agonist 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine
      3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-cyclic AMP (pCPT-cAMP) prevented the production of
      adriamycin (ADR)-induced reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in podocytes,
      which were inhibited by CREB RNA interference (RNAi). The activation of PKA
      enhanced mitochondrial function and prevented the ADR-induced decrease of
      mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I subunits, NADH-ubiquinone
      oxidoreductase complex (ND) 1/3/4 genes, and protein expression. Inhibition of
      CREB expression alleviated pCPT-cAMP-induced ND3, but not the recovery of ND1/4
      protein, in ADR-treated podocytes. In addition, CREB RNAi blocked the
      pCPT-cAMP-induced increase in ATP and the expression of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1-alpha). The
      chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed enrichment of CREB on PGC1-alpha and
      ND3 promoters, suggesting that these promoters are CREB targets. In vivo, both an
      endogenous cAMP activator (isoproterenol) and pCPT-cAMP decreased the
      albumin/creatinine ratio in mice with ADR nephropathy, reduced glomerular
      oxidative stress, and retained Wilm's tumor suppressor gene 1 (WT-1)-positive
      cells in glomeruli. We conclude that the upregulation of mitochondrial
      respiratory chain proteins played a partial role in the protection of PKA/CREB
      signaling.

AB  - Recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 are critical enzymes for
      initiating variable-diversity-joining [V(D)J] segment recombination, an essential
      process for antigen receptor expression and lymphocyte development. The BCL11A
      transcription factor is required for B cell and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)
      development, but its molecular function(s) in early B cell fate specification and
      commitment is unknown. We show here that the major B cell isoform, BCL11A-XL,
      binds directly to the RAG1 promoter as well as directly to regulatory regions of 
      transcription factors previously implicated in both B cell and pDC development to
      activate RAG1 and RAG2 gene transcription in pro- and pre-B cells. We employed
      BCL11A overexpression with recombination substrates to demonstrate direct
      consequences of BCL11A/RAG modulation on V(D)J recombination. We conclude that
      BCL11A is a critical component of a transcriptional network that regulates B cell
      fate by controlling V(D)J recombination.

TI  - Mechanistic Differences in Transcription Initiation at TATA-Less and

LID - e00448-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00448-17 [doi]
AB  - A yeast in vitro system was developed that is active for transcription at both
      TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters. Transcription with extracts made from
      cells depleted of TFIID subunit Taf1 demonstrated that promoters of both classes 
      are TFIID dependent, in agreement with recent in vivo findings. TFIID depletion
      can be complemented in vitro by additional recombinant TATA binding protein (TBP)
      at only the TATA-containing promoters. In contrast, high levels of TBP did not
      complement Taf1 depletion in vivo and instead repressed transcription from both
      promoter types. We also demonstrate the importance of the TATA-like sequence
      found at many TATA-less promoters and describe how the presence or absence of the
      TATA element is likely not the only feature that distinguishes these two types of
      promoters.

AB  - To interrogate genes essential for cell growth, proliferation and survival in
      human cells, we carried out a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short
      palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 screen in a B-cell lymphoma line using a custom 
      extended-knockout (EKO) library of 278,754 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that
      targeted 19,084 RefSeq genes, 20,852 alternatively spliced exons, and 3,872
      hypothetical genes. A new statistical analysis tool called robust analytics and
      normalization for knockout screens (RANKS) identified 2,280 essential genes, 234 
      of which were unique. Individual essential genes were validated experimentally
      and linked to ribosome biogenesis and stress responses. Essential genes exhibited
      a bimodal distribution across 10 different cell lines, consistent with a
      continuous variation in essentiality as a function of cell type. Genes essential 
      in more lines had more severe fitness defects and encoded the evolutionarily
      conserved structural cores of protein complexes, whereas genes essential in fewer
      lines formed context-specific modules and encoded subunits at the periphery of
      essential complexes. The essentiality of individual protein residues across the
      proteome correlated with evolutionary conservation, structural burial, modular
      domains, and protein interaction interfaces. Many alternatively spliced exons in 
      essential genes were dispensable and were enriched for disordered regions.
      Fitness defects were observed for 44 newly evolved hypothetical reading frames.
      These results illuminate the contextual nature and evolution of essential gene
      functions in human cells.

      Factor Function.
LID - MCB.00277-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00277-17 [doi]
AB  - The scaffold protein SH2B1, a major regulator of body weight, is recruited to the
      receptors of multiple cytokines and growth factors, including nerve growth factor
      (NGF). The beta isoform, but not the alpha isoform, of SH2B1 greatly enhances
      NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Here we asked how the unique
      C-terminal tails of the alpha and beta isoforms modulate SH2B1 function. We
      compared the actions of SH2B1alpha and SH2B1beta to those of the N-terminal 631
      amino acids shared by both isoforms. In contrast to the beta-tail, the alpha-tail
      inhibited the ability of SH2B1 to both cycle through the nucleus and enhance
      NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth, gene expression, phosphorylation of Akt and
      PLCgamma and autophosphorylation of the NGF receptor TrkA. These functions were
      restored when Tyr753 in the alpha-tail was mutated to phenylalanine. We provide
      evidence that TrkA phosphorylates Tyr753 in SH2B1alpha, as well as tyrosines 439 
      and 55 in both SH2B1alpha and SH2B1beta. Finally, co-expression of SH2B1alpha,
      but not SH2B1alpha Y753F, inhibited the ability of SH2B1beta to enhance neurite
      outgrowth. These results suggest that the C-terminal tails of SH2B1 isoforms are 
      key determinants of the cellular role of SH2B1. Furthermore, the function of
      SH2B1alpha is regulated by phosphorylation of the alpha-tail.

TI  - CITED2 restrains pro-inflammatory macrophage activation and response.
LID - MCB.00452-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00452-17 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages are strategically distributed in mammalian tissues and play an
      essential role in priming immune response. However, macrophages need to
      constantly strike a balance between activation and inhibition state to avoid a
      futile inflammatory reaction. Herein, we identify the CBP/p300-interacting
      transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxyl-terminal domain 2
      (CITED2) as a potent repressor of macrophage pro-inflammatory activation. Gain-
      and loss-of-function studies revealed that CITED2 is required for optimal
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) activation and
      attendant select anti-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. More
      importantly, deficiency of CITED2 resulted in significant attenuation in
      rosiglitazone-induced PPARgamma activity, PPARgamma recruitment to target gene
      promoters and anti-inflammatory target gene expression in macrophages.
      Interestingly, deficiency of Cited2 strikingly heightened pro-inflammatory gene
      expression through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha) 
      protein in macrophages. Further, overexpression of Egln3 or inhibition of
      HIF1alpha in Cited2-deficient macrophages completely reversed elevated
      pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine gene expression. Importantly, mice bearing a 
      myeloid-specific deletion of Cited2 were highly susceptible to endotoxin-induced 
      sepsis symptomatology and mortality. Collectively, our observations identify
      CITED2 as a novel negative regulator of macrophage pro-inflammatory activation
      and protect the host from inflammatory insults.

TI  - Loss of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1/2 in the Retinal Pigment
      Epithelium Leads to RPE65 Decrease and Retinal Degeneration.
LID - e00295-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00295-17 [doi]
AB  - Recent work suggested that the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      1/2 (ERK1/2) is increased in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of age-related 
      macular degeneration (ARMD) patients and therefore could be an attractive
      therapeutic target. Notably, ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors are used in cancer
      therapy, with severe and noncharacterized ocular side effects. To decipher the
      role of ERK1/2 in RPE cells, we conditionally disrupted the Erk1 and Erk2 genes
      in mouse RPE. The loss of ERK1/2 activity resulted in a significant decrease in
      the level of RPE65 expression, a decrease in ocular retinoid levels concomitant
      with low visual function, and a rapid disorganization of RPE cells, ultimately
      leading to retinal degeneration. Our results identify the ERK1/2 pathway as a
      direct regulator of the visual cycle and a critical component of the viability of
      RPE and photoreceptor cells. Moreover, our results caution about the need for a
      very fine adjustment of kinase inhibition in cancer or ARMD treatment in order to
      avoid ocular side effects.

TI  - The mTOR-Bach2 Cascade Controls Cell Cycle and Class Switch Recombination during 
      B Cell Differentiation.
LID - e00418-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00418-17 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor Bach2 regulates both acquired and innate immunity at
      multiple steps, including antibody class switching and regulatory T cell
      development in activated B and T cells, respectively. However, little is known
      about the molecular mechanisms of Bach2 regulation in response to signaling of
      cytokines and antigen. We show here that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      controls Bach2 along B cell differentiation with two distinct mechanisms in pre-B
      cells. First, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibited accumulation of Bach2 protein in 
      nuclei and reduced its stability. Second, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) inhibited FoxO1
      to reduce Bach2 mRNA expression. Using expression profiling and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation assay, the Ccnd3 gene, encoding cyclin D3, was identified as 
      a new direct target of Bach2. A proper cell cycle was lost at pre-B and mature B 
      cell stages in Bach2-deficient mice. Furthermore, AZD8055, an mTOR inhibitor,
      increased class switch recombination in wild-type mature B cells but not in
      Bach2-deficient cells. These results suggest that the mTOR-Bach2 cascade
      regulates proper cell cycle arrest in B cells as well as immunoglobulin gene
      rearrangement.

AB  - The nucleolus is required for ribosome biogenesis. Human cells have 2 or 3
      nucleoli associated with nucleolar organizer region (NOR)-bearing chromosomes. An
      increase in number and altered nucleolar morphology define cancer cells. However,
      the mechanisms that modulate nucleolar morphology and function are unclear. Here 
      we show that in addition to localizing at the nuclear envelope, lamin B2
      localizes proximal to nucleolin at the granular component (GC) of the nucleolus
      and associates with the nucleolar proteins nucleolin and nucleophosmin. Lamin B2 
      knockdown severely disrupted the nucleolar morphology, which was rescued to
      intact and discrete nucleoli upon lamin B2 overexpression. Furthermore, two
      mutually exclusive lamin B2 deletion mutants, DeltaHead and DeltaSLS, rescued
      nuclear and nucleolar morphology defects, respectively, induced upon lamin B2
      depletion, suggesting independent roles for lamin B2 at the nucleolus and nuclear
      envelope. Lamin B2 depletion increased nucleolin aggregation in the nucleoplasm, 
      implicating lamin B2 in stabilizing nucleolin within the nucleolus. Lamin B2
      knockdown upregulated nucleolus-specific 45S rRNA and upstream intergenic
      sequence (IGS) transcripts. The IGS transcripts colocalized with aggregates of
      nucleolin speckles, which were sustained in the nucleoplasm upon lamin B2
      depletion. Taken together, these studies uncover a novel role for lamin B2 in
      modulating the morphology, dynamics, and function of the nucleolus.

TI  - Effect of Mutant p53 Proteins on Glycolysis and Mitochondrial Metabolism.
LID - e00328-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00328-17 [doi]
AB  - TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers. Unlike other
      tumor suppressors that are frequently deleted or acquire loss-of-function
      mutations, the majority of TP53 mutations in tumors are missense substitutions,
      which lead to the expression of full-length mutant proteins that accumulate in
      cancer cells and may confer unique gain-of-function (GOF) activities to promote
      tumorigenic events. Recently, mutant p53 proteins have been shown to mediate
      metabolic changes as a novel GOF to promote tumor development. There is a strong 
      rationale that the GOF activities, including alterations in cellular metabolism, 
      might vary between the different p53 mutants. Accordingly, the effect of
      different mutant p53 proteins on cancer cell metabolism is largely unknown. In
      this study, we have metabolically profiled several individual frequently
      occurring p53 mutants in cancers, focusing on glycolytic and mitochondrial
      oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Our investigation highlights the diversity of
      different p53 mutants in terms of their effect on metabolism, which might provide
      a foundation for the development of more effective targeted pharmacological
      approaches toward variants of mutant p53.

TI  - Genetic Separation of Sae2 Nuclease Activity from Mre11 Nuclease Functions in
      Budding Yeast.
LID - e00156-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00156-17 [doi]
AB  - Sae2 promotes the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      The role of Sae2 is linked to the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX) complex, which is
      important for the processing of DNA ends into single-stranded substrates for
      homologous recombination. Sae2 has intrinsic endonuclease activity, but the role 
      of this activity has not been assessed independently from its functions in
      promoting Mre11 nuclease activity. Here we identify and characterize
      separation-of-function mutants that lack intrinsic nuclease activity or the
      ability to promote Mre11 endonucleolytic activity. We find that the ability of
      Sae2 to promote MRX nuclease functions is important for DNA damage survival,
      particularly in the absence of Dna2 nuclease activity. In contrast, Sae2 nuclease
      activity is essential for DNA repair when the Mre11 nuclease is compromised.
      Resection of DNA breaks is impaired when either Sae2 activity is blocked,
      suggesting roles for both Mre11 and Sae2 nuclease activities in promoting the
      processing of DNA ends in vivo Finally, both activities of Sae2 are important for
      sporulation, indicating that the processing of meiotic breaks requires both Mre11
      and Sae2 nuclease activities.

      Structure and Genome Organization in Response to Thermal Stress.
LID - e00292-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00292-17 [doi]
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is important for proper gene
      regulation, yet how the genome is remodeled in response to stress is largely
      unknown. Here, we use a highly sensitive version of chromosome conformation
      capture in combination with fluorescence microscopy to investigate Heat Shock
      Protein (HSP) gene conformation and 3D nuclear organization in budding yeast. In 
      response to acute thermal stress, HSP genes undergo intense intragenic folding
      interactions that go well beyond 5'-3' gene looping previously described for RNA 
      polymerase II genes. These interactions include looping between upstream
      activation sequence (UAS) and promoter elements, promoter and terminator regions,
      and regulatory and coding regions (gene "crumpling"). They are also dynamic,
      being prominent within 60 s, peaking within 2.5 min, and attenuating within 30
      min, and correlate with HSP gene transcriptional activity. With similarly
      striking kinetics, activated HSP genes, both chromosomally linked and unlinked,
      coalesce into discrete intranuclear foci. Constitutively transcribed genes also
      loop and crumple yet fail to coalesce. Notably, a missense mutation in
      transcription factor TFIIB suppresses gene looping, yet neither crumpling nor HSP
      gene coalescence is affected. An inactivating promoter mutation, in contrast,
      obviates all three. Our results provide evidence for widespread,
      transcription-associated gene crumpling and demonstrate the de novo assembly and 
      disassembly of HSP gene foci.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00476-17 [doi]
AB  - The core promoter of protein-encoding genes plays a central role in regulating
      transcription. M1BP is a transcriptional activator that associates with a core
      promoter element known as Motif 1 that resides at thousand of genes in
      Drosophila. To gain insight into how M1BP functions, we identified an interacting
      protein called GFZF. GFZF had been previously identified in genetic screens for
      factors involved in maintenance of hybrid inviability, the G2-M DNA damage
      checkpoint, and RAS/MAPK signaling but its contribution to these processes was
      unknown. Here, we show that GFZF resides in the nucleus and functions as a
      transcriptional co-activator. In addition, we show that GFZF is a glutathione
      S-transferase(GST). Thus, GFZF is the first transcriptional co-activator with
      intrinsic GST activity, and its identification as a transcriptional co-activator 
      provides an explanation for its role in numerous biological processes.

TI  - Sphingomyelin metabolism is a regulator of KRAS function.
LID - MCB.00373-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00373-17 [doi]
AB  - KRAS must localize to the plasma membrane (PM) for biological activity. We show
      here that multiple acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) inhibitors, including tricyclic
      antidepressants, mislocalized phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and KRASG12V from the
      PM; resulting in abrogation of KRASG12V signaling and potent, selective growth
      inhibition of mutant KRAS transformed cancer cells. Concordantly, in nude mice,
      the ASM inhibitor fendiline decreased the rate of growth of oncogenic
      KRAS-expressing MiaPaCa-2 tumors, but had no effect on the growth of the
      wild-type KRAS-expressing BxPC-3 tumors. ASM inhibitors also inhibited activated 
      LET-60 (a KRAS ortholog) signaling in C.elegans as evidenced by suppression of
      the induced multi-vulva phenotype. Using RNAis against C.elegans genes encoding
      other enzymes in the sphingomyelin (SM) biosynthetic pathway, we identified 14
      enzymes whose knockdown strongly or moderately suppressed the LET-60 multi-vulva 
      phenotype. In mammalian cells, pharmacological agents that target these enzymes
      all depleted PtdSer from the PM and caused KRASG12V mislocalization. These
      effects correlated with changes in SM levels or subcellular distribution.
      Selected compounds, including sphingosine kinase inhibitors, potently inhibited
      the proliferation of oncogenic KRAS-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. In
      conclusion, these results show that normal SM metabolism is critical for KRAS
      function, which may present therapeutic options for the treatment of KRAS-driven 
      cancers.

TI  - Increasing the Unneddylated Cullin1 Portion Rescues the csn Phenotypes by
      Stabilizing Adaptor Modules To Drive SCF Assembly.
LID - e00109-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00109-17 [doi]
AB  - The dynamic SCF (Skp1-cullin1-F-box protein) assembly is controlled by cycles of 
      cullin neddylation/deneddylation based on the deneddylation activity of the COP9 
      signalosome (CSN) and global sequestration of cullins by CAND1. However,
      acceptance of this prediction was hampered by the results of recent studies, and 
      the regulatory mechanism and key players remain to be identified. We found that
      maintaining a proper Cul1(Nedd8)/Cul1 ratio is crucial to ensure SCF functions.
      Reducing the high Cul1(Nedd8)/Cul1 ratios in csn mutants through ectopic
      expression of the nonneddylatable Cul1(K722R) proteins or introducing the
      endogenous cul1(K722R) point mutation significantly rescues their defective
      phenotypes. In vivo protein degradation assays revealed that the large portion of
      the unneddylated Cul1 contributes to F-box protein stabilization. Moreover, the
      unneddylated Cul1 tends to associate with adaptor modules, and disruption of
      Cul1-Skp-1 binding fails to restore the csn phenotypes. Taking the data together,
      we propose that unneddylated Cul1 is another central player involved in
      maintenance of the adaptor module pool through the formation of Cul1-Skp-1-F-box 
      complexes and promotion of rapid SCF assembly.

TI  - Bivalent Epigenetic Control of Oncofetal Gene Expression in Cancer.
LID - e00352-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00352-17 [doi]
AB  - Multiple mechanisms of epigenetic control that include DNA methylation, histone
      modification, noncoding RNAs, and mitotic gene bookmarking play pivotal roles in 
      stringent gene regulation during lineage commitment and maintenance. Experimental
      evidence indicates that bivalent chromatin domains, i.e., genome regions that are
      marked by both H3K4me3 (activating) and H3K27me3 (repressive) histone
      modifications, are a key property of pluripotent stem cells. Bivalency of
      developmental genes during the G1 phase of the pluripotent stem cell cycle
      contributes to cell fate decisions. Recently, some cancer types have been shown
      to exhibit partial recapitulation of bivalent chromatin modifications that are
      lost along with pluripotency, suggesting a mechanism by which cancer cells
      reacquire properties that are characteristic of undifferentiated, multipotent
      cells. This bivalent epigenetic control of oncofetal gene expression in cancer
      cells may offer novel insights into the onset and progression of cancer and may
      provide specific and selective options for diagnosis as well as for therapeutic
      intervention.

TI  - PARI Regulates Stalled Replication Fork Processing To Maintain Genome Stability
      upon Replication Stress in Mice.
LID - e00117-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00117-17 [doi]
AB  - DNA replication is frequently perturbed by intrinsic, as well as extrinsic,
      genotoxic stress. At damaged forks, DNA replication and repair activities require
      proper coordination to maintain genome integrity. We show here that PARI
      antirecombinase plays an essential role in modulating the initial response to
      replication stress in mice. PARI is functionally dormant at replisomes during
      normal replication, but upon replication stress, it enhances nascent-strand
      shortening that is regulated by RAD51 and MRE11. PARI then promotes double-strand
      break induction, followed by new origin firing instead of replication restart.
      Such PARI function is apparently obstructive to replication but is nonetheless
      physiologically required for chromosome stability in vivo and ex vivo Of note,
      Pari-deficient embryonic stem cells exhibit spontaneous chromosome instability,
      which is attenuated by differentiation induction, suggesting that pluripotent
      stem cells have a preferential requirement for PARI that acts against endogenous 
      replication stress. PARI is a latent modulator of stalled fork processing, which 
      is required for stable genome inheritance under both endogenous and exogenous
      replication stress in mice.

TI  - Corrected and Republished from: Activation Status-Coupled Transient S-Acylation
      Determines Membrane Partitioning of a Plant Rho-Related GTPase.
LID - e00333-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00333-17 [doi]
AB  - ROPs or RACs are plant Rho-related GTPases implicated in the regulation of a
      multitude of signaling pathways that function at the plasma membrane via
      posttranslational lipid modifications. The relationships between ROP activation
      status and membrane localization has not been established. Here, we show that
      endogenous ROPs, as well as a transgenic His6-green fluorescent protein
      (GFP)-Arabidopsis thaliana ROP6 (AtROP6) fusion protein, were partitioned between
      Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble membranes. In contrast, the
      His6-GFP-Atrop6(CA) activated mutant accumulated exclusively in
      detergent-resistant membranes. GDP induced accumulation of ROPs in Triton-soluble
      membranes, whereas GTPgammaS induced accumulation of ROPs in detergent-resistant 
      membranes. Recombinant wild-type and constitutively active AtROP6 proteins were
      purified from Arabidopsis plants, and in turn, their lipids were cleaved and
      analyzed by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. In Triton-soluble
      membranes, the wild-type AtROP6 was only prenylated, primarily by geranylgeranyl.
      The activated AtROP6 that accumulated in detergent-resistant membranes was
      modified by prenyl and acyl lipids, identified as palmitic and stearic acids.
      Consistently, activated His6-GFP-Atrop6(CA)mS(156), in which C156 was mutated
      into serine, accumulated in Triton-soluble membranes. These findings show that
      upon GTP binding and activation, AtROP6, and possibly other ROPs, are transiently
      S-acylated, inducing their partitioning into detergent-resistant membranes.

TI  - The relationship between immunity and metabolism in Drosophila diet-induced
      insulin resistance.
LID - MCB.00259-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00259-17 [doi]
AB  - Systemic and tissue-specific insulin resistance have been described in
      Drosophila, and are accompanied by many indicators of metabolic disease. The
      downstream mediators of insulin-resistant pathophysiology remain unclear. We
      analyzed insulin signaling in the fat body using loss- and gain-of-function. When
      expression of the sole Drosophila Insulin receptor (InR) was reduced in larval
      fat bodies, animals exhibited developmental delay and reduced size in a
      diet-dependent manner. Fat body InR knockdown also led to reduced survival on
      high-sugar diets. To look downstream of InR at potential mediators of insulin
      resistance, RNA-seq studies in insulin-resistant fat bodies revealed differential
      expression of genes, including those involved in innate immunity.
      Obesity-associated insulin resistance led to increased susceptibility of flies to
      infection, as in humans. Reduced innate immunity was dependent on fat body InR
      expression. The peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) PGRP-SB2 and PGRP-SC2 
      were selected for further study based on differential expression studies.
      Downregulating PGRP-SB2 selectively in the fat body protected animals from the
      deleterious effects of overnutrition, whereas downregulating PGRP-SC2 produced
      InR-like phenotypes. These studies extend earlier work linking the immune and
      insulin signaling pathways and identify new targets of insulin signaling that
      could serve as potential drug targets to treat type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Internal Associations of the Acidic Region of Upstream Binding Factor Control Its
      Nucleolar Localization.
LID - e00218-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00218-17 [doi]
AB  - Upstream binding factor (UBF) is a member of the high-mobility group (HMG) box
      protein family, characterized by multiple HMG boxes and a C-terminal acidic
      region (AR). UBF is an essential transcription factor for rRNA genes and mediates
      the formation of transcriptionally active chromatin in the nucleolus. However, it
      remains unknown how UBF is specifically localized to the nucleolus. Here, we
      examined the molecular mechanisms that localize UBF to the nucleolus. We found
      that the first HMG box (HMG box 1), the linker region (LR), and the AR
      cooperatively regulate the nucleolar localization of UBF1. We demonstrated that
      the AR intramolecularly associates with and attenuates the DNA binding activity
      of HMG boxes and confers the structured DNA preference to HMG box 1. In contrast,
      the LR was found to serve as a nuclear localization signal and compete with HMG
      boxes to bind the AR, permitting nucleolar localization of UBF1. The LR sequence 
      binds DNA and assists the stable chromatin binding of UBF. We also showed that
      the phosphorylation status of the AR does not clearly affect the localization of 
      UBF1. Our results strongly suggest that associations of the AR with HMG boxes and
      the LR regulate UBF nucleolar localization.

TI  - Long Noncoding RNA MEG3 Is an Epigenetic Determinant of Oncogenic Signaling in
      Functional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Cells.
LID - e00278-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00278-17 [doi]
AB  - The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 is significantly downregulated in pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). MEG3 loss corresponds with aberrant upregulation
      of the oncogenic hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-MET in PNETs. Meg3
      overexpression in a mouse insulin-secreting PNET cell line, MIN6, downregulates
      c-Met expression. However, the molecular mechanism by which MEG3 regulates c-MET 
      is not known. Using chromatin isolation by RNA purification and sequencing
      (ChIRP-Seq), we identified Meg3 binding to unique genomic regions in and around
      the c-Met gene. In the absence of Meg3, these c-Met regions displayed distinctive
      enhancer-signature histone modifications. Furthermore, Meg3 relied on functional 
      enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a component of polycomb repressive complex 2 
      (PRC2), to inhibit c-Met expression. Another mechanism of lncRNA-mediated
      regulation of gene expression utilized triplex-forming GA-GT rich sequences.
      Transfection of such motifs from Meg3 RNA, termed triplex-forming
      oligonucleotides (TFOs), in MIN6 cells suppressed c-Met expression and enhanced
      cell proliferation, perhaps by modulating other targets. This study
      comprehensively establishes epigenetic mechanisms underlying Meg3 control of
      c-Met and the oncogenic consequences of Meg3 loss or c-Met gain. These findings
      have clinical relevance for targeting c-MET in PNETs. There is also the potential
      for pancreatic islet beta-cell expansion through c-MET regulation to ameliorate
      beta-cell loss in diabetes.

TI  - Mice Deficient in lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase delta
      (Lpaatdelta)/acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase 4 (Agpat4) Have Impaired
      Learning and Memory.
LID - e00245-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00245-17 [doi]
AB  - We previously characterized LPAATdelta/AGPAT4 as a mitochondrial lysophosphatidic
      acid acyltransferase that regulates brain levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC),
      phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Here, we report
      that Lpaatdelta(-/-) mice display impaired spatial learning and memory compared
      to wild-type littermates in the Morris water maze and our investigation of
      potential mechanisms associated with brain phospholipid changes. Marker protein
      immunoblotting suggested that the relative brain content of neurons, glia, and
      oligodendrocytes was unchanged. Relative abundance of the important brain fatty
      acid docosahexaenoic acid was also unchanged in phosphatidylserine,
      phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin, in agreement with prior data on PC, PE and
      PI. In phosphatidic acid, it was increased. Specific decreases in
      ethanolamine-containing phospholipids were detected in mitochondrial lipids, but 
      the function of brain mitochondria in Lpaatdelta(-/-) mice was unchanged.
      Importantly, we found that Lpaatdelta(-/-) mice have a significantly and
      drastically lower brain content of the N-methyl-d-asparate (NMDA) receptor
      subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, as well as the
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit 
      GluR1, compared to wild-type mice. However, general dysregulation of PI-mediated 
      signaling is not likely responsible, since phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR pathway
      regulation was unaffected. Our findings indicate that Lpaatdelta deficiency
      causes deficits in learning and memory associated with reduced NMDA and AMPA
      receptors.

TI  - Reducing Inflammatory Cytokine Production from Renal Collecting Duct Cells by
      Inhibiting GATA2 Ameliorates Acute Kidney Injury.
LID - e00211-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00211-17 [doi]
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease. Proximal 
      tubules are considered to be the primary origin of pathogenic inflammatory
      cytokines in AKI. However, it remains unclear whether other cell types, including
      collecting duct (CD) cells, participate in inflammatory processes. The
      transcription factor GATA2 is specifically expressed in CD cells and maintains
      their cellular identity. To explore the pathophysiological function of GATA2 in
      AKI, we generated renal tubular cell-specific Gata2 deletion (G2CKO) mice and
      examined their susceptibility to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). Notably,
      G2CKO mice exhibited less severe kidney damage, with reduced granulomacrophagic
      infiltration upon IRI. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a series of
      inflammatory cytokine genes were downregulated in GATA2-deficient CD cells,
      suggesting that GATA2 induces inflammatory cytokine expression in diseased kidney
      CD cells. Through high-throughput chemical library screening, we identified a
      potent GATA inhibitor. The chemical reduces cytokine production in CD cells and
      protects the mouse kidney from IRI. These results revealed a novel pathological
      mechanism of renal IRI, namely, that CD cells produce inflammatory cytokines and 
      promote IRI progression. In injured kidney CD cells, GATA2 exerts a
      proinflammatory function by upregulating inflammatory cytokine gene expression.
      GATA2 can therefore be considered a therapeutic target for AKI.

TI  - Multi-BRCT Domain Protein Brc1 Links Rhp18/Rad18 and gammaH2A To Maintain Genome 
      Stability during S Phase.
LID - e00260-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00260-17 [doi]
AB  - DNA replication involves the inherent risk of genome instability, since
      replisomes invariably encounter DNA lesions or other structures that stall or
      collapse replication forks during the S phase. In the fission yeast
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the multi-BRCT domain protein Brc1, which is related
      to budding yeast Rtt107 and mammalian PTIP, plays an important role in
      maintaining genome integrity and cell viability when cells experience replication
      stress. The C-terminal pair of BRCT domains in Brc1 were previously shown to bind
      phosphohistone H2A (gammaH2A) formed by Rad3/ATR checkpoint kinase at DNA
      lesions; however, the putative scaffold interactions involving the N-terminal
      BRCT domains 1 to 4 of Brc1 have remained obscure. Here, we show that these
      domains bind Rhp18/Rad18, which is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that has
      crucial functions in postreplication repair. A missense allele in BRCT domain 4
      of Brc1 disrupts binding to Rhp18 and causes sensitivity to replication stress.
      Brc1 binding to Rhp18 and gammaH2A are required for the Brc1 overexpression
      suppression of smc6-74, a mutation that impairs the Smc5/6 structural maintenance
      of chromosomes complex required for chromosome integrity and repair of collapsed 
      replication forks. From these findings, we propose that Brc1 provides scaffolding
      functions linking gammaH2A, Rhp18, and Smc5/6 complex at damaged replication
      forks.

TI  - Upregulation of MicroRNA 18b Contributes to the Development of Colorectal Cancer 
      by Inhibiting CDKN2B.
LID - e00391-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00391-17 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit aberrant expression in the initiation and progression 
      of a variety of human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the
      exact mechanisms are not well defined. miRNA expression profiles were
      characterized by microarrays in CRC samples, and miRNA 18b (miR-18b) was
      increased significantly in tumor tissues. The expression of miR-18b was confirmed
      in the CRC cell lines SW480 and HCT116 and 44 clinical specimens by quantitative 
      real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Multiple linear regression analysis showed a strong
      correlation of miR-18b expression with lymph node and distant metastasis.
      Overexpression of miR-18b promoted cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle 
      progression, and knockdown of miR-18b significantly suppressed migration in CRC
      cells. CDKN2B was identified as a target of miR-18b by high-throughput RNA
      sequencing and bioinformatics. After transfection with a miR-18b mimic,
      expression of CDKN2B was reduced significantly in CRC cells, and the effect was
      restored when a miR-18b inhibitor was transfected. A luciferase assay indicated
      miR-18b directly binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of CDKN2B. Expression 
      of CDKN2B was downregulated in patient cancer tissues and negatively correlated
      with miR-18b. In a model of ectopic expression of miR-18b and CDKN2B, CDKN2B
      overexpression antagonized the effects of miR-18b in vitro and in vivo The data
      show that miR-18b is involved in CRC carcinogenesis through targeting CDKN2B.

TI  - Systematic analysis of human cells lacking ATG8 proteins uncovers roles for

      autophagic flux.
LID - MCB.00392-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00392-17 [doi]
AB  - Selective and macro autophagy sequester specific organelles/substrates or bulk
      cytoplasm, respectively, inside autophagosomes as cargo for delivery to
      lysosomes. The mammalian ATG8 orthologues (MAP1LC3A/B/C and GABARAP/L1/L2) are
      ubiquitin (UB)-like proteins conjugated to the autophagosome membrane and are
      thought to facilitate cargo receptor recruitment, vesicle maturation, and
      lysosomal fusion. To elucidate the molecular functions of the ATG8 proteins, we
      engineered cells lacking genes for each subfamily as well as all six mammalian
      ATG8s. Loss of GABARAPs alone attenuates autophagic flux basally and in response 
      to macro or selective autophagic stimuli including PARKIN-dependent mitophagy,
      and cells lacking all ATG8 proteins accumulate cytoplasmic UB aggregates, which
      are resolved following ectopic expression of individual GABARAPs. Autophagosomes 
      from cells lacking GABARAPs had reduced lysosomal content by quantitative
      proteomics, consistent with fusion defects, but accumulated regulators of late
      endosome (LE)/autophagosome maturation. Through interaction proteomics of
      proteins accumulating in GABARAP/L1/L2-deficient cells, we identified
      C18orf8/RMC1 as a new subunit of the CCZ1-MON1 RAB7 guanine exchange factor (GEF)
      that positively regulates RAB7 recruitment to LE/autophagosomes. This work
      defines unique roles for GABARAP and LC3 subfamilies in macro and selective
      autophagy and demonstrates how analysis of autophagic machinery in the absence of
      flux can identify new regulatory circuits.

TI  - Both DNA Polymerases delta and epsilon Contact Active and Stalled Replication
      Forks Differently.

AB  - Three DNA polymerases, polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon (Pol alpha, Pol
      delta, and Pol epsilon), are responsible for eukaryotic genome duplication. When 
      DNA replication stress is encountered, DNA synthesis stalls until the stress is
      ameliorated. However, it is not known whether there is a difference in the
      association of each polymerase with active and stalled replication forks. Here,
      we show that each DNA polymerase has a distinct pattern of association with
      active and stalled replication forks. Pol alpha is enriched at extending Okazaki 
      fragments of active and stalled forks. In contrast, although Pol delta contacts
      the nascent lagging strands of active and stalled forks, it binds to only the
      matured (and not elongating) Okazaki fragments of stalled forks. Pol epsilon has 
      greater contact with the nascent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of the leading
      strand on active forks than on stalled forks. We propose that the configuration
      of DNA polymerases at stalled forks facilitates the resumption of DNA synthesis
      after stress removal.

AB  - Chromatin entry sites (CES) are 100- to 1,500-bp elements that recruit
      male-specific lethal (MSL) complexes to the X chromosome to upregulate expression
      of X-linked genes in male flies. CES contain one or more approximately 20-bp
      GA-rich sequences called MSL recognition elements (MREs) that are critical for
      dosage compensation. Recent studies indicate that CES also correspond to
      boundaries of X-chromosomal topologically associated domains (TADs). Here, we
      show that an approximately 1,000-kDa complex called the late boundary complex
      (LBC), which is required for the functioning of the Bithorax complex boundary
      Fab-7, interacts specifically with a special class of CES that contain multiple
      MREs. Mutations in the MRE sequences of three of these CES that disrupt function 
      in vivo abrogate interactions with the LBC. Moreover, reducing the levels of two 
      LBC components compromises MSL recruitment. Finally, we show that several of the 
      CES that are physically linked to each other in vivo are LBC interactors.

TI  - TRMT1-Catalyzed tRNA Modifications Are Required for Redox Homeostasis To Ensure
      Proper Cellular Proliferation and Oxidative Stress Survival.
LID - e00214-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00214-17 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1) gene have been identified as
      the cause of certain forms of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability (ID).
      However, the molecular pathology underlying ID-associated TRMT1 mutations is
      unknown, since the biological role of the encoded TRMT1 protein remains to be
      determined. Here, we have elucidated the molecular targets and function of TRMT1 
      to uncover the cellular effects of ID-causing TRMT1 mutations. Using human cells 
      that have been rendered deficient in TRMT1, we show that TRMT1 is responsible for
      catalyzing the dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) base modification in both nucleus- and
      mitochondrion-encoded tRNAs. TRMT1-deficient cells exhibit decreased
      proliferation rates, alterations in global protein synthesis, and perturbations
      in redox homeostasis, including increased endogenous ROS levels and
      hypersensitivity to oxidizing agents. Notably, ID-causing TRMT1 variants are
      unable to catalyze the formation of m2,2G due to defects in RNA binding and
      cannot rescue oxidative stress sensitivity. Our results uncover a biological role
      for TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modification in redox metabolism and show that
      individuals with TRMT1-associated ID are likely to have major perturbations in
      cellular homeostasis due to the lack of m2,2G modifications.

TI  - TIE2 Associates with Caveolae and Regulates Caveolin-1 To Promote Their Nuclear
      Translocation.
LID - e00142-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00142-17 [doi]
AB  - DNA repair pathways are aberrant in cancer, enabling tumor cells to survive
      standard therapies-chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Our group previously reported
      that, upon irradiation, the membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2
      translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates histone H4 at Tyr51, recruiting 
      ABL1 to the DNA repair complexes that participate in the nonhomologous
      end-joining pathway. However, no specific molecular mechanisms of TIE2
      endocytosis have been reported. Here, we show that irradiation or ligand-induced 
      TIE2 trafficking is dependent on caveolin-1, the main component of caveolae.
      Subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy demonstrated TIE2/caveolin-1
      complexes in the nucleus, and using inhibitor or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 
      against caveolin-1 or Tie2 inhibited their trafficking. TIE2 was found in
      caveolae and directly phosphorylated caveolin-1 at Tyr14 in vitro and in vivo
      This modification regulated the generation of TIE2/caveolin-1 complexes and was
      essential for TIE2/caveolin-1 nuclear translocation. Our data further demonstrate
      that the combination of TIE2 and caveolin-1 inhibitors resulted in significant
      radiosensitization of malignant glioma cells, which will guide the development of
      combinatorial treatment with radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma.

TI  - Unperturbed Immune Function despite Mutation of C-Terminal Tyrosines in Syk
      Previously Implicated in Signaling and Activity Regulation.
LID - e00216-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00216-17 [doi]
AB  - The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk, a central regulator of immune cell
      differentiation and activation, is a promising drug target for treatment of
      leukemia and allergic and inflammatory diseases. The clinical failure of Syk
      inhibitors underscores the importance of understanding the regulation of Syk
      function and activity. A series of previous studies emphasized the importance of 
      three C-terminal tyrosines in Syk for kinase activity regulation, as docking
      sites for downstream effector molecules, and for Ca(2+) mobilization. Here, we
      investigated the roles of these C-terminal tyrosines in the mouse. Surprisingly, 
      expression of a triple tyrosine-to-phenylalanine human Syk mutant, SYK(Y3F), was 
      not associated with discernible signaling defects either in reconstituted DT40
      cells or in B or mast cells from mice expressing SYK(Y3F) instead of wild-type
      Syk. Remarkably, lymphocyte differentiation, calcium mobilization, and
      2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP)-specific immune responses were unperturbed in SYK(Y3F)
      mice. These results emphasize the capacity of immune cells to compensate for
      specific molecular defects, likely using redundant intermolecular interactions,
      and highlight the importance of in vivo analyses for understanding cellular
      signaling mechanisms.

TI  - Mitochondrial Abnormality Facilitates Cyst Formation in Autosomal Dominant
      Polycystic Kidney Disease.

AB  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) constitutes the most common 
      inherited kidney disease. Mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, encoding
      respective polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 Ca(2+) ion channels, results in tubular 
      epithelial cell-derived renal cysts. Recent clinical studies demonstrate
      oxidative stress as present early in ADPKD. Mitochondria comprise the primary
      reactive oxygen species source and also their main effector target; however, the 
      pathophysiological role of mitochondria in ADPKD remains uncharacterized. To
      clarify this function, we examined the mitochondria of cyst-lining cells in ADPKD
      model mice (Ksp-Cre PKD1(flox/flox) ) and rats (Han:SPRD Cy/+), demonstrating
      obvious tubular cell morphological abnormalities. Notably, mitochondrial DNA copy
      number and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha
      (PGC-1alpha) expression were decreased in ADPKD model animal kidneys, with
      PGC-1alpha expression inversely correlated with oxidative stress levels.
      Consistent with these findings, human ADPKD cyst-derived cells with heterozygous 
      and homozygous PKD1 mutation exhibited morphological and functional abnormalities
      including increased mitochondrial superoxide. Furthermore, PGC-1alpha expression 
      was suppressed by decreased intracellular Ca(2+) levels via calcineurin, p38
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nitric oxide synthase deactivation. 
      Moreover, the mitochondria-specific antioxidant MitoQ reduced intracellular
      superoxide and inhibited cyst epithelial-cell proliferation through extracellular
      signal-related kinase/MAPK inactivation. Collectively, these results indicated
      mitochondrial abnormalities facilitate cyst formation in ADPKD.

TI  - Tet-Mediated DNA Demethylation Is Required for SWI/SNF-Dependent Chromatin
      Remodeling and Histone-Modifying Activities That Trigger Expression of the Sp7
      Osteoblast Master Gene during Mesenchymal Lineage Commitment.
LID - e00177-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00177-17 [doi]
AB  - Here we assess histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and DNA methylation
      processes that coordinately control the expression of the bone master
      transcription factor Sp7 (osterix) during mesenchymal lineage commitment in
      mammalian cells. We find that Sp7 gene silencing is mediated by DNA
      methyltransferase1/3 (DNMT1/3)-, histone deacetylase 1/2/4 (HDAC1/2/4)-,
      Setdb1/Suv39h1-, and Ezh1/2-containing complexes. In contrast, Sp7 gene
      activation involves changes in histone modifications, accompanied by decreased
      nucleosome enrichment and DNA demethylation mediated by SWI/SNF- and
      Tet1/Tet2-containing complexes, respectively. Inhibition of DNA methylation
      triggers changes in the histone modification profile and chromatin-remodeling
      events leading to Sp7 gene expression. Tet1/Tet2 silencing prevents Sp7
      expression during osteoblast differentiation as it impairs DNA demethylation and 
      alters the recruitment of histone methylase (COMPASS)-, histone demethylase
      (Jmjd2a/Jmjd3)-, and SWI/SNF-containing complexes to the Sp7 promoter. The
      dissection of these interconnected epigenetic mechanisms that govern Sp7 gene
      activation reveals a hierarchical process where regulatory components mediating
      DNA demethylation play a leading role.

TI  - PARN Modulates Y RNA Stability and Its 3'-End Formation.
LID - e00264-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00264-17 [doi]
AB  - Loss-of-function mutations in 3'-to-5' exoribonucleases have been implicated in
      hereditary human diseases. For example, PARN mutations cause a severe form of
      dyskeratosis congenita (DC), wherein PARN deficiency leads to human telomerase
      RNA instability. Since the DC phenotype in PARN patients is even more severe than
      that of loss-of-function alleles in telomerase components, we hypothesized that
      PARN would also be required for the stability of other RNAs. Here, we show that
      PARN depletion reduces the levels of abundant human Y RNAs, which might
      contribute to the severe phenotype of DC observed in patients. Depletion of PAPD5
      or the cytoplasmic exonuclease DIS3L rescues the effect of PARN depletion on Y
      RNA levels, suggesting that PARN stabilizes Y RNAs by removing oligoadenylated
      tails added by PAPD5, which would otherwise recruit DIS3L for Y RNA degradation. 
      Through deep sequencing of 3' ends, we provide evidence that PARN can also
      deadenylate the U6 and RMRP RNAs without affecting their levels. Moreover, we
      observed widespread posttranscriptional oligoadenylation, uridylation, and
      guanylation of U6 and Y RNA 3' ends, suggesting that in mammalian cells, the
      formation of a 3' end for noncoding RNAs can be a complex process governed by the
      activities of various 3'-end polymerases and exonucleases.

TI  - Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres Mediated by Mitotic DNA Synthesis Engages
      Break-Induced Replication Processes.
LID - e00226-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00226-17 [doi]
AB  - Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomerase-independent telomere
      maintenance mechanism that occurs in a subset of cancers. By analyzing
      telomerase-positive cells and their human TERC knockout-derived ALT human cell
      lines, we show that ALT cells harbor more fragile telomeres representing telomere
      replication problems. ALT-associated replication defects trigger mitotic DNA
      synthesis (MiDAS) at telomeres in a RAD52-dependent, but RAD51-independent,
      manner. Telomeric MiDAS is a conservative DNA synthesis process, potentially
      mediated by break-induced replication, similar to type II ALT survivors in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae Replication stresses induced by ectopic oncogenic
      expression of cyclin E, G-quadruplexes, or R-loop formation facilitate the ALT
      pathway and lead to telomere clustering, a hallmark of ALT cancers. The
      TIMELESS/TIPIN complex suppresses telomere clustering and telomeric MiDAS,
      whereas the SMC5/6 complex promotes them. In summary, ALT cells exhibit more
      telomere replication defects that result in persistent DNA damage responses at
      telomeres, leading to the engagement of telomeric MiDAS (spontaneous mitotic
      telomere synthesis) that is triggered by DNA replication stress, a potential
      driver of genomic duplications in cancer.

TI  - Acylation of Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) at K122 Governs SOD1-Mediated
      Inhibition of Mitochondrial Respiration.
LID - e00354-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00354-17 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we employed proteomics to identify mechanisms of posttranslational
      regulation on cell survival signaling proteins. We focused on Cu-Zn superoxide
      dismutase (SOD1), which protects cells from oxidative stress. We found that
      acylation of K122 on SOD1, while not impacting SOD1 catalytic activity,
      suppressed the ability of SOD1 to inhibit mitochondrial metabolism at respiratory
      complex I. We found that deacylase depletion increased K122 acylation on SOD1,
      which blocked the suppression of respiration in a K122-dependent manner. In
      addition, we found that acyl-mimicking mutations at K122 decreased SOD1
      accumulation in mitochondria, initially hinting that SOD1 may inhibit respiration
      directly within the intermembrane space (IMS). However, surprisingly, we found
      that forcing the K122 acyl mutants into the mitochondria with an IMS-targeting
      tag did not recover their ability to suppress respiration. Moreover, we found
      that suppressing or boosting respiration levels toggled SOD1 in or out of the
      mitochondria, respectively. These findings place SOD1-mediated inhibition of
      respiration upstream of its mitochondrial localization. Lastly, deletion-rescue
      experiments show that a respiration-defective mutant of SOD1 is also impaired in 
      its ability to rescue cells from toxicity caused by SOD1 deletion. Together,
      these data suggest a previously unknown interplay between SOD1 acylation,
      metabolic regulation, and SOD1-mediated cell survival.

TI  - CKS Proteins Promote Checkpoint Recovery by Stimulating Phosphorylation of
      Treslin.
LID - e00344-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00344-17 [doi]
AB  - CKS proteins are small (9-kDa) polypeptides that bind to a subset of the
      cyclin-dependent kinases. The two paralogs expressed in mammals, Cks1 and Cks2,
      share an overlapping function that is essential for early development. However,
      both proteins are frequently overexpressed in human malignancy. It has been shown
      that CKS protein overexpression overrides the replication stress checkpoint,
      promoting continued origin firing. This finding has led to the proposal that CKS 
      protein-dependent checkpoint override allows premalignant cells to evade oncogene
      stress barriers, providing a causal link to oncogenesis. Here, we provide
      mechanistic insight into how overexpression of CKS proteins promotes override of 
      the replication stress checkpoint. We show that CKS proteins greatly enhance the 
      ability of Cdk2 to phosphorylate the key replication initiation protein treslin
      in vitro Furthermore, stimulation of treslin phosphorylation does not occur by
      the canonical adapter mechanism demonstrated for other substrates, as
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) binding-defective mutants are capable of
      stimulating treslin phosphorylation. This effect is recapitulated in vivo, where 
      silencing of Cks1 and Cks2 decreases treslin phosphorylation, and overexpression 
      of wild-type or CDK binding-defective Cks2 prevents checkpoint-dependent
      dephosphorylation of treslin. Finally, we provide evidence that the role of CKS
      protein-dependent checkpoint override involves recovery from checkpoint-mediated 
      arrest of DNA replication.

TI  - Analysis of Small Critical Regions of Swi1 Conferring Prion Formation,
      Maintenance, and Transmission.
LID - e00206-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00206-17 [doi]
AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains several prion elements, which are
      epigenetically transmitted as self-perpetuating protein conformations. One such
      prion is [SWI(+) ], whose protein determinant is Swi1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF
      chromatin-remodeling complex. We previously reported that [SWI(+) ] formation
      results in a partial loss-of-function phenotype of poor growth in nonglucose
      medium and abolishment of multicellular features. We also showed that the first
      38 amino acids of Swi1 propagated [SWI(+)]. We show here that a region as small
      as the first 32 amino acids of Swi1 (Swi11-32) can decorate [SWI(+)] aggregation 
      and stably maintain and transmit [SWI(+)] independently of full-length Swi1.
      Regions smaller than Swi11-32 are either incapable of aggregation or unstably
      propagate [SWI(+)]. When fused to Sup35MC, the [PSI(+) ] determinant lacking its 
      PrD, Swi11-31 and Swi11-32 can act as transferable prion domains (PrDs). The
      resulting fusions give rise to a novel chimeric prion, [SPS(+)], exhibiting
      [PSI(+)]-like nonsense suppression. Thus, an NH2-terminal region of approximately
      30 amino acids of Swi1 contains all the necessary information for in vivo prion
      formation, maintenance, and transmission. This PrD is unique in size and
      composition: glutamine free, asparagine rich, and the smallest defined to date.
      Our findings broaden our understanding of what features allow a protein region to
      serve as a PrD.

TI  - Biochemical Regulatory Features of Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase Remain
      Conserved from Lampreys to Humans.
LID - e00077-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00077-17 [doi]
AB  - Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a genome-mutating enzyme that
      initiates class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation of antibodies in
      jawed vertebrates. We previously described the biochemical properties of human
      AID and found that it is an unusual enzyme in that it exhibits binding affinities
      for its substrate DNA and catalytic rates several orders of magnitude higher and 
      lower, respectively, than a typical enzyme. Recently, we solved the functional
      structure of AID and demonstrated that these properties are due to nonspecific
      DNA binding on its surface, along with a catalytic pocket that predominantly
      assumes a closed conformation. Here we investigated the biochemical properties of
      AID from a sea lamprey, nurse shark, tetraodon, and coelacanth: representative
      species chosen because their lineages diverged at the earliest critical junctures
      in evolution of adaptive immunity. We found that these earliest-diverged AID
      orthologs are active cytidine deaminases that exhibit unique substrate
      specificities and thermosensitivities. Significant amino acid sequence divergence
      among these AID orthologs is predicted to manifest as notable structural
      differences. However, despite major differences in sequence specificities,
      thermosensitivities, and structural features, all orthologs share the unusually
      high DNA binding affinities and low catalytic rates. This absolute conservation
      is evidence for biological significance of these unique biochemical properties.

      Neurons and Intestinal Cells.
LID - e00192-17 [pii]

AB  - Ca(2+)- and diacylglycerol (DAG)-activated protein kinase C (cPKC) promotes
      learning and behavioral plasticity. However, knowledge of in vivo regulation and 
      exact functions of cPKCs that affect behavior is limited. We show that PKC-2, a
      Caenorhabditis elegans cPKC, is essential for a complex behavior, thermotaxis. C.
      elegans memorizes a nutrient-associated cultivation temperature (Tc ) and
      migrates along the Tc within a 17 to 25 degrees C gradient. pkc-2 gene disruption
      abrogated thermotaxis; a PKC-2 transgene, driven by endogenous pkc-2 promoters,
      restored thermotaxis behavior in pkc-2(-/-) animals. Cell-specific manipulation
      of PKC-2 activity revealed that thermotaxis is controlled by cooperative
      PKC-2-mediated signaling in both AFD sensory neurons and intestinal cells.
      Cold-directed migration (cryophilic drive) precedes Tc tracking during
      thermotaxis. Analysis of temperature-directed behaviors elicited by persistent
      PKC-2 activation or inhibition in AFD (or intestine) disclosed that PKC-2
      regulates initiation and duration of cryophilic drive. In AFD neurons, PKC-2 is a
      Ca(2+) sensor and signal amplifier that operates downstream from cyclic GMP-gated
      cation channels and distal guanylate cyclases. UNC-18, which regulates
      neurotransmitter and neuropeptide release from synaptic vesicles, is a critical
      PKC-2 effector in AFD. UNC-18 variants, created by mutating Ser(311) or Ser(322),
      disrupt thermotaxis and suppress PKC-2-dependent cryophilic migration.

TI  - Cooperative Repression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor Type 2 Receptor Translation 
      by MicroRNA 195 and RNA-Binding Protein CUGBP1.
LID - e00225-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00225-17 [doi]
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor type 2 (IGF2) receptor (IGF2R) recognizes mannose
      6-phosphate-containing molecules and IGF2 and plays an important role in many
      pathophysiological processes, including gut mucosal adaptation. However, the
      mechanisms that control cellular IGF2R abundance are poorly known. MicroRNAs
      (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) critically regulate gene expression
      programs in mammalian cells by modulating the stability and translation of target
      mRNAs. Here we report that miRNA 195 (miR-195) and RBP CUG-binding protein 1
      (CUGBP1) jointly regulate IGF2R expression at the posttranscriptional level in
      intestinal epithelial cells. Both miR-195 and CUGBP1 interacted with the 3'
      untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Igf2r mRNA, and the association of CUGBP1 with
      Igf2r mRNA enhanced miR-195 binding to Igf2r mRNA. Ectopically expressed CUGBP1
      and miR-195 repressed IGF2R translation cooperatively without altering the
      stability of Igf2r mRNA. Importantly, the miR-195- and CUGBP1-repressed levels of
      cellular IGF2R led to a disruption in the structure of the trans-Golgi network.
      These findings indicate that IGF2R expression is controlled posttranscriptionally
      by two factors that associate with Igf2r mRNA and suggest that miR-195 and CUGBP1
      dampen IGF signaling by inhibiting IGF2R translation.

LID - e00082-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00082-17 [doi]
AB  - Global histone hyperacetylation is suggested to play a critical role for
      replacement of histones by transition proteins and protamines to compact the
      genome during spermiogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms for
      hyperacetylation-mediated histone replacement remains poorly understood. Here, we
      report that EPC1 and TIP60, two critical components of the mammalian nucleosome
      acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4) complexes, are coexpressed in male germ cells.
      Strikingly, genetic ablation of either Epc1 or Tip60 disrupts hyperacetylation
      and impairs histone replacement, in turn causing aberrant spermatid development. 
      Taking these observations together, we reveal an essential role of the NuA4
      complexes for histone hyperacetylation and subsequent compaction of the spermatid
      genome.

      and death at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). In this study, we show that Erf is
      required in all three waves of embryonic hematopoiesis. Mice lacking Erf in the
      embryo proper exhibited severe anemia and died around embryonic day 14.5. Erf
      epiblast-specific knockout embryos had reduced numbers of circulating blood cells
      from E9.5 onwards, with the development of severe anemia by E14.5. Elimination of
      Erf resulted in both reduced and more immature primitive erythroblasts at E9.5 to
      E10.5. Reduced definitive erythroid colony-forming activity was found in the
      bloodstream of E10.5 embryos and in the fetal liver at E11.5 to E13.5. Finally,
      elimination of Erf resulted in impaired repopulation ability, indicating that Erf
      is necessary for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance or differentiation. We
      conclude that Erf is required for both primitive and erythromyeloid progenitor
      waves of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-independent hematopoiesis as well as for
      the normal function of HSCs.

      Circular DNA Transcription by Super Elongation Complex and BRD4.

AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV reactivation during or after chemotherapy is a
      potentially fatal complication for cancer patients with chronic HBV infection.
      Transcription of HBV is a critical intermediate step of the HBV life cycle.
      However, factors controlling HBV transcription remain largely unknown. Here, we
      found that different P-TEFb complexes are involved in the transcription of the
      HBV viral genome. Both BRD4 and the super elongation complex (SEC) bind to the
      HBV genome. The treatment of bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 stimulates HBV
      transcription and increases the occupancy of BRD4 on the HBV genome, suggesting
      the bromodomain-independent recruitment of BRD4 to the HBV genome. JQ1 also leads
      to the increased binding of SEC to the HBV genome, and SEC is required for
      JQ1-induced HBV transcription. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which
      the HBV genome hijacks the host P-TEFb-containing complexes to promote its own
      transcription. Our findings also point out an important clinical implication,
      that is, the potential risk of HBV reactivation during therapy with a BRD4
      inhibitor, such as JQ1 or its analogues, which are a potential treatment for
      acute myeloid leukemia.

TI  - NRF2 Activation Impairs Quiescence and Bone Marrow Reconstitution Capacity of
      Hematopoietic Stem Cells.
LID - e00086-17 [pii]

AB  - Tissue stem cells are maintained in quiescence under physiological conditions but
      proliferate and differentiate to replenish mature cells under stressed
      conditions. The KEAP1-NRF2 system plays an essential role in stress response and 
      cytoprotection against redox disturbance. To clarify the role of the KEAP1-NRF2
      system in tissue stem cells, we focused on hematopoiesis in this study and used
      Keap1-deficient mice to examine the effects of persistent activation of NRF2 on
      long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). We found that persistent activation
      of NRF2 due to Keap1 deficiency did not change the number of LT-HSCs but reduced 
      their quiescence in steady-state hematopoiesis. During hematopoietic regeneration
      after bone marrow (BM) transplantation, persistent activation of NRF2 reduced the
      BM reconstitution capacity of LT-HSCs, suggesting that NRF2 reduces the
      quiescence of LT-HSCs and promotes their differentiation, leading to eventual
      exhaustion. Transient activation of NRF2 by an electrophilic reagent also
      promotes the entry of LT-HSCs into the cell cycle. Taken together, our findings
      show that NRF2 drives the cell cycle entry and differentiation of LT-HSCs at the 
      expense of their quiescence and maintenance, an effect that appears to be
      beneficial for prompt recovery from blood loss. We propose that the appropriate
      control of NRF2 activity by KEAP1 is essential for maintaining HSCs and
      guarantees their stress-induced regenerative response.

TI  - PRAS40 Connects Microenvironmental Stress Signaling to Exosome-Mediated
      Secretion.
LID - e00171-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00171-17 [doi]
AB  - Secreted exosomes carrying lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids conduct cell-cell 
      communications within the microenvironment of both physiological and pathological
      conditions. Exosome secretion is triggered by extracellular or intracellular
      stress signals. Little is known, however, about the signal transduction between
      stress cues and exosome secretion. To identify the linker protein, we took
      advantage of a unique finding in human keratinocytes. In these cells, although
      transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and epidermal growth factor (EGF)
      share the same EGF receptor and previously indistinguishable intracellular
      signaling networks, only TGF-alpha stimulation causes exosome-mediated secretion.
      However, deduction of EGF-activated pathways from TGFalpha-activated pathways in 
      the same cells allowed us to identify the proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa
      (PRAS40) as the unique downstream effector of TGF-alpha but not EGF signaling via
      threonine 308-phosphorylated Akt. PRAS40 knockdown (KD) or PRAS40
      dominant-negative (DN) mutant overexpression blocks not only TGF-alpha- but also 
      hypoxia- and H2O2-induced exosome secretion in a variety of normal and tumor
      cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and gene rescue studies show that Akt-mediated
      activation of PRAS40 via threonine 246 phosphorylation is both necessary and
      sufficient to cause exosome secretion without affecting the endoplasmic
      reticulum/Golgi pathway. Identification of PRAS40 as a linker protein paves the
      way for understanding how stress regulates exosome secretion under
      pathophysiological conditions.

TI  - MTORC1 Regulates both General Autophagy and Mitophagy Induction after Oxidative
      Phosphorylation Uncoupling.
LID - MCB.00441-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00441-17 [doi]
AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) is a critical negative
      regulator of general autophagy. We hypothesized that MTORC1 may specifically
      regulate autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria. To test this, we used
      cells lacking tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2 -/-), which show constitutive
      MTORC1 activation. TSC2 -/- cells show MTORC1-dependent impaired autophagic flux 
      after chemical uncoupling of mitochondria, increased mitochondrial protein aging 
      and accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 positive mitochondria. Mitochondrial autophagy
      (mitophagy) was also deficient in cells lacking TSC2, associated with altered
      expression of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARK2 translocation to uncoupled 
      mitochondria, all of which were recovered by MTORC1 inhibition or expression of
      constitutively active FoxO1. These data prove the necessity of intact MTORC1
      signaling to regulate two synergistic processes required for clearance of damaged
      mitochondria: 1) general autophagy initiation, and 2) PINK1/PARK2-mediated
      selective targeting of uncoupled mitochondria to the autophagic machinery.

TI  - Transforming Growth Factor beta/NR4A1-Inducible Breast Cancer Cell Migration and 
      Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Is p38alpha (Mitogen-Activated Protein
      Kinase 14) Dependent.
LID - e00306-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00306-17 [doi]
AB  - Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-induced migration of triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) cells is dependent on nuclear export of the orphan receptor 
      NR4A1, which plays a role in proteasome-dependent degradation of SMAD7. In this
      study, we show that TGF-beta induces p38alpha (mitogen-activated protein kinase
      14 [MAPK14]), which in turn phosphorylates NR4A1, resulting in nuclear export of 
      the receptor. TGF-beta/p38alpha and NR4A1 also play essential roles in the
      induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and induction of
      beta-catenin in TNBC cells, and these TGF-beta-induced responses and nuclear
      export of NR4A1 are blocked by NR4A1 antagonists, the p38 inhibitor SB202190, and
      kinase-dead [p38(KD)] and dominant-negative [p38(DN)] forms of p38alpha.
      Inhibition of NR4A1 nuclear export results in nuclear export of TGF-beta-induced 
      beta-catenin, which then undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation.
      TGF-beta-induced beta-catenin also regulates NR4A1 expression through formation
      of the beta-catenin-TCF-3/TCF-4/LEF-1 complex on the NR4A1 promoter. Thus,
      TGF-beta-induced nuclear export of NR4A1 in TNBC cells plays an essential role in
      cell migration, SMAD7 degradation, EMT, and induction of beta-catenin, and all of
      these pathways are inhibited by bis-indole-derived NR4A1 antagonists that inhibit
      nuclear export of the receptor and thereby block TGF-beta-induced migration and
      EMT.

AB  - Termination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts
      occurs through two alternative pathways. Termination of mRNAs is coupled to
      cleavage and polyadenylation while noncoding transcripts are terminated through
      the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) pathway in a process that is linked to RNA degradation
      by the nuclear exosome. Some mRNA transcripts are also attenuated through
      premature termination directed by the NNS complex. In this paper we present the
      results of nuclear depletion of the NNS component Nab3. As expected, many
      noncoding RNAs fail to terminate properly. In addition, we observe that nitrogen 
      catabolite-repressed genes are upregulated by Nab3 depletion.

      Determined by Mortalin/HSPA9 and Protein Phosphatase 1 Alpha in KRAS and BRAF
      Tumor Cells.
LID - e00061-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00061-17 [doi]
AB  - Although deregulation of MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity
      is a key feature in cancer, high-magnitude MEK/ERK activity can paradoxically
      induce growth inhibition. Therefore, additional mechanisms may exist to modulate 
      MEK/ERK activity in favor of tumor cell proliferation. We previously reported
      that mortalin/HSPA9 can facilitate proliferation of certain KRAS and BRAF tumor
      cells by modulating MEK/ERK activity. In this study, we demonstrated that
      mortalin can regulate MEK/ERK activity via protein phosphatase 1alpha (PP1alpha).
      We found that PP1alpha inhibition increases steady-state levels of phosphorylated
      MEK1/2 in various tumor cells expressing B-Raf(V600E) or K-Ras(G12C/D)
      Intriguingly, coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays revealed that
      mortalin facilitates PP1alpha-mediated MEK1/2 dephosphorylation by promoting
      PP1alpha-MEK1/2 interaction in an ATP-sensitive manner. The region spanning
      Val482 to Glu491 in the substrate-binding cavity and the substrate lid of
      mortalin were necessary for these physical interactions, which is consistent with
      conventional heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)-client interaction mechanisms.
      Nevertheless, mortalin depletion did not affect cellular PP1alpha levels or its
      regulatory phosphorylation, suggesting a nonconventional role for mortalin in
      promoting PP1alpha-MEK1/2 interaction. Of note, PP1alpha was upregulated in human
      melanoma and pancreatic cancer biopsy specimens in correlation with mortalin
      upregulation. PP1alpha may therefore have a role in tumorigenesis in concert with
      mortalin, which affects MEK/ERK activity in tumor cells.

TI  - Mammalian ECD Protein Is a Novel Negative Regulator of the PERK Arm of the
      Unfolded Protein Response.
LID - e00030-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00030-17 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian Ecdysoneless (ECD) is a highly conserved ortholog of the DrosophilaEcd 
      gene product whose mutations impair the synthesis of Ecdysone and produce
      cell-autonomous survival defects, but the mechanisms by which ECD functions are
      largely unknown. Here we present evidence that ECD regulates the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) stress response. ER stress induction led to a reduced ECD protein 
      level, but this effect was not seen in PKR-like ER kinase knockout (PERK-KO) or
      phosphodeficient eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha)
      mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs); moreover, ECD mRNA levels were increased,
      suggesting impaired ECD translation as the mechanism for reduced protein levels. 
      ECD colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with PERK and GRP78. ECD depletion
      increased the levels of both phospho-PERK (p-PERK) and p-eIF2alpha, and these
      effects were enhanced upon ER stress induction. Reciprocally, overexpression of
      ECD led to marked decreases in p-PERK, p-eIF2alpha, and ATF4 levels but robust
      increases in GRP78 protein levels. However, GRP78 mRNA levels were unchanged,
      suggesting a posttranscriptional event. Knockdown of GRP78 reversed the
      attenuating effect of ECD overexpression on PERK signaling. Significantly,
      overexpression of ECD provided a survival advantage to cells upon ER stress
      induction. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ECD promotes survival upon
      ER stress by increasing GRP78 protein levels to enhance the adaptive folding
      protein in the ER to attenuate PERK signaling.

TI  - Long Noncoding RNA JHDM1D-AS1 Promotes Tumor Growth by Regulating Angiogenesis in
      Response to Nutrient Starvation.
LID - e00125-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00125-17 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs play a pivotal role in tumor progression, but their role in
      cancer cells in the nutrient-starved tumor microenvironment remains unknown.
      Here, we show that a nutrient starvation-responsive long noncoding RNA, JHDM1D
      antisense 1 (JHDM1D-AS1), promotes tumorigenesis by regulating angiogenesis in
      response to nutrient starvation. Expression of JHDM1D-AS1 was increased in cancer
      cells. In addition, expression of JHDM1D-AS1 was increased in clinical tumor
      samples compared to that in normal tissue. Stable expression of JHDM1D-AS1 in
      human pancreatic cancer (PANC-1 and AsPC-1) cells promoted cell growth in vitro
      Remarkably, these JHDM1D-AS1-expressing cells showed a significant increase in
      tumor growth in vivo that was associated with increased formation of CD31(+)
      blood vessels and elevated infiltration of CD11b(+) macrophage lineage cells into
      tumor tissues. Genome-wide analysis of tumor xenografts revealed that expression 
      of genes for tumor-derived angiogenic factors such as hHGF and hFGF1 concomitant 
      with host-derived inflammation-responsive genes such as mMmp3, mMmp9, mS100a8,
      and mS100a9 was increased in tumor xenografts of JHDM1D-AS1-expressing pancreatic
      cancer cells, leading to a poor prognosis. Our results provide evidence that
      increased JHDM1D-AS1 expression under nutrient starvation accelerates tumor
      growth by upregulating angiogenesis, thus laying the foundation for improved
      therapeutic strategies.

TI  - DeSUMOylation of Gli1 by SENP1 Attenuates Sonic Hedgehog Signaling.
LID - e00579-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00579-16 [doi]
AB  - The transcriptional output of the Sonic Hedgehog morphogenic pathway is
      orchestrated by three Kruppel family transcription factors, Gli1 to -3, which
      undergo extensive posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination and
      SUMOylation. Here, we report that the sentrin-specific peptidase SENP1 is the
      specific deSUMOylation enzyme for Gli1. We show that SUMOylation stabilizes Gli1 
      by competing with ubiquitination at conserved lysine residues and that SUMOylated
      Gli1 is enriched in the nucleus, suggesting that SUMOylation is a nuclear
      localization signal for Gli1. Finally, we show that small interfering RNA
      (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of SENP1 augments the ability of Shh to sustain the
      proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors, demonstrating the
      physiological significance of the negative regulation of Shh signaling by SENP1.

TI  - RNF20 Suppresses Tumorigenesis by Inhibiting SREBP1c-PTTG1 Axis in Kidney Cancer.
LID - MCB.00265-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00265-17 [doi]
AB  - Elevated lipid metabolism promotes cancer cell proliferation. Clear cell renal
      cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of kidney cancers,
      characterized by ectopic lipid accumulation. However, the relationship between
      aberrant lipid metabolism and tumorigenesis in ccRCC is not thoroughly
      understood. Here, we demonstrate that ring finger protein 20 (RNF20) acts as a
      tumor suppressor in ccRCC. RNF20 overexpression repressed lipogenesis and cell
      proliferation by inhibiting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c
      (SREBP1c), and SREBP1 suppression by either knockdown or the pharmacological
      inhibitor betulin attenuated proliferation and cell cycle progression in ccRCC
      cells. Notably, SREBP1c regulates cell cycle progression by inducing the
      expression of pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), a novel target gene of
      SREBP1c. Furthermore, RNF20 overexpression reduced tumor growth and lipid storage
      in xenografts. In ccRCC patients, RNF20 downregulation and SREBP1 activation are 
      markers of poor prognosis. Therefore, RNF20 suppresses tumorigenesis in ccRCC by 
      inhibiting the SREBP1c-PTTG1 axis.

      in p21 Checkpoint-Proficient Human Cells.
LID - e00569-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00569-16 [doi]
AB  - The Ki-67 protein is widely used as a tumor proliferation marker. However,
      whether Ki-67 affects cell cycle progression has been controversial. Here we
      demonstrate that depletion of Ki-67 in human hTERT-RPE1, WI-38, IMR90, and
      hTERT-BJ cell lines and primary fibroblast cells slowed entry into S phase and
      coordinately downregulated genes related to DNA replication. Some gene expression
      changes were partially relieved in Ki-67-depleted hTERT-RPE1 cells by codepletion
      of the Rb checkpoint protein, but more thorough suppression of the
      transcriptional and cell cycle defects was observed upon depletion of the cell
      cycle inhibitor p21. Notably, induction of p21 upon depletion of Ki-67 was a
      consistent hallmark of cell types in which transcription and cell cycle
      distribution were sensitive to Ki-67; these responses were absent in cells that
      did not induce p21. Furthermore, upon Ki-67 depletion, a subset of inactive X
      (Xi) chromosomes in female hTERT-RPE1 cells displayed several features of
      compromised heterochromatin maintenance, including decreased H3K27me3 and
      H4K20me1 labeling. These chromatin alterations were limited to Xi chromosomes
      localized away from the nuclear lamina and were not observed in
      checkpoint-deficient 293T cells. Altogether, our results indicate that Ki-67
      integrates normal S-phase progression and Xi heterochromatin maintenance in p21
      checkpoint-proficient human cells.

TI  - Obesity and p16(INK4A) Downregulation Activate Breast Adipocytes and Promote
      Their Protumorigenicity.
LID - e00101-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00101-17 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for breast cancer
      development. However, the molecular basis of obesity-related breast
      carcinogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we have shown that obesity reduces
      the level of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4A) protein in breast adipocytes, which 
      showed active features and strong procarcinogenic potential both in vitro and in 
      orthotopic tumor xenografts compared to mature adipocytes from lean women.
      Furthermore, obesity triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
      breast ductal epithelial cells. Interestingly, specific downregulation of
      p16(INK4A) increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines,
      including leptin, and activated breast adipocytes from lean women. Consequently, 
      like breast adipocytes from obese women, p16-deficient adipocytes induced EMT in 
      normal primary breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent manner and enhanced
      tumor growth. Additionally, we have shown that p16(INK4A) negatively controls
      leptin at the mRNA level through microRNAs 141 and 146b-5p (miR-141 and
      miR-146b-5p), which bind the leptin mRNA at a specific sequence in the 3'
      untranslated region (UTR). These results show that obesity activates breast
      stromal adipocytes through p16 downregulation, which upregulates leptin and
      promotes procarcinogenic processes.

TI  - Synthetic Deletion of the Interleukin 23 Receptor (IL-23R) Stalk Region Led to
      Autonomous IL-23R Homodimerization and Activation.
LID - e00014-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00014-17 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin 23 (IL-23) regulates the development of TH17 cells, which are
      important for antimicrobial and antifungal responses and autoimmune and chronic
      inflammatory diseases. IL-23-induced Jak/STAT signaling is mediated via the
      heterodimeric IL-23 receptor (IL-23R)-IL-12 receptor beta1 (IL-12Rbeta1) complex.
      The typical signal-transducing receptor of the IL-6/IL-12 family contains three
      extracellular-membrane-proximal fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, which are
      not involved in cytokine binding but are mandatory for signal transduction. In
      place of FNIII-type domains, IL-23R has a structurally undefined stalk. We
      hypothesized that the IL-23R stalk acts as a spacer to position the cytokine
      binding domains at a defined distance from the plasma membrane to enable signal
      transduction. Minor deletions of the murine, but not of the human, IL-23R stalk
      resulted in unresponsiveness to IL-23. Complete deletion of the human IL-23R
      stalk and the extended murine IL-23R stalk, including a 20-amino-acid-long
      duplication of domain 3, however, induced ligand-independent, autonomous receptor
      activation, as determined by STAT3 phosphorylation and cell proliferation.
      Ligand-independent, autonomous activity was caused by IL-23R homodimers and was
      independent of IL-12Rbeta1. Our data show that deletion of the stalk results in
      biologically active IL-23R homodimers, thereby creating an as-yet-undescribed
      receptor complex of the IL-6/IL-12 cytokine family.

TI  - T-Cell Intracellular Antigens and Hu Antigen R Antagonistically Modulate
      Mitochondrial Activity and Dynamics by Regulating Optic Atrophy 1 Gene
      Expression.
LID - e00174-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00174-17 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria undergo frequent morphological changes to control their function. We
      show here that T-cell intracellular antigens (TIA1b/TIARb) and Hu antigen R (HuR)
      have antagonistic roles in mitochondrial function by modulating the expression of
      mitochondrial shaping proteins. Expression of TIA1b/TIARb alters the
      mitochondrial dynamic network by enhancing fission and clustering, which is
      accompanied by a decrease in respiration. In contrast, HuR expression promotes
      fusion and cristae remodeling and increases respiratory activity.
      Mechanistically, TIA proteins downregulate the expression of optic atrophy 1
      (OPA1) protein via switching of the splicing patterns of OPA1 to facilitate the
      production of OPA1 variant 5 (OPA1v5). Conversely, HuR enhances the expression of
      OPA1 mRNA isoforms through increasing steady-state levels and targeting
      translational efficiency at the 3' untranslated region. Knockdown of TIA1/TIAR or
      HuR partially reversed the expression profile of OPA1, whereas knockdown of OPA1 
      or overexpression of OPA1v5 provoked mitochondrial clustering. Middle-term
      expression of TIA1b/TIARb triggers reactive oxygen species production and
      mitochondrial DNA damage, which is accompanied by mitophagy, autophagy, and
      apoptosis. In contrast, HuR expression promotes mitochondrion-dependent cell
      proliferation. Collectively, these results provide molecular insights into the
      antagonistic functions of TIA1b/TIARb and HuR in mitochondrial activity dynamics 
      and suggest that their balance might contribute to mitochondrial physiopathology.

TI  - Multitiered and Cooperative Surveillance of Mitochondrial Phosphatidylserine
      Decarboxylase 1.
LID - e00049-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00049-17 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p), an ancient enzyme that converts
      phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner mitochondrial
      membrane, must undergo an autocatalytic self-processing event to gain activity.
      Autocatalysis severs the protein into a large membrane-anchored beta subunit that
      noncovalently associates with the small alpha subunit on the intermembrane space 
      side of the inner membrane. Here, we determined that a temperature sensitive (ts)
      PSD1 allele is autocatalytically impaired and that its fidelity is closely
      monitored throughout its life cycle by multiple mitochondrial quality control
      proteases. Interestingly, the proteases involved in resolving misfolded Psd1(ts) 
      vary depending on its autocatalytic status. Specifically, the degradation of a
      Psd1(ts) precursor unable to undergo autocatalysis requires the unprecedented
      cooperative and sequential actions of two inner membrane proteases, Oma1p and
      Yme1p. In contrast, upon heat exposure postautocatalysis, Psd1(ts) beta subunits 
      accumulate in protein aggregates that are resolved by Yme1p acting alone, while
      the released alpha subunit is degraded in parallel by an unidentified protease.
      Importantly, the stability of endogenous Psd1p is also influenced by Yme1p. We
      conclude that Psd1p, the key enzyme required for the mitochondrial pathway of
      phosphatidylethanolamine production, is closely monitored at several levels and
      by multiple mitochondrial quality control mechanisms present in the intermembrane
      space.

TI  - Cadmium Causes Misfolding and Aggregation of Cytosolic Proteins in Yeast.
LID - e00490-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00490-16 [doi]
AB  - Cadmium is a highly poisonous metal and is classified as a human carcinogen.
      While its toxicity is undisputed, the underlying in vivo molecular mechanisms are
      not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that cadmium induces aggregation of
      cytosolic proteins in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Cadmium primarily
      targets proteins in the process of synthesis or folding, probably by interacting 
      with exposed thiol groups in not-yet-folded proteins. On the basis of in vitro
      and in vivo data, we show that cadmium-aggregated proteins form seeds that
      increase the misfolding of other proteins. Cells that cannot efficiently protect 
      the proteome from cadmium-induced aggregation or clear the cytosol of protein
      aggregates are sensitized to cadmium. Thus, protein aggregation may contribute to
      cadmium toxicity. This is the first report on how cadmium causes misfolding and
      aggregation of cytosolic proteins in vivo The proposed mechanism might explain
      not only the molecular basis of the toxic effects of cadmium but also the
      suggested role of this poisonous metal in the pathogenesis of certain
      protein-folding disorders.

TI  - Multiplication of Ribosomal P-Stalk Proteins Contributes to the Fidelity of
      Translation.
LID - e00060-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00060-17 [doi]
AB  - The P-stalk represents a vital element within the ribosomal GTPase-associated
      center, which represents a landing platform for translational GTPases. The
      eukaryotic P-stalk exists as a uL10-(P1-P2)2 pentameric complex, which contains
      five identical C-terminal domains, one within each protein, and the presence of
      only one such element is sufficient to stimulate factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis 
      in vitro and to sustain cell viability. The functional contribution of the
      P-stalk to the performance of the translational machinery in vivo, especially the
      role of P-protein multiplication, has never been explored. Here, we show that
      ribosomes depleted of P1/P2 proteins exhibit reduced translation fidelity at
      elongation and termination steps. The elevated rate of the decoding error is
      inversely correlated with the number of the P-proteins present on the ribosome.
      Unexpectedly, the lack of P1/P2 has little effect in vivo on the efficiency of
      other translational GTPase (trGTPase)-dependent steps of protein synthesis,
      including translocation. We have shown that loss of accuracy of decoding caused
      by P1/P2 depletion is the major cause of translation slowdown, which in turn
      affects the metabolic fitness of the yeast cell. We postulate that the
      multiplication of P-proteins is functionally coupled with the qualitative aspect 
      of ribosome action, i.e., the recoding phenomenon shaping the cellular proteome.

TI  - FOXN1 Transcription Factor in Epithelial Growth and Wound Healing.
LID - e00110-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00110-17 [doi]
AB  - FOXN1 is a prodifferentiation transcription factor in the skin epithelium.
      Recently, it has also emerged as an important player in controlling the skin
      wound healing process, as it actively participates in reepithelialization and is 
      thought to be responsible for scar formation. FOXN1 positivity is also a feature 
      of pigmented keratinocytes, including nevi, and FOXN1 is an attribute of benign
      epithelial tumors. The lack of FOXN1 favors the skin regeneration process
      displayed by nude mice, pointing to FOXN1 as a switch between regeneration and
      reparative processes. The stem cell niche provides a functional source of cells
      after the loss of tissue following wounding. The involvement of
      prodifferentiation factors in the regulation of this pool of stem cells is
      suggested. However, the exact mechanism is still under question, and we speculate
      that the FOXN1 transcription factor is involved in this process. This review
      analyzes the pleiotropic effects of FOXN1 in the skin, its function in the
      tumorigenesis process, and its potential role in depletion of the stem cell niche
      after injury, as well as its suggested mechanistic role, acting in a
      cell-autonomous and a non-cell-autonomous manner during skin self-renewal.

TI  - CLEAVAGE ALTERS THE MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF PROTEIN KINASE C-delta CATALYTIC
      ACTIVITY.
LID - MCB.00324-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00324-17 [doi]
AB  - Protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) is an allosterically-activated enzyme that acts 
      much like other PKC isoforms to transduce growth factor-dependent signaling
      responses. However, PKCdelta is unique in that activation loop (Thr(507))
      phosphorylation is not required for catalytic activity. Since PKCdelta can be
      proteolytically-cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, the prevailing assumption 
      has been that the kinase domain fragment (deltaKD) freed from autoinhibitory
      constraints imposed by the regulatory domain is catalytically competent - and
      that Thr(507) phosphorylation is not required for deltaKD activity. This study
      provides a counter-narrative showing that deltaKD activity is regulated through
      Thr(507) phosphorylation. We show that Thr(507)-phosphorylated deltaKD is
      catalytically active - and not phosphorylated at Ser(359) in its ATP-positioning 
      G-loop. In contrast, a deltaKD fragment that is not phosphorylated at Thr(507)
      (which accumulates in doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes) displays decreased
      C-tail priming site phosphorylation, increased G-loop Ser(359) phosphorylation,
      and defective kinase activity. deltaKD is not a substrate for Src, but Src
      phosphorylates deltaKD-T507A at Tyr(334) (in the newly exposed deltaKD
      N-terminus) and this (or a S359A substitution) rescues deltaKD-T507A catalytic
      activity. These results expose a unique role for deltaKD-Thr(507) phosphorylation
      (that does not apply to full-length PKCdelta) to structurally organize diverse
      elements within the enzyme that critically regulate catalytic activity.

TI  - Gle1 regulates RNA binding of the DEAD-box helicase Ded1 in its complex role in
      translation initiation.
LID - MCB.00139-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00139-17 [doi]
AB  - DEAD-box proteins (DBPs) are required in gene expression to facilitate changes to
      ribonucleoprotein complexes, but the cellular mechanisms and regulation of DBPs
      are not fully defined. Gle1 is a multifunctional regulator of DBPs with roles in 
      mRNA export and translation. In translation, Gle1 modulates Ded1, a DBP required 
      for initiation. However, DED1 overexpression causes defects, suggesting that Ded1
      can promote or repress translation in different contexts. Here we show that GLE1 
      expression suppresses the repressive effects of DED1 in vivo, and Gle1
      counteracts Ded1 in translation assays in vitro Furthermore, Ded1 and Gle1 both
      affect assembly of pre-initiation complexes. Through mutation analysis and
      binding assays, we show that Gle1 inhibits Ded1 by reducing its affinity for RNA.
      Our results are consistent with a model wherein active Ded1 promotes translation,
      but inactive or excess Ded1 leads to translation repression. Gle1 can inhibit
      either role of Ded1, positioning it as a gatekeeper to optimize Ded1 activity to 
      the appropriate level for translation. This study suggests a paradigm for finely 
      controlling the activity of DEAD-box proteins to optimize their function in
      RNA-based processes. It also positions the versatile regulator Gle1 as a
      potential node for the coordination of different steps of gene expression.

TI  - Targeting Oxygen-Sensing Prolyl Hydroxylase for Metformin-Associated Lactic
      Acidosis Treatment.
LID - e00248-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00248-17 [doi]
AB  - Metformin is one of the most widely used therapeutics for type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and also has anticancer and antiaging properties. However, it is known
      to induce metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), a severe medical condition
      with poor prognosis, especially in individuals with renal dysfunction. Inhibition
      of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) is known to activate the transcription factor
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) that increases lactate efflux as a result of
      enhanced glycolysis, but it also enhances gluconeogenesis from lactate in the
      liver that contributes to reducing circulating lactate levels. Here, we
      investigated the outcome of pharmaceutical inhibition of PHD in mice with MALA
      induced through the administration of metformin per os and an intraperitoneal
      injection of lactic acid. We found that the PHD inhibitors significantly
      increased the expression levels of genes involved in gluconeogenesis in the liver
      and the kidney and significantly improved the survival of mice with MALA.
      Furthermore, the PHD inhibitor also improved the rate of survival of MALA induced
      in mice with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thus, PHD represents a new therapeutic
      target for MALA, which is a critical complication of metformin therapy.

      Neurogenesis.
LID - e00201-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00201-17 [doi]
AB  - Sox2 is known to be important for neuron formation, but the precise mechanism
      through which it activates a neurogenic program and how this differs from its
      well-established function in self-renewal of stem cells remain elusive. In this
      study, we identified a highly conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)
      phosphorylation site on serine 39 (S39) in Sox2. In neural stem cells (NSCs),
      phosphorylation of S39 enhances the ability of Sox2 to negatively regulate
      neuronal differentiation, while loss of phosphorylation is necessary for
      chromatin retention of a truncated form of Sox2 generated during neurogenesis. We
      further demonstrated that nonphosphorylated cleaved Sox2 specifically induces the
      expression of proneural genes and promotes neurogenic commitment in vivo Our
      present study sheds light on how the level of Cdk kinase activity directly
      regulates Sox2 to tip the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in
      NSCs.

TI  - Acetylation of Cavin-1 Promotes Lipolysis in White Adipose Tissue.
LID - e00058-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00058-17 [doi]
AB  - White adipose tissue (WAT) serves as a reversible energy storage depot in the
      form of lipids in response to nutritional status. Cavin-1, an essential component
      in the biogenesis of caveolae, is a positive regulator of lipolysis in
      adipocytes. However, molecular mechanisms of cavin-1 in the modulation of
      lipolysis remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that cavin-1 was acetylated
      at lysines 291, 293, and 298 (3K), which were under nutritional regulation in
      WAT. We further identified GCN5 as the acetyltransferase and Sirt1 as the
      deacetylase of cavin-1. Acetylation-mimetic 3Q mutants of cavin-1 augmented fat
      mobilization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and zebrafish. Mechanistically, acetylated
      cavin-1 preferentially interacted with hormone-sensitive lipase and recruited it 
      to the caveolae, thereby promoting lipolysis. Our findings shed light on the
      essential role of cavin-1 in regulating lipolysis in an acetylation-dependent
      manner in WAT.

TI  - RNA Binding Protein CUGBP1 Inhibits Liver Cancer in a Phosphorylation-Dependent
      Manner.
LID - e00128-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00128-17 [doi]
AB  - Despite intensive investigations, mechanisms of liver cancer are not known. Here,
      we identified an important step of liver cancer, which is the neutralization of
      tumor suppressor activities of an RNA binding protein, CUGBP1. The translational 
      activity of CUGBP1 is activated by dephosphorylation at Ser302. We generated
      CUGBP1-S302A knock-in mice and found that the reduction of translational activity
      of CUGBP1 causes development of a fatty liver phenotype in young S302A mice.
      Examination of liver cancer in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated CUGBP1-S302A mice
      showed these mice develop much more severe liver cancer that is associated with
      elimination of the mutant CUGBP1. Searching for mechanisms of this elimination,
      we found that the oncoprotein gankyrin (Gank) preferentially binds to and
      triggers degradation of dephosphorylated CUGBP1 (de-ph-S302-CUGBP1) or S302A
      mutant CUGBP1. To test the role of Gank in degradation of CUGBP1, we generated
      mice with liver-specific deletion of Gank. In these mice, the tumor suppressor
      isoform of CUGBP1 is protected from Gank-mediated degradation. Consistent with
      reduction of CUGBP1 in animal models, CUGBP1 is reduced in patients with
      pediatric liver cancer. Thus, this work presents evidence that de-ph-S302-CUGBP1 
      is a tumor suppressor protein and that the Gank-UPS-mediated reduction of CUGBP1 
      is a key event in the development of liver cancer.

TI  - Bypass of Activation Loop Phosphorylation by Aspartate 836 in Activation of the
      Endoribonuclease Activity of Ire1.
LID - e00655-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00655-16 [doi]
AB  - The bifunctional protein kinase-endoribonuclease Ire1 initiates splicing of the
      mRNA for the transcription factor Hac1 when unfolded proteins accumulate in the
      endoplasmic reticulum. Activation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1 coincides with
      autophosphorylation of its activation loop at S840, S841, T844, and S850. Mass
      spectrometric analysis of Ire1 expressed in Escherichia coli identified S837 as
      another potential phosphorylation site in vivo Mutation of all five potential
      phosphorylation sites in the activation loop decreased, but did not completely
      abolish, splicing of HAC1 mRNA, induction of KAR2 and PDI1 mRNAs, and expression 
      of a beta-galactosidase reporter activated by Hac1(i) Phosphorylation site
      mutants survive low levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress better than IRE1
      deletions strains. In vivo clustering and inactivation of Ire1 are not affected
      by phosphorylation site mutants. Mutation of D836 to alanine in the activation
      loop of phosphorylation site mutants nearly completely abolished HAC1 splicing,
      induction of KAR2, PDI1, and beta-galactosidase reporters, and survival of ER
      stress, but it had no effect on clustering of Ire1. By itself, the D836A mutation
      does not confer a phenotype. These data argue that D836 can partially substitute 
      for activation loop phosphorylation in activation of the endoribonuclease domain 
      of Ire1.

TI  - Efficient and Accurate Translation Initiation Directed by TISU Involves RPS3 and 
      RPS10e Binding and Differential Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 1A Regulation.
LID - e00150-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00150-17 [doi]
AB  - Canonical translation initiation involves ribosomal scanning, but short 5'
      untranslated region (5'UTR) mRNAs are translated in a scanning-independent
      manner. The extent and mechanism of scanning-independent translation are not
      fully understood. Here we report that short 5'UTR mRNAs constitute a substantial 
      fraction of the translatome. Short 5'UTR mRNAs are enriched with TISU
      (translation initiator of short 5'UTR), a 12-nucleotide element directing
      efficient scanning-independent translation. Comprehensive mutagenesis revealed
      that each AUG codon-flanking nucleotide of TISU contributes to translational
      strength, but only a few are important for accuracy. Using site-specific UV
      cross-linking of ribosomal complexes assembled on TISU mRNA, we demonstrate
      specific binding of TISU to ribosomal proteins at the E and A sites. We
      identified RPS3 as the major TISU binding protein in the 48S complex A site. Upon
      80S complex formation, RPS3 interaction is weakened and switched to RPS10e
      (formerly called RPS10). We further demonstrate that TISU is particularly
      dependent on eukaryotic initiation factor 1A (eIF1A) which interacts with both
      RPS3 and RPS10e. Our findings suggest that the cap-recruited ribosome
      specifically binds the TISU nucleotides at the A and E sites in cooperation with 
      eIF1A to promote scanning arrest.

TI  - CD9 Regulates Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Trafficking in
      Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells.
LID - e00202-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00202-17 [doi]
AB  - Antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) stimulates naive CD4(+) T cells,
      triggering T cell activation and the adaptive arm of the immune response. Newly
      synthesized major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules
      accumulate at MHC-II-enriched endosomal compartments and are transported to the
      plasma membrane of DCs after binding to antigenic peptides to enable antigen
      presentation. In DCs, MHC-II molecules are included in tetraspanin-enriched
      microdomains (TEMs). However, the role of tetraspanin CD9 in these processes
      remains largely undefined. Here, we show that CD9 regulates the T
      cell-stimulatory capacity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF)-dependent bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), without affecting antigen
      presentation by fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L)-dependent BMDCs. CD9
      knockout (KO) GM-CSF-dependent BMDCs, which resemble monocyte-derived DCs
      (MoDCs), induce lower levels of T cell activation than wild-type DCs, and this
      effect is related to a reduction in MHC-II surface expression in CD9-deficient
      MoDCs. Importantly, MHC-II targeting to the plasma membrane is largely impaired
      in immature CD9 KO MoDCs, in which MHC-II remains arrested in acidic
      intracellular compartments enriched in LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membrane
      protein 1), and MHC-II internalization is also blocked. Moreover, CD9
      participates in MHC-II trafficking in mature MoDCs, regulating its endocytosis
      and recycling. Our results demonstrate that the tetraspanin CD9 specifically
      regulates antigenic presentation in MoDCs through the regulation of MHC-II
      intracellular trafficking.

TI  - Triptolide-Assisted Phosphorylation of p53 Suppresses Inflammation-Induced
      NF-kappaB Survival Pathways in Cancer Cells.
LID - e00149-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00149-17 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation plays important roles in cancer initiation and progression. 
      Resolving chronic inflammation or blocking inflammatory signal transduction may
      prevent cancer development. Here, we report that the combined low-dose use of two
      anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin and triptolide, reduces spontaneous lung cancer 
      incidence from 70% to 10% in a mouse model. Subsequent studies reveal that such
      treatment has little effect on resolving chronic inflammatory conditions in the
      lung, but it significantly blocks the NF-kappaB-mediated expression of
      proliferation and survival genes in cancer cells. Furthermore, triptolide and
      aspirin induce distinct mechanisms to potentiate each other to block NF-kappaB
      nuclear localization stimulated by inflammatory cytokines. While aspirin directly
      inhibits IkappaB kinases (IKKs) to phosphorylate IkappaBalpha for NF-kappaB
      activation, triptolide does not directly target IKKs or other factors that
      mediate IKK activation. Instead, it requires p53 to inhibit IkappaBalpha
      phosphorylation and degradation. Triptolide binds to and activates p38alpha and
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which phosphorylate and
      stabilize p53. Subsequently, p53 competes with IkappaBalpha for substrate binding
      to IKKbeta and thereby blocks IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and NF-kappaB nuclear 
      translocation. Inhibition of p38alpha and ERK1/2 or p53 mutations could abolish
      the inhibitory effects of triptolide on NF-kappaB. Our study defines a new
      p53-dependent mechanism for blocking NF-kappaB survival pathways in cancer cells.

TI  - Obesity-Linked Phosphorylation of SIRT1 by Casein Kinase 2 Inhibits Its Nuclear
      Localization and Promotes Fatty Liver.
LID - e00006-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00006-17 [doi]
AB  - Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) deacetylase delays and improves many obesity-related diseases,
      including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes, and has received
      great attention as a drug target. SIRT1 function is aberrantly low in obesity, so
      understanding the underlying mechanisms is important for drug development. Here, 
      we show that obesity-linked phosphorylation of SIRT1 inhibits its function and
      promotes pathological symptoms of NAFLD. In proteomic analysis, Ser-164 was
      identified as a major serine phosphorylation site in SIRT1 in obese, but not
      lean, mice, and this phosphorylation was catalyzed by casein kinase 2 (CK2), the 
      levels of which were dramatically elevated in obesity. Mechanistically,
      phosphorylation of SIRT1 at Ser-164 substantially inhibited its nuclear
      localization and modestly affected its deacetylase activity. Adenovirus-mediated 
      liver-specific expression of SIRT1 or a phosphor-defective S164A-SIRT1 mutant
      promoted fatty acid oxidation and ameliorated liver steatosis and glucose
      intolerance in diet-induced obese mice, but these beneficial effects were not
      observed in mice expressing a phosphor-mimic S164D-SIRT1 mutant. Remarkably,
      phosphorylated S164-SIRT1 and CK2 levels were also highly elevated in liver
      samples of NAFLD patients and correlated with disease severity. Thus, inhibition 
      of phosphorylation of SIRT1 by CK2 may serve as a new therapeutic approach for
      treatment of NAFLD and other obesity-related diseases.

TI  - Systemic Activation of NRF2 Alleviates Lethal Autoimmune Inflammation in Scurfy
      Mice.
LID - e00063-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00063-17 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2) plays
      crucial roles in the defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and mediates
      anti-inflammatory actions under various pathological conditions. Recent studies
      showed that the dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is directly linked to
      the initiation and progression of various autoimmune diseases. To determine the
      Treg-independent impact of NRF2 activation on autoimmune inflammation, we
      examined scurfy (Sf) mice, which are deficient in Tregs and succumb to severe
      multiorgan inflammation by 4 weeks of age. We found that systemic activation of
      NRF2 by Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) knockdown ameliorated tissue 
      inflammation and lethality in Sf mice. Activated T cells and their cytokine
      production were accordingly decreased by Keap1 knockdown. In contrast, NRF2
      activation through cell lineage-specific Keap1 disruption (i.e., in T cells,
      myeloid cells, and dendritic cells) achieved only partial or no improvement in
      the inflammatory status of Sf mice. Our results indicate that systemic activation
      of NRF2 suppresses effector T cell activities independently of Tregs and that
      NRF2 activation in multiple cell lineages appears to be required for sufficient
      anti-inflammatory effects. This study emphasizes the possible therapeutic
      application of NRF2 inducers in autoimmune diseases that are accompanied by Treg 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Tfe3 and Tfeb Transcriptionally Regulate Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated
      Receptor gamma2 Expression in Adipocytes and Mediate Adiponectin and Glucose
      Levels in Mice.
LID - e00608-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00608-16 [doi]
AB  - Members of the MiT transcription factor family are pivotal regulators of several 
      lineage-selective differentiation programs. We show that two of these, Tfeb and
      Tfe3, control the regulator of adipogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma2 (Ppargamma2). Knockdown of Tfeb or Tfe3 expression during in
      vitro adipogenesis causes dramatic downregulation of Ppargamma2 expression as
      well as adipogenesis. Additionally, we found that these factors regulate
      Ppargamma2 in mature adipocytes. Next, we demonstrated that Tfeb and Tfe3 act
      directly by binding to consensus E-boxes within the Ppargamma transcriptional
      regulatory region. This transcriptional control also exists in vivo, as we
      discovered that wild-type mice in the fed state increased their expression of
      Tfe3, Tf3b, and Ppargamma in white adipose tissue. Furthermore, Tfe3 knockout
      (Tfe3KO) mice in the fed state failed to upregulate Ppargamma and the adiponectin
      gene, a Ppargamma-dependent gene, confirming the in vivo role for Tfe3. Lastly,
      we found that blood glucose is elevated and serum adiponectin levels are
      suppressed in the Tfe3KO mice, indicating that the Tfe3/Tfeb/Ppargamma2 axis may 
      contribute to whole-body energy balance. Thus, we offer new insights into the
      upstream regulation of Ppargamma by Tfe3/Tf3b and propose that targeting these
      transcription factors may offer opportunities to complement existing approaches
      for the treatment of diseases that have dysregulated energy metabolism.

      Colorectal Cancer Cells.
LID - e00012-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00012-17 [doi]
AB  - Deregulated activation of RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
      signaling and defects in retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling are both
      implicated in many types of cancers. However, interrelationships between these
      alterations in regulating cancer cell fates have not been fully elucidated. Here,
      we show that RAS/ERK and RAR signaling pathways antagonistically interact with
      each other to regulate colorectal cancer (CRC) cell fates. We show that RAR
      signaling activation promotes spontaneous differentiation of CRC cells, while ERK
      activation suppresses it. Our microarray analyses identify genes whose expression
      levels are upregulated by RAR signaling. Notably, one of these genes, MKP4,
      encoding a member of dual-specificity phosphatases for mitogen-activated protein 
      (MAP) kinases, mediates ERK inactivation upon RAR activation, thereby promoting
      the differentiation of CRC cells. Moreover, our results also show that RA
      induction of RAR target genes is suppressed by the ERK pathway activation. This
      suppression results from the inhibition of RAR transcriptional activity, which is
      shown to be mediated through an RIP140/histone deacetylase (HDAC)-mediated
      mechanism. These results identify antagonistic interactions between RAS/ERK and
      RAR signaling in the cell fate decision of CRC cells and define their underlying 
      molecular mechanisms.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the C-Raf N-region promotes Raf dimerization.
LID - MCB.00132-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00132-17 [doi]
AB  - Activation of Raf kinases by the small GTPase Ras requires two major sets of
      phosphorylations. One set lies within the activation loop and the other lies
      within the N-terminal acidic region (N-region). In the most abundant isoform of
      Raf, C-Raf, N-region phosphorylations occur on serine 338 (S338) and tyrosine 341
      (Y341), and are thought to provide allosteric activation of the Raf dimer. We
      show that the phosphorylation of these N-region sites does not require C-Raf
      dimerization, but rather, they precede dimerization. One of these
      phosphorylations (phospho-Y341) is required for C-Raf dimerization and this
      action can be replicated by phosphomimetic mutants both in vivo and in vitro The 
      role of phosphorylation of Y341 in promoting Raf dimerization is distinct from
      its well-known function to facilitate S338 phosphorylation.In Ras-mutant
      pancreatic cancer cell lines, phosphorylation and dimerization of C-Raf is
      basally elevated. Dimerization is thought to contribute to their elevated growth 
      rate through their activation of the MAP kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. Blocking
      tyrosine phosphorylation of C-Raf with Src family inhibitors blocks the growth,
      basal dimerization, and ERK activation in these cells. We suggest that the
      kinases mediating C-Raf Y341 phosphorylation are potential candidate drug targets
      in selected Ras-dependent cancers.

      Activation of sex-biased transcriptional networks and dynamic changes in
      chromatin states.
LID - MCB.00301-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00301-17 [doi]
AB  - Sex-dependent pituitary GH secretory profiles--pulsatile in males and persistent 
      in females--regulate sex-biased, STAT5-dependent expression of hundreds of genes 
      in mouse liver, imparting sex differences in hepatic drug/lipid metabolism and
      disease risk. Here we examine transcriptional and epigenetic changes induced by
      continuous-GH infusion (cGH) in male mice, which rapidly feminizes the temporal
      profile of liver STAT5 activity. cGH repressed 86% of male-biased genes and
      induced 68% of female-biased genes within 4-days; however, several highly
      female-specific genes showed weak or no feminization, even after 14-days cGH.
      Female-biased genes already in an active chromatin state in male liver generally 
      showed early cGH responses; genes in an inactive chromatin state often responded 
      late. Early cGH-responsive genes included those encoding two GH/STAT5-regulated
      transcriptional repressors: male-biased BCL6, which was repressed, and
      female-specific CUX2, which was induced. Male-biased genes activated by STAT5
      and/or repressed by CUX2 were enriched for early cGH repression. Female-biased
      BCL6 targets were enriched for early cGH de-repression. Changes in sex-specific
      chromatin accessibility and histone modifications accompanied these cGH-induced
      sex-biased gene expression changes. Thus, the temporal, sex-biased gene responses
      to persistent GH stimulation are dictated by GH/STAT5-regulated transcription
      factors arranged in a hierarchical network and by the dynamics of changes in
      sex-biased epigenetic states.

TI  - N-terminal part of Dishevelled DEP domain is required for Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling in mammalian cells.

AB  - Dishevelled (DVL) proteins are key mediators of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      pathway. All DVL proteins contain three conserved domains -- DIX, PDZ and DEP.
      There is a consensus in the field that DIX domain is critical for
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling but contradictory evidence exists regarding the
      function of the DEP domain. It has been difficult until recently to test the
      importance of the DEP domain rigorously because of the interference with
      endogenous DVL, expressed in all Wnt-responsive cell lines. In this study, we
      took advantage of DVL KO (DVL1/DVL2/DVL3-triple knockout) cells, fully deficient 
      in Wnt3a-induced signaling events, and performed series of rescue experiments.
      Using this complementation assays we analyze the role of individual DVL isoforms.
      Further domain mapping of DVL1 showed that DVL1 DEP domain, and especially its
      N-terminal region, is both required and sufficient for Wnt3a-induced
      phosphorylation of LRP6 and TopFlash reporter activation. On the contrary,
      multiple DEP domain mutants deficient in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway
      could fully rescue the Wnt3a response. This study provides conclusive evidence
      that DVL DEP domain is essential for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mammalian
      cells and establishes an experimental system suitable for further functional
      testing of DVL.

TI  - An In Vitro TORC1 Kinase Assay That Recapitulates the Gtr-Independent
      Glutamine-Responsive TORC1 Activation Mechanism on Yeast Vacuoles.
LID - e00075-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00075-17 [doi]
AB  - Evolutionarily conserved target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1) responds to 
      nutrients, especially amino acids, to promote cell growth. In the yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, various nitrogen sources activate TORC1 with different 
      efficiencies, although the mechanism remains elusive. Leucine, and perhaps other 
      amino acids, was reported to activate TORC1 via the heterodimeric small GTPases
      Gtr1-Gtr2, the orthologues of the mammalian Rag GTPases. More recently, an
      alternative Gtr-independent TORC1 activation mechanism that may respond to
      glutamine was reported, although its molecular mechanism is not clear. In
      studying the nutrient-responsive TORC1 activation mechanism, the lack of an in
      vitro assay hinders associating particular nutrient compounds with the TORC1
      activation status, whereas no in vitro assay that shows nutrient responsiveness
      has been reported. In this study, we have developed a new in vitro TORC1 kinase
      assay that reproduces, for the first time, the nutrient-responsive TORC1
      activation. This in vitro TORC1 assay recapitulates the previously predicted
      Gtr-independent glutamine-responsive TORC1 activation mechanism. Using this
      system, we found that this mechanism specifically responds to l-glutamine,
      resides on the vacuolar membranes, and involves a previously uncharacterized
      Vps34-Vps15 phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase complex and the PI-3-phosphate
      [PI(3)P]-binding FYVE domain-containing vacuolar protein Pib2. Thus, this system 
      was proved to be useful for dissecting the glutamine-responsive TORC1 activation 
      mechanism.

AB  - The human CD99 protein is a 32-kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein that
      regulates various cellular responses, including cell adhesion and leukocyte
      extravasation. We previously reported that CD99 activation suppresses beta1
      integrin activity through dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at
      Y397. We explored a molecular mechanism underlying the suppression of beta1
      integrin activity by CD99 agonists and its relevance to tumor growth in vivo
      CD99-Fc fusion proteins or a series of CD99-derived peptides suppressed beta1
      integrin activity by specifically interacting with three conserved motifs of the 
      CD99 extracellular domain. CD99CRIII3, a representative CD99-derived 3-mer
      peptide, facilitated protein kinase A-SHP2 interaction and subsequent activation 
      of the HRAS/RAF1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Subsequently, CD99CRIII3 induced FAK 
      phosphorylation at S910, which led to the recruitment of PTPN12 and PIN1 to FAK, 
      followed by FAK dephosphorylation at Y397. Taken together, these results indicate
      that CD99-derived agonist ligands inhibit fibronectin-mediated beta1 integrin
      activation through the SHP2/ERK/PTPN12/FAK signaling pathway.

TI  - RNA Binding by Histone Methyltransferases Set1 and Set2.
LID - e00165-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00165-17 [doi]
AB  - Histone methylation at H3K4 and H3K36 is commonly associated with genes actively 
      transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and is catalyzed by Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae Set1 and Set2, respectively. Here we report that both
      methyltransferases can be UV cross-linked to RNA in vivo High-throughput
      sequencing of the bound RNAs revealed strong Set1 enrichment near the
      transcription start site, whereas Set2 was distributed along pre-mRNAs. A subset 
      of transcripts showed notably high enrichment for Set1 or Set2 binding relative
      to RNAPII, suggesting functional posttranscriptional interactions. In particular,
      Set1 was strongly bound to the SET1 mRNA, Ty1 retrotransposons, and noncoding
      RNAs from the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacers, consistent with its
      previously reported silencing roles. Set1 lacking RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2) 
      showed reduced in vivo cross-linking to RNA and reduced chromatin occupancy. In
      addition, levels of H3K4 trimethylation were decreased, whereas levels of
      dimethylation were increased. We conclude that RNA binding by Set1 contributes to
      both chromatin association and methyltransferase activity.

TI  - Progerin-Induced Replication Stress Facilitates Premature Senescence in
      Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome.
LID - e00659-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00659-16 [doi]
AB  - Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by a mutation in LMNA that 
      produces an aberrant lamin A protein, progerin. The accumulation of progerin in
      HGPS cells leads to an aberrant nuclear morphology, genetic instability, and
      p53-dependent premature senescence. How p53 is activated in response to progerin 
      production is unknown. Here we show that young cycling HGPS fibroblasts exhibit
      chronic DNA damage, primarily in S phase, as well as delayed replication fork
      progression. We demonstrate that progerin binds to PCNA, altering its
      distribution away from replicating DNA in HGPS cells, leading to gammaH2AX
      formation, ATR activation, and RPA Ser33 phosphorylation. Unlike normal human
      cells that can be immortalized by enforced expression of telomerase alone,
      immortalization of HGPS cells requires telomerase expression and p53 repression. 
      In addition, we show that the DNA damage response in HGPS cells does not
      originate from eroded telomeres. Together, these results establish that progerin 
      interferes with the coordination of essential DNA replication factors, causing
      replication stress, and is the primary signal for p53 activation leading to
      premature senescence in HGPS. Furthermore, this damage response is shown to be
      independent of progerin farnesylation, implying that unprocessed lamin A alone
      causes replication stress.

TI  - Mrhl Long Noncoding RNA Mediates Meiotic Commitment of Mouse Spermatogonial Cells
      by Regulating Sox8 Expression.
LID - e00632-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00632-16 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of various biological
      processes, including spermatogenesis. Our previous studies have revealed the
      regulatory loop of mrhl RNA and Wnt signaling, where mrhl RNA negatively
      regulates Wnt signaling and gets downregulated upon Wnt signaling activation.
      This downregulation of mrhl RNA is important for the meiotic progression of
      spermatogonial cells. In our present study, we identified the transcription
      factor Sox8 as the regulatory link between mrhl RNA expression, Wnt signaling
      activation, and meiotic progression. In contrast to reports from other groups, we
      report the expression of Sox8 in germ cells and describe the molecular mechanism 
      of Sox8 regulation by mrhl RNA during differentiation of spermatogonial cells.
      Binding of mrhl RNA to the Sox8 promoter is accompanied by the assembly of other 
      regulatory factors involving Myc-Max-Mad transcription factors, corepressor
      Sin3a, and coactivator Pcaf. In the context of Wnt signaling, Sox8 directly
      regulates the expression of premeiotic and meiotic markers. Prolonged Wnt
      signaling activation in spermatogonial cells leads to changes in global chromatin
      architecture and a decrease in levels of stem cell markers.

TI  - CREBH Maintains Circadian Glucose Homeostasis by Regulating Hepatic
      Glycogenolysis and Gluconeogenesis.
LID - e00048-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00048-17 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein, hepatocyte specific (CREBH), is a 
      liver-enriched, endoplasmic reticulum-tethered transcription factor known to
      regulate the hepatic acute-phase response and lipid homeostasis. In this study,
      we demonstrate that CREBH functions as a circadian transcriptional regulator that
      plays major roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis. The proteolytic cleavage
      and posttranslational acetylation modification of CREBH are regulated by the
      circadian clock. Functionally, CREBH is required in order to maintain circadian
      homeostasis of hepatic glycogen storage and blood glucose levels. CREBH regulates
      the rhythmic expression of the genes encoding the rate-limiting enzymes for
      glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, including liver glycogen phosphorylase
      (PYGL), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), and the glucose-6-phosphatase
      catalytic subunit (G6PC). CREBH interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor alpha (PPARalpha) to synergize its transcriptional activities in hepatic
      gluconeogenesis. The acetylation of CREBH at lysine residue 294 controls
      CREBH-PPARalpha interaction and synergy in regulating hepatic glucose metabolism 
      in mice. CREBH deficiency leads to reduced blood glucose levels but increases
      hepatic glycogen levels during the daytime or upon fasting. In summary, our
      studies revealed that CREBH functions as a key metabolic regulator that controls 
      glucose homeostasis across the circadian cycle or under metabolic stress.

TI  - Evidence of a prion-like transmission of p53 amyloid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - MCB.00118-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00118-17 [doi]
AB  - Loss of p53 function is largely responsible for the occurrence of cancer in
      human. Aggregation of mutant p53 has been found in multiple cancer cell types
      suggesting a role of aggregation for loss of p53 function and cancer development.
      The p53 protein has recently been hypothesized to possess a prion-like
      conformation although experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we report that
      human p53 can be inactivated upon exposure to preformed fibrils containing an
      aggregation prone sequence specific peptide PILTIITL derived from p53 and the
      inactive state was found to be stable for many generations. Importantly, we
      provide evidence of a prion-like transmission of these p53 aggregates. This study
      has a significant implication in understanding cancer progression due to p53
      malfunctioning without any loss of function mutation or occurrence of
      transcriptional inactivation. Our data might unlock new possibilities for
      understanding the disease and will lead to rational designing of p53 aggregation 
      inhibitors for drug development against cancer.

TI  - Eya2, a Target Activated by Plzf, Is Critical for PLZF-RARA-Induced
      Leukemogenesis.
LID - e00585-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00585-16 [doi]
AB  - PLZF is a transcription factor that confers aberrant self-renewal in
      leukemogenesis, and the PLZF-RARA fusion gene causes acute promyelocytic leukemia
      (APL) through differentiation block. However, the molecular mechanisms of
      aberrant self-renewal underlying PLZF-mediated leukemogenesis are poorly
      understood. To investigate these mechanisms, comprehensive expression profiling
      of mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with Plzf was performed, 
      which revealed the involvement of a key transcriptional coactivator, Eya2, a
      target molecule shared by Plzf and PLZF-RARA, in the aberrant self-renewal.
      Indeed, PLZF-RARA as well as Plzf rendered those cells immortalized through
      upregulation of Eya2. Eya2 also led to immortalization without differentiation
      block, while depletion of Eya2 suppressed clonogenicity in cells immortalized by 
      PLZF-RARA without influence on differentiation and apoptosis. Interestingly,
      cancer outlier profile analysis of human samples of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
      in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a subtype of AML that strongly
      expressed EYA2 In addition, gene set enrichment analysis of human AML samples,
      including TCGA data, showed that this subtype of AML was more closely associated 
      with the properties of leukemic stem cells in its gene expression signature than 
      other AMLs. Therefore, EYA2 may be a target for molecular therapy in this subtype
      of AML, including PLZF-RARA APL.

TI  - A Kinase-Independent Role for Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 19 in p53 Response.
LID - e00626-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00626-16 [doi]
AB  - The human Mediator complex regulates RNA polymerase II transcription genome-wide.
      A general factor that regulates Mediator function is the four-subunit kinase
      module, which contains either cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) or CDK19. Whereas 
      CDK8 is linked to specific signaling cascades and oncogenesis, the cellular roles
      of its paralog, CDK19, are poorly studied. We discovered that osteosarcoma cells 
      (SJSA) are naturally depleted of CDK8 protein. Whereas stable CDK19 knockdown was
      tolerated in SJSA cells, proliferation was reduced. Notably, proliferation
      defects were rescued upon the reexpression of wild-type or kinase-dead CDK19.
      Comparative RNA sequencing analyses showed reduced expression of mitotic genes
      and activation of genes associated with cholesterol metabolism and the p53
      pathway in CDK19 knockdown cells. SJSA cells treated with 5-fluorouracil, which
      induces metabolic and genotoxic stress and activates p53, further implicated
      CDK19 in p53 target gene expression. To better probe the p53 response, SJSA cells
      (shCDK19 versus shCTRL) were treated with the p53 activator nutlin-3. Remarkably,
      CDK19 was required for SJSA cells to return to a proliferative state after
      nutlin-3 treatment, and this effect was kinase independent. These results
      implicate CDK19 as a regulator of p53 stress responses and suggest a role for
      CDK19 in cellular resistance to nutlin-3.

TI  - p53 Dynamically Directs TFIID Assembly on Target Gene Promoters.
LID - e00085-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00085-17 [doi]
AB  - p53 is a central regulator that turns on vast gene networks to maintain cellular 
      integrity in the presence of various stimuli. p53 activates transcription
      initiation in part by aiding recruitment of TFIID to the promoter. However, the
      precise means by which p53 dynamically interacts with TFIID to facilitate
      assembly on target gene promoters remains elusive. To address this key issue, we 
      have undertaken an integrated approach involving single-molecule fluorescence
      microscopy, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemistry. Our
      real-time single-molecule imaging data demonstrate that TFIID alone binds poorly 
      to native p53 target promoters. p53 unlocks TFIID's ability to bind DNA by
      stabilizing TFIID contacts with both the core promoter and a region within p53's 
      response element. Analysis of single-molecule dissociation kinetics reveals that 
      TFIID interacts with promoters via transient and prolonged DNA binding modes that
      are each regulated by p53. Importantly, our structural work reveals that TFIID's 
      conversion to a rearranged DNA binding conformation is enhanced in the presence
      of DNA and p53. Notably, TFIID's interaction with DNA induces p53 to rapidly
      dissociate, which likely leads to additional rounds of p53-mediated recruitment
      of other basal factors. Collectively, these findings indicate that p53
      dynamically escorts and loads TFIID onto its target promoters.

TI  - VprBP/DCAF1 Regulates the Degradation and Nonproteolytic Activation of the Cell
      Cycle Transcription Factor FoxM1.
LID - e00609-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00609-16 [doi]
AB  - The oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 plays a vital role in cell cycle
      progression, is activated in numerous human malignancies, and is linked to
      chromosome instability. We characterize here a cullin 4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase
      and its substrate receptor, VprBP/DCAF1 (CRL4(VprBP)), which we show regulate
      FoxM1 ubiquitylation and degradation. Paradoxically, we also found that the
      substrate receptor VprBP is a potent FoxM1 activator. VprBP depletion reduces
      expression of FoxM1 target genes and impairs mitotic entry, whereas ectopic VprBP
      expression strongly activates a FoxM1 transcriptional reporter. VprBP binding to 
      CRL4 is reduced during mitosis, and our data suggest that VprBP activation of
      FoxM1 is ligase independent. This implies a nonproteolytic activation mechanism
      that is reminiscent of, yet distinct from, the ubiquitin-dependent
      transactivation of the oncoprotein Myc by other E3s. Significantly, VprBP protein
      levels were upregulated in high-grade serous ovarian patient tumors, where the
      FoxM1 signature is amplified. These data suggest that FoxM1 abundance and
      activity are controlled by VprBP and highlight the functional repurposing of E3
      ligase substrate receptors independent of the ubiquitin system.

TI  - A Molecular Mechanism To Switch the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor from a
      Transcription Factor to an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.
LID - e00630-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00630-16 [doi]
AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor
      that is known as a mediator of toxic responses. Recently, it was shown that the
      AhR has dual functions. Besides being a transcription factor, it also possesses
      an intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase function that targets, e.g., the steroid
      receptors for proteasomal degradation. The aim of this study was to identify the 
      molecular switch that determines whether the AhR acts as a transcription factor
      or an E3 ubiquitin ligase. To do this, we used the breast cancer cell line MCF7, 
      which expresses a functional estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) signaling pathway.
      Our data suggest that aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) plays
      an important role in the modulation of the dual functions of the AhR. ARNT
      knockdown dramatically impaired the transcriptional activation properties of the 
      ligand-activated AhR but did not affect its E3 ubiquitin ligase function. The
      availability of ARNT itself is modulated by another basic helix-loop-helix
      (bHLH)-Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS) protein, the repressor of AhR function (AhRR). MCF7
      cells overexpressing the AhRR showed lower ERalpha protein levels, reduced
      responsiveness to estradiol, and reduced growth rates. Importantly, when these
      cells were used to produce estrogen-dependent xenograft tumors in SCID mice, we
      also observed lower ERalpha protein levels and a reduced tumor mass, implying a
      tumor-suppressive-like function of the AhR in MCF7 xenograft tumors.

TI  - An mRNA Capping Enzyme Targets FACT to the Active Gene To Enhance the Engagement 
      of RNA Polymerase II into Transcriptional Elongation.
LID - e00029-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00029-17 [doi]
AB  - We have recently demonstrated that an mRNA capping enzyme, Cet1, impairs
      promoter-proximal accumulation/pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
      independently of its capping activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to control
      transcription. However, it is still unknown how Pol II pausing is regulated by
      Cet1. Here, we show that Cet1's N-terminal domain (NTD) promotes the recruitment 
      of FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription that enhances the engagement of Pol 
      II into transcriptional elongation) to the coding sequence of an active gene,
      ADH1, independently of mRNA-capping activity. Absence of Cet1's NTD decreases
      FACT targeting to ADH1 and consequently reduces the engagement of Pol II in
      transcriptional elongation, leading to promoter-proximal accumulation of Pol II. 
      Similar results were also observed at other genes. Consistently, Cet1 interacts
      with FACT. Collectively, our results support the notion that Cet1's NTD promotes 
      FACT targeting to the active gene independently of mRNA-capping activity in
      facilitating Pol II's engagement in transcriptional elongation, thus deciphering 
      a novel regulatory pathway of gene expression.

TI  - Caloric Restriction Extends Yeast Chronological Life Span by Optimizing the Snf1 
      (AMPK) Signaling Pathway.
LID - e00562-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00562-16 [doi]
AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the homologous yeast SNF1 complex are key
      regulators of energy metabolism that counteract nutrient deficiency and ATP
      depletion by phosphorylating multiple enzymes and transcription factors that
      maintain energetic homeostasis. AMPK/SNF1 also promotes longevity in several
      model organisms, including yeast. Here we investigate the role of yeast SNF1 in
      mediating the extension of chronological life span (CLS) by caloric restriction
      (CR). We find that SNF1 activity is required throughout the transition of log
      phase to stationary phase (diauxic shift) for effective CLS extension. CR expands
      the period of maximal SNF1 activation beyond the diauxic shift, as indicated by
      Sak1-dependent T210 phosphorylation of the Snf1 catalytic alpha-subunit. A
      concomitant increase in ADP is consistent with SNF1 activation by ADP in vivo
      Downstream of SNF1, the Cat8 and Adr1 transcription factors are required for full
      CR-induced CLS extension, implicating an alternative carbon source utilization
      for acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) production and gluconeogenesis. Indeed, CR
      increased acetyl-CoA levels during the diauxic shift, along with expression of
      both acetyl-CoA synthetase genes ACS1 and ACS2 We conclude that CR maximizes Snf1
      activity throughout and beyond the diauxic shift, thus optimizing the
      coordination of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA production with massive reorganization
      of the transcriptome and respiratory metabolism.

TI  - Let-7 contributes to diabetic retinopathy but represses pathological ocular
      angiogenesis.
LID - MCB.00001-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00001-17 [doi]
AB  - The in vivo function of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in diabetic retinopathy (DR)
      and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains unclear. Here we report that
      let-7 family members are expressed in retinal and choroidal endothelial cells
      (EC). In ECs, overexpression of let-7 by adenovirus represses EC proliferation,
      migration, and networking in vitro, while inhibition of the let-7 family with a
      locked nucleic acid (LNA)-anti-miR has the opposite effect. Mechanistically,
      silencing of the let-7 target gene HMGA2 mimics the phenotype of let-7
      overexpression in ECs. Let-7 transgenic (let-7-Tg) mice show features of
      non-proliferative DR, including tortuous retinal vessels and defective pericyte
      coverage. However, these mice develop significantly less choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) compared to wildtype controls after laser injury.
      Consistently, silencing of let-7 in the eye increased laser-induced CNV in
      wild-type mice. Together, our data establish a causative role of let-7 in
      non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and a repressive function of let-7 in
      pathological angiogenesis, suggesting distinct implications of let-7 in the
      pathogenesis of DR and AMD.

TI  - Dual Mechanism of Rag Gene Repression by c-Myb during Pre-B Cell Proliferation.
LID - e00437-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00437-16 [doi]
AB  - Developing B lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion following successful
      immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. During this proliferative burst,
      expression of the Rag genes is transiently repressed to prevent the generation of
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks in cycling large pre-B cells. The Rag genes
      are then reexpressed in small, resting pre-B cells for immunoglobulin light chain
      gene rearrangement. We previously identified c-Myb as a repressor of Rag
      transcription during clonal expansion using Abelson murine leukemia
      virus-transformed B cells. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myb 
      achieved precise spatiotemporal repression of Rag expression remained obscure.
      Here, we identify two mechanisms by which c-Myb represses Rag transcription.
      First, c-Myb negatively regulates the expression of the Rag activator Foxo1, an
      activity dependent on M303 in c-Myb's transactivation domain, and likely the
      recruitment of corepressors to the Foxo1 locus by c-Myb. Second, c-Myb represses 
      Rag transcription directly by occupying the Erag enhancer and antagonizing Foxo1 
      binding to a consensus forkhead site in this cis-regulatory element that we show 
      is crucial for Rag expression in Abelson pre-B cell lines. This work provides
      important mechanistic insight into how spatiotemporal expression of the Rag genes
      is tightly controlled during B lymphocyte development to prevent mistimed dsDNA
      breaks and their deleterious consequences.

TI  - Taking a Step Back from Back-Translocation: an Integrative View of LepA/EF4's
      Cellular Function.
LID - e00653-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00653-16 [doi]
AB  - Protein synthesis, the translation of mRNA into a polypeptide facilitated by the 
      ribosome, is assisted by a variety of protein factors, some of which are GTPases.
      In addition to four highly conserved and well-understood GTPases with known
      function, there are also a number of noncanonical GTPases that are implicated in 
      translation but whose functions are not fully understood. LepA/EF4 is one of
      these noncanonical GTPases. It is highly conserved and present in bacteria,
      mitochondria, and chloroplasts, but its functional role in the cell remains
      unknown. LepA's sequence and domain arrangement are very similar to those of
      other translational GTPases, but it contains a unique C-terminal domain (CTD)
      that is likely essential to its specific function in the cell. Three main
      hypotheses about the function of LepA have been brought forward to date: (i) LepA
      is a back-translocase, (ii) LepA relieves ribosome stalling or facilitates
      sequestration, and (iii) LepA is involved in ribosome biogenesis. This review
      examines the structural and biochemical information available on bacterial LepA
      and discusses it on the background of the available in vivo information from
      higher organisms in order to broaden the view regarding LepA's functional role in
      the cell and how the structure of its unique CTD might be involved in
      facilitating this role.

TI  - GATA3 Abundance Is a Critical Determinant of T Cell Receptor beta Allelic
      Exclusion.
LID - e00052-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00052-17 [doi]
AB  - Allelic exclusion describes the essential immunological process by which feedback
      repression of sequential DNA rearrangements ensures that only one autosome
      expresses a functional T or B cell receptor. In wild-type mammals, approximately 
      60% of cells have recombined the DNA of one T cell receptor beta (TCRbeta)
      V-to-DJ-joined allele in a functional configuration, while the second allele has 
      recombined only the DJ sequences; the other 40% of cells have recombined the V to
      the DJ segments on both alleles, with only one of the two alleles predicting a
      functional TCRbeta protein. Here we report that the transgenic overexpression of 
      GATA3 leads predominantly to biallelic TCRbeta gene (Tcrb) recombination. We also
      found that wild-type immature thymocytes can be separated into distinct
      populations based on intracellular GATA3 expression and that GATA3(LO) cells had 
      almost exclusively recombined only one Tcrb locus (that predicted a functional
      receptor sequence), while GATA3(HI) cells had uniformly recombined both Tcrb
      alleles (one predicting a functional and the other predicting a nonfunctional
      rearrangement). These data show that GATA3 abundance regulates the recombination 
      propensity at the Tcrb locus and provide new mechanistic insight into the
      historic immunological conundrum for how Tcrb allelic exclusion is mediated.

TI  - Endothelial NO Synthase-Dependent S-Nitrosylation of beta-Catenin Prevents Its
      Association with TCF4 and Inhibits Proliferation of Endothelial Cells Stimulated 
      by Wnt3a.
LID - e00089-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00089-17 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) modulates many
      functions in endothelial cells. S-nitrosylation (SNO) of cysteine residues on
      beta-catenin by eNOS-derived NO has been shown to influence intercellular
      contacts between endothelial cells. However, the implication of SNO in the
      regulation of beta-catenin transcriptional activity is ill defined. Here, we
      report that NO inhibits the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin and
      endothelial cell proliferation induced by activation of Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling. Interestingly, induction by Wnt3a of beta-catenin target genes, such
      as the axin2 gene, is repressed in an eNOS-dependent manner by vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We identified Cys466 of beta-catenin as a
      target for SNO by eNOS-derived NO and as the critical residue for the repressive 
      effects of NO on beta-catenin transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we observed 
      that Cys466 of beta-catenin, located at the binding interface of the
      beta-catenin-TCF4 transcriptional complex, is essential for disruption of this
      complex by NO. Importantly, Cys466 of beta-catenin is necessary for the
      inhibitory effects of NO on Wnt3a-stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells. 
      Thus, our data define the mechanism responsible for the repressive effects of NO 
      on the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin and link eNOS-derived NO to the
      modulation by VEGF of Wnt/beta-catenin-induced endothelial cell proliferation.

TI  - Sav1 Loss Induces Senescence and Stat3 Activation Coinciding with
      Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis.
LID - e00565-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00565-16 [doi]
AB  - Tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) is recognized as a final phenotypic
      manifestation in the transition from chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD). Here we show that conditional inactivation of Sav1 in the
      mouse renal epithelium resulted in upregulated expression of profibrotic genes
      and TIF. Loss of Sav1 induced Stat3 activation and a senescence-associated
      secretory phenotype (SASP) that coincided with the development of
      tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Treatment of mice with the YAP inhibitor verteporfin
      (VP) inhibited activation of genes associated with senescence, SASPs, and
      activation of Stat3 as well as impeded the development of fibrosis. Collectively,
      our studies offer novel insights into molecular events that are linked to
      fibrosis development from Sav1 loss and implicate VP as a potential
      pharmacological inhibitor to treat patients at risk for developing CKD and TIF.

TI  - The Drosophila DAXX-Like Protein (DLP) Cooperates with ASF1 for H3.3 Deposition
      and Heterochromatin Formation.
LID - e00597-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00597-16 [doi]
AB  - Histone variants are nonallelic isoforms of canonical histones, and they are
      deposited, in contrast to canonical histones, in a replication-independent (RI)
      manner. RI deposition of H3.3, a histone variant from the H3.3 family, is
      mediated in mammals by distinct pathways involving either the histone regulator A
      (HIRA) complex or the death-associated protein (DAXX)/alpha-thalassemia X-linked 
      mental retardation protein (ATRX) complex. Here, we investigated the function of 
      the Drosophila DAXX-like protein (DLP) by using both fly genetic approaches and
      protein biochemistry. DLP specifically interacts with H3.3 and shows a prominent 
      localization on the base of the X chromosome, where it appears to act in concert 
      with XNP, the Drosophila homolog of ATRX, in heterochromatin assembly and
      maintenance. The functional association between DLP and XNP is further supported 
      by a series of experiments that illustrate genetic interactions and the
      DLP-XNP-dependent localization of specific chromosomal proteins. In addition, DLP
      both participates in the RI deposition of H3.3 and associates with anti-silencing
      factor 1 (ASF1). We suggest, in agreement with a recently proposed model, that
      DLP and ASF1 are part of a predeposition complex, which is recruited by XNP and
      is necessary to prevent DNA exposure in the nucleus.

TI  - DNA polymerase beta participates in mitochondrial DNA repair.
LID - MCB.00237-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00237-17 [doi]
AB  - We have detected DNA polymerase beta (Polbeta), known as a key nuclear base
      excision repair (BER) protein, in mitochondrial protein extracts derived from
      mammalian tissue and cells. Manipulation of the N-terminal sequence affected the 
      amount of Polbeta in the mitochondria. Using Polbeta fragments,
      mitochondrial-specific protein partners were identified, with the interactors
      mainly functioning in DNA maintenance and mitochondrial import. Of particular
      interest was the identification of the proteins TWINKLE, SSBP1 and TFAM, all of
      which are mitochondria specific DNA effectors and are known to function in the
      nucleoid. Polbeta directly interacted with, and influenced the activity of, the
      mitochondrial helicase TWINKLE. Human kidney cells with Polbeta knock-out (KO)
      had higher endogenous mtDNA damage. Mitochondrial extracts derived from
      heterozygous Polbeta mouse tissue and KO cells had lower nucleotide incorporation
      activity. Mouse derived Polbeta null fibroblasts had severely affected metabolic 
      parameters. Indeed, gene knockout of Polbeta caused mitochondrial dysfunction
      including reduced membrane potential and mitochondrial content. We show that
      Polbeta is a mitochondrial polymerase involved in mtDNA maintenance and is
      required for mitochondrial homeostasis.

TI  - Essential Roles of L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 in Syncytiotrophoblast
      Development by Presenting Fusogenic 4F2hc.
LID - e00427-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00427-16 [doi]
AB  - The layers of the epithelial syncytium, i.e., syncytiotrophoblasts, differentiate
      from chorionic trophoblasts via cell fusion and separate maternal and fetal
      circulations in hemochorial placentas. L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and
      its covalently linked ancillary subunit 4F2hc are colocalized on both maternal
      and fetal surfaces of syncytiotrophoblasts, implying their roles in amino acid
      transfer through the placental barrier. In this study, LAT1 knockout, in
      addition, revealed a novel role of LAT1 in syncytiotrophoblast development. LAT1 
      at midgestation was selectively expressed in trophoblastic lineages in the
      placenta, exclusively as a LAT1-4F2hc heterodimer. In LAT1 homozygous knockout
      mice, chorionic trophoblasts remained largely mononucleated, and the layers of
      syncytiotrophoblasts were almost completely absent. The amount of 4F2hc protein, 
      which possesses a fusogenic function in trophoblastic cells, as well as in
      virus-infected cells, was drastically reduced by LAT1 knockout, with less
      affecting the mRNA level. Knockdown of LAT1 in trophoblastic BeWo cells also
      reduced 4F2hc protein and suppressed forskolin-induced cell fusion. These results
      demonstrate a novel fundamental role of LAT1 to support the protein expression of
      4F2hc via a chaperone-like function in chorionic trophoblasts and to promote
      syncytiotrophoblast formation by contributing to cell fusion in the developing
      placenta.

TI  - Fumarate Mediates a Chronic Proliferative Signal in Fumarate
      Hydratase-Inactivated Cancer Cells by Increasing Transcription and Translation of
      Ferritin Genes.
LID - e00079-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00079-17 [doi]
AB  - Germ line mutations of the gene encoding the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
      enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) cause a hereditary cancer syndrome known as
      hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). HLRCC-associated tumors 
      harbor biallelic FH inactivation that results in the accumulation of the TCA
      cycle metabolite fumarate. Although it is known that fumarate accumulation can
      alter cellular signaling, if and how fumarate confers a growth advantage remain
      unclear. Here we show that fumarate accumulation confers a chronic proliferative 
      signal by disrupting cellular iron signaling. Specifically, fumarate covalently
      modifies cysteine residues on iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), rendering it
      unable to repress ferritin mRNA translation. Simultaneously, fumarate increases
      ferritin gene transcription by activating the NRF2 (nuclear factor
      [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2) transcription factor. In turn, increased ferritin
      protein levels promote the expression of the promitotic transcription factor
      FOXM1 (Forkhead box protein M1). Consistently, clinical HLRCC tissues showed
      increased expression levels of both FOXM1 and its proliferation-associated target
      genes. This finding demonstrates how FH inactivation can endow cells with a
      growth advantage.

TI  - Coordinated Hsp110 and Hsp104 Activities Power Protein Disaggregation in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - e00027-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00027-17 [doi]
AB  - Protein aggregation is intimately associated with cellular stress and is
      accelerated during aging, disease, and cellular dysfunction. Yeast cells rely on 
      the ATP-consuming chaperone Hsp104 to disaggregate proteins together with Hsp70. 
      Hsp110s are ancient and abundant chaperones that form complexes with Hsp70. Here 
      we provide in vivo data showing that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp110s Sse1
      and Sse2 are essential for Hsp104-dependent protein disaggregation. Following
      heat shock, complexes of Hsp110 and Hsp70 are recruited to protein aggregates and
      function together with Hsp104 in the disaggregation process. In the absence of
      Hsp110, targeting of Hsp70 and Hsp104 to the aggregates is impaired, and the
      residual Hsp104 that still reaches the aggregates fails to disaggregate. Thus,
      coordinated activities of both Hsp104 and Hsp110 are required to reactivate
      aggregated proteins. These findings have important implications for the
      understanding of how eukaryotic cells manage misfolded and amyloid proteins.

TI  - T Cell Costimulation by CD6 Is Dependent on Bivalent Binding of a GADS/SLP-76
      Complex.
LID - e00071-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00071-17 [doi]
AB  - The cell surface receptor CD6 regulates T cell activation in both activating and 
      inhibitory manners. The adaptor protein SLP-76 is recruited to the phosphorylated
      CD6 cytoplasmic Y662 residue during T cell activation, providing an activating
      signal to T cells. In this study, a biochemical approach identified the SH2
      domain-containing adaptor protein GADS as the dominant interaction partner for
      the CD6 cytoplasmic Y629 residue. Functional experiments in human Jurkat and
      primary T cells showed that both mutations Y629F and Y662F abolished
      costimulation by CD6. In addition, a restraint on T cell activation by CD6 was
      revealed in primary T cells expressing CD6 mutated at Y629 and Y662. These data
      are consistent with a model in which bivalent recruitment of a GADS/SLP-76
      complex is required for costimulation by CD6.

TI  - Gain-of-Function Mutation of Tristetraprolin Impairs Negative Feedback Control of
      Macrophages In Vitro yet Has Overwhelmingly Anti-Inflammatory Consequences In
      Vivo.
LID - e00536-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00536-16 [doi]
AB  - The mRNA-destabilizing factor tristetraprolin (TTP) binds in a sequence-specific 
      manner to the 3' untranslated regions of many proinflammatory mRNAs and recruits 
      complexes of nucleases to promote rapid mRNA turnover. Mice lacking TTP develop a
      severe, spontaneous inflammatory syndrome characterized by the overexpression of 
      tumor necrosis factor and other inflammatory mediators. However, TTP also employs
      the same mechanism to inhibit the expression of the potent anti-inflammatory
      cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). Perturbation of TTP function may therefore have 
      mixed effects on inflammatory responses, either increasing or decreasing the
      expression of proinflammatory factors via direct or indirect mechanisms. We
      recently described a knock-in mouse strain in which the substitution of 2 amino
      acids of the endogenous TTP protein renders it constitutively active as an
      mRNA-destabilizing factor. Here we investigate the impact on the IL-10-mediated
      anti-inflammatory response. It is shown that the gain-of-function mutation of TTP
      impairs IL-10-mediated negative feedback control of macrophage function in vitro 
      However, the in vivo effects of TTP mutation are uniformly anti-inflammatory
      despite the decreased expression of IL-10.

TI  - SorLA in Interleukin-6 Signaling and Turnover.
LID - e00641-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00641-16 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine with important functions in
      various physiologic processes. Mice lacking IL-6 exhibit multiple phenotypic
      abnormalities, such as an inadequate immune and acute-phase response, and
      elevated levels of circulating IL-6 have been found to accompany several
      pathological conditions. IL-6 binds the nonsignaling IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which
      is expressed as a transmembrane, as well as a secreted circulating protein,
      before it engages homodimeric gp130 for signaling. Complex formation between IL-6
      and the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor gives rise to classic cis signaling, whereas
      complex formation between IL-6 and the soluble IL-6R results in trans signaling. 
      Here, we report that the endocytic receptor SorLA targets IL-6 and IL-6R. We
      present evidence that SorLA mediates efficient cellular uptake of both IL-6 and
      the circulating IL-6R in astrocytes. We further show that SorLA interacts with
      the membrane-bound IL-6R at the cell surface and thereby downregulates IL-6 cis
      signaling. Finally, we find that the SorLA ectodomain, released from the cell
      membrane upon enzymatic cleavage of full-length SorLA, may act as an IL-6 carrier
      protein that stabilizes IL-6 and its capacity for trans signaling.

TI  - Deletion of Pofut1 in Mouse Skeletal Myofibers Induces Muscle Aging-Related
      Phenotypes in cis and in trans.
LID - e00426-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00426-16 [doi]
AB  - Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength during normal aging, involves
      coordinate changes in skeletal myofibers and the cells that contact them,
      including satellite cells and motor neurons. Here we show that the protein
      O-fucosyltransferase 1 gene (Pofut1), which encodes a glycosyltransferase
      required for NotchR-mediated cell-cell signaling, has reduced expression in aging
      skeletal muscle. Moreover, premature postnatal deletion of Pofut1 in skeletal
      myofibers can induce aging-related phenotypes in cis within skeletal myofibers
      and in trans within satellite cells and within motor neurons via the
      neuromuscular junction. Changed phenotypes include reduced skeletal muscle size
      and strength, decreased myofiber size, increased slow fiber (type 1) density,
      increased muscle degeneration and regeneration in aged muscles, decreased
      satellite cell self-renewal and regenerative potential, and increased
      neuromuscular fragmentation and occasional denervation. Pofut1 deletion in
      skeletal myofibers reduced NotchR signaling in young adult muscles, but this
      effect was lost with age. Increasing muscle NotchR signaling also reduced muscle 
      size. Gene expression studies point to regulation of cell cycle genes, muscle
      myosins, NotchR and Wnt pathway genes, and connective tissue growth factor by
      Pofut1 in skeletal muscle, with additional effects on alpha dystroglycan
      glycosylation.

AB  - The nuclear receptor CAR (NR1I3) regulates hepatic drug and energy metabolism as 
      well as cell fate. Its activation can be a critical factor in drug-induced
      toxicity and the development of diseases, including diabetes and tumors. CAR
      inactivates its constitutive activity by phosphorylation at threonine 38.
      Utilizing receptor for protein kinase 1 (RACK1) as the regulatory subunit,
      protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylates threonine 38 to activate CAR. Here
      we demonstrate that CAR undergoes homodimer-monomer conversion to regulate this
      dephosphorylation. By coexpression of two differently tagged CAR proteins in
      Huh-7 cells, mouse primary hepatocytes, and mouse livers, coimmunoprecipitation
      and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that CAR can form a homodimer in
      a configuration in which the PP2A/RACK1 binding site is buried within its dimer
      interface. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was found to stimulate CAR
      homodimerization, thus constraining CAR in its inactive form. The agonistic
      ligand CITCO binds directly to the CAR homodimer and dissociates phosphorylated
      CAR into its monomers, exposing the PP2A/RACK1 binding site for
      dephosphorylation. Phenobarbital, which is not a CAR ligand, binds the EGF
      receptor, reversing the EGF signal to monomerize CAR for its indirect activation.
      Thus, the homodimer-monomer conversion is the underlying molecular mechanism that
      regulates CAR activation, by placing phosphorylated threonine 38 as the common
      target for both direct and indirect activation of CAR.

TI  - Glucose Deprivation Induces ATF4-Mediated Apoptosis through TRAIL Death
      Receptors.
LID - e00479-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00479-16 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic stress occurs frequently in tumors and in normal tissues undergoing
      transient ischemia. Nutrient deprivation triggers, among many potential cell
      death-inducing pathways, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response with the
      induction of the integrated stress response transcription factor ATF4. However,
      how this results in cell death remains unknown. Here we show that glucose
      deprivation triggered ER stress and induced the unfolded protein response
      transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP. This was associated with the
      nontranscriptional accumulation of TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) (DR4) and with the
      ATF4-mediated, CHOP-independent induction of TRAIL-R2 (DR5), suggesting that cell
      death in this context may involve death receptor signaling. Consistent with this,
      the ablation of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, FADD, Bid, and caspase-8 attenuated cell
      death, although the downregulation of TRAIL did not, suggesting
      ligand-independent activation of TRAIL receptors. These data indicate that stress
      triggered by glucose deprivation promotes the ATF4-dependent upregulation of
      TRAIL-R2/DR5 and TRAIL receptor-mediated cell death.

TI  - LIM-Only Protein FHL2 Is a Negative Regulator of Transforming Growth Factor beta1
      Expression.
LID - e00636-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00636-16 [doi]
AB  - Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a master cytokine in many
      biological processes, including tissue homeostasis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition, and wound repair. Here, we report that four and a half LIM-only
      protein 2 (FHL2) is a critical regulator of TGF-beta1 expression. Devoid of a
      DNA-binding domain, FHL2 is a transcriptional cofactor that plays the role of
      coactivator or corepressor, depending on the cell and promoter contexts. We
      detected association of FHL2 with the TGF-beta1 promoter, which showed higher
      activity in Fhl2(-/-) cells than in wild-type (WT) cells in a reporter assay.
      Overexpression of FHL2 abrogates the activation of the TGF-beta1 promoter,
      whereas the upregulation of TGF-beta1 gene transcription correlates with reduced 
      occupancy of FHL2 on the promoter. Moreover, ablation of FHL2 facilitates
      recruitment of RNA polymerase II on the TGF-beta1 promoter, suggesting that FHL2 
      may be involved in chromatin remodeling in the control of TGF-beta1 gene
      transcription. Enhanced expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA and cytokine was evidenced
      in the livers of Fhl2(-/-) mice. We tested the in vivo impact of Fhl2 loss on
      hepatic fibrogenesis that involves TGF-beta1 activation. Fhl2(-/-) mice developed
      more severe fibrosis than their WT counterparts. These results demonstrate the
      repressive function of FHL2 on TGF-beta1 expression and contribute to the
      understanding of the TGF-beta-mediated fibrogenic response.

TI  - Ssp2 Binding Activates the Smk1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase.
LID - e00607-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00607-16 [doi]
AB  - Smk1 is a meiosis-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae that couples spore morphogenesis to the completion of
      chromosome segregation. Similar to other MAPKs, Smk1 is controlled by
      phosphorylation of a threonine (T) and a tyrosine (Y) in its activation loop.
      However, it is not activated by a dual-specificity MAPK kinase. Instead, T207 in 
      Smk1's activation loop is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase
      (CDK)-activating kinase (Cak1), and Y209 is autophosphorylated in an
      intramolecular reaction that requires the meiosis-specific protein Ssp2. In this 
      study, we show that Smk1 is catalytically inert unless it is bound by Ssp2. While
      Ssp2 binding activates Smk1 by a mechanism that is independent of activation loop
      phosphorylation, binding also triggers autophosphorylation of Y209 in Smk1,
      which, along with Cak1-mediated phosphorylation of T207, further activates the
      kinase. Autophosphorylation of Smk1 on Y209 also appears to modify the
      specificity of the MAPK by suppressing Y kinase and enhancing S/T kinase
      activity. We also found that the phosphoconsensus motif preference of Ssp2/Smk1
      is more extensive than that of other characterized MAPKs. This study therefore
      defines a novel mechanism of MAPK activation requiring binding of an activator
      and also shows that MAPKs can be diversified to recognize unique phosphorylation 
      motifs.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00494-16 [doi]
AB  - AMPK-related protein kinases (ARKs) coordinate cell growth, proliferation, and
      migration with environmental status. It is unclear how specific ARKs are
      activated at specific times. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the 
      CaMKK-like protein kinase Ssp1 promotes cell cycle progression by activating the 
      ARK Cdr2 according to cell growth signals. Here, we demonstrate that Ssp1
      activates a second ARK, Ssp2/AMPKalpha, for cell proliferation in low
      environmental glucose. Ssp1 activates these two related targets by the same
      biochemical mechanism: direct phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the
      activation loop (Cdr2-T166 and Ssp2-T189). Despite a shared upstream kinase and
      similar phosphorylation sites, Cdr2 and Ssp2 have distinct regulatory input cues 
      and distinct functional outputs. We investigated this specificity and found that 
      distinct protein phosphatases counteract Ssp1 activity toward its different
      substrates. We identified the PP6 family phosphatase Ppe1 as the primary
      phosphatase for Ssp2-T189 dephosphorylation. The phosphatase inhibitor Sds23 acts
      upstream of PP6 to regulate Ssp2-T189 phosphorylation in a manner that depends on
      energy but not on the intact AMPK heterotrimer. In contrast, Cdr2-T166
      phosphorylation is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A but not by the Sds23-PP6
      pathway. Thus, our study provides a phosphatase-driven mechanism to induce
      specific physiological responses downstream of a master protein kinase.

TI  - Coordination of Myeloid Differentiation with Reduced Cell Cycle Progression by
      PU.1 Induction of MicroRNAs Targeting Cell Cycle Regulators and Lipid Anabolism.
LID - e00013-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00013-17 [doi]
AB  - During macrophage development, myeloid progenitor cells undergo terminal
      differentiation coordinated with reduced cell cycle progression. Differentiation 
      of macrophages from myeloid progenitors is accompanied by increased expression of
      the E26 transformation-specific transcription factor PU.1. Reduced PU.1
      expression leads to increased proliferation and impaired differentiation of
      myeloid progenitor cells. It is not understood how PU.1 coordinates macrophage
      differentiation with reduced cell cycle progression. In this study, we utilized
      cultured PU.1-inducible myeloid cells to perform genome-wide chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis coupled with gene expression
      analysis to determine targets of PU.1 that may be involved in regulating cell
      cycle progression. We found that genes encoding cell cycle regulators and enzymes
      involved in lipid anabolism were directly and inducibly bound by PU.1 although
      their steady-state mRNA transcript levels were reduced. Inhibition of lipid
      anabolism was sufficient to reduce cell cycle progression in these cells.
      Induction of PU.1 reduced expression of E2f1, an important activator of genes
      involved in cell cycle and lipid anabolism, indirectly through microRNA 223.
      Next-generation sequencing identified microRNAs validated as targeting cell cycle
      and lipid anabolism for downregulation. These results suggest that PU.1
      coordinates cell cycle progression with differentiation through induction of
      microRNAs targeting cell cycle regulators and lipid anabolism.

TI  - La Deletion from Mouse Brain Alters Pre-tRNA Metabolism and Accumulation of
      Pre-5.8S rRNA, with Neuron Death and Reactive Astrocytosis.
LID - e00588-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00588-16 [doi]
AB  - Human La antigen (Sjogren's syndrome antigen B [SSB]) is an abundant
      multifunctional RNA-binding protein. In the nucleoplasm, La binds to and protects
      from 3' exonucleases, the ends of precursor tRNAs, and other transcripts
      synthesized by RNA polymerase III and facilitates their maturation, while a
      nucleolar isoform has been implicated in rRNA biogenesis by multiple independent 
      lines of evidence. We showed previously that conditional La knockout (La cKO)
      from mouse cortex neurons results in defective tRNA processing, although the
      pathway(s) involved in neuronal loss thereafter was unknown. Here, we demonstrate
      that La is stably associated with a spliced pre-tRNA intermediate. Microscopic
      evidence of aberrant nuclear accumulation of 5.8S rRNA in La cKO is supported by 
      a 10-fold increase in a pre-5.8S rRNA intermediate. To identify pathways involved
      in subsequent neurodegeneration and loss of brain mass in the cKO cortex, we
      employed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq), immunohistochemistry, and other approaches. 
      This revealed robust enrichment of immune and astrocyte reactivity in La cKO
      cortex. Immunohistochemistry, including temporal analyses, demonstrated
      neurodegeneration, followed by astrocyte invasion associated with immune response
      and decreasing cKO cortex size over time. Thus, deletion of La from postmitotic
      neurons results in defective pre-tRNA and pre-rRNA processing and progressive
      neurodegeneration with loss of cortical brain mass.

TI  - DNA Damage Response-Independent Role for MDC1 in Maintaining Genomic Stability.
LID - e00595-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00595-16 [doi]
AB  - MDC1 is a central player in checkpoint activation and subsequent DNA repair
      following DNA damage. Although MDC1 has been studied extensively, many of its
      known functions, to date, pertain to the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway.
      Herein we report a novel function of phosphorylated MDC1 that is independent of
      ATM and DNA damage and is required for proper mitotic progression and maintenance
      of genomic stability. We demonstrate that MDC1 is an in vivo target of Plk1 and
      that phosphorylated MDC1 is dynamically localized to nuclear envelopes,
      centrosomes, kinetochores, and midbodies. Knockdown of MDC1 or abrogation of Plk1
      phosphorylation of MDC1 causes a delay of the prometaphase-metaphase transition. 
      It is significant that mice with reduced levels of MDC1 showed an elevated level 
      of spontaneous tumors in aged animals. Our results demonstrate that MDC1 also
      plays a fundamentally significant role in maintenance of genomic stability
      through a DDR-independent pathway.

TI  - Protein 4.1R Exon 16 3' Splice Site Activation Requires Coordination among TIA1, 
      Pcbp1, and RBM39 during Terminal Erythropoiesis.
LID - e00446-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00446-16 [doi]
AB  - Exon 16 of protein 4.1R encodes a spectrin/actin-binding peptide critical for
      erythrocyte membrane stability. Its expression during erythroid differentiation
      is regulated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. A UUUUCCCCCC motif situated
      between the branch point and the 3' splice site is crucial for inclusion. We show
      that the UUUU region and the last three C residues in this motif are necessary
      for the binding of splicing factors TIA1 and Pcbp1 and that these proteins appear
      to act in a collaborative manner to enhance exon 16 inclusion. This element also 
      activates an internal exon when placed in a corresponding intronic position in a 
      heterologous reporter. The impact of these two factors is further enhanced by
      high levels of RBM39, whose expression rises during erythroid differentiation as 
      exon 16 inclusion increases. TIA1 and Pcbp1 associate in a complex containing
      RBM39, which interacts with U2AF65 and SF3b155 and promotes U2 snRNP recruitment 
      to the branch point. Our results provide a mechanism for exon 16 3' splice site
      activation in which a coordinated effort among TIA1, Pcbp1, and RBM39 stabilizes 
      or increases U2 snRNP recruitment, enhances spliceosome A complex formation, and 
      facilitates exon definition through RBM39-mediated splicing regulation.

TI  - Predicted RNA Binding Proteins Pes4 and Mip6 Regulate mRNA Levels, Translation,
      and Localization during Sporulation in Budding Yeast.

AB  - In response to starvation, diploid cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergo
      meiosis and form haploid spores, a process collectively referred to as
      sporulation. The differentiation into spores requires extensive changes in gene
      expression. The transcriptional activator Ndt80 is a central regulator of this
      process, which controls many genes essential for sporulation. Ndt80 induces
      approximately 300 genes coordinately during meiotic prophase, but different mRNAs
      within the NDT80 regulon are translated at different times during sporulation.
      The protein kinase Ime2 and RNA binding protein Rim4 are general regulators of
      meiotic translational delay, but how differential timing of individual
      transcripts is achieved was not known. This report describes the characterization
      of two related NDT80-induced genes, PES4 and MIP6, encoding predicted RNA binding
      proteins. These genes are necessary to regulate the steady-state expression,
      translational timing, and localization of a set of mRNAs that are transcribed by 
      NDT80 but not translated until the end of meiosis II. Mutations in the predicted 
      RNA binding domains within PES4 alter the stability of target mRNAs. PES4 and
      MIP6 affect only a small portion of the NDT80 regulon, indicating that they act
      as modulators of the general Ime2/Rim4 pathway for specific transcripts.

TI  - A Key Regulator of Cell Adhesion: Identification and Characterization of
      Important N-Glycosylation Sites on Integrin alpha5 for Cell Migration.
LID - e00558-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00558-16 [doi]
AB  - The N-glycosylation of integrin alpha5beta1 is thought to control many
      fundamental aspects of cell behavior, including cell adhesion and migration.
      However, the mechanism of how N-glycans function remains largely obscure. Here,
      we used a loss-of-function approach. Wild-type (WT) integrin alpha5 and
      N-glycosylation mutant S3-5 (sites 3 to 5) integrin alpha5, which contains fewer 
      N-glycans, were stably reconstituted in alpha5 knockout cancer cells. We found
      that the migration ability of S3-5 cells was decreased in comparison with that of
      the WT. Interestingly, the levels of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and
      actin stress fiber formation were greatly enhanced in the S3-5 mutant. In a
      mechanistic manner, the internalization of active but not total integrin
      alpha5beta1 was inhibited in S3-5 cells, which is a process that is related to
      the enhanced expression of active integrin alpha5beta1 on the cell surface.
      Importantly, restoration of N-glycosylation on the beta-propeller domain of
      alpha5 reinstated the cell migration ability, active alpha5beta1 expression, and 
      internalization. Moreover, these N-glycans are critical for alpha5-syndecan-4
      complex formation. These findings indicate that N-glycosylation on the
      beta-propeller domain functions as a molecular switch to control the dynamics of 
      alpha5beta1 on the cell surface that in turn is required for optimum adhesion for
      cell migration.

TI  - Deubiquitinating Enzyme USP20 Regulates Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 3
      Stability and Biological Activity.
LID - e00432-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00432-16 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) is an atypical mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) whose regulatory mechanisms and biological functions remain
      superficially understood. Contrary to most protein kinases, ERK3 is a highly
      unstable protein that is subject to dynamic regulation by the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, the effectors that control ERK3
      ubiquitination and degradation are unknown. In this study, we carried out an
      unbiased functional loss-of-function screen of the human deubiquitinating enzyme 
      (DUB) family and identified ubiquitin-specific protease 20 (USP20) as a novel
      ERK3 regulator. USP20 interacts with and deubiquitinates ERK3 both in vitro and
      in intact cells. The overexpression of USP20 results in the stabilization and
      accumulation of the ERK3 protein, whereas USP20 depletion reduces the levels of
      ERK3. We found that the expression levels of ERK3 correlate with those of USP20
      in various cellular contexts. Importantly, we show that USP20 regulates actin
      cytoskeleton organization and cell migration in a manner dependent on ERK3
      expression. Our results identify USP20 as a bona fide regulator of ERK3 stability
      and physiological functions.

TI  - Thymus-Derived Regulatory T Cell Development Is Regulated by C-Type
      Lectin-Mediated BIC/MicroRNA 155 Expression.
LID - e00341-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00341-16 [doi]
AB  - Thymus-derived regulatory T (tTreg) cells are key to preventing autoimmune
      diseases, but the mechanisms involved in their development remain unsolved. Here,
      we show that the C-type lectin receptor CD69 controls tTreg cell development and 
      peripheral Treg cell homeostasis through the regulation of BIC/microRNA 155
      (miR-155) and its target, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1). Using
      Foxp3-mRFP/cd69(+/-) or Foxp3-mRFP/cd69(-/-) reporter mice and short hairpin RNA 
      (shRNA)-mediated silencing and miR-155 transfection approaches, we found that
      CD69 deficiency impaired the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5
      (STAT5) pathway in Foxp3(+) cells. This results in BIC/miR-155 inhibition,
      increased SOCS-1 expression, and severely impaired tTreg cell development in
      embryos, adults, and Rag2(-/-) gammac(-/-) hematopoietic chimeras reconstituted
      with cd69(-/-) stem cells. Accordingly, mirn155(-/-) mice have an impaired
      development of CD69(+) tTreg cells and overexpression of the miR-155-induced CD69
      pathway, suggesting that both molecules might be concomitantly activated in a
      positive-feedback loop. Moreover, in vitro-inducible CD25(+) Treg (iTreg) cell
      development is inhibited in Il2rgamma(-/-)/cd69(-/-) mice. Our data highlight the
      contribution of CD69 as a nonredundant key regulator of BIC/miR-155-dependent
      Treg cell development and homeostasis.

TI  - Gs-DREADD Knock-In Mice for Tissue-Specific, Temporal Stimulation of Cyclic AMP
      Signaling.
LID - e00584-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00584-16 [doi]
AB  - Hundreds of hormones and ligands stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in
      different tissues through the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 
      Although the functions and individual effectors of cAMP signaling are well
      characterized in many tissues, pleiotropic effects of GPCR agonists limit
      investigations of physiological functions of cAMP signaling in individual cell
      types at different developmental stages in vivo To facilitate studies of cAMP
      signaling in specific cell populations in vivo, we harnessed the power of DREADD 
      (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) technology by
      creating ROSA26-based knock-in mice for the conditional expression of a
      Gs-coupled DREADD (rM3Ds-green fluorescent protein [GFP], or "GsD"). After Cre
      recombinase expression, GsD is activated temporally by the administration of the 
      ligand clozapine N-oxide (CNO). In the same allele, we engineered a
      CREB-luciferase reporter transgene for noninvasive bioluminescence monitoring of 
      CREB activity. After viral delivery of Cre recombinase to hepatocytes in vivo,
      GsD is expressed and allows CNO-dependent cAMP signaling and glycogen breakdown. 
      The long-term expression of GsD in the liver results in constitutive CREB
      activity and hyperglycemia. ROSA26-Gs-DREADD mice can be used to study the
      physiological effects of cAMP signaling, acute or chronic, in liver or any tissue
      or cell type for which transgenic or viral Cre drivers are available.

TI  - Chromatin Domain Organization of the TCRb Locus and Its Perturbation by Ectopic
      CTCF Binding.
LID - e00557-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00557-16 [doi]
AB  - CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions influence organization and function of
      mammalian genome in diverse ways. We analyzed the interactions among CTCF binding
      sites (CBS) at the murine TCRb locus to discern the role of CTCF-mediated
      interactions in the regulation of transcription and VDJ recombination. Chromosome
      conformation capture analysis revealed thymocyte-specific long-range
      intrachromosomal interactions among various CBS across the locus that were
      relevant for defining the limit of the enhancer Eb-regulated recombination center
      (RC) and for facilitating the spatial proximity of TCRb variable (V) gene
      segments to the RC. Ectopic CTCF binding in the RC region, effected via genetic
      manipulation, altered CBS-directed chromatin loops, interfered with RC
      establishment, and reduced the spatial proximity of the RC with Trbv segments.
      Changes in chromatin loop organization by ectopic CTCF binding were relatively
      modest but influenced transcription and VDJ recombination dramatically. Besides
      revealing the importance of CTCF-mediated chromatin organization for TCRb
      regulation, the observed chromatin loops were consistent with the emerging idea
      that CBS orientations influence chromatin loop organization and underscored the
      importance of CBS orientations for defining chromatin architecture that supports 
      VDJ recombination. Further, our study suggests that in addition to mediating
      long-range chromatin interactions, CTCF influences intricate configuration of
      chromatin loops that govern functional interactions between elements.

TI  - L2hgdh Deficiency Accumulates l-2-Hydroxyglutarate with Progressive
      Leukoencephalopathy and Neurodegeneration.
LID - e00492-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00492-16 [doi]
AB  - l-2-Hydroxyglutarate aciduria (L-2-HGA) is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic 
      disorder caused by a mutation in the l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) 
      gene. In this study, we generated L2hgdh knockout (KO) mice and observed a robust
      increase of l-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) levels in multiple tissues. The highest
      levels of L-2-HG were observed in the brain and testis, with a corresponding
      increase in histone methylation in these tissues. L2hgdh KO mice exhibit white
      matter abnormalities, extensive gliosis, microglia-mediated neuroinflammation,
      and an expansion of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Moreover, L2hgdh
      deficiency leads to impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis and late-onset
      neurodegeneration in mouse brains. Our data provide in vivo evidence that L2hgdh 
      mutation leads to L-2-HG accumulation, leukoencephalopathy, and neurodegeneration
      in mice, thereby offering new insights into the pathophysiology of L-2-HGA in
      humans.

TI  - Effects of Mutations on the Aggregation Propensity of the Human Prion-Like
      Protein hnRNPA2B1.
LID - e00652-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00652-16 [doi]
AB  - Hundreds of human proteins contain prion-like domains, which are a subset of
      low-complexity domains with high amino acid compositional similarity to yeast
      prion domains. A recently characterized mutation in the prion-like domain of the 
      human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNPA2B1 increases the aggregation
      propensity of the protein and causes multisystem proteinopathy. The mutant
      protein forms cytoplasmic inclusions when expressed in Drosophila, the mutation
      accelerates aggregation in vitro, and the mutant prion-like domain can substitute
      for a portion of a yeast prion domain in supporting prion activity. To examine
      the relationship between amino acid sequence and aggregation propensity, we made 
      a diverse set of point mutations in the hnRNPA2B1 prion-like domain. We found
      that the effects on prion formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and aggregation
      in vitro could be predicted entirely based on amino acid composition. However,
      composition was an imperfect predictor of inclusion formation in Drosophila;
      while most mutations showed similar behaviors in yeast, in vitro, and in
      Drosophila, a few showed anomalous behavior. Collectively, these results
      demonstrate the significant progress that has been made in predicting the effects
      of mutations on intrinsic aggregation propensity while also highlighting the
      challenges of predicting the effects of mutations in more complex organisms.

TI  - Osteogenesis Is Improved by Low Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Concentration through
      the Modulation of Gs-Coupled Receptor Signals.
LID - e00442-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00442-16 [doi]
AB  - In the early phase of bone damage, low concentrations of the cytokine tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) favor osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, 
      chronic high doses of the same cytokine contribute to bone loss, demonstrating
      opposite effects depending on its concentration and on the time of exposure. In
      the bone microenvironment, TNF-alpha modulates the expression/function of
      different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and of their regulatory proteins,
      GPCR-regulated kinases (GRKs), thus dictating their final biological outcome in
      controlling bone anabolic processes. Here, the effects of TNF-alpha were
      investigated on the expression/responsiveness of the A2B adenosine receptor
      (A2BAR), a Gs-coupled receptor that promotes mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
      differentiation into osteoblasts. Low TNF-alpha concentrations exerted a
      prodifferentiating effect on MSCs, pushing them toward an osteoblast phenotype.
      By regulating GRK2 turnover and expression, the cytokine impaired A2BAR
      desensitization, accelerating receptor-mediated osteoblast differentiation. These
      data supported the anabolic effect of TNF-alpha submaximal concentration and
      demonstrated that the cytokine regulates GPCR responses by interfering with the
      receptor desensitization machinery, thereby enhancing the anabolic responses
      evoked by A2BAR ligands. Overall, these results indicated that GPCR
      desensitization plays a pivotal role in osteogenesis and that its manipulation is
      an effective strategy to favor bone remodeling.

      Immune Synapse Organization.
LID - e00424-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00424-16 [doi]
AB  - Antigen-specific adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC)
      during the formation of the immunological synapse (IS) is mediated by LFA-1 and
      ICAM-1. Here, LFA-1-ICAM-1 interactions were measured at the single-molecule
      level on supported lipid bilayers. High-affinity binding was detected at low
      frequencies in the inner peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC) zone
      that contained high levels of activated Rap1 and kindlin-3. Rap1 was essential
      for T cell attachment, whereas deficiencies of ste20-like kinases, Mst1/Mst2,
      diminished high-affinity binding and abrogated central SMAC (cSMAC) formation
      with mislocalized kindlin-3 and vesicle transport regulators involved in T cell
      receptor recycling/releasing machineries, resulting in impaired T cell-APC
      interactions. We found that NDR1 kinase, activated by the Rap1 signaling cascade 
      through RAPL and Mst1/Mst2, associated with and recruited kindlin-3 to the IS,
      which was required for high-affinity LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding and cSMAC formation.
      Our findings reveal crucial roles for Rap1 signaling via NDR1 for recruitment of 
      kindlin-3 and IS organization.

TI  - The PP2A-B56 Phosphatase Opposes Cyclin E Autocatalytic Degradation via
      Site-Specific Dephosphorylation.
LID - e00657-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00657-16 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin E, in conjunction with its catalytic partner cyclin-dependent kinase 2
      (CDK2), regulates cell cycle progression as cells exit quiescence and enter
      S-phase. Multiple mechanisms control cyclin E periodicity during the cell cycle, 
      including phosphorylation-dependent cyclin E ubiquitylation by the SCF(Fbw7)
      ubiquitin ligase. Serine 384 (S384) is the critical cyclin E phosphorylation site
      that stimulates Fbw7 binding and cyclin E ubiquitylation and degradation. Because
      S384 is autophosphorylated by bound CDK2, this presents a paradox as to how
      cyclin E can evade autocatalytically induced degradation in order to
      phosphorylate its other substrates. We found that S384 phosphorylation is
      dynamically regulated in cells and that cyclin E is specifically dephosphorylated
      at S384 by the PP2A-B56 phosphatase, thereby uncoupling cyclin E degradation from
      cyclin E-CDK2 activity. Furthermore, the rate of S384 dephosphorylation is high
      in interphase but low in mitosis. This provides a mechanism whereby interphase
      cells can oppose autocatalytic cyclin E degradation and maintain cyclin E-CDK2
      activity while also enabling cyclin E destruction in mitosis, when inappropriate 
      cyclin E expression is genotoxic.

TI  - p97 Negatively Regulates NRF2 by Extracting Ubiquitylated NRF2 from the
      KEAP1-CUL3 E3 Complex.
LID - e00660-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00660-16 [doi]
AB  - Activation of the stress-responsive transcription factor NRF2 is the major line
      of defense to combat oxidative or electrophilic insults. Under basal conditions, 
      NRF2 is continuously ubiquitylated by the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase
      complex and is targeted to the proteasome for degradation (the canonical
      mechanism). However, the path from the CUL3 complex to ultimate proteasomal
      degradation was previously unknown. p97 is a ubiquitin-targeted ATP-dependent
      segregase that extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from membranes, protein
      complexes, or chromatin and has an essential role in autophagy and the ubiquitin 
      proteasome system (UPS). In this study, we show that p97 negatively regulates
      NRF2 through the canonical pathway by extracting ubiquitylated NRF2 from the
      KEAP1-CUL3 E3 complex, with the aid of the heterodimeric cofactor UFD1/NPL4 and
      the UBA-UBX-containing protein UBXN7, for efficient proteasomal degradation.
      Given the role of NRF2 in chemoresistance and the surging interest in p97
      inhibitors to treat cancers, our results indicate that dual p97/NRF2 inhibitors
      may offer a more potent and long-term avenue of p97-targeted treatment.

TI  - Derepression of the DNA Methylation Machinery of the Gata1 Gene Triggers the
      Differentiation Cue for Erythropoiesis.
LID - e00592-16 [pii]

AB  - GATA1 is a critical regulator of erythropoiesis. While the mechanisms underlying 
      the high-level expression of GATA1 in maturing erythroid cells have been studied 
      extensively, the initial activation of the Gata1 gene in early hematopoietic
      progenitors remains to be elucidated. We previously identified a hematopoietic
      stem and progenitor cell (HSPC)-specific silencer element (the Gata1
      methylation-determining region [G1MDR]) that recruits DNA methyltransferase 1
      (Dnmt1) and provokes methylation of the Gata1 gene enhancer. In the present
      study, we hypothesized that removal of the G1MDR-mediated silencing machinery is 
      the molecular basis of the initial activation of the Gata1 gene and
      erythropoiesis. To address this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mouse lines
      harboring a Gata1 bacterial artificial chromosome in which the G1MDR was deleted.
      The mice exhibited abundant GATA1 expression in HSPCs, in a GATA2-dependent
      manner. The ectopic GATA1 expression repressed Gata2 transcription and induced
      erythropoiesis and apoptosis of HSPCs. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Dnmt1 in 
      HSPCs activated Gata1 expression and depleted HSPCs, thus recapitulating the HSC 
      phenotype associated with GATA1 gain of function. These results demonstrate that 
      the G1MDR holds the key to HSPC maintenance and suggest that release from this
      suppressive mechanism is a fundamental requirement for subsequent initiation of
      erythroid differentiation.

TI  - ISLET1-Dependent beta-Catenin/Hedgehog Signaling Is Required for Outgrowth of the
      Lower Jaw.
LID - e00590-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00590-16 [doi]
AB  - Mandibular patterning information initially resides in the epithelium during
      development. However, how transcriptional regulation of epithelium-derived
      signaling controls morphogenesis of the mandible remains elusive. Using Shh(Cre) 
      to target the mandibular epithelium, we ablated transcription factor Islet1,
      resulting in a distally truncated mandible via unbalanced cell apoptosis and
      decreased cell proliferation in the distal mesenchyme. Loss of Islet1 caused a
      lack of cartilage at the distal tip, leading the fusion of two growing mandibular
      elements surrounding the rostral process of Meckel's cartilage. Loss of Islet1
      results in dysregulation of mesenchymal genes important for morphogenesis of the 
      mandibular arch. We revealed that Islet1 is required for the activation of
      epithelial beta-catenin signaling via repression of Wnt antagonists. Reactivation
      of beta-catenin in the epithelium of the Islet1 mutant rescued mandibular
      morphogenesis through sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling to the mesenchyme.
      Furthermore, overexpression of a transgenic hedgehog ligand in the epithelium
      also partially restored outgrowth of the mandible. These data reveal functional
      roles for an ISLET1-dependent network integrating beta-catenin/SHH signals in
      mesenchymal cell survival and outgrowth of the mandible during development.

TI  - FBXL5 Inactivation in Mouse Brain Induces Aberrant Proliferation of Neural Stem
      Progenitor Cells.
LID - e00470-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00470-16 [doi]
AB  - FBXL5 is the substrate recognition subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase that
      serves as a master regulator of iron metabolism in mammalian cells. We previously
      showed that mice with systemic deficiency of FBXL5 fail to sense intracellular
      iron levels and die in utero at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) as a result of iron
      overload and subsequent oxidative stress. This early embryonic mortality has thus
      impeded study of the role of FBXL5 in brain development. We have now generated
      mice lacking FBXL5 specifically in nestin-expressing neural stem progenitor cells
      (NSPCs) in the brain. Unexpectedly, the mutant embryos manifested a progressive
      increase in the number of NSPCs and astroglia in the cerebral cortex.
      Stabilization of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) as a result of FBXL5 deficiency
      led to accumulation of ferrous and ferric iron as well as to generation of
      reactive oxygen species. Pharmacological manipulation suggested that the
      phenotypes of FBXL5 deficiency are attributable to aberrant activation of
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Our results thus show that FBXL5 
      contributes to regulation of NSPC proliferation during mammalian brain
      development.

TI  - Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 Phosphorylate Gab2 To Promote a
      Negative-Feedback Loop That Attenuates Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Akt Signaling.
LID - e00357-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00357-16 [doi]
AB  - The scaffolding adapter protein Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder) promotes cell
      proliferation, survival, and motility by engaging several signaling pathways
      downstream of growth factor and cytokine receptors. In particular, Gab2 plays
      essential roles in mast cells, as it is required for phosphoinositide 3-kinase
      (PI3K) activation in response to Kit and the high-affinity IgE receptor. While
      the positive role of Gab2 in PI3K signaling is well documented, very little is
      known about the mechanisms that attenuate its function. Here we show that Gab2
      becomes phosphorylated on multiple proline-directed sites upon stimulation of the
      Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. We demonstrate
      that ERK1 and ERK2 interact with Gab2 via a novel docking motif, which is
      required for subsequent Gab2 phosphorylation in response to ERK1/2 activation. We
      identified four ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation sites in Gab2 that prevent the
      recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. Using bone marrow-derived mast
      cells to study Gab2-dependent signaling, we found that the inhibition of ERK1/2
      activity promotes Akt signaling in response to Kit and the high-affinity IgE
      receptor. Together, our results indicate that ERK1/2 participates in a
      negative-feedback loop that attenuates PI3K/Akt signaling in response to various 
      agonists.

TI  - TOR Complex 2-Regulated Protein Kinase Fpk1 Stimulates Endocytosis via Inhibition
      of Ark1/Prk1-Related Protein Kinase Akl1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - e00627-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00627-16 [doi]
AB  - Depending on the stress, plasma membrane alterations activate or inhibit yeast
      target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 2, which, in turn, upregulates or downregulates
      the activity of its essential downstream effector, protein kinase Ypk1. Through
      phosphorylation of multiple substrates, Ypk1 controls many processes that restore
      homeostasis. One such substrate is protein kinase Fpk1, which is negatively
      regulated by Ypk1. Fpk1 phosphorylates and stimulates flippases that translocate 
      aminoglycerophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma
      membrane. Fpk1 has additional roles, but other substrates were uncharacterized.
      We show that Fpk1 phosphorylates and inhibits protein kinase Akl1, related to
      protein kinases Ark1 and Prk1, which modulate the dynamics of actin
      patch-mediated endocytosis. Akl1 has two Fpk1 phosphorylation sites (Ark1 and
      Prk1 have none) and is hypophosphorylated when Fpk1 is absent. Conversely, under 
      conditions that inactivate TORC2-Ypk1 signaling, which alleviates Fpk1
      inhibition, Akl1 is hyperphosphorylated. Monitoring phosphorylation of known Akl1
      substrates (Sla1 and Ent2) confirmed that Akl1 is hyperactive when not
      phosphorylated by Fpk1. Fpk1-mediated negative regulation of Akl1 enhances
      endocytosis, because an Akl1 mutant immune to Fpk1 phosphorylation causes faster 
      dissociation of Sla1 from actin patches, confers elevated resistance to
      doxorubicin (a toxic compound whose entry requires endocytosis), and impedes
      Lucifer yellow uptake (a marker of fluid phase endocytosis). Thus, TORC2-Ypk1, by
      regulating Fpk1-mediated phosphorylation of Akl1, adjusts the rate of
      endocytosis.

TI  - Checkpoint-Independent Regulation of Origin Firing by Mrc1 through Interaction
      with Hsk1 Kinase.
LID - e00355-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00355-16 [doi]
AB  - Mrc1 is a conserved checkpoint mediator protein that transduces the replication
      stress signal to the downstream effector kinase. The loss of mrc1 checkpoint
      activity results in the aberrant activation of late/dormant origins in the
      presence of hydroxyurea. Mrc1 was also suggested to regulate orders of early
      origin firing in a checkpoint-independent manner, but its mechanism was unknown. 
      Here we identify HBS (Hsk1 bypass segment) on Mrc1. An DeltaHBS mutant does not
      activate late/dormant origin firing in the presence of hydroxyurea but causes the
      precocious and enhanced activation of weak early-firing origins during normal
      S-phase progression and bypasses the requirement for Hsk1 for growth. This may be
      caused by the disruption of intramolecular binding between HBS and NTHBS
      (N-terminal target of HBS). Hsk1 binds to Mrc1 through HBS and phosphorylates a
      segment adjacent to NTHBS, disrupting the intramolecular interaction. We propose 
      that Mrc1 exerts a "brake" on initiation (through intramolecular interactions)
      and that this brake can be released (upon the loss of intramolecular
      interactions) by either the Hsk1-mediated phosphorylation of Mrc1 or the deletion
      of HBS (or a phosphomimic mutation of putative Hsk1 target serine/threonine),
      which can bypass the function of Hsk1 for growth. The brake mechanism may explain
      the checkpoint-independent regulation of early origin firing in fission yeast.

TI  - A Two-Tiered Mechanism Enables Localized Cdc42 Signaling during Enterocyte
      Polarization.
LID - e00547-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00547-16 [doi]
AB  - Signaling by the small GTPase Cdc42 governs a diverse set of cellular processes
      that contribute to tissue morphogenesis. Since these processes often require
      highly localized signaling, Cdc42 activity must be clustered in order to prevent 
      ectopic signaling. During cell polarization, apical Cdc42 signaling directs the
      positioning of the nascent apical membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms
      that drive Cdc42 clustering during polarity establishment are largely unknown.
      Here, we demonstrate that during cell polarization localized Cdc42 signaling is
      enabled via activity-dependent control of Cdc42 mobility. By performing
      photoconversion experiments, we show that inactive Cdc42-GDP is 30-fold more
      mobile than active Cdc42-GTP. This switch in apical mobility originates from a
      dual mechanism involving RhoGDI-mediated membrane dissociation of Cdc42-GDP and
      Tuba-mediated immobilization of Cdc42-GTP. Interference with either mechanism
      affects Cdc42 clustering and as a consequence impairs Cdc42-mediated apical
      membrane clustering. We therefore identify a molecular network, comprised of
      Cdc42, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Tuba, and RhoGDI, that
      enables differential diffusion of inactive and active Cdc42 and is required to
      establish localized Cdc42 signaling during enterocyte polarization.

TI  - mTORC1 Plays an Important Role in Skeletal Development by Controlling
      Preosteoblast Differentiation.
LID - e00668-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00668-16 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated by
      extracellular factors that control bone accrual. However, the direct role of this
      complex in osteoblast biology remains to be determined. To investigate this
      question, we disrupted mTORC1 function in preosteoblasts by targeted deletion of 
      Raptor (Rptor) in Osterix-expressing cells. Deletion of Rptor resulted in reduced
      limb length that was associated with smaller epiphyseal growth plates in the
      postnatal skeleton. Rptor deletion caused a marked reduction in pre- and
      postnatal bone accrual, which was evident in skeletal elements derived from both 
      intramembranous and endochondrial ossification. The decrease in bone accrual, as 
      well as the associated increase in skeletal fragility, was due to a reduction in 
      osteoblast function. In vitro, osteoblasts derived from knockout mice display a
      reduced osteogenic potential, and an assessment of bone-developmental markers in 
      Rptor knockout osteoblasts revealed a transcriptional profile consistent with an 
      immature osteoblast phenotype suggesting that osteoblast differentiation was
      stalled early in osteogenesis. Metabolic labeling and an assessment of cell size 
      of Rptor knockout osteoblasts revealed a significant decrease in protein
      synthesis, a major driver of cell growth. These findings demonstrate that mTORC1 
      plays an important role in skeletal development by regulating mRNA translation
      during preosteoblast differentiation.

TI  - KLHL3 Knockout Mice Reveal the Physiological Role of KLHL3 and the
      Pathophysiology of Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type II Caused by Mutant KLHL3.
LID - e00508-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00508-16 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the with-no-lysine kinase 1 (WNK1), WNK4, kelch-like 3 (KLHL3), and 
      cullin3 (CUL3) genes are known to cause the hereditary disease
      pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII). It was recently demonstrated that this
      results from the defective degradation of WNK1 and WNK4 by the KLHL3/CUL3
      ubiquitin ligase complex. However, the other physiological in vivo roles of KLHL3
      remain unclear. Therefore, here we generated KLHL3(-/-) mice that expressed
      beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) under the control of the endogenous KLHL3 promoter.
      Immunoblots of beta-Gal and LacZ staining revealed that KLHL3 was expressed in
      some organs, such as brain. However, the expression levels of WNK kinases were
      not increased in any of these organs other than the kidney, where WNK1 and WNK4
      increased in KLHL3(-/-) mice but not in KLHL3(+/-) mice. KLHL3(-/-) mice also
      showed PHAII-like phenotypes, whereas KLHL3(+/-) mice did not. This clearly
      demonstrates that the heterozygous deletion of KLHL3 was not sufficient to cause 
      PHAII, indicating that autosomal dominant type PHAII is caused by the dominant
      negative effect of mutant KLHL3. We further demonstrated that the dimerization of
      KLHL3 can explain this dominant negative effect. These findings could help us to 
      further understand the physiological roles of KLHL3 and the pathophysiology of
      PHAII caused by mutant KLHL3.

TI  - D120 and K152 within the PH Domain of T Cell Adapter SKAP55 Regulate Plasma
      Membrane Targeting of SKAP55 and LFA-1 Affinity Modulation in Human T
      Lymphocytes.
LID - e00509-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00509-16 [doi]
AB  - The beta2-integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) is needed for
      the T cell receptor (TCR)-induced activation of LFA-1 to promote T cell adhesion 
      and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). LFA-1-mediated cell-cell
      interactions are critical for proper T cell differentiation and proliferation.
      The Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa (SKAP55) is a key regulator of
      TCR-mediated LFA-1 signaling (inside-out/outside-in signaling). To gain an
      understanding of how SKAP55 controls TCR-mediated LFA-1 activation, we assessed
      the functional role of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. We identified two
      critical amino acid residues within the PH domain of SKAP55, aspartic acid 120
      (D120) and lysine 152 (K152). D120 facilitates the retention of SKAP55 in the
      cytoplasm of nonstimulated T cells, while K152 promotes SKAP55 membrane
      recruitment via actin binding upon TCR triggering. Importantly, the
      K152-dependent interaction of the PH domain with actin promotes the binding of
      talin to LFA-1, thus facilitating LFA-1 activation. These data suggest that K152 
      and D120 within the PH domain of SKAP55 regulate plasma membrane targeting and
      TCR-mediated activation of LFA-1.

TI  - Activation-Dependent TRAF3 Exon 8 Alternative Splicing Is Controlled by CELF2 and
      hnRNP C Binding to an Upstream Intronic Element.
LID - e00488-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00488-16 [doi]
AB  - Cell-type-specific and inducible alternative splicing has a fundamental impact on
      regulating gene expression and cellular function in a variety of settings,
      including activation and differentiation. We have recently shown that
      activation-induced skipping of TRAF3 exon 8 activates noncanonical NF-kappaB
      signaling upon T cell stimulation, but the regulatory basis for this splicing
      event remains unknown. Here we identify cis- and trans-regulatory elements
      rendering this splicing switch activation dependent and cell type specific. The
      cis-acting element is located 340 to 440 nucleotides upstream of the regulated
      exon and acts in a distance-dependent manner, since altering the location reduces
      its activity. A small interfering RNA screen, followed by cross-link
      immunoprecipitation and mutational analyses, identified CELF2 and hnRNP C as
      trans-acting factors that directly bind the regulatory sequence and together
      mediate increased exon skipping in activated T cells. CELF2 expression levels
      correlate with TRAF3 exon skipping in several model systems, suggesting that
      CELF2 is the decisive factor, with hnRNP C being necessary but not sufficient.
      These data suggest an interplay between CELF2 and hnRNP C as the mechanistic
      basis for activation-dependent alternative splicing of TRAF3 exon 8 and
      additional exons and uncover an intronic splicing silencer whose full activity
      depends on the precise location more than 300 nucleotides upstream of the
      regulated exon.

TI  - SETD4 Regulates Cell Quiescence and Catalyzes the Trimethylation of H4K20 during 
      Diapause Formation in Artemia.
LID - e00453-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00453-16 [doi]
AB  - As a prominent characteristic of cell life, the regulation of cell quiescence is 
      important for proper development, regeneration, and stress resistance and may
      play a role in certain degenerative diseases. However, the mechanism underlying
      quiescence remains largely unknown. Encysted embryos of Artemia are useful for
      studying the regulation of this state because they remain quiescent for prolonged
      periods during diapause, a state of obligate dormancy. In the present study, SET 
      domain-containing protein 4, a histone lysine methyltransferase from Artemia, was
      identified, characterized, and named Ar-SETD4. We found that Ar-SETD4 was
      expressed abundantly in Artemia diapause embryos, in which cells were in a
      quiescent state. Meanwhile, trimethylated histone H4K20 (H4K20me3) was enriched
      in diapause embryos. The knockdown of Ar-SETD4 reduced the level of H4K20me3
      significantly and prevented the formation of diapause embryos in which neither
      the cell cycle nor embryogenesis ceased. The catalytic activity of Ar-SETD4 on
      H4K20me3 was confirmed by an in vitro histone methyltransferase (HMT) assay and
      overexpression in cell lines. This study provides insights into the function of
      SETD4 and the mechanism of cell quiescence regulation.

TI  - HuR Enhances Early Restitution of the Intestinal Epithelium by Increasing Cdc42
      Translation.
LID - e00574-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00574-16 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian intestinal mucosa exhibits a spectrum of responses after acute
      injury and repairs itself rapidly to restore the epithelial integrity. The
      RNA-binding protein HuR regulates the stability and translation of target mRNAs
      and is involved in many aspects of gut epithelium homeostasis, but its exact role
      in the regulation of mucosal repair after injury remains unknown. We show here
      that HuR is essential for early intestinal epithelial restitution by increasing
      the expression of cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) at the
      posttranscriptional level. HuR bound to the Cdc42 mRNA via its 3' untranslated
      region, and this association specifically enhanced Cdc42 translation without an
      effect on the Cdc42 mRNA level. Intestinal epithelium-specific HuR knockout not
      only decreased Cdc42 levels in mucosal tissues, but it also inhibited repair of
      damaged mucosa induced by mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion in the small intestine 
      and by dextran sulfate sodium in the colon. Furthermore, Cdc42 silencing
      prevented HuR-mediated stimulation of cell migration over the wounded area by
      altering the subcellular distribution of F-actin. These results indicate that HuR
      promotes early intestinal mucosal repair after injury by increasing Cdc42
      translation and demonstrate the importance of HuR deficiency in the pathogenesis 
      of delayed mucosal healing in certain pathological conditions.

TI  - Interactome Analysis Reveals a Novel Role for RAD6 in the Regulation of
      Proteasome Activity and Localization in Response to DNA Damage.
LID - e00419-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00419-16 [doi]
AB  - RAD6, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is a key node for determining different
      DNA damage repair pathways, controlling both the error-prone and the error-free
      DNA damage repair pathways through differential regulation of the ubiquitination 
      of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein. However, whether other 
      pathways are involved in the RAD6-mediated regulation of DNA damage repair is
      still unclear. To deeply understand the molecular mechanisms of RAD6 in DNA
      damage repair, we performed a proteomic analysis and identified the changes of
      the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of RAD6 before and after X-ray
      irradiation. Furthermore, our study indicated that a proteasome-related event is 
      likely involved in the DNA damage repair process. Moreover, we found that RAD6
      promotes proteasome activity and nuclear translocation by enhancing the
      degradation of PSMF1 and the lamin B receptor (LBR). Therefore, we provide a
      novel pathway that is employed by RAD6 in response to DNA damage.

LID - e00500-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00500-16 [doi]
AB  - The partially understood phosphoinositide signaling cascade regulates multiple
      aspects of cellular metabolism. Previous studies revealed that INPP5E, the
      inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase that is mutated in the developmental
      disorders Joubert and MORM syndromes, is essential for the function of the
      primary cilium and maintenance of phosphoinositide balance in nondividing cells. 
      Here, we report that INPP5E further contributes to cellular homeostasis by
      regulating cell division. We found that silencing or genetic knockout of INPP5E
      in human and murine cells impairs the spindle assembly checkpoint, centrosome and
      spindle function, and maintenance of chromosomal integrity. Consistent with a
      cell cycle regulatory role, we found that INPP5E expression is cell cycle
      dependent, peaking at mitotic entry. INPP5E localizes to centrosomes,
      chromosomes, and kinetochores in early mitosis and shuttles to the midzone
      spindle at mitotic exit. Our findings identify the previously unknown, essential 
      role of INPP5E in mitosis and prevention of aneuploidy, providing a new
      perspective on the function of this phosphoinositide phosphatase in health and
      development.

TI  - Myocyte-Derived Hsp90 Modulates Collagen Upregulation via Biphasic Activation of 
      STAT-3 in Fibroblasts during Cardiac Hypertrophy.
LID - e00611-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00611-16 [doi]
AB  - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3)-mediated signaling in
      relation to upregulated collagen expression in fibroblasts during cardiac
      hypertrophy is well defined. Our recent findings have identified heat shock
      protein 90 (Hsp90) to be a critical modulator of fibrotic signaling in cardiac
      fibroblasts in this disease milieu. The present study was therefore intended to
      analyze the role of Hsp90 in the STAT-3-mediated collagen upregulation process.
      Our data revealed a significant difference between in vivo and in vitro results, 
      pointing to a possible involvement of myocyte-fibroblast cross talk in this
      process. Cardiomyocyte-targeted knockdown of Hsp90 in rats (Rattus norvegicus) in
      which the renal artery was ligated showed downregulated collagen synthesis.
      Furthermore, the results obtained with cardiac fibroblasts conditioned with
      Hsp90-inhibited hypertrophied myocyte supernatant pointed toward cardiomyocytes' 
      role in the regulation of collagen expression in fibroblasts during hypertrophy. 
      Our study also revealed a novel signaling mechanism where myocyte-derived Hsp90
      orchestrates not only p65-mediated interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis but also its
      release in exosomal vesicles. Such myocyte-derived exosomes and myocyte-secreted 
      IL-6 are responsible in unison for the biphasic activation of STAT-3 signaling in
      cardiac fibroblasts that culminates in excess collagen synthesis, leading to
      severely compromised cardiac function during cardiac hypertrophy.

      repairs AP sites in mammalian cells is the AP endonuclease (APE1), which
      functions through the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Although the mechanism 
      by which APE1 repairs AP sites in vitro has been extensively investigated, it is 
      largely unknown how APE1 repairs AP sites in cells. Here, we show that APE1 is
      acetylated (AcAPE1) after binding to the AP sites in chromatin and that AcAPE1 is
      exclusively present on chromatin throughout the cell cycle. Positive charges of
      acetylable lysine residues in the N-terminal domain of APE1 are essential for
      chromatin association. Acetylation-mediated neutralization of the positive
      charges of the lysine residues in the N-terminal domain of APE1 induces a
      conformational change; this in turn enhances the AP endonuclease activity of
      APE1. In the absence of APE1 acetylation, cells accumulated AP sites in the
      genome and showed higher sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Thus, mammalian
      cells, unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Escherichia coli cells, require
      acetylation of APE1 for the efficient repair of AP sites and base damage in the
      genome. Our study reveals that APE1 acetylation is an integral part of the BER
      pathway for maintaining genomic integrity.

TI  - Role of Tim17 Transmembrane Regions in Regulating the Architecture of Presequence
      Translocase and Mitochondrial DNA Stability.
LID - e00491-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00491-16 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial life cycle and protein import are intricate cellular processes,
      which require precise coordination between the transport machineries of outer and
      inner mitochondrial membranes. Presequence translocase performs the indispensable
      function of translocating preproteins having N-terminal targeting sequences
      across the inner membrane. Tim23 forms the core of the voltage-gated import
      channel, while Tim17 is presumed to maintain the stoichiometry of the
      translocase. However, mechanistic insights into how Tim17 coordinates these
      regulatory events within the complex remained elusive. We demonstrate that Tim17 
      harbors conserved G/AXXXG/A motifs within its transmembrane regions and plays an 
      imperative role in the translocase assembly through interaction with Tim23.
      Tandem motifs are highly essential, as most of the amino acid substitutions lead 
      to nonviability due to the complete destabilization of the TIM23 channel.
      Importantly, Tim17 transmembrane regions regulate the dynamic assembly of
      translocase to form either the TIM23 (PAM)-complex or TIM23 (SORT)-complex by
      recruiting the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) machinery or Tim21,
      respectively. To a greater significance, tim17 mutants displayed mitochondrial
      DNA (mtDNA) instability, membrane potential loss, and defective import, resulting
      in organellar dysfunction. We conclude that the integrity of Tim17 transmembrane 
      regions is critical for mitochondrial function and protein turnover.

TI  - Asymmetric Arginine Dimethylation Modulates Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism and
      Homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans.
LID - e00504-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00504-16 [doi]
AB  - Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT-1) catalyzes asymmetric arginine
      dimethylation on cellular proteins and modulates various aspects of biological
      processes, such as signal transduction, DNA repair, and transcriptional
      regulation. We have previously reported that the null mutant of prmt-1 in
      Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a slightly shortened life span, but the
      physiological significance of PRMT-1 remains largely unclear. Here we explored
      the role of PRMT-1 in mitochondrial function as hinted by a two-dimensional
      Western blot-based proteomic study. Subcellular fractionation followed by liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis showed that PRMT-1 is
      almost entirely responsible for asymmetric arginine dimethylation on
      mitochondrial proteins. Importantly, isolated mitochondria from prmt-1 mutants
      represent compromised ATP synthesis in vitro, and whole-worm respiration in
      prmt-1 mutants is decreased in vivo Transgenic rescue experiments demonstrate
      that PRMT-1-dependent asymmetric arginine dimethylation is required to prevent
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which consequently causes
      the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded-protein response. Furthermore, the
      loss of enzymatic activity of prmt-1 induces food avoidance behavior due to
      mitochondrial dysfunction, but treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine
      significantly ameliorates this phenotype. These findings add a new layer of
      complexity to the posttranslational regulation of mitochondrial function and
      provide clues for understanding the physiological roles of PRMT-1 in
      multicellular organisms.

TI  - Role of Cwc24 in the First Catalytic Step of Splicing and Fidelity of 5' Splice
      Site Selection.
LID - e00580-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00580-16 [doi]
AB  - Cwc24 is an essential splicing factor but only transiently associates with the
      spliceosome, with an unknown function. The protein contains a RING finger and a
      zinc finger domain in the carboxyl terminus. The human ortholog of Cwc24,
      RNF113A, has been associated with the disorder trichothiodystrophy. Here, we show
      that the zinc finger domain is essential for Cwc24 function, while the RING
      finger domain is dispensable. Cwc24 binds to the spliceosome after the
      Prp19-associated complex and is released upon Prp2 action. Cwc24 is not required 
      for Prp2-mediated remodeling of the spliceosome, but the spliceosome becomes
      inactive if remodeling occurs before the addition of Cwc24. Cwc24 binds directly 
      to pre-mRNA at the 5' splice site, spanning the splice junction. In the absence
      of Cwc24, U5 and U6 modes of interaction with the 5' splice site are altered, and
      splicing is very inefficient, with aberrant cleavage at the 5' splice site. Our
      data suggest roles for Cwc24 in orchestrating organization of the spliceosome
      into an active configuration prior to Prp2-mediated spliceosome remodeling and in
      promoting specific interaction of U5 and U6 with the 5' splice site for fidelity 
      of 5' splice site selection.

TI  - ArfGAP Domain-Containing Protein 2 (ADAP2) Integrates Upstream and Downstream
      Modules of RIG-I Signaling and Facilitates Type I Interferon Production.
LID - e00537-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00537-16 [doi]
AB  - Transcription of type I interferon genes during RNA virus infection requires
      signal communication between several pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-adaptor
      complexes located at distinct subcellular membranous compartments and a central
      cytoplasmic TBK1-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) kinase-transcription
      factor module. However, how the cell integrates signal transduction through
      spatially distinct modules of antiviral signaling pathways is less defined. RIG-I
      is a major cytosolic PRR involved in the control of several RNA viruses. Here we 
      identify ArfGAP domain-containing protein 2 (ADAP2) as a key novel scaffolding
      protein that integrates different modules of the RIG-I pathway, located at
      distinct subcellular locations, and mediates cellular antiviral type I interferon
      production. ADAP2 served to bridge the mitochondrial membrane-bound upstream
      RIG-I adaptor MAVS and the downstream cytosolic complex of NEMO (regulatory
      subunit of TBK1), TBK1, and IRF3, leading to IRF3 phosphorylation. Furthermore,
      independently, ADAP2 also functioned as a major orchestrator of the interaction
      of TBK1 with NEMO and IRF3. Mutational and in vitro cell-free reconstituted RIG-I
      signaling assay-based analyses identified that the ArfGAP domain of ADAP2
      mediates the interferon response. TRAF3 acted as a trigger for ADAP2 to recruit
      RIG-I pathway component proteins into a single macromolecular complex. This study
      provides important novel insights into the assembly and integration of different 
      modules of antiviral signaling cascades.

TI  - Snail-Modulated MicroRNA 493 Forms a Negative Feedback Loop with the Insulin-Like
      Growth Factor 1 Receptor Pathway and Blocks Tumorigenesis.
LID - e00510-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00510-16 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we have identified one microRNA, microRNA 493 (miR-493), which
      could simultaneously and directly regulate multiple genes downstream of the
      insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) pathway, including IGF1R, by
      binding with complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs
      of IGF1R, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and mitogen-activated protein
      kinase 1 (MAPK1), thereby potentiating their inhibitory function at multiple
      levels in development and progression of cancers. This binding was further
      confirmed by pulldown of miR with AGO-2 antibody. Further, results from head and 
      neck samples showed that miR-493 levels were significantly downregulated in
      tumors, with a concomitant increase in the expression of IGF1R and key downstream
      effectors. Functional studies from miR-493 overexpression cells and nude-mouse
      models revealed the tumor suppressor functions of miR-493. Regulation studies
      revealed that Snail binds to the miR-493 promoter and represses it. We found the 
      existence of a dynamic negative feedback loop in the regulation of IGF1R and
      miR-493 mediated via Snail. Our study showed that nicotine treatment
      significantly decreases the levels of miR-493-with a concomitant increase in the 
      levels of Snail-an indication of progression of cells toward tumorigenesis,
      reestablishing the role of tobacco as a major risk factor for head and neck
      cancers and elucidating the mechanism behind nicotine-mediated tumorigenesis.

TI  - Tgif1 and Tgif2 Repress Expression of the RabGAP Evi5l.
LID - e00527-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00527-16 [doi]
AB  - Mouse embryos conditionally lacking Tgif1 and Tgif2 have holoprosencephaly and
      defects in left-right asymmetry. To identify pathways affected by loss of Tgif
      function during embryogenesis, we performed transcriptome profiling on whole
      mouse embryos. Among the genes with altered expression in embryos lacking Tgifs
      were a number with links to cilium function. One of these, Evi5l, encodes a
      RabGAP that is known to block the formation of cilia when overexpressed. Evi5l
      expression is increased in Tgif1; Tgif2-null embryos and in double-null mouse
      embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Knockdown of Tgifs in a human retinal pigment
      epithelial cell line also increased EVI5L expression. We show that TGIF1 binds to
      a conserved consensus TGIF site 5' of the human and mouse Evi5l genes and
      represses Evi5l expression. In primary MEFs lacking both Tgifs, the number of
      cells with primary cilia was significantly decreased, and we observed a reduction
      in the transcriptional response to Shh pathway activation. Reducing Evi5l
      expression in MEFs lacking Tgifs resulted in a partial restoration of cilium
      numbers and in the transcriptional response to activation of the Shh pathway. In 
      summary, this work shows that Tgifs regulate ciliogenesis and suggests that Evi5l
      mediates at least part of this effect.

TI  - Astrocyte Elevated Gene 1 Interacts with Acetyltransferase p300 and c-Jun To
      Promote Tumor Aggressiveness.
LID - e00456-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00456-16 [doi]
AB  - Astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG-1) is an oncoprotein that strongly promotes the
      development and progression of cancers. However, the detailed underlying
      mechanisms through which AEG-1 enhances tumor development and progression remain 
      to be determined. In this study, we identified c-Jun and p300 to be novel
      interacting partners of AEG-1 in gliomas. AEG-1 promoted c-Jun transcriptional
      activity by interacting with the c-Jun/p300 complex and inducing c-Jun
      acetylation. Furthermore, the AEG-1/c-Jun/p300 complex was found to bind the
      promoter of c-Jun downstream targeted genes, consequently establishing an
      acetylated chromatin state that favors transcriptional activation. Importantly,
      AEG-1/p300-mediated c-Jun acetylation resulted in the development of a more
      aggressive malignant phenotype in gliomas through a drastic increase in glioma
      cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo Consistently, the AEG-1 
      expression levels in clinical glioma specimens correlated with the status of
      c-Jun activation. Taken together, our results suggest that AEG-1 mediates a novel
      epigenetic mechanism that enhances c-Jun transcriptional activity to induce
      glioma progression and that AEG-1 might be a novel, potential target for the
      treatment of gliomas.

TI  - The Chromatin-Associated Phf12 Protein Maintains Nucleolar Integrity and Prevents
      Premature Cellular Senescence.
LID - e00522-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00522-16 [doi]
AB  - Pf1, also known as Phf12 (plant homeodomain [PHD] zinc finger protein 12), is a
      member of the PHD zinc finger family of proteins. Pf1 associates with a
      chromatin-interacting protein complex comprised of MRG15, Sin3B, and histone
      deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) that functions as a transcriptional modulator. The
      biological function of Pf1 remains largely elusive. We undertook the generation
      of Pf1 knockout mice to elucidate its physiological role. We demonstrate that Pf1
      is required for mid- to late gestation viability. Pf1 inactivation impairs the
      proliferative potential of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and is associated
      with a significant decrease in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation; an increase in
      senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity, a marker of
      cellular senescence; and elevated levels of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2A.X), a 
      marker associated with DNA double-strand breaks. Analysis of transcripts
      differentially expressed in wild-type and Pf1-deficient cells revealed the impact
      of Pf1 in multiple regulatory arms of the ribosome biogenesis pathways.
      Strikingly, assessment of the morphology of the nucleoli exposed an abnormal
      nucleolar structure in Pf1-deficient cells. Finally, proteomic analysis of the
      Pf1-interacting complexes highlighted proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis.
      Taken together, our data reveal an unsuspected function for the Pf1-associated
      chromatin complex in the ribosomal biogenesis and senescence pathways.

TI  - mTORC1 and -2 Coordinate Transcriptional and Translational Reprogramming in
      Resistance to DNA Damage and Replicative Stress in Breast Cancer Cells.
LID - e00577-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00577-16 [doi]
AB  - mTOR coordinates growth signals with metabolic pathways and protein synthesis and
      is hyperactivated in many human cancers. mTOR exists in two complexes: mTORC1,
      which stimulates protein, lipid, and ribosome biosynthesis, and mTORC2, which
      regulates cytoskeleton functions. While mTOR is known to be involved in the DNA
      damage response, little is actually known regarding the functions of mTORC1
      compared to mTORC2 in this regard or the respective impacts on transcriptional
      versus translational regulation. We show that mTORC1 and mTORC2 are both required
      to enact DNA damage repair and cell survival, resulting in increased cancer cell 
      survival during DNA damage. Together mTORC1 and -2 enact coordinated
      transcription and translation of protective cell cycle and DNA replication,
      recombination, and repair genes. This coordinated transcriptional-translational
      response to DNA damage was not impaired by rapalog inhibition of mTORC1 or
      independent inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2 but was blocked by inhibition of
      mTORC1/2. Only mTORC1/2 inhibition reversed cancer cell resistance to DNA damage 
      and replicative stress and increased tumor cell killing and tumor control by DNA 
      damage therapies in animal models. When combined with DNA damage, inhibition of
      mTORC1/2 blocked transcriptional induction more strongly than translation of DNA 
      replication, survival, and DNA damage response mRNAs.

TI  - Dormant Pluripotent Cells Emerge during Neural Differentiation of Embryonic Stem 
      Cells in a FoxO3-Dependent Manner.
LID - e00417-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00417-16 [doi]
AB  - One major concern over the clinical application of embryonic stem cell
      (ESC)-derived cells is the potentiation of latent tumorigenicity by residual
      undifferentiated cells. Despite the use of intensive methodological approaches to
      eliminate residual undifferentiated cells, the properties of these cells remain
      elusive. Here, we show that under a serum-free neural differentiation condition, 
      residual undifferentiated cells markedly delay progression of their cell cycle
      without compromising their pluripotency. This dormant pluripotency was maintained
      during reculture of the cells under a serum-free condition, whereas upon serum
      stimulation, the cells exited the dormant state and restarted proliferation and
      differentiation into all three germ layers. Microarray analysis revealed a set of
      genes that is significantly upregulated in the dormant ESCs compared with their
      levels of regulation in proliferating ESCs. Among them, we identified the
      transcription factor Forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) to be an essential regulator of the 
      maintenance of pluripotency in dormant ESCs. Our study demonstrates that the
      transition into the dormant state endows residual undifferentiated cells with
      FoxO3-dependent and leukemia inhibitory factor/serum-independent pluripotency.

TI  - Blockade of Metallothioneins 1 and 2 Increases Skeletal Muscle Mass and Strength.
LID - e00305-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00305-16 [doi]
AB  - Metallothioneins are proteins that are involved in intracellular zinc storage and
      transport. Their expression levels have been reported to be elevated in several
      settings of skeletal muscle atrophy. We therefore investigated the effect of
      metallothionein blockade on skeletal muscle anabolism in vitro and in vivo We
      found that concomitant abrogation of metallothioneins 1 and 2 results in
      activation of the Akt pathway and increases in myotube size, in type IIb fiber
      hypertrophy, and ultimately in muscle strength. Importantly, the beneficial
      effects of metallothionein blockade on muscle mass and function was also observed
      in the setting of glucocorticoid addition, which is a strong atrophy-inducing
      stimulus. Given the blockade of atrophy and the preservation of strength in
      atrophy-inducing settings, these results suggest that blockade of
      metallothioneins 1 and 2 constitutes a promising approach for the treatment of
      conditions which result in muscle atrophy.

TI  - Epithelial Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2alpha Facilitates the Progression of Colon
      Tumors through Recruiting Neutrophils.
LID - e00481-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00481-16 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a significant risk factor for colon cancer. Recent work has
      demonstrated essential roles for several infiltrating immune populations in the
      metaplastic progression following inflammation. Hypoxia and stabilization of
      hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are hallmark features of inflammation and solid 
      tumors. Previously, we demonstrated an important role for tumor epithelial
      HIF-2alpha in colon tumors; however, the function of epithelial HIF-2alpha as a
      critical link in the progression of inflammation to cancer has not been
      elucidated. In colitis-associated colon cancer models, epithelial HIF-2alpha was 
      essential in tumor growth. Concurrently, epithelial disruption of HIF-2alpha
      significantly decreased neutrophils in the colon tumor microenvironment.
      Intestinal epithelial HIF-2alpha-overexpressing mice demonstrated that neutrophil
      recruitment was a direct response to increased epithelial HIF-2alpha signaling.
      High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of HIF-2alpha-overexpressing
      mice in conjunction with data mining from the Cancer Genome Atlas showed that the
      neutrophil chemokine CXCL1 gene was highly upregulated in colon tumor epithelium 
      in a HIF-2alpha-dependent manner. Using selective peptide inhibitors of the
      CXCL1-CXCR2 signaling axis identified HIF-2alpha-dependent neutrophil recruitment
      as an essential mechanism to increase colon carcinogenesis. These studies
      demonstrate that HIF-2alpha is a novel regulator of neutrophil recruitment to
      colon tumors and that it is essential in shaping the protumorigenic inflammatory 
      microenvironment in colon cancer.

TI  - Targeting the Nuclear Cathepsin L CCAAT Displacement Protein/Cut Homeobox
      Transcription Factor-Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Pathway in Prostate and
      Breast Cancer Cells with the Z-FY-CHO Inhibitor.
LID - e00297-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00297-16 [doi]
AB  - The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes tumor migration and invasion
      by downregulating epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and upregulating
      mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. Cathepsin L (Cat L) is a cysteine protease 
      that can proteolytically activate CCAAT displacement protein/cut homeobox
      transcription factor (CUX1). We hypothesized that nuclear Cat L may promote EMT
      via CUX1 and that this could be antagonized with the Cat L-specific inhibitor
      Z-FY-CHO. Mesenchymal prostate (ARCaP-M and ARCaP-E overexpressing Snail) and
      breast (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 overexpressing Snail) cancer cells
      expressed lower E-cadherin activity, higher Snail, vimentin, and Cat L activity, 
      and a p110/p90 active CUX1 form, compared to epithelial prostate (ARCaP-E and
      ARCaP-Neo) and breast (MCF-7 and MCF-7 Neo) cancer cells. There was increased
      binding of CUX1 to Snail and the E-cadherin promoter in mesenchymal cells
      compared to epithelial prostate and breast cells. Treatment of mesenchymal cells 
      with the Cat L inhibitor Z-FY-CHO led to nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization of
      Cat L, decreased binding of CUX1 to Snail and the E-cadherin promoter, reversed
      EMT, and decreased cell migration/invasion. Overall, our novel data suggest that 
      a positive feedback loop between Snail-nuclear Cat L-CUX1 drives EMT, which can
      be antagonized by Z-FY-CHO. Therefore, Z-FY-CHO may be an important therapeutic
      tool to antagonize EMT and cancer progression.

TI  - The MLKL Channel in Necroptosis Is an Octamer Formed by Tetramers in a Dyadic
      Process.
LID - e00497-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00497-16 [doi]
AB  - Oligomerization of the mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) is
      essential for its cation channel function in necroptosis. Here we show that the
      MLKL channel is an octamer comprising two previously identified tetramers most
      likely in their side-by-side position. Intermolecule disulfide bonds are present 
      in the tetramer but are not required for octamer assembly and necroptosis. MLKL
      forms oligomers in the necrosome and is then released from the necrosome before
      or during its membrane translocation. We identified two MLKL mutants that could
      not oligomerize into octamers, although they formed a tetramer, and also, one
      MLKL mutant could spontaneously form a disulfide bond-linked octamer. Subsequent 
      analysis revealed that the tetramers fail to translocate to the plasma membrane
      and that the MLKL octamer formation depends on alpha-helices 4 and 5. While MLKL 
      could be detected from outside the cells, its N- and C-terminal ends could not be
      detected, indicating that the MLKL octamer spans across the plasma membrane,
      leaving its N and C termini inside the cell. These data allowed us to propose a
      180 degrees symmetry model of the MLKL octamer and conclude that the fully
      assembled MLKL octamers, but not the previously described tetramers, act as
      effectors of necroptosis.

TI  - Protein Kinase R Mediates the Inflammatory Response Induced by Hyperosmotic
      Stress.
LID - e00521-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00521-16 [doi]
AB  - High extracellular osmolarity results in a switch from an adaptive to an
      inflammatory gene expression program. We show that hyperosmotic stress activates 
      the protein kinase R (PKR) independently of its RNA-binding domain. In turn, PKR 
      stimulates nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 species 
      phosphorylated at serine-536, which is paralleled by the induction of a subset of
      inflammatory NF-kappaB p65-responsive genes, including inducible nitric oxide
      synthase (iNOS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1beta. The PKR-mediated
      hyperinduction of iNOS decreases cell survival in mouse embryonic fibroblasts via
      mechanisms involving nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and posttranslational
      modification of proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the PKR inhibitor C16
      ameliorates both iNOS amplification and disease-induced phenotypic breakdown of
      the intestinal epithelial barrier caused by an increase in extracellular
      osmolarity induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in vivo Collectively, these
      findings indicate that PKR activation is an essential part of the molecular
      switch from adaptation to inflammation in response to hyperosmotic stress.

TI  - A Transcription Factor Pulse Can Prime Chromatin for Heritable Transcriptional
      Memory.
LID - e00372-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00372-16 [doi]
AB  - Short-term and long-term transcriptional memory is the phenomenon whereby the
      kinetics or magnitude of gene induction is enhanced following a prior induction
      period. Short-term memory persists within one cell generation or in postmitotic
      cells, while long-term memory can survive multiple rounds of cell division. We
      have developed a tissue culture model to study the epigenetic basis for long-term
      transcriptional memory (LTTM) and subsequently used this model to better
      understand the epigenetic mechanisms that enable heritable memory of temporary
      stimuli. We find that a pulse of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding
      protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) induces LTTM on a subset of target genes that survives
      nine cell divisions. The chromatin landscape at genes that acquire LTTM is more
      repressed than at those genes that do not exhibit memory, akin to a latent state.
      We show through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chemical inhibitor
      studies that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation is important for establishing 
      memory in this model but that Pol II itself is not retained as part of the memory
      mechanism. More generally, our work reveals that a transcription factor involved 
      in lineage specification can induce LTTM and that failure to rerepress chromatin 
      is one epigenetic mechanism underlying transcriptional memory.

TI  - Casein Kinase 2 Is Linked to Stress Granule Dynamics through Phosphorylation of
      the Stress Granule Nucleating Protein G3BP1.
LID - e00596-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00596-16 [doi]
AB  - Stress granules (SGs) are large macromolecular aggregates that contain
      translation initiation complexes and mRNAs. Stress granule formation coincides
      with translational repression, and stress granules actively signal to mediate
      cell fate decisions by signaling to the translation apparatus to (i) maintain
      translational repression, (ii) mount various transcriptional responses, including
      innate immunity, and (iii) repress apoptosis. Previous work showed that G3BP1 is 
      phosphorylated at serine 149, which regulates G3BP1 oligomerization, stress
      granule assembly, and RNase activity intrinsic to G3BP1. However, the kinase that
      phosphorylates G3BP1 was not identified, leaving a key step in stress granule
      regulation uncharacterized. Here, using chemical inhibition, genetic depletion,
      and overexpression experiments, we show that casein kinase 2 (CK2) promotes
      stress granule dynamics. These results link CK2 activity with SG disassembly. We 
      also show that casein kinase 2 phosphorylates G3BP1 at serine 149 in vitro and in
      cells. These data support a role for casein kinase 2 in regulation of protein
      synthesis by downregulating stress granule formation through G3BP1.

TI  - Bmp Induces Osteoblast Differentiation through both Smad4 and mTORC1 Signaling.
LID - e00253-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00253-16 [doi]
AB  - The bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) family of secreted molecules has been
      extensively studied in the context of osteoblast differentiation. However, the
      intracellular signaling cascades that mediate the osteoblastogenic function of
      Bmp have not been fully elucidated. By profiling mRNA expression in the bone
      marrow mesenchymal progenitor cell line ST2, we discover that BMP2 induces not
      only genes commonly associated with ossification and mineralization but also
      genes important for general protein synthesis. We define the two groups of genes 
      as mineralization related versus protein anabolism signatures of osteoblasts.
      Although it induces the expression of several Wnt genes, BMP2 activates the
      osteogenic program largely independently of de novo Wnt secretion. Remarkably,
      although Smad4 is necessary for the activation of the mineralization-related
      genes, it is dispensable for BMP2 to induce the protein anabolism signature,
      which instead critically depends on the transcription factor Atf4. Upstream of
      Atf4, BMP2 activates mTORC1 to stimulate protein synthesis, resulting in an
      endoplasmic reticulum stress response mediated by Perk. Thus, Bmp signaling
      induces osteoblast differentiation through both Smad4- and mTORC1-dependent
      mechanisms.

TI  - Group I Paks Promote Skeletal Myoblast Differentiation In Vivo and In Vitro.
LID - e00222-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00222-16 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal myogenesis is regulated by signal transduction, but the factors and
      mechanisms involved are not well understood. The group I Paks Pak1 and Pak2 are
      related protein kinases and direct effectors of Cdc42 and Rac1. Group I Paks are 
      ubiquitously expressed and specifically required for myoblast fusion in
      Drosophila We report that both Pak1 and Pak2 are activated during mammalian
      myoblast differentiation. One pathway of activation is initiated by N-cadherin
      ligation and involves the cadherin coreceptor Cdo with its downstream effector,
      Cdc42. Individual genetic deletion of Pak1 and Pak2 in mice has no overt effect
      on skeletal muscle development or regeneration. However, combined muscle-specific
      deletion of Pak1 and Pak2 results in reduced muscle mass and a higher proportion 
      of myofibers with a smaller cross-sectional area. This phenotype is exacerbated
      after repair to acute injury. Furthermore, primary myoblasts lacking Pak1 and
      Pak2 display delayed expression of myogenic differentiation markers and myotube
      formation. These results identify Pak1 and Pak2 as redundant regulators of
      myoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo and as components of the
      promyogenic Ncad/Cdo/Cdc42 signaling pathway.

TI  - A Homeostatic Shift Facilitates Endoplasmic Reticulum Proteostasis through
      Transcriptional Integration of Proteostatic Stress Response Pathways.
LID - e00439-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00439-16 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic cells maintain protein homeostasis through the activity of multiple
      basal and inducible systems, which function in concert to allow cells to adapt to
      a wide range of environmental conditions. Although the transcriptional programs
      regulating individual pathways have been studied in detail, it is not known how
      the different pathways are transcriptionally integrated such that a deficiency in
      one pathway can be compensated by a change in an auxiliary response. One such
      pathway that plays an essential role in many proteostasis responses is the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, which functions to degrade damaged, unfolded, or
      short half-life proteins. Transcriptional regulation of the proteasome is
      mediated by the transcription factor Nrf1. Using a conditional knockout mouse
      model, we found that Nrf1 regulates protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) through transcriptional regulation of the ER stress sensor ATF6.
      In Nrf1 conditional-knockout mice, a reduction in proteasome activity is
      accompanied by an ATF6-dependent downregulation of the endoplasmic
      reticulum-associated degradation machinery, which reduces the substrate burden on
      the proteasome. This indicates that Nrf1 regulates a homeostatic shift through
      which proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm are coregulated
      based on a cell's ability to degrade proteins.

TI  - Renal Anemia Model Mouse Established by Transgenic Rescue with an Erythropoietin 
      Gene Lacking Kidney-Specific Regulatory Elements.
LID - e00451-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00451-16 [doi]
AB  - The erythropoietin (Epo) gene is under tissue-specific inducible regulation.
      Because the kidney is the primary EPO-producing tissue in adults, impaired EPO
      production in chronic kidney disorders results in serious renal anemia. The Epo
      gene contains a liver-specific enhancer in the 3' region, but the kidney-specific
      enhancer for gene expression in renal EPO-producing (REP) cells remains elusive. 
      Here, we examined a conserved upstream element for renal Epo regulation (CURE)
      region that spans 17.4 kb to 3.6 kb upstream of the Epo gene and harbors several 
      phylogenetically conserved elements. We prepared various Epo gene-reporter
      constructs utilizing a bacterial artificial chromosome and generated a number of 
      transgenic-mouse lines. We observed that deletion of the CURE region (deltaCURE) 
      abrogated Epo gene expression in REP cells. Although transgenic expression of the
      deltaCURE construct rescued Epo-deficient mice from embryonic lethality, the
      rescued mice had severe EPO-dependent anemia. These mouse lines serve as an
      elaborate model for the search for erythroid stimulatory activity and are
      referred to as AnRED (anemic model with renal EPO deficiency) mice. We also
      dissected the CURE region by exploiting a minigene harboring four
      phylogenetically conserved elements in reporter transgenic-mouse analyses. Our
      analyses revealed that Epo gene regulation in REP cells is a complex process that
      utilizes multiple regulatory influences.

TI  - Ubiquitylation of Ku80 by RNF126 Promotes Completion of Nonhomologous End
      Joining-Mediated DNA Repair.
LID - e00347-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00347-16 [doi]
AB  - Repair of damaged DNA is critical for maintenance of genetic information. In
      eukaryotes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are recognized by the Ku70-Ku80
      heterodimer, which then recruits proteins that mediate repair by nonhomologous
      end joining (NHEJ). Prolonged retention of Ku70/80 at DSBs prevents completion of
      repair, however, with ubiquitylation of Ku80 having been implicated in Ku70/80
      dissociation from DNA. Here, we identify RNF126 as a ubiquitin ligase that is
      recruited to DSBs and ubiquitylates Ku80, with UBE2D3 serving as an E2 enzyme.
      Knockdown of RNF126 prevented Ku70/80 dissociation from DSBs and inhibited break 
      repair. Attenuation of Ku80 ubiquitylation by replacement of ubiquitylation site 
      lysines with arginine residues delayed Ku70/80 release from chromatin after DSB
      induction by genotoxic insults. Together, our data indicate that RNF126 is a
      novel regulator of NHEJ that promotes completion of DNA repair by ubiquitylating 
      Ku80 and releasing Ku70/80 from damaged DNA.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Uncoupling of MicroRNA-Mediated Translational Repression and
      Target RNA Degradation Controls MicroRNP Recycling in Mammalian Cells.
LID - e00464-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00464-16 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated repression controls expression of more than half of
      protein-coding genes in metazoan animals. Translation repression is associated
      with target mRNA degradation initiated by decapping and deadenylation of the
      repressed mRNAs. Earlier evidence suggests the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as the 
      site where microRNPs (miRNPs) interact with their targets before translation
      repression sets in, but the subcellular location of subsequent degradation of
      miRNA-repressed messages is largely unidentified. Here, we explore the
      subcellular distribution of essential components of degradation machineries of
      miRNA-targeted mRNAs. We have noted that interaction of target mRNAs with AGO2
      protein on the ER precedes the relocalization of repressed messages to
      multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The repressed messages subsequently get
      deadenylated, lose their interaction with AGO2, and become decapped. Blocking
      maturation of endosomes to late endosome and MVBs by targeting the endosomal
      protein HRS uncouples miRNA-mediated translation repression from target RNA
      degradation. HRS is also targeted by the intracellular parasite Leishmania
      donovani, which curtails the HRS level in infected cells to prevent uncoupling of
      mRNA-AGO2 interaction, preventing degradation of translationally repressed
      messages, and thus stops recycling of miRNPs preengaged in repression.

TI  - A High-Fat Diet Promotes Mammary Gland Myofibroblast Differentiation through
      MicroRNA 140 Downregulation.
LID - e00461-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00461-16 [doi]
AB  - Human breast adipose tissue is a heterogeneous cell population consisting of
      mature white adipocytes, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells, committed progenitor
      cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Dependent on external
      stimulation, adipose-derived stem cells differentiate along diverse lineages into
      adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. It is
      currently not fully understood how a high-fat diet reprograms adipose-derived
      stem cells into myofibroblasts. In our study, we used mouse models of a regular
      diet and of high-fat-diet-induced obesity to investigate the role of dietary fat 
      on myofibroblast differentiation in the mammary stromal microenvironment. We
      found that a high-fat diet promotes myofibroblast differentiation by decreasing
      microRNA 140 (miR-140) expression in mammary adipose tissue through a novel
      negative-feedback loop. Increased transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) in
      mammary adipose tissue in obese mice activates SMAD3 signaling, causing
      phospho-SMAD3 to bind to the miR-140 locus and inhibit miR-140 transcription.
      This prevents miR-140 from targeting SMAD3 for degradation, resulting in
      amplified TGF-beta1/SMAD3 signaling and miR-140 downregulation-dependent
      myofibroblast differentiation. Using tissue and coculture models, we found that
      myofibroblasts and the fibrotic microenvironment created by myofibroblasts impact
      the stemness and proliferation of normal ductal epithelial cells and early-stage 
      breast cancer invasion and stemness.

TI  - Endogenous Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase N-Terminal Tagging Affects Human
      Telomerase Function at Telomeres In Vivo.
LID - e00541-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00541-16 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase action at telomeres is essential for the immortal phenotype of stem
      cells and the aberrant proliferative potential of cancer cells. Insufficient
      telomere maintenance can cause stem cell and tissue failure syndromes, while
      increased telomerase levels are associated with tumorigenesis. Both pathologies
      can arise from only small perturbation of telomerase function. To analyze
      telomerase at its low endogenous expression level, we genetically engineered
      human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to express various N-terminal fusion
      proteins of the telomerase reverse transcriptase from its endogenous locus. Using
      this approach, we found that these modifications can perturb telomerase function 
      in hPSCs and cancer cells, resulting in telomere length defects. Biochemical
      analysis suggests that this defect is multileveled, including changes in
      expression and activity. These findings highlight the unknown complexity of
      telomerase structural requirements for expression and function in vivo.

TI  - Proteomics Screen Identifies Class I Rab11 Family Interacting Proteins as Key
      Regulators of Cytokinesis.
LID - e00278-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00278-16 [doi]
AB  - The 14-3-3 protein family orchestrates a complex network of molecular
      interactions that regulates various biological processes. Owing to their role in 
      regulating the cell cycle and protein trafficking, 14-3-3 proteins are prevalent 
      in human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. 14-3-3
      proteins are expressed in all eukaryotic cells, suggesting that they mediate
      their biological functions through evolutionarily conserved protein interactions.
      To identify these core 14-3-3 client proteins, we used an affinity-based
      proteomics approach to characterize and compare the human and Drosophila 14-3-3
      interactomes. Using this approach, we identified a group of Rab11 effector
      proteins, termed class I Rab11 family interacting proteins (Rab11-FIPs), or Rip11
      in Drosophila We found that 14-3-3 binds to Rip11 in a phospho-dependent manner
      to ensure its proper subcellular distribution during cell division. Our results
      indicate that Rip11 plays an essential role in the regulation of cytokinesis and 
      that this function requires its association with 14-3-3 but not with Rab11.
      Together, our results suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for 14-3-3 in
      controlling Rip11-dependent protein transport during cytokinesis.

TI  - Arginine Methylation by PRMT1 Regulates Muscle Stem Cell Fate.
LID - e00457-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00457-16 [doi]
AB  - Quiescent muscle stem cells (MSCs) become activated in response to skeletal
      muscle injury to initiate regeneration. Activated MSCs proliferate and
      differentiate to repair damaged fibers or self-renew to maintain the pool and
      ensure future regeneration. The balance between self-renewal, proliferation, and 
      differentiation is a tightly regulated process controlled by a genetic cascade
      involving determinant transcription factors such as Pax7, Myf5, MyoD, and MyoG.
      Recently, there have been several reports about the role of arginine methylation 
      as a requirement for epigenetically mediated control of muscle regeneration. Here
      we report that the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is expressed in
      MSCs and that conditional ablation of PRMT1 in MSCs using Pax7(CreERT2) causes
      impairment of muscle regeneration. Importantly, PRMT1-deficient MSCs have
      enhanced cell proliferation after injury but are unable to terminate the myogenic
      differentiation program, leading to regeneration failure. We identify the
      coactivator of Six1, Eya1, as a substrate of PRMT1. We show that PRMT1 methylates
      Eya1 in vitro and that loss of PRMT1 function in vivo prevents Eya1 methylation. 
      Moreover, we observe that PRMT1-deficient MSCs have reduced expression of
      Eya1/Six1 target MyoD due to disruption of Eya1 recruitment at the MyoD promoter 
      and subsequent Eya1-mediated coactivation. These findings suggest that arginine
      methylation by PRMT1 regulates muscle stem cell fate through the Eya1/Six1/MyoD
      axis.

TI  - The Werner Syndrome Helicase Coordinates Sequential Strand Displacement and
      FEN1-Mediated Flap Cleavage during Polymerase delta Elongation.
LID - e00560-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00560-16 [doi]
AB  - The Werner syndrome protein (WRN) suppresses the loss of telomeres replicated by 
      lagging-strand synthesis by a yet to be defined mechanism. Here, we show that
      whereas either WRN or the Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM) stimulates DNA polymerase
      delta progression across telomeric G-rich repeats, only WRN promotes sequential
      strand displacement synthesis and FEN1 cleavage, a critical step in Okazaki
      fragment maturation, at these sequences. Helicase activity, as well as the
      conserved winged-helix (WH) motif and the helicase and RNase D C-terminal (HRDC) 
      domain play important but distinct roles in this process. Remarkably, WRN also
      influences the formation of FEN1 cleavage products during strand displacement on 
      a nontelomeric substrate, suggesting that WRN recruitment and cooperative
      interaction with FEN1 during lagging-strand synthesis may serve to regulate
      sequential strand displacement and flap cleavage at other genomic sites. These
      findings define a biochemical context for the physiological role of WRN in
      maintaining genetic stability.

TI  - Suppressor of Fused Chaperones Gli Proteins To Generate Transcriptional Responses
      to Sonic Hedgehog Signaling.
LID - e00421-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00421-16 [doi]
AB  - Cellular responses to the graded Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) morphogenic signal are
      orchestrated by three Gli genes that give rise to both transcription activators
      and repressors. An essential downstream regulator of the pathway, encoded by the 
      tumor suppressor gene Suppressor of fused (Sufu), plays critical roles in the
      production, trafficking, and function of Gli proteins, but the mechanism remains 
      controversial. Here, we show that Sufu is upregulated in active Shh responding
      tissues and accompanies Gli activators translocating into and Gli repressors out 
      of the nucleus. Trafficking of Sufu to the primary cilium, potentiated by Gli
      activators but not repressors, was found to be coupled to its nuclear import. We 
      have identified a nuclear export signal (NES) motif of Sufu in juxtaposition to
      the protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) dual
      phosphorylation sites and show that Sufu binds the chromatin with both Gli1 and
      Gli3. Close comparison of neural tube development among individual Ptch1(-/-),
      Sufu(-/-), and Ptch1(-/-); Sufu(-/-) double mutant embryos indicates that Sufu is
      critical for the maximal activation of Shh signaling essential to the
      specification of the most-ventral neurons. These data define Sufu as a novel
      class of molecular chaperone required for every aspect of Gli regulation and
      function.

TI  - RBM4 Regulates Neuronal Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Modulating
      Alternative Splicing of Pyruvate Kinase M.
LID - e00466-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00466-16 [doi]
AB  - RBM4 promotes differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and neurite outgrowth 
      of cultured neurons via its role in splicing regulation. In this study, we
      further explored the role of RBM4 in neuronal differentiation. During neuronal
      differentiation, energy production shifts from glycolysis to oxidative
      phosphorylation. We found that the splice isoform change of the metabolic enzyme 
      pyruvate kinase M (PKM) from PKM2 to PKM1 occurs during brain development and is 
      impaired in RBM4-deficient brains. The PKM isoform change could be recapitulated 
      in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during neuronal induction. Using a PKM
      minigene, we demonstrated that RBM4 plays a direct role in regulating alternative
      splicing of PKM. Moreover, RBM4 antagonized the function of the splicing factor
      PTB and induced the expression of a PTB isoform with attenuated splicing activity
      in MSCs. Overexpression of RBM4 or PKM1 induced the expression of neuronal genes,
      increased the mitochondrial respiration capacity in MSCs, and, accordingly,
      promoted neuronal differentiation. Finally, we demonstrated that RBM4 is induced 
      and is involved in the PKM splicing switch and neuronal gene expression during
      hypoxia-induced neuronal differentiation. Hence, RBM4 plays an important role in 
      the PKM isoform switch and the change in mitochondrial energy production during
      neuronal differentiation.

TI  - Functional Roles of Acetylated Histone Marks at Mouse Meiotic Recombination Hot
      Spots.
LID - e00942-15 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00942-15 [doi]
AB  - Meiotic recombination initiates following the formation of DNA double-strand
      breaks (DSBs) by the Spo11 endonuclease early in prophase I, at discrete regions 
      in the genome coined "hot spots." In mammals, meiotic DSB site selection is
      directed in part by sequence-specific binding of PRDM9, a polymorphic histone H3 
      (H3K4Me3) methyltransferase. However, other chromatin features needed for meiotic
      hot spot specification are largely unknown. Here we show that the recombinogenic 
      cores of active hot spots in mice harbor several histone H3 and H4 acetylation
      and methylation marks that are typical of open, active chromatin. Further,
      deposition of these open chromatin-associated histone marks is dynamic and is
      manifest at spermatogonia and/or pre-leptotene-stage cells, which facilitates
      PRDM9 binding and access for Spo11 to direct the formation of DSBs, which are
      initiated at the leptotene stage. Importantly, manipulating histone acetylase and
      deacetylase activities established that histone acetylation marks are necessary
      for both hot spot activity and crossover resolution. We conclude that there are
      functional roles for histone acetylation marks at mammalian meiotic recombination
      hot spots.

TI  - MCL-1 Depletion Impairs DNA Double-Strand Break Repair and Reinitiation of
      Stalled DNA Replication Forks.
LID - e00535-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00535-16 [doi]
AB  - Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) is a prosurvival BCL-2 protein family member
      highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and regulated by growth
      factor signals that manifest antiapoptotic activity. Here we report that
      depletion of MCL-1 but not its isoform MCL-1S increases genomic instability and
      cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced death. MCL-1 association with
      genomic DNA increased postirradiation, and the protein colocalized with 53BP1
      foci. Postirradiation, MCL-1-depleted cells exhibited decreased gamma-H2AX foci, 
      decreased phosphorylation of ATR, and higher levels of residual 53BP1 and RIF1
      foci, suggesting that DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous
      recombination (HR) was compromised. Consistent with this model, MCL-1-depleted
      cells had a reduced frequency of IR-induced BRCA1, RPA, and Rad51 focus
      formation, decreased DNA end resection, and decreased HR repair in the DR-GFP DSB
      repair model. Similarly, after HU induction of stalled replication forks in
      MCL-1-depleted cells, there was a decreased ability to subsequently restart DNA
      synthesis, which is normally dependent upon HR-mediated resolution of collapsed
      forks. Therefore, the present data support a model whereby MCL-1 depletion
      increases 53BP1 and RIF1 colocalization at DSBs, which inhibits BRCA1
      recruitment, and sensitizes cells to DSBs from IR or stalled replication forks
      that require HR for repair.

TI  - Asc1p/RACK1 Connects Ribosomes to Eukaryotic Phosphosignaling.
LID - e00279-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00279-16 [doi]
AB  - WD40 repeat proteins fold into characteristic beta-propeller structures and
      control signaling circuits during cellular adaptation processes within
      eukaryotes. The RACK1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Asc1p, consists
      exclusively of a single seven-bladed beta-propeller that operates from the
      ribosomal base at the head region of the 40S subunit. Here we show that the R38D 
      K40E ribosomal binding-compromised variant (Asc1DEp) is severely destabilized
      through mutation of phosphosite T143 to a dephosphorylation-mimicking alanine,
      probably through proteasomal degradation, leading to asc1(-) phenotypes.
      Phosphosite Y250 contributes to resistance to translational inhibitors but does
      not influence Asc1DEp stability. Beyond its own phosphorylation at T143, Y250,
      and other sites, Asc1p heavily influences the phosphorylation of as many as 90
      proteins at 120 sites. Many of these proteins are regulators of fundamental
      processes ranging from mRNA translation to protein transport and turnover,
      cytoskeleton organization, and cellular signaling. Our data expose Asc1p/RACK1 as
      a key factor in phosphosignaling and manifest it as a control point at the head
      of the ribosomal 40S subunit itself regulated through posttranslational
      modification.

TI  - Interchangeable Roles for E2F Transcriptional Repression by the Retinoblastoma
      Protein and p27KIP1-Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Regulation in Cell Cycle Control and 
      Tumor Suppression.
LID - e00561-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00561-16 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian G1-S phase transition is controlled by the opposing forces of
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Here, we
      present evidence for systems-level control of cell cycle arrest by pRB-E2F and
      p27-CDK regulation. By introducing a point mutant allele of pRB that is defective
      for E2F repression (Rb1(G)) into a p27(KIP1) null background (Cdkn1b(-/-)), both 
      E2F transcriptional repression and CDK regulation are compromised. These
      double-mutant Rb1(G/G); Cdkn1b(-/-) mice are viable and phenocopy Rb1(+/-) mice
      in developing pituitary adenocarcinomas, even though neither single mutant strain
      is cancer prone. Combined loss of pRB-E2F transcriptional regulation and
      p27(KIP1) leads to defective proliferative control in response to various types
      of DNA damage. In addition, Rb1(G/G); Cdkn1b(-/-) fibroblasts immortalize faster 
      in culture and more frequently than either single mutant genotype. Importantly,
      the synthetic DNA damage arrest defect caused by Rb1(G/G); Cdkn1b(-/-) mutations 
      is evident in the developing intermediate pituitary lobe where tumors ultimately 
      arise. Our work identifies a unique relationship between pRB-E2F and p27-CDK
      control and offers in vivo evidence that pRB is capable of cell cycle control
      through E2F-independent effects.

TI  - Notch Downregulation and Extramedullary Erythrocytosis in Hypoxia-Inducible
      Factor Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase 2-Deficient Mice.
LID - e00529-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00529-16 [doi]
AB  - Erythrocytosis is driven mainly by erythropoietin, which is regulated by
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Mutations in HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylase 2
      (HIF-P4H-2) (PHD2/EGLN1), the major downregulator of HIFalpha subunits, are found
      in familiar erythrocytosis, and large-spectrum conditional inactivation of
      HIF-P4H-2 in mice leads to severe erythrocytosis. Although bone marrow is the
      primary site for erythropoiesis, spleen remains capable of extramedullary
      erythropoiesis. We studied HIF-P4H-2-deficient (Hif-p4h-2(gt/gt)) mice, which
      show slightly induced erythropoiesis upon aging despite nonincreased
      erythropoietin levels, and identified spleen as the site of extramedullary
      erythropoiesis. Splenic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of these mice exhibited
      increased erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) growth, and the mice were
      protected against anemia. HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha were stabilized in the
      spleens, while the Notch ligand genes Jag1, Jag2, and Dll1 and target Hes1 became
      downregulated upon aging HIF-2alpha dependently. Inhibition of Notch signaling in
      wild-type spleen HSCs phenocopied the increased BFU-E growth. HIFalpha
      stabilization can thus mediate non-erythropoietin-driven splenic erythropoiesis
      via altered Notch signaling.

TI  - SUMO-Modified FADD Recruits Cytosolic Drp1 and Caspase-10 to Mitochondria for
      Regulated Necrosis.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00254-16 [doi]
AB  - Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) plays a key role in extrinsic
      apoptosis. Here, we show that FADD is SUMOylated as an essential step during
      intrinsic necrosis. FADD was modified at multiple lysine residues (K120/125/149) 
      by small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO2) during necrosis caused by calcium
      ionophore A23187 and by ischemic damage. SUMOylated FADD bound to dynamin-related
      protein 1 (Drp1) in cells both in vitro and in ischemic tissue damage cores, thus
      promoting Drp1 recruitment by mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) to accomplish
      mitochondrial fragmentation. Mitochondrial-fragmentation-associated necrosis was 
      blocked by FADD or Drp1 deficiency and SUMO-defective FADD expression.
      Interestingly, caspase-10, but not caspase-8, formed a ternary protein complex
      with SUMO-FADD/Drp1 on the mitochondria upon exposure to A23187 and potentiated
      Drp1 oligomerization for necrosis. Moreover, the caspase-10 L285F and A414V
      mutants, found in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma, respectively, regulated this necrosis. Our study reveals an essential
      role of SUMOylated FADD in Drp1- and caspase-10-dependent necrosis, providing
      insights into the mechanism of regulated necrosis by calcium overload and
      ischemic injury.

TI  - FABP4/aP2 Regulates Macrophage Redox Signaling and Inflammasome Activation via
      Control of UCP2.
LID - e00282-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00282-16 [doi]
AB  - Obesity-linked metabolic disease is mechanistically associated with the
      accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue, leading to
      increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and chronic low-grade
      inflammation. Previous work has demonstrated that deletion of the adipocyte fatty
      acid-binding protein (FABP4/aP2) uncouples obesity from inflammation via
      upregulation of the uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Here, we demonstrate that
      ablation of FABP4/aP2 regulates systemic redox capacity and reduces cellular
      protein sulfhydryl oxidation and, in particular, oxidation of mitochondrial
      protein cysteine residues. Coincident with the loss of FABP4/aP2 is the
      upregulation of the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD2), catalase,
      methionine sulfoxide reductase A, and the 20S proteasome subunits PSMB5 and
      alphabeta. Reduced mitochondrial protein oxidation in FABP4/aP2(-/-) macrophages 
      attenuates the mitochondrial unfolded-protein response (mtUPR) as measured by
      expression of heat shock protein 60, Clp protease, and Lon peptidase 1.
      Consistent with a diminished mtUPR, FABP4/aP2(-/-) macrophages exhibit reduced
      expression of cleaved caspase-1 and NLRP3. Secretion of interleukin 1beta
      (IL-1beta), in response to inflammasome activation, is ablated in FABP4/aP2(-/-) 
      macrophages, as well as in FABP4/aP2 inhibitor-treated cells, but partially
      rescued in FABP4/aP2-null macrophages when UCP2 is silenced. Collectively, these 
      data offer a novel pathway whereby FABP4/aP2 regulates macrophage redox signaling
      and inflammasome activation via control of UCP2 expression.

TI  - MBD4 Facilitates Immunoglobulin Class Switch Recombination.
LID - e00316-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00316-16 [doi]
AB  - Immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination (CSR) requires targeted
      formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive switch region elements
      followed by ligation between distal breaks. The introduction of DSBs is initiated
      by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and requires base excision repair 
      (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR). The BER enzyme methyl-CpG binding domain protein
      4 (MBD4) has been linked to the MMR pathway through its interaction with MutL
      homologue 1 (MLH1). We find that when Mbd4 exons 6 to 8 are deleted in a
      switching B cell line, DSB formation is severely reduced and CSR frequency is
      impaired. Impaired CSR can be rescued by ectopic expression of Mbd4 Mbd4
      deficiency yields a deficit in DNA end processing similar to that found in MutS
      homologue 2 (Msh2)- and Mlh1-deficient B cells. We demonstrate that
      microhomology-rich S-S junctions are enriched in cells in which Mbd4 is deleted. 
      Our studies suggest that Mbd4 is a component of MMR-directed DNA end processing.

LID - e00260-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00260-16 [doi]
AB  - Dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic ligand for glucocorticoid receptor (GR), is
      routinely used to stimulate adipogenesis in culture. GR-depleted preadipocytes
      show adipogenesis defects 1 week after induction of differentiation. However, it 
      has remained unclear whether GR is required for adipogenesis in vivo By deleting 
      GR in precursors of brown adipocytes, we found unexpectedly that GR is
      dispensable for brown adipose tissue development in mice. In culture,
      GR-deficient primary or immortalized white and brown preadipocytes showed
      severely delayed adipogenesis 1 week after induction of differentiation. However,
      when differentiation was extended to 3 weeks, GR-deficient preadipocytes showed
      levels of adipogenesis marker expression and lipid accumulation similar to those 
      of the wild-type cells, indicating that DEX-bound GR accelerates, but is
      dispensable for, adipogenesis. Consistently, DEX accelerates, but is dispensable 
      for, adipogenesis in culture. We show that DEX-bound GR accelerates adipogenesis 
      by directly promoting the expression of adipogenic transcription factors
      CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), C/EBPbeta, C/EBPdelta, KLF5,
      KLF9, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in the
      early phase of differentiation. Mechanistically, DEX-bound GR recruits histone
      H3K27 acetyltransferase CBP to promote activation of C/EBPbeta-primed enhancers
      of adipogenic genes. These results clarify the role of GR in adipogenesis in vivo
      and demonstrate that DEX-mediated activation of GR accelerates, but is
      dispensable for, adipogenesis.

      Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma in Adipogenesis.
LID - e00554-16 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00554-16 [doi]
AB  - Much of our knowledge on adipogenesis comes from cell culture models of
      preadipocyte differentiation. Adipogenesis is induced by treating confluent
      preadipocytes with the adipogenic cocktail, which activates transcription factors
      (TFs) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CREB within minutes and increases
      expression of TFs C/EBPbeta, C/EBPdelta, KLF4, and Krox20 within hours. All of
      these TFs have been shown to be capable of promoting adipogenesis in culture when
      they are overexpressed. However, it has remained unclear whether endogenous KLF4 
      and Krox20 are required for adipogenesis in culture and in vivo Using conditional
      knockout mice and derived white and brown preadipocytes, we show that endogenous 
      KLF4 and Krox20 are dispensable for adipogenesis in culture and for brown adipose
      tissue development in mice. In contrast, the master adipogenic TF peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is essential. These results
      challenge the existing model on transcriptional regulation in the early phase of 
      adipogenesis and highlight the need of studying adipogenesis in vivo.

TI  - EYA1's Conformation Specificity in Dephosphorylating Phosphothreonine in Myc and 
      Its Activity on Myc Stabilization in Breast Cancer.
LID - e00499-16 [pii]
AB  - EYA1 is known to be overexpressed in human breast cancer, in which the Myc
      protein is also accumulated in association with decreased phospho-T58 (pT58)
      levels. We have recently reported that EYA1 functions as a unique protein
      phosphatase to dephosphorylate Myc at pT58 to regulate Myc levels. However, it
      remains unclear whether EYA1-mediated Myc dephosphorylation on T58 is a critical 
      function in regulating Myc protein stability in breast cancer. Furthermore,
      EYA1's substrate specificity has remained elusive. In this study, we have
      investigated these questions, and here, we report that depletion of EYA1 using
      short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in breast cancer cells destabilizes the Myc protein and
      increases pT58 levels, leading to an increase in the doubling time and impairment
      of cell cycle progression. In correlation with EYA1-mediated stabilization of
      cMyc and reduced levels of pT58, EYA1 greatly reduced cMyc-FBW7 binding and cMyc 
      ubiquitination, thus providing novel insight into how EYA1 acts to regulate the
      FBW7-mediated Myc degradation machinery. We found that the conserved C-terminal
      haloacid dehalogenase domain of EYA1, which has been reported to have only
      tyrosine phosphatase activity, has dual phosphatase activities, and both the N-
      and C-terminal domains interact with substrates to increase the catalytic
      activity of EYA1. Enzymatic assay and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis
      demonstrated that EYA1 has a striking conformation preference for phospho-T58 of 
      Myc. Together, our results not only provide novel structural evidence about the
      conformation specificity of EYA1 in dephosphorylating phosphothreonine in Myc but
      also reveal an important mechanism contributing to Myc deregulation in human
      breast cancer.

TI  - Beta Interferon Production Is Regulated by p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase
      in Macrophages via both MSK1/2- and Tristetraprolin-Dependent Pathways.
LID - e00454-16 [pii]
AB  - Autocrine or paracrine signaling by beta interferon (IFN-beta) is essential for
      many of the responses of macrophages to pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
      This feedback loop contributes to pathological responses to infectious agents and
      is therefore tightly regulated. We demonstrate here that macrophage expression of
      IFN-beta is negatively regulated by mitogen- and stress-activated kinases 1 and 2
      (MSK1/2). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of IFN-beta was elevated in
      both MSK1/2 knockout mice and macrophages. Although MSK1 and -2 promote the
      expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10, it did not strongly 
      contribute to the ability of MSKs to regulate IFN-beta expression. Instead, MSK1 
      and -2 inhibit IFN-beta expression via the induction of dual-specificity
      phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), which dephosphorylates and inactivates the
      mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK).
      Prolonged LPS-induced activation of p38 and JNK, phosphorylation of downstream
      transcription factors, and overexpression of IFN-beta mRNA and protein were
      similar in MSK1/2 and DUSP1 knockout macrophages. Two distinct mechanisms were
      implicated in the overexpression of IFN-beta: first, JNK-mediated activation of
      c-jun, which binds to the IFN-beta promoter, and second, p38-mediated
      inactivation of the mRNA-destabilizing factor tristetraprolin, which we show is
      able to target the IFN-beta mRNA.

TI  - E2F-2 Promotes Nuclear Condensation and Enucleation of Terminally Differentiated 
      Erythroblasts.
LID - e00274-16 [pii]
AB  - E2F-2 is a retinoblastoma (Rb)-regulated transcription factor induced during
      terminal erythroid maturation. Cyclin E-mediated Rb hyperphosphorylation induces 
      E2F transcriptional activator functions. We previously reported that deregulated 
      cyclin E activity causes defective terminal maturation of nucleated erythroblasts
      in vivo Here, we found that these defects are normalized by E2F-2 deletion;
      however, anemia in mice with deregulated cyclin E is not improved by E2F-2-loss, 
      which itself causes reduced peripheral red blood cell (RBC) counts without
      altering relative abundances of erythroblast subpopulations. To determine how
      E2F-2 regulates RBC production, we comprehensively studied erythropoiesis using
      knockout mice and hematopoietic progenitors. We found that efficient stress
      erythropoiesis in vivo requires E2F-2, and we also identified an unappreciated
      role for E2F-2 in erythroblast enucleation. In particular, E2F-2 deletion impairs
      nuclear condensation, a morphological feature of maturing erythroblasts.
      Transcriptome profiling of E2F-2-null, mature erythroblasts demonstrated
      widespread changes in gene expression. Notably, we identified citron
      Rho-interacting kinase (CRIK), which has known functions in mitosis and
      cytokinesis, as induced in erythroblasts in an E2F-2-dependent manner, and we
      found that CRIK activity promotes efficient erythroblast enucleation and nuclear 
      condensation. Together, our data reveal novel, lineage-specific functions for
      E2F-2 and suggest that some mitotic kinases have specialized roles supporting
      enucleation of maturing erythroblasts.

TI  - PHD2 Is a Regulator for Glycolytic Reprogramming in Macrophages.
LID - e00236-16 [pii]
AB  - The prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes are regarded as the molecular
      oxygen sensors. There is an interplay between oxygen availability and cellular
      metabolism, which in turn has significant effects on the functionality of innate 
      immune cells, such as macrophages. However, if and how PHD enzymes affect
      macrophage metabolism are enigmatic. We hypothesized that macrophage metabolism
      and function can be controlled via manipulation of PHD2. We characterized the
      metabolic phenotypes of PHD2-deficient RAW cells and primary PHD2 knockout bone
      marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). Both showed typical features of anaerobic
      glycolysis, which were paralleled by increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1
      (PDK1) protein levels and a decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity.
      Metabolic alterations were associated with an impaired cellular functionality.
      Inhibition of PDK1 or knockout of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha)
      reversed the metabolic phenotype and impaired the functionality of the
      PHD2-deficient RAW cells and BMDM. Taking these results together, we identified a
      critical role of PHD2 for a reversible glycolytic reprogramming in macrophages
      with a direct impact on their function. We suggest that PHD2 serves as an
      adjustable switch to control macrophage behavior.

TI  - Phosphorylation of Translation Initiation Factor 2-Alpha in Leishmania donovani
      under Stress Is Necessary for Parasite Survival.
LID - e00344-16 [pii]
AB  - The transformation of Leishmania donovani from a promastigote to an amastigote
      during mammalian host infection displays the immense adaptability of the parasite
      to survival under stress. Induction of translation initiation factor 2-alpha
      (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation by stress-specific eIF2alpha kinases is the basic
      stress-perceiving signal in eukaryotes to counter stress. Here, we demonstrate
      that elevated temperature and acidic pH induce the phosphorylation of Leishmania 
      donovani eIF2alpha (LdeIF2alpha). In vitro inhibition experiments suggest that
      interference of LdeIF2alpha phosphorylation under conditions of elevated
      temperature and acidic pH debilitates parasite differentiation and reduces
      parasite viability (P < 0.05). Furthermore, inhibition of LdeIF2alpha
      phosphorylation significantly reduced the infection rate (P < 0.05), emphasizing 
      its deciding role in successful invasion and infection establishment. Notably,
      our findings suggested the phosphorylation of LdeIF2alpha under H2O2-induced
      oxidative stress. Inhibition of H2O2-induced LdeIF2alpha phosphorylation hampered
      antioxidant balance by impaired redox homeostasis gene expression, resulting in
      increased reactive oxygen species accumulation (P < 0.05) and finally leading to 
      decreased parasite viability (P < 0.05). Interestingly, exposure to sodium
      antimony glucamate and amphotericin B induces LdeIF2alpha phosphorylation,
      indicating its possible contribution to protection against antileishmanial drugs 
      in common use. Overall, the results strongly suggest that stress-induced
      LdeIF2alpha phosphorylation is a necessary event for the parasite life cycle
      under stressed conditions for survival.

TI  - TAX1BP1 Restrains Virus-Induced Apoptosis by Facilitating Itch-Mediated
      Degradation of the Mitochondrial Adaptor MAVS.
LID - e00422-16 [pii]
AB  - The host response to RNA virus infection consists of an intrinsic innate immune
      response and the induction of apoptosis as mechanisms to restrict viral
      replication. The mitochondrial adaptor molecule MAVS plays critical roles in
      coordinating both virus-induced type I interferon production and apoptosis;
      however, the regulation of MAVS-mediated apoptosis is poorly understood. Here, we
      show that the adaptor protein TAX1BP1 functions as a negative regulator of
      virus-induced apoptosis. TAX1BP1-deficient cells are highly sensitive to
      apoptosis in response to infection with the RNA viruses vesicular stomatitis
      virus and Sendai virus and to transfection with poly(I.C). TAX1BP1 undergoes
      degradation during RNA virus infection, and loss of TAX1BP1 is associated with
      apoptotic cell death. TAX1BP1 deficiency augments virus-induced activation of
      proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Virus infection promotes
      the mitochondrial localization of TAX1BP1 and concomitant interaction with the
      mitochondrial adaptor MAVS. TAX1BP1 recruits the E3 ligase Itch to MAVS to
      trigger its ubiquitination and degradation, and loss of TAX1BP1 or Itch results
      in increased MAVS protein expression. Together, these results indicate that
      TAX1BP1 functions as an adaptor molecule for Itch to target MAVS during RNA virus
      infection and thus restrict virus-induced apoptosis.

TI  - G-Quadruplex in the NRF2 mRNA 5' Untranslated Region Regulates De Novo NRF2
      Protein Translation under Oxidative Stress.
LID - e00122-16 [pii]
AB  - Inhibition of protein synthesis serves as a general measure of cellular
      consequences of chemical stress. A few proteins are translated selectively and
      influence cell fate. How these proteins can bypass the general control of
      translation remains unknown. We found that low to mild doses of oxidants induce
      de novo translation of the NRF2 protein. Here we demonstrate the presence of a
      G-quadruplex structure in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of NRF2 mRNA, as
      measured by circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, and dimethylsulfate
      footprinting analyses. Such a structure is important for 5'-UTR activity, since
      its removal by sequence mutation eliminated H2O2-induced activation of the NRF2
      5' UTR. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based
      proteomics revealed elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1a) as a protein binding to the 
      G-quadruplex sequence. Cells responded to H2O2 treatment by increasing the EF1a
      protein association with NRF2 mRNA, as measured by RNA-protein interaction
      assays. The EF1a interaction with small and large subunits of ribosomes did not
      appear to change due to H2O2 treatment, nor did posttranslational modifications, 
      as measured by two-dimensional (2-D) Western blot analysis. Since NRF2 encodes a 
      transcription factor essential for protection against tissue injury, our data
      have revealed a novel mechanism of cellular defense involving de novo NRF2
      protein translation governed by the EF1a interaction with the G-quadruplex in the
      NRF2 5' UTR during oxidative stress.

TI  - Enhanced Stabilization of MCL1 by the Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 bZIP
      Factor Is Modulated by Blocking the Recruitment of Cullin 1 to the SCF Complex.
PG  - 3075-3085
AB  - Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic retrovirus that is
      the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The HTLV-1 basic leucine
      zipper factor (HBZ), which is encoded by the minus strand of the provirus, is
      constitutively expressed in all ATL patient cells and likely contributes to the
      development and maintenance of ATL. Furthermore, the overexpression of the
      myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein is frequently observed in hematological
      cancers as well as several other types of cancers. Here, we found that the
      expression of HBZ in cells stabilized MCL1 protein expression and suppressed the 
      MCL1-mediated release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. This effect was
      mediated by inhibition of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MCL1. In a
      serial binding assay, HBZ interacted with cullin 1 (CUL1) through a head-to-tail 
      interaction. The association between CUL1 and Skp1, which serves as the molecular
      scaffold for the components of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, was markedly
      repressed in the presence of HBZ. Mechanistic analysis indicated that HBZ
      abrogated the CUL1 association with Skp1, which in turn promoted the cellular
      expression of MCL1. This novel function of HBZ likely plays a role in the viral
      pathogenesis of HTLV-1 and provides important insights into our understanding of 
      the development of ATL.

TI  - SHP-1 Acts as a Key Regulator of Alloresponses by Modulating LFA-1-Mediated
      Adhesion in Primary Murine T Cells.
PG  - 3113-3127
AB  - The clinical potential of transplantation is often reduced by T cell-mediated
      alloresponses that cause graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease.
      Integrin-mediated adhesion between alloreactive T cells and antigen-presenting
      cells is essential for allorejection. The identity of the signaling events needed
      for the activation of integrins such as LFA-1 is poorly understood. Here, we
      identified a novel role of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in the
      regulation of murine LFA-1-mediated adhesion in an allograft setting. Upon
      alloactivation, SHP-1 activity is reduced, resulting in an increase in LFA-1
      adhesion compared to that for syngeneically activated T cells. The importance of 
      these differential activation properties was further indicated by small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of SHP-1 in syngeneically and allogeneically
      stimulated T cells. Mechanistically, SHP-1 modulated the binding of SLP-76 to
      ADAP by dephosphorylation of the YDGI tyrosine motif of ADAP, a known docking
      site for the Src family kinase Fyn. This novel key role of SHP-1 in the
      regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion may provide a new insight into T
      cell-mediated alloresponses and may pave the way to the development of new
      immunosuppressive pharmaceutical agents.

TI  - Inositol Pyrophosphate Kinase Asp1 Modulates Chromosome Segregation Fidelity and 
      Spindle Function in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
PG  - 3128-3140
AB  - Chromosome transmission fidelity during mitosis is of critical importance for the
      fitness of an organism, as mistakes will lead to aneuploidy, which has a
      causative role in numerous severe diseases. Proper segregation of chromosomes
      depends on interdependent processes at the microtubule-kinetochore interface and 
      the spindle assembly checkpoint. Here we report the discovery of a new element
      essential for chromosome transmission fidelity that implicates inositol
      pyrophosphates (IPPs) as playing a key role in this process. The protein is Asp1,
      the Schizosaccharomyces pombe member of the highly conserved Vip1 family. Vip1
      enzymes are bifunctional: they consist of an IPP-generating kinase domain and a
      pyrophosphatase domain that uses such IPPs as substrates. We show that Asp1
      kinase function is required for bipolar spindle formation. The absence of
      Asp1-generated IPPs resulted in errors in sister chromatid biorientation, a
      prolonged checkpoint-controlled delay of anaphase onset, and chromosome
      missegregation. Remarkably, expression of Asp1 variants that generated
      higher-than-wild-type levels of IPPs led to a faster-than-wild-type entry into
      anaphase A without an increase in chromosome missegregation. In fact, the
      chromosome transmission fidelity of a nonessential chromosome was enhanced with
      increased cellular IPPs. Thus, we identified an element that optimized the
      wild-type chromosome transmission process.

TI  - AMPK and Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Signaling Regulates K-Ras Plasma
      Membrane Interactions via Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinase 2.
PG  - 3086-3099
AB  - K-Ras must localize to the plasma membrane and be arrayed in nanoclusters for
      biological activity. We show here that K-Ras is a substrate for cyclic
      GMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs). In intact cells, activated PKG2 selectively
      colocalizes with K-Ras on the plasma membrane and phosphorylates K-Ras at Ser181 
      in the C-terminal polybasic domain. K-Ras phosphorylation by PKG2 is triggered by
      activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and requires endothelial nitric
      oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclase. Phosphorylated K-Ras reorganizes
      into distinct nanoclusters that retune the signal output. Phosphorylation acutely
      enhances K-Ras plasma membrane affinity, but phosphorylated K-Ras is
      progressively lost from the plasma membrane via endocytic recycling.
      Concordantly, chronic pharmacological activation of AMPK --> PKG2 signaling with 
      mitochondrial inhibitors, nitric oxide, or sildenafil inhibits proliferation of
      K-Ras-positive non-small cell lung cancer cells. The study shows that K-Ras is a 
      target of a metabolic stress-signaling pathway that can be leveraged to inhibit
      oncogenic K-Ras function.

TI  - Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Enhances Mitochondrial Metabolic Activity in
      Mammalian Adrenals and Gonads.
PG  - 3058-3074
AB  - The acute response to stress consists of a series of physiological programs to
      promote survival by generating glucocorticoids and activating stress response
      genes that increase the synthesis of many chaperone proteins specific to
      individual organelles. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), short-term stress
      triggers activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) module that either
      leads to neutralization of the initial stress or adaptation to it; chronic stress
      favors cell death. UPR induces expression of the transcription factor, C/EBP
      homology protein (CHOP), and its deletion protects against the lethal
      consequences of prolonged UPR. Here, we show that stress-induced CHOP expression 
      coincides with increased metabolic activity. During stress, the ER and
      mitochondria come close to each other, resulting in the formation of a complex
      consisting of the mitochondrial translocase, translocase of outer mitochondrial
      membrane 22 (Tom22), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and
      3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3betaHSD2) via its intermembrane space
      (IMS)-exposed charged unstructured loop region. Stress increased the circulation 
      of phosphates, which elevated pregnenolone synthesis by 2-fold by increasing the 
      stability of 3betaHSD2 and its association with the mitochondrion-associated ER
      membrane (MAM) and mitochondrial proteins. In summary, cytoplasmic CHOP plays a
      central role in coordinating the interaction of MAM proteins with the outer
      mitochondrial membrane translocase, Tom22, to activate metabolic activity in the 
      IMS by enhanced phosphate circulation.

TI  - Human PDCD2L Is an Export Substrate of CRM1 That Associates with 40S Ribosomal
      Subunit Precursors.
PG  - 3019-3032
AB  - Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) forms a stable complex with 40S
      ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) and contributes to ribosome biogenesis. However, the 
      molecular mechanism by which PRMT3 influences ribosome biogenesis and/or function
      still remains unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified human
      programmed cell death 2-like (PDCD2L) as a novel PRMT3-associated protein. Our
      data suggest that RPS2 promotes the formation of a conserved extraribosomal
      complex with PRMT3 and PDCD2L. We also show that PDCD2L associates with 40S
      subunit precursors that contain a 3'-extended form of the 18S rRNA (18S-E
      pre-rRNA) and several pre-40S maturation factors. PDCD2L shuttles between the
      nucleus and the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner using a leucine-rich nuclear
      export signal that is sufficient to direct the export of a reporter protein.
      Although PDCD2L is not required for the biogenesis and export of 40S ribosomal
      subunits, we found that PDCD2L-null cells accumulate free 60S ribosomal subunits,
      which is indicative of a deficiency in 40S subunit availability. Our data also
      indicate that PDCD2L and its paralog, PDCD2, function redundantly in 40S
      ribosomal subunit production. Our findings uncover the existence of an
      extraribosomal complex consisting of PDCD2L, RPS2, and PRMT3 and support a role
      for PDCD2L in the late maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.

TI  - SIK2 Restricts Autophagic Flux To Support Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Survival.
PG  - 3048-3057
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease with
      multiple, distinct molecular subtypes that exhibit unique transcriptional
      programs and clinical progression trajectories. Despite knowledge of the
      molecular heterogeneity of the disease, most patients are limited to generic,
      indiscriminate treatment options: cytotoxic chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation.
      To identify new intervention targets in TNBC, we used large-scale,
      loss-of-function screening to identify molecular vulnerabilities among different 
      oncogenomic backgrounds. This strategy returned salt inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) as
      essential for TNBC survival. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SIK2 leads 
      to increased autophagic flux in both normal-immortalized and tumor-derived cell
      lines. However, this activity causes cell death selectively in breast cancer
      cells and is biased toward the claudin-low subtype. Depletion of ATG5, which is
      essential for autophagic vesicle formation, rescued the loss of viability
      following SIK2 inhibition. Importantly, we find that SIK2 is essential for TNBC
      tumor growth in vivo Taken together, these findings indicate that claudin-low
      tumor cells rely on SIK2 to restrain maladaptive autophagic activation.
      Inhibition of SIK2 therefore presents itself as an intervention opportunity to
      reactivate this tumor suppressor mechanism.

TI  - Absolute Amounts and Status of the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3 Complex within Cells.
PG  - 3100-3112
AB  - The transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related-factor 2) is essential for the
      oxidative and electrophilic stress responses. Keap1
      (Kelch-like-ECH-associated-protein 1), an adaptor for a cullin-3 (Cul3)-based
      ubiquitin ligase, regulates Nrf2 activity through proteasomal degradation, and
      acts as a sensor for oxidative and electrophilic stresses. The Keap1-Cul3 complex
      is a critical regulator of the cellular Nrf2 level, and yet quantitative
      information regarding their endogenous intracellular concentrations in
      homeostatic conditions and during stress responses is unknown. We analyzed the
      absolute amounts of the Nrf2, Keap1, and Cul3 proteins in five murine cell lines 
      by comparison with serial dilutions of purified recombinant protein standards in 
      combination with quantitative immunoblot analyses. In the basal state, the amount
      of Nrf2 was maintained at lower levels than those of Keap1 and Cul3 proteins,
      whereas the electrophilic agent diethylmaleate dramatically increased Nrf2 to a
      level greater than that of Keap1 and Cul3, resulting in the accumulation of Nrf2 
      in the nucleus. In contrast, Keap1 and Cul3 did not display any changes in their 
      abundance, subcellular localization, or interaction in response to electrophilic 
      stimuli. Our results demonstrate that the regulation of the Nrf2 protein level
      during stress responses is mediated by the activity but not the composition of
      the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3 complex.

TI  - Transcriptional Maintenance of Pancreatic Acinar Identity, Differentiation, and
      Homeostasis by PTF1A.
PG  - 3033-3047
AB  - Maintenance of cell type identity is crucial for health, yet little is known of
      the regulation that sustains the long-term stability of differentiated
      phenotypes. To investigate the roles that key transcriptional regulators play in 
      adult differentiated cells, we examined the effects of depletion of the
      developmental master regulator PTF1A on the specialized phenotype of the adult
      pancreatic acinar cell in vivo Transcriptome sequencing and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing results showed that PTF1A maintains the expression
      of genes for all cellular processes dedicated to the production of the secretory 
      digestive enzymes, a highly attuned surveillance of unfolded proteins, and a
      heightened unfolded protein response (UPR). Control by PTF1A is direct on target 
      genes and indirect through a ten-member transcription factor network. Depletion
      of PTF1A causes an imbalance that overwhelms the UPR, induces cellular injury,
      and provokes acinar metaplasia. Compromised cellular identity occurs by
      derepression of characteristic stomach genes, some of which are also associated
      with pancreatic ductal cells. The loss of acinar cell homeostasis,
      differentiation, and identity is directly relevant to the pathologies of
      pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Regulation of Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex by Caspase-Mediated
      Cleavage of RNF31.
PG  - 3010-3018
AB  - Cell death and survival signaling pathways have opposed but fundamental functions
      for various cellular processes and maintain cell homeostasis through cross talk. 
      Here we report a novel mechanism of interaction between these two pathways
      through the cleavage of RNF31 by caspases. RNF31, a component of the linear
      ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), regulates cell survival by inducing
      linear ubiquitination of NF-kappaB signaling components. We found that RNF31 is
      cleaved under apoptosis conditions through various stimulations. The effector
      caspases caspase 3 and caspase 6 are responsible for this event, and aspartates
      348, 387, and 390 were identified as target sites for this cleavage. Cleavage of 
      RNF31 suppressed its ability to activate NF-kappaB signaling; thus, mutation of
      cleavage sites inhibited the induction of apoptosis by treatment with tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Our findings elucidate a novel regulatory loop
      between cell death and the survival signal and may provide guidance for the
      development of therapeutic strategies for cancers through the sensitization of
      tumor cells to death-inducing drugs.

TI  - Mechanisms Underlying Acrolein-Mediated Inhibition of Chromatin Assembly.
PG  - 2995-3008
AB  - Acrolein is a major component of cigarette smoke and cooking fumes. Previously,
      we reported that acrolein compromises chromatin assembly; however, underlying
      mechanisms have not been defined. Here, we report that acrolein reacts with
      lysine residues, including lysines 5 and 12, sites important for chromatin
      assembly, on histone H4 in vitro and in vivo Acrolein-modified histones are
      resistant to acetylation, suggesting that the reduced H4K12 acetylation that
      occurs following acrolein exposure is probably due to the formation of
      acrolein-histone lysine adducts. Accordingly, the association of H3/H4 with the
      histone chaperone ASF1 and importin 4 is disrupted and the translocation of green
      fluorescent protein-tagged H3 is inhibited in cells exposed to acrolein.
      Interestingly, in vitro plasmid supercoiling assays revealed that treatment of
      either histones or ASF1 with acrolein has no effect on the formation of plasmid
      supercoiling, indicating that acrolein-protein adduct formation itself does not
      directly interfere with nucleosome assembly. Notably, exposure of histones to
      acrolein prior to histone acetylation leads to the inhibition of remodeling and
      spacing factor chromatin assembly, which requires acetylated histones for
      efficient assembly. These results suggest that acrolein compromises chromatin
      assembly by reacting with histone lysine residues at the sites critical for
      chromatin assembly and prevents these sites from physiological modifications.

TI  - p97 Promotes a Conserved Mechanism of Helicase Unloading during DNA Cross-Link
      Repair.
PG  - 2983-2994
AB  - Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are extremely toxic DNA lesions that create an
      impassable roadblock to DNA replication. When a replication fork collides with an
      ICL, it triggers a damage response that promotes multiple DNA processing events
      required to excise the cross-link from chromatin and resolve the stalled
      replication fork. One of the first steps in this process involves displacement of
      the CMG replicative helicase (comprised of Cdc45, MCM2-7, and GINS), which
      obstructs the underlying cross-link. Here we report that the p97/Cdc48/VCP
      segregase plays a critical role in ICL repair by unloading the CMG complex from
      chromatin. Eviction of the stalled helicase involves K48-linked
      polyubiquitylation of MCM7, p97-mediated extraction of CMG, and a largely
      degradation-independent mechanism of MCM7 deubiquitylation. Our results show that
      ICL repair and replication termination both utilize a similar mechanism to
      displace the CMG complex from chromatin. However, unlike termination,
      repair-mediated helicase unloading involves the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1,
      which acts upstream of MCM7 ubiquitylation and p97 recruitment. Together, these
      findings indicate that p97 plays a conserved role in dismantling the CMG helicase
      complex during different cellular events, but that distinct regulatory signals
      ultimately control when and where unloading takes place.

TI  - Altered Interleukin-10 Signaling in Skeletal Muscle Regulates Obesity-Mediated
      Inflammation and Insulin Resistance.
PG  - 2956-2966
AB  - Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is a major characteristic of obesity and type 
      2 diabetes. Although obesity-mediated inflammation is causally associated with
      insulin resistance, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we examined the
      effects of chronic obesity in mice with muscle-specific overexpression of
      interleukin-10 (M(IL10)). After 16 weeks of a high-fat diet (HFD), M(IL10) mice
      became markedly obese but showed improved insulin action compared to that of
      wild-type mice, which was largely due to increased glucose metabolism and reduced
      inflammation in skeletal muscle. Since leptin regulates inflammation, the
      beneficial effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10) were further examined in
      leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Muscle-specific overexpression of IL-10 in ob/ob
      mice (MCK-IL10(ob/ob)) did not affect spontaneous obesity, but MCK-IL10(ob/ob)
      mice showed increased glucose turnover compared to that in ob/ob mice. Last, mice
      with muscle-specific ablation of IL-10 receptor (M-IL10R(-/-)) were generated to 
      determine whether IL-10 signaling in skeletal muscle is involved in IL-10 effects
      on glucose metabolism. After an HFD, M-IL10R(-/-) mice developed insulin
      resistance with reduced glucose metabolism compared to that in wild-type mice.
      Overall, these results demonstrate IL-10 effects to attenuate obesity-mediated
      inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, and our findings
      implicate a potential therapeutic role of anti-inflammatory cytokines in treating
      insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

TI  - A Pdx-1-Regulated Soluble Factor Activates Rat and Human Islet Cell
      Proliferation.
PG  - 2918-2930
AB  - The homeodomain transcription factor Pdx-1 has important roles in pancreas and
      islet development as well as in beta-cell function and survival. We previously
      reported that Pdx-1 overexpression stimulates islet cell proliferation, but the
      mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of Pdx-1
      triggers proliferation largely by a non-cell-autonomous mechanism mediated by
      soluble factors. Consistent with this idea, overexpression of Pdx-1 under the
      control of a beta-cell-specific promoter (rat insulin promoter [RIP]) stimulates 
      proliferation of both alpha and beta cells, and overexpression of Pdx-1 in islets
      separated by a Transwell membrane from islets lacking Pdx-1 overexpression
      activates proliferation in the untreated islets. Microarray and gene ontology
      (GO) analysis identified inhibin beta-B (Inhbb), an activin subunit and member of
      the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, as a Pdx-1-responsive
      gene. Overexpression of Inhbb or addition of activin B stimulates rat islet cell 
      and beta-cell proliferation, and the activin receptors RIIA and RIIB are required
      for the full proliferative effects of Pdx-1 in rat islets. In human islets, Inhbb
      overexpression stimulates total islet cell proliferation and potentiates
      Pdx-1-stimulated proliferation of total islet cells and beta cells. In sum, this 
      study identifies a mechanism by which Pdx-1 induces a soluble factor that is
      sufficient to stimulate both rat and human islet cell proliferation.

TI  - DHX33 Transcriptionally Controls Genes Involved in the Cell Cycle.
PG  - 2903-2917
AB  - The RNA helicase DHX33 has been shown to be a critical regulator of cell
      proliferation and growth. However, the underlying mechanisms behind DHX33
      function remain incompletely understood. We present original evidence in multiple
      cell lines that DHX33 transcriptionally controls the expression of genes involved
      in the cell cycle, notably cyclin, E2F1, cell division cycle (CDC), and
      minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes. DHX33 physically associates with the
      promoters of these genes and controls the loading of active RNA polymerase II
      onto these promoters. DHX33 deficiency abrogates cell cycle progression and DNA
      replication and leads to cell apoptosis. In zebrafish, CRISPR-mediated knockout
      of DHX33 results in downregulation of cyclin A2, cyclin B2, cyclin D1, cyclin E2,
      cdc6, cdc20, E2F1, and MCM complexes in DHX33 knockout embryos. Additionally, we 
      found the overexpression of DHX33 in a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers and 
      in Ras-mutated human lung cancer cell lines. Forced reduction of DHX33 in these
      cancer cells abolished tumor formation in vivo Our study demonstrates for the
      first time that DHX33 acts as a direct transcriptional regulator to promote cell 
      cycle progression and plays an important role in driving cell proliferation
      during both embryo development and tumorigenesis.

TI  - Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 2 and CHOP Restrict the Expression of the
      Growth Arrest-Specific p20K Lipocalin Gene to G0.
PG  - 2890-2902
AB  - The activation of the growth arrest-specific (gas) p20K gene depends on the
      interaction of C/EBPbeta with two elements of a 48-bp promoter region termed the 
      quiescence-responsive unit (QRU). Here we identify extracellular signal-related
      kinase 2 (ERK2) as a transcriptional repressor of the p20K QRU in cycling chicken
      embryo fibroblasts (CEF). ERK2 binds to repeated GAAAG sequences overlapping the 
      C/EBPbeta sites of the QRU. The recruitment of ERK2 and C/EBPbeta is mutually
      exclusive and dictates the expression of p20K. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
      was associated with C/EBPbeta under conditions promoting endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) stress and, to a lesser extent, in cycling CEF but was not detectable when
      C/EBPbeta was immunoprecipitated from contact-inhibited cells. During ER stress, 
      overexpression of CHOP inhibited p20K, while its downregulation promoted p20K,
      indicating that CHOP is also a potent inhibitor of p20K. Transcriptome analyses
      revealed that hypoxia-responsive genes are strongly induced in contact-inhibited 
      but not serum-starved CEF, and elevated levels of nitroreductase activity, a
      marker of hypoxia, were detected at confluence. Conditions of hypoxia (2% O2)
      induced growth arrest in subconfluent CEF and markedly stimulated p20K
      expression, suggesting that the control of proliferation and gas gene expression 
      is closely linked to limiting oxygen concentrations associated with high cell
      densities.

TI  - Mutator Phenotype and DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in BLM Helicase-Deficient
      Human Cells.
PG  - 2877-2889
AB  - Bloom syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder of the BLM gene, predisposes
      sufferers to various cancers. To investigate the mutator phenotype and genetic
      consequences of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in BS cells, we developed BLM
      helicase-deficient human cells by disrupting the BLM gene. Cells with a loss of
      heterozygosity (LOH) due to homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end
      joining (NHEJ) can be restored with or without site-directed DSB induction. BLM
      cells exhibited a high frequency of spontaneous interallelic HR with crossover,
      but noncrossover events with long-tract gene conversions also occurred. Despite
      the highly interallelic HR events, BLM cells predominantly produced hemizygous
      LOH by spontaneous deletion. These phenotypes manifested during repair of DSBs.
      Both NHEJ and HR appropriately repaired DSBs in BLM cells, resulting in
      hemizygous and homozygous LOHs, respectively. However, the magnitude of the LOH
      was exacerbated in BLM cells, as evidenced by large deletions and long-tract gene
      conversions with crossover. BLM helicase suppresses the elongation of branch
      migration and crossover of double Holliday junctions (HJs) during HR repair, and 
      a deficiency in this enzyme causes collapse, abnormal elongation, and/or
      preferable resolution to crossover of double HJs, resulting in a large-scale LOH.
      This mechanism underlies the predisposition for cancer in BS.

TI  - Cytoplasmic ATXN7L3B Interferes with Nuclear Functions of the SAGA Deubiquitinase
      Module.
PG  - 2855-2866
AB  - The SAGA complex contains two enzymatic modules, which house histone
      acetyltransferase (HAT) and deubiquitinase (DUB) activities. USP22 is the
      catalytic subunit of the DUB module, but two adaptor proteins, ATXN7L3 and ENY2, 
      are necessary for DUB activity toward histone H2Bub1 and other substrates.
      ATXN7L3B shares 74% identity with the N-terminal region of ATXN7L3, but the
      functions of ATXN7L3B are not known. Here we report that ATXN7L3B interacts with 
      ENY2 but not other SAGA components. Even though ATXN7L3B localizes in the
      cytoplasm, ATXN7L3B overexpression increases H2Bub1 levels, while overexpression 
      of ATXN7L3 decreases H2Bub1 levels. In vitro, ATXN7L3B competes with ATXN7L3 to
      bind ENY2, and in vivo, knockdown of ATXN7L3B leads to concomitant loss of ENY2. 
      Unlike the ATXN7L3 DUB complex, a USP22-ATXN7L3B-ENY2 complex cannot
      deubiquitinate H2Bub1 efficiently in vitro Moreover, ATXN7L3B knockdown inhibits 
      migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and limits expression of ER target
      genes. Collectively, our studies suggest that ATXN7L3B regulates H2Bub1 levels
      and SAGA DUB activity through competition for ENY2 binding.

TI  - Activated Transcription Factor 3 in Association with Histone Deacetylase 6
      Negatively Regulates MicroRNA 199a2 Transcription by Chromatin Remodeling and
      Reduces Endothelin-1 Expression.
PG  - 2838-2854
AB  - Previous studies showed that high levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF)
      correlated with increased plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent
      vasoconstrictor, in sickle cell disease (SCD). PlGF-mediated transcription of the
      ET-1 gene occurs by activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha)
      and posttranscriptionally by microRNA 199a2 (miR-199a2), which targets the 3'
      untranslated region (UTR) of HIF-1alpha mRNA. However, relatively less is known
      about how PlGF represses the expression of miR-199a2 located in the DNM3 opposite
      strand (DNM3os) transcription unit. Here, we show that PlGF induces the
      expression of activated transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which, in association with
      accessory proteins (c-Jun dimerization protein 2 [JDP2], ATF2, and histone
      deacetylase 6 [HDAC6]), as determined by proteomic analysis, binds to the DNM3os 
      promoter. Furthermore, we show that association of HDAC6 with ATF3 at its binding
      site in this promoter was correlated with repression of miR-199a2 transcription, 
      as shown by DNM3os transcription reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation
      (ChIP) assays. Tubacin, an inhibitor of HDAC6, antagonized PlGF-mediated
      repression of DNM3os/pre-miR-199a2 transcription with a concomitant reduction in 
      ET-1 levels in cultured endothelial cells. Analysis of lung tissues from Berkeley
      sickle (BK-SS) mice showed increased levels of ATF3 and increased expression of
      ET-1. Delivery of tubacin to BK-SS mice significantly attenuated plasma ET-1 and 
      PlGF levels. Our studies demonstrated that ATF3 in conjunction with HDAC6 acts as
      a transcriptional repressor of the DNM3os/miR-199a2 locus.

TI  - Combined Action of Histone Reader Modules Regulates NuA4 Local Acetyltransferase 
      Function but Not Its Recruitment on the Genome.
PG  - 2768-2781
AB  - Recognition of histone marks by reader modules is thought to be at the heart of
      epigenetic mechanisms. These protein domains are considered to function by
      targeting regulators to chromosomal loci carrying specific histone modifications.
      This is important for proper gene regulation as well as propagation of epigenetic
      information. The NuA4 acetyltransferase complex contains two of these reader
      modules, an H3K4me3-specific plant homeodomain (PHD) within the Yng2 subunit and 
      an H3K36me2/3-specific chromodomain in the Eaf3 subunit. While each domain showed
      a close functional interaction with the respective histone mark that it
      recognizes, at the biochemical level, genetic level (as assessed with epistatic
      miniarray profile screens), and phenotypic level, cells with the combined loss of
      both readers showed greatly enhanced phenotypes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
      coupled with next-generation sequencing experiments demonstrated that the Yng2
      PHD specifically directs H4 acetylation near the transcription start site of
      highly expressed genes, while Eaf3 is important downstream on the body of the
      genes. Strikingly, the recruitment of the NuA4 complex to these loci was not
      significantly affected. Furthermore, RNA polymerase II occupancy was decreased
      only under conditions where both PHD and chromodomains were lost, generally in
      the second half of the gene coding regions. Altogether, these results argue that 
      methylated histone reader modules in NuA4 are not responsible for its recruitment
      to the promoter or coding regions but, rather, are required to orient its
      acetyltransferase catalytic site to the methylated histone 3-bearing nucleosomes 
      in the surrounding chromatin, cooperating to allow proper transition from
      transcription initiation to elongation.

TI  - DEAD Box 1 Facilitates Removal of RNA and Homologous Recombination at DNA
      Double-Strand Breaks.
PG  - 2794-2810
AB  - Although RNA and RNA-binding proteins have been linked to double-strand breaks
      (DSBs), little is known regarding their roles in the cellular response to DSBs
      and, if any, in the repair process. Here, we provide direct evidence for the
      presence of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs and suggest that binding of RNA to DNA at
      DSBs may impact repair efficiency. Our data indicate that the RNA-unwinding
      protein DEAD box 1 (DDX1) is required for efficient DSB repair and cell survival 
      after ionizing radiation (IR), with depletion of DDX1 resulting in reduced DSB
      repair by homologous recombination (HR). While DDX1 is not essential for end
      resection, a key step in homology-directed DSB repair, DDX1 is required for
      maintenance of the single-stranded DNA once generated by end resection. We show
      that transcription deregulation has a significant effect on DSB repair by HR in
      DDX1-depleted cells and that RNA-DNA duplexes are elevated at DSBs in
      DDX1-depleted cells. Based on our combined data, we propose a role for DDX1 in
      resolving RNA-DNA structures that accumulate at DSBs located at sites of active
      transcription. Our findings point to a previously uncharacterized requirement for
      clearing RNA at DSBs for efficient repair by HR.

TI  - Suppression of MicroRNA 200 Family Expression by Oncogenic KRAS Activation
      Promotes Cell Survival and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in KRAS-Driven
      Cancer.
PG  - 2742-2754
AB  - Oncogenic KRAS contributes to malignant transformation, antiapoptosis, and
      metastasis in multiple human cancers, such as lung, colon, and pancreatic cancers
      and melanoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 18- to 25-nucleotide noncoding
      small RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner via the
      degradation of target mRNAs or inhibition of protein translation. In the present 
      study, using array-based miRNA profiling in IMR90 and MCF10A cells expressing
      oncogenic KRAS, we identified that the expression of the microRNA 200 (mir-200)
      family was suppressed by KRAS activation and that this suppression was mediated
      by the transcription factors JUN and SP1 in addition to ZEB1. Restoration of
      mir-200 expression compromised KRAS-induced cellular transformation in vitro and 
      tumor formation in vivo In addition, we found that enforced expression of mir-200
      abrogated KRAS-induced resistance to apoptosis by directly targeting the
      antiapoptotic gene BCL2 Finally, mir-200 was able to antagonize the
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driven by mutant KRAS. Collectively, our 
      results suggest that repression of endogenous mir-200 expression is one of the
      important cellular responses to KRAS activation during tumor initiation and
      progression.

TI  - Hepatic Overexpression of CD36 Improves Glycogen Homeostasis and Attenuates
      High-Fat Diet-Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance.
PG  - 2715-2727
AB  - The common complications in obesity and type 2 diabetes include hepatic steatosis
      and disruption of glucose-glycogen homeostasis, leading to hyperglycemia. Fatty
      acid translocase (FAT/CD36), whose expression is inducible in obesity, is known
      for its function in fatty acid uptake. Previous work by us and others suggested
      that CD36 plays an important role in hepatic lipid homeostasis, but the results
      have been conflicting and the mechanisms were not well understood. In this study,
      by using CD36-overexpressing transgenic (CD36Tg) mice, we uncovered a surprising 
      function of CD36 in regulating glycogen homeostasis. Overexpression of CD36
      promoted glycogen synthesis, and as a result, CD36Tg mice were protected from
      fasting hypoglycemia. When challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD), CD36Tg mice
      showed unexpected attenuation of hepatic steatosis, increased very low-density
      lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin
      sensitivity. The HFD-fed CD36Tg mice also showed decreased levels of
      proinflammatory hepatic prostaglandins and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
      (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictive and proinflammatory arachidonic acid
      metabolite. We propose that CD36 functions as a protective metabolic sensor in
      the liver under lipid overload and metabolic stress. CD36 may be explored as a
      valuable therapeutic target for the management of metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Xist and Tsix Transcription Dynamics Is Regulated by the X-to-Autosome Ratio and 
      Semistable Transcriptional States.
PG  - 2656-2667
AB  - In female mammals, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a key process in the
      control of gene dosage compensation between X-linked genes and autosomes. Xist
      and Tsix, two overlapping antisense-transcribed noncoding genes, are central
      elements of the X inactivation center (Xic) regulating XCI. Xist upregulation
      results in the coating of the entire X chromosome by Xist RNA in cis, whereas
      Tsix transcription acts as a negative regulator of Xist Here, we generated Xist
      and Tsix reporter mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines to study the genetic and
      dynamic regulation of these genes upon differentiation. Our results revealed
      mutually antagonistic roles for Tsix on Xist and vice versa and indicate the
      presence of semistable transcriptional states of the Xic locus predicting the
      outcome of XCI. These transcriptional states are instructed by the X-to-autosome 
      ratio, directed by regulators of XCI, and can be modulated by tissue culture
      conditions.

TI  - Regulation of Cellular Dynamics and Chromosomal Binding Site Preference of Linker
      Histones H1.0 and H1.X.
PG  - 2681-2696
AB  - Linker histones play important roles in the genomic organization of mammalian
      cells. Of the linker histone variants, H1.X shows the most dynamic behavior in
      the nucleus. Recent research has suggested that the linker histone variants H1.X 
      and H1.0 have different chromosomal binding site preferences. However, it remains
      unclear how the dynamics and binding site preferences of linker histones are
      determined. Here, we biochemically demonstrated that the DNA/nucleosome and
      histone chaperone binding activities of H1.X are significantly lower than those
      of other linker histones. This explains why H1.X moves more rapidly than other
      linker histones in vivo Domain swapping between H1.0 and H1.X suggests that the
      globular domain (GD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of H1.X independently contribute
      to the dynamic behavior of H1.X. Our results also suggest that the N-terminal
      domain (NTD), GD, and CTD cooperatively determine the preferential binding sites,
      and the contribution of each domain for this determination is different depending
      on the target genes. We also found that linker histones accumulate in the
      nucleoli when the nucleosome binding activities of the GDs are weak. Our results 
      contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of dynamic behaviors,
      binding site selection, and localization of linker histones.

TI  - BAR Domain-Containing FAM92 Proteins Interact with Chibby1 To Facilitate
      Ciliogenesis.
PG  - 2668-2680
AB  - Chibby1 (Cby1) is a small, conserved coiled-coil protein that localizes to
      centrioles/basal bodies and plays a crucial role in the formation and function of
      cilia. During early stages of ciliogenesis, Cby1 is required for the efficient
      recruitment of small vesicles at the distal end of centrioles to facilitate basal
      body docking to the plasma membrane. Here, we identified family with sequence
      similarity 92, member A (FAM92A) and FAM92B, which harbor predicted lipid-binding
      BAR domains, as novel Cby1-interacting partners using tandem affinity
      purification and mass spectrometry. We found that in cultured cell lines, FAM92A 
      colocalizes with Cby1 at the centrioles/basal bodies of primary cilia, while
      FAM92B is undetectable. In airway multiciliated cells, both FAM92A and -92B
      colocalize with Cby1 at the base of cilia. Notably, the centriolar localization
      of FAM92A and -92B depends largely on Cby1. Knockdown of FAM92A in RPE1 cells
      impairs ciliogenesis. Consistent with the membrane-remodeling properties of BAR
      domains, FAM92A and -92B in cooperation with Cby1 induce deformed membrane-like
      structures containing the small GTPase Rab8 in cultured cells. Our results
      therefore suggest that FAM92 proteins interact with Cby1 to promote ciliogenesis 
      via regulation of membrane-remodeling processes.

TI  - Functional Differences of Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor Splice Variants
      in Regulating Wnt Signaling.
PG  - 2645-54
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00235-16 [doi]
AB  - The very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) negatively regulates Wnt
      signaling. VLDLR has two major alternative splice variants, VLDLRI and VLDLRII,
      but their biological significance and distinction are unknown. Here we found that
      most tissues expressed both VLDLRI and VLDLRII, while the retina expressed only
      VLDLRII. The shed soluble VLDLR extracellular domain (sVLDLR-N) was detected in
      the conditioned medium of retinal pigment epithelial cells, interphotoreceptor
      matrix, and mouse plasma, indicating that ectodomain shedding of VLDLR occurs
      endogenously. VLDLRII displayed a higher ectodomain shedding rate and a more
      potent inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling than VLDLRI in vitro and in vivo
      O-glycosylation, which is present in VLDLRI but not VLDLRII, determined the
      differential ectodomain shedding rates. Moreover, the release of sVLDLR-N was
      inhibited by a metalloproteinase inhibitor, TAPI-1, while it was promoted by
      phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In addition, sVLDLR-N shedding was
      suppressed under hypoxia. Further, plasma levels of sVLDLR-N were reduced in both
      type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse models. We concluded that VLDLRI and VLDLRII had
      differential roles in regulating Wnt signaling and that decreased plasma levels
      of sVLDLR-N may contribute to Wnt signaling activation in diabetic complications.
      Our study reveals a novel mechanism for intercellular regulation of Wnt signaling
      through VLDLR ectodomain shedding.

TI  - Differences and Similarities in TRAIL- and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Mediated
      Necroptotic Signaling in Cancer Cells.
PG  - 2626-44
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00941-15 [doi]
AB  - Recently, a type of regulated necrosis (RN) called necroptosis was identified to 
      be involved in many pathophysiological processes and emerged as an alternative
      method to eliminate cancer cells. However, only a few studies have elucidated
      components of TRAIL-mediated necroptosis useful for anticancer therapy.
      Therefore, we have compared this type of cell death to tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-mediated necroptosis and found similar signaling through acid and neutral
      sphingomyelinases, the mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2/Omi, Atg5, and
      vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Notably, executive mechanisms of both TRAIL- and
      TNF-mediated necroptosis are independent of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
      (PARP-1), and depletion of p38alpha increases the levels of both types of cell
      death. Moreover, we found differences in signaling between TNF- and
      TRAIL-mediated necroptosis, e.g., a lack of involvement of ubiquitin carboxyl
      hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) and Atg16L1 in executive mechanisms of TRAIL-mediated
      necroptosis. Furthermore, we discovered indications of an altered involvement of 
      mitochondrial components, since overexpression of the mitochondrial protein Bcl-2
      protected Jurkat cells from TRAIL- and TNF-mediated necroptosis, and
      overexpression of Bcl-XL diminished only TRAIL-induced necroptosis in Colo357
      cells. Furthermore, TRAIL does not require receptor internalization and
      endosome-lysosome acidification to mediate necroptosis. Taken together, pathways 
      described for TRAIL-mediated necroptosis and differences from those for
      TNF-mediated necroptosis might be unique targets to increase or modify
      necroptotic signaling and eliminate tumor cells more specifically in future
      anticancer approaches.

TI  - SPRED1 Interferes with K-ras but Not H-ras Membrane Anchorage and Signaling.
PG  - 2612-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00191-16 [doi]
AB  - The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is tightly
      controlled by negative feedback regulators, such as the tumor suppressor SPRED1. 
      The SPRED1 gene also carries loss-of-function mutations in the RASopathy Legius
      syndrome. Growth factor stimulation translocates SPRED1 to the plasma membrane,
      triggering its inhibitory activity. However, it remains unclear whether SPRED1
      there acts at the level of Ras or Raf. We show that pharmacological or galectin-1
      (Gal-1)-mediated induction of B- and C-Raf-containing dimers translocates SPRED1 
      to the plasma membrane. This is facilitated in particular by SPRED1 interaction
      with B-Raf and, via its N terminus, with Gal-1. The physiological significance of
      these novel interactions is supported by two Legius syndrome-associated mutations
      that show diminished binding to both Gal-1 and B-Raf. On the plasma membrane,
      SPRED1 becomes enriched in acidic membrane domains to specifically perturb
      membrane organization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling
      of active K-ras4B (here, K-ras) but not H-ras. However, SPRED1 also blocks on the
      nanoscale the positive effects of Gal-1 on H-ras. Therefore, a combinatorial
      expression of SPRED1 and Gal-1 potentially regulates specific patterns of K-ras- 
      and H-ras-dependent signaling output. More broadly, our results open up the
      possibility that related SPRED and Sprouty proteins act in a similar Ras and Raf

TI  - Unravelling the Mechanism of TrkA-Induced Cell Death by Macropinocytosis in
      Medulloblastoma Daoy Cells.
PG  - 2596-611
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00255-16 [doi]
AB  - Macropinocytosis is a normal cellular process by which cells internalize
      extracellular fluids and nutrients from their environment and is one strategy
      that Ras-transformed pancreatic cancer cells use to increase uptake of amino
      acids to meet the needs of rapid growth. Paradoxically, in non-Ras transformed
      medulloblastoma brain tumors, we have shown that expression and activation of the
      receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA overactivates macropinocytosis, resulting in the
      catastrophic disintegration of the cell membrane and in tumor cell death. The
      molecular basis of this uncontrolled form of macropinocytosis has not been
      previously understood. Here, we demonstrate that the overactivation of
      macropinocytosis is caused by the simultaneous activation of two TrkA-mediated
      pathways: (i) inhibition of RhoB via phosphorylation at Ser(185) by casein kinase
      1, which relieves actin stress fibers, and (ii) FRS2-scaffolded Src and H-Ras
      activation of RhoA, which stimulate actin reorganization and the formation of
      lamellipodia. Since catastrophic macropinocytosis results in brain tumor cell
      death, improved understanding of the mechanisms involved will facilitate future
      efforts to reprogram tumors, even those resistant to apoptosis, to die.

TI  - The Neutrophil Response Induced by an Agonist for Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2
      (GPR43) Is Primed by Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha and by Receptor Uncoupling from 
      the Cytoskeleton but Attenuated by Tissue Recruitment.
PG  - 2583-95
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00161-16 [doi]
AB  - Ligands with improved potency and selectivity for free fatty acid receptor 2
      (FFA2R) have become available, and we here characterize the neutrophil responses 
      induced by one such agonist (Cmp1) and one antagonist (CATPB). Cmp1 triggered an 
      increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ca(2+), and the neutrophils were then 
      desensitized to Cmp1 and to acetate, a naturally occurring FFA2R agonist. The
      antagonist CATPB selectively inhibited responses induced by Cmp1 or acetate. The 
      activated FFA2R induced superoxide anion secretion at a low level in naive blood 
      neutrophils. This response was largely increased by tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) in a process associated with a recruitment of easily mobilizable
      granules, but neutrophils recruited to an aseptic inflammation in vivo were
      nonresponding. Superoxide production induced by Cmp1 was increased in latrunculin
      A-treated neutrophils, but no reactivation of desensitized FFA2R was induced by
      this drug, suggesting that the cytoskeleton is not directly involved in
      terminating the response. The functional and regulatory differences between the
      receptors that recognize short-chain fatty acids and formylated peptides,
      respectively, imply different roles of these receptors in the orchestration of
      inflammation and confirm the usefulness of a selective FFA2R agonist and
      antagonist as tools for the exploration of the precise role of the FFA2R.

TI  - OLA1, a Translational Regulator of p21, Maintains Optimal Cell Proliferation
      Necessary for Developmental Progression.
PG  - 2568-82
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00137-16 [doi]
AB  - OLA1, an Obg-family GTPase, has been implicated in eukaryotic initiation factor 2
      (eIF2)-mediated translational control, but its physiological functions remain
      obscure. Here we report that mouse embryos lacking OLA1 have stunted growth,
      delayed development leading to immature organs-especially lungs-at birth, and
      frequent perinatal lethality. Proliferation of primary Ola1(-/-) mouse embryonic 
      fibroblasts (MEFs) is impaired due to defective cell cycle progression,
      associated with reduced cyclins D1 and E1, attenuated Rb phosphorylation, and
      increased p21(Cip1/Waf1) Accumulation of p21 in Ola1(-/-) MEFs is due to enhanced
      mRNA translation and can be prevented by either reconstitution of OLA1 expression
      or treatment with an eIF2alpha dephosphorylation inhibitor, suggesting that OLA1 
      regulates p21 through a translational mechanism involving eIF2. With
      immunohistochemistry, overexpression of p21 protein was detected in Ola1-null
      embryos with reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, we have generated p21(-/-)
      Ola1(-/-) mice and found that knockout of p21 can partially rescue the growth
      retardation defect of Ola1(-/-) embryos but fails to rescue them from
      developmental delay and the lethality. These data demonstrate, for the first
      time, that OLA1 is required for normal progression of mammalian development. OLA1
      plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation at least in part through 
      suppression of p21 and organogenesis via factors yet to be discovered.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00150-16 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that E proteins induce activation-induced
      deaminase (AID) expression in activated B cells. Here, we examined the role of
      Id3 in germinal center (GC) cells. We found that Id3 expression is high in
      follicular B lineage cells but declines in GC cells. Immunized mice with Id3
      expression depleted displayed a block in germinal center B cell maturation,
      showed reduced numbers of marginal zone B cells and class-switched cells, and
      were associated with decreased antibody titers and lower numbers of plasma cells.
      In vitro, Id3-depleted B cells displayed a defect in class switch recombination. 
      Whereas AID levels were not altered in Id3-depleted activated B cells, the
      expression of a subset of genes encoding signaling components of antigen
      receptor-, cytokine receptor-, and chemokine receptor-mediated signaling was
      significantly impaired. We propose that during the GC reaction, Id3 levels
      decline to activate the expression of genes encoding signaling components that
      mediate B cell receptor- and or cytokine receptor-mediated signaling to promote
      the differentiation of GC B cells.

      to NAFLD. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein alpha-subunit (MTPalpha) functions 
      as a critical enzyme for fatty acid beta-oxidation, but whether dysregulation of 
      MTPalpha is pathogenically connected to NAFLD is poorly understood. We show that 
      MTPalpha is acetylated at lysine residues 350, 383, and 406 (MTPalpha-3K), which 
      promotes its protein stability by antagonizing its ubiquitylation on the same
      three lysines (MTPalpha-3K) and blocking its subsequent degradation. Sirtuin 4
      (SIRT4) has been identified as the deacetylase, deacetylating and destabilizing
      MTPalpha. Replacement of MTPalpha-3K with either MTPalpha-3KR or MTPalpha-3KQ
      inhibits cellular lipid accumulation both in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated alpha 
      mouse liver 12 (AML12) cells and primary hepatocytes and in the livers of
      high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet-fed mice. Moreover, knockdown of SIRT4 could
      phenocopy the effects of MTPalpha-3K mutant expression in mouse livers, and
      MTPalpha-3K mutants more efficiently attenuate SIRT4-mediated hepatic steatosis
      in HF/HS diet-fed mice. Importantly, acetylation of both MTPalpha and MTPalpha-3K
      is decreased while SIRT4 is increased in the livers of mice and humans with
      NAFLD. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of MTPalpha regulation by acetylation 
      and ubiquitylation and a direct functional link of this regulation to NAFLD.

TI  - AJUBA LIM Proteins Limit Hippo Activity in Proliferating Cells by Sequestering
      the Hippo Core Kinase Complex in the Cytosol.
PG  - 2526-42
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00136-16 [doi]
AB  - The Hippo pathway controls organ growth and is implicated in cancer development. 
      Whether and how Hippo pathway activity is limited to sustain or initiate cell
      growth when needed is not understood. The members of the AJUBA family of LIM
      proteins are negative regulators of the Hippo pathway. In mammalian epithelial
      cells, we found that AJUBA LIM proteins limit Hippo regulation of YAP, in
      proliferating cells only, by sequestering a cytosolic Hippo kinase complex in
      which LATS kinase is inhibited. At the plasma membranes of growth-arrested cells,
      AJUBA LIM proteins do not inhibit or associate with the Hippo kinase complex. The
      ability of AJUBA LIM proteins to inhibit YAP regulation by Hippo and to associate
      with the kinase complex directly correlate with their capacity to limit Hippo
      signaling during Drosophila wing development. AJUBA LIM proteins did not
      influence YAP activity in response to cell-extrinsic or cell-intrinsic mechanical
      signals. Thus, AJUBA LIM proteins limit Hippo pathway activity in contexts where 
      cell proliferation is needed.

TI  - Mutation of the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)
      substrate-docking site in the developing brain causes microcephaly with abnormal 
      brain morphogenesis independently of Akt, leading to impaired cognition and
      disruptive behaviors.
LID - MCB.00230-16 [pii]
AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt signaling pathway plays essential
      roles during neuronal development. The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase 1 (PDK1) coordinates the PI 3-kinase signals by activating twenty three
      kinases of the AGC family including Akt. Phosphorylation of a conserved docking
      site in the substrate is a requisite for PDK1 to recognize, phosphorylate and
      activate most of these kinases, with the exception of Akt. We exploited this
      differential mechanism of regulation by generating neuronal-specific conditional 
      knock-in mice expressing the mutant form of PDK1 L155E in which the
      substrate-docking site binding motif, termed the PIF-pocket, was disrupted. As a 
      consequence, activation of all the PDK1 substrates tested excluding Akt was
      abolished. Mice exhibited microcephaly, altered cortical layering and reduced
      circuitry, leading to cognitive deficits and exacerbated disruptive behavior
      combined with diminished motivation. The abnormal patterning of the adult brain
      arise from the reduced ability of the embryonic neurons to polarize and extend
      their axons, therefore highlighting the essential roles that the PDK1 signaling
      beyond Akt plays in mediating the neuronal responses that are instructive for
      brain development.

TI  - MIST1 and PTF1 Collaborate in Feed-forward Regulatory Loops that Maintain the
      Pancreatic Acinar Phenotype in Adult Mice.
LID - MCB.00370-16 [pii]
AB  - Much remains unknown regarding the regulatory networks formed by transcription
      factors in mature, differentiated mammalian cells in vivo, despite many studies
      of individual DNA-binding transcription factors. We report a constellation of
      feed-forward loops formed by the pancreatic transcription factors MIST1 and PTF1 
      that govern the differentiated phenotype of the adult pancreatic acinar cell.
      PTF1 is an atypical basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor complex of
      pancreatic acinar cells and critical to acinar cell fate specification and
      differentiation. MIST1, also a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor,
      enhances the formation and maintenance of the specialized phenotype of
      professional secretory cells. The MIST1 and PTF1 collaboration controls a wide
      range of specialized cellular processes, including secretory protein synthesis
      and processing, exocytosis, and homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum. PTF1
      drives Mist1 transcription, and MIST1 and PTF1 bind and drive the transcription
      of over a hundred downstream acinar genes. PTF1 binds two canonical bipartite
      sites within a 0.7-kb transcriptional enhancer upstream of Mist1 that are
      essential for the activity of the enhancer in vivo MIST1 and PTF1 co-regulate
      target genes synergistically or additively, depending on the target
      transcriptional enhancer. The frequent close binding proximity of PTF1 and MIST1 
      in pancreatic acinar cell chromatin implies extensive collaboration, although the
      collaboration is not dependent on a stable physical interaction.

TI  - MIST1 Links Secretion and Stress as Both Target and Regulator of the UPR.
LID - MCB.00366-16 [pii]
AB  - Transcriptional networks that govern secretory cell specialization, including
      instructing cells to develop a unique cytoarchitecture, amass extensive protein
      synthesis machinery, and be embodied to respond to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      stress, remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we discovered that the
      secretory cell transcription factor MIST1 (Bhlha15), previously shown to be
      essential for cytoskeletal organization and secretory activity, also functions as
      a potent ER stress-inducible transcriptional regulator. Genome-wide DNA binding
      studies, coupled with genetic mouse models, revealed MIST1 gene targets that
      function along the entire breadth of the protein synthesis, processing, transport
      and exocytosis networks. Additionally, key MIST1 targets are essential for
      alleviating ER stress in these highly specialized cells. Indeed, MIST1 functions 
      as a co-regulator of the UPR master transcription factor XBP1 for a portion of
      target genes that contain adjacent MIST1 and XBP1 binding sites. Interestingly,
      Mist1 gene expression is induced during ER stress by XBP1, but as ER stress
      subsides, MIST1 serves as a feedback inhibitor, directly binding the Xbp1
      promoter and repressing Xbp1 transcript production. Together, our findings
      provide a new paradigm for XBP1-dependent UPR regulation and position MIST1 as a 
      potential biotherapeutic for numerous human diseases.

TI  - An Arginine Finger Regulates the Sequential Action of Asymmetrical Hexameric
      ATPase in the Double-Stranded DNA Translocation Motor.
PG  - 2514-23
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00142-16 [doi]
AB  - Biological motors are ubiquitous in living systems. Currently, how the motor
      components coordinate the unidirectional motion is elusive in most cases. Here,
      we report that the sequential action of the ATPase ring in the DNA packaging
      motor of bacteriophage varphi29 is regulated by an arginine finger that extends
      from one ATPase subunit to the adjacent unit to promote noncovalent dimer
      formation. Mutation of the arginine finger resulted in the interruption of ATPase
      oligomerization, ATP binding/hydrolysis, and DNA translocation. Dimer formation
      reappeared when arginine mutants were mixed with other ATPase subunits that can
      offer the arginine to promote their interaction. Ultracentrifugation and virion
      assembly assays indicated that the ATPase was presenting as monomers and dimer
      mixtures. The isolated dimer alone was inactive in DNA translocation, but the
      addition of monomer could restore the activity, suggesting that the hexameric
      ATPase ring contained both dimer and monomers. Moreover, ATP binding or
      hydrolysis resulted in conformation and entropy changes of the ATPase with high
      or low DNA affinity. Taking these observations together, we concluded that the
      arginine finger regulates sequential action of the motor ATPase subunit by
      promoting the formation of the dimer inside the hexamer. The finding of
      asymmetrical hexameric organization is supported by structural evidence of many
      other ATPase systems showing the presence of one noncovalent dimer and four
      monomer subunits. All of these provide clues for why the asymmetrical hexameric
      ATPase gp16 of varphi29 was previously reported as a pentameric configuration by 
      cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) since the contact by the arginine finger
      renders two adjacent ATPase subunits closer than other subunits. Thus, the
      asymmetrical hexamer would appear as a pentamer by cryo-EM, a technology that
      acquires the average of many images.

TI  - Acetylation of Mammalian ADA3 Is Required for Its Functional Roles in Histone
      Acetylation and Cell Proliferation.
PG  - 2487-502
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00342-16 [doi]
AB  - Alteration/deficiency in activation 3 (ADA3) is an essential component of
      specific histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes. We have previously shown that
      ADA3 is required for establishing global histone acetylation patterns and for
      normal cell cycle progression (S. Mohibi et al., J Biol Chem 287:29442-29456,
      2012, http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M112.378901). Here, we report that these
      functional roles of ADA3 require its acetylation. We show that ADA3 acetylation, 
      which is dynamically regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, reflects a
      balance of coordinated actions of its associated HATs, GCN5, PCAF, and p300, and 
      a new partner that we define, the deacetylase SIRT1. We use mass spectrometry and
      site-directed mutagenesis to identify major sites of ADA3 acetylated by GCN5 and 
      p300. Acetylation-defective mutants are capable of interacting with HATs and
      other components of HAT complexes but are deficient in their ability to restore
      ADA3-dependent global or locus-specific histone acetylation marks and cell
      proliferation in Ada3-deleted murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Given the key 
      importance of ADA3-containing HAT complexes in the regulation of various
      biological processes, including the cell cycle, our study presents a novel
      mechanism to regulate the function of these complexes through dynamic ADA3
      acetylation.

TI  - Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition in Sarcomas Is Controlled by the Combinatorial 
      Expression of MicroRNA 200s and GRHL2.
PG  - 2503-13
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00373-16 [doi]
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity involves a process in which cells transiently acquire
      phenotypic traits of another lineage. Two commonly studied types of phenotypic
      plasticity are epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial
      transition (MET). In carcinomas, EMT drives invasion and metastatic
      dissemination, while MET is proposed to play a role in metastatic colonization.
      Phenotypic plasticity in sarcomas is not well studied; however, there is evidence
      that a subset of sarcomas undergo an MET-like phenomenon. While the exact
      mechanisms by which these transitions occur remain largely unknown, it is likely 
      that some of the same master regulators that drive EMT and MET in carcinomas also
      act in sarcomas. In this study, we combined mathematical models with bench
      experiments to identify a core regulatory circuit that controls MET in sarcomas. 
      This circuit comprises the microRNA 200 (miR-200) family, ZEB1, and GRHL2.
      Interestingly, combined expression of miR-200s and GRHL2 further upregulates
      epithelial genes to induce MET. This effect is phenocopied by downregulation of
      either ZEB1 or the ZEB1 cofactor, BRG1. In addition, an MET gene expression
      signature is prognostic for improved overall survival in sarcoma patients.
      Together, our results suggest that a miR-200, ZEB1, GRHL2 gene regulatory network
      may drive sarcoma cells to a more epithelial-like state and that this likely has 
      prognostic relevance.

AB  - The Keystone Symposium on Chromatin and Epigenetics, organized by Luciano Di
      Croce (Center for Genomic Regulation, Spain) and Yang Shi (Harvard Medical
      School, USA), took place 20 to 24 March 2016 at Whistler (British Columbia,
      Canada). The symposium brought together some of the most outstanding scientists
      studying how chromatin structure and epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene function
      in both development and disease. Junior scientists had the opportunity to
      interact with experienced researchers by presenting their work and discussing
      ideas and novel hypotheses. In order to foster interaction and networking, the
      scientific agenda was balanced with an extended social agenda. This meeting
      review describes several of the most provocative and exciting talks from the
      symposium, revealing how fast this research field is evolving and the profound
      impact it will have on human health.

      Drosophila.

AB  - Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs)
      regulates the posttranscriptional fate of RNA during development. Drosophila
      hnRNP A1, Hrp38, is required for germ line stem cell maintenance and oocyte
      localization. The mRNA targets regulated by Hrp38 are mostly unknown. We
      identified 428 Hrp38-associated gene transcripts in the fly ovary, including mRNA
      of the translational repressor Nanos. We found that Hrp38 binds to the 3'
      untranslated region (UTR) of Nanos mRNA, which contains a translation control
      element. We have demonstrated that translation of the luciferase reporter bearing
      the Nanos 3' UTR is enhanced by dsRNA-mediated Hrp38 knockdown as well as by
      mutating potential Hrp38-binding sites. Our data show that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
      inhibits Hrp38 binding to the Nanos 3' UTR, increasing the translation in vivo
      and in vitro hrp38 and Parg null mutants showed an increased ectopic Nanos
      translation early in the embryo. We conclude that Hrp38 represses Nanos
      translation, whereas its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation relieves the repression effect,
      allowing restricted Nanos expression in the posterior germ plasm during oogenesis
      and early embryogenesis.

TI  - Function of Conserved Topological Regions within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      Basal Transcription Factor TFIIH.
PG  - 2464-75
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00182-16 [doi]
AB  - TFIIH is a 10-subunit RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor with a dual
      role in DNA repair. TFIIH contains three enzymatic functions and over 30
      conserved subdomains and topological regions. We systematically tested the
      function of these regions in three TFIIH core module subunits, i.e., Ssl1, Tfb4, 
      and Tfb2, in the DNA translocase subunit Ssl2, and in the kinase module subunit
      Tfb3. Our results are consistent with previously predicted roles for the Tfb2
      Hub, Ssl2 Lock, and Tfb3 Latch regions, with mutations in these elements
      typically having severe defects in TFIIH subunit association. We also found
      unexpected roles for other domains whose function had not previously been
      defined. First, the Ssl1-Tfb4 Ring domains are important for TFIIH assembly.
      Second, the Tfb2 Hub and HEAT domains have an unexpected role in association with
      Tfb3. Third, the Tfb3 Ring domain is important for association with many other
      TFIIH subunits. Fourth, a partial deletion of the Ssl1 N-terminal extension (NTE)
      domain inhibits TFIIH function without affecting subunit association. Finally, we
      used site-specific cross-linking to localize the Tfb3-binding surface on the Rad3
      Arch domain. Our cross-linking results suggest that Tfb3 and Rad3 have an unusual
      interface, with Tfb3 binding on two opposite faces of the Arch.

TI  - Transcriptional Modulator Ifrd1 Regulates Osteoclast Differentiation through
      Enhancing the NF-kappaB/NFATc1 Pathway.
PG  - 2451-63
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01075-15 [doi]
AB  - Bone homeostasis is maintained by the synergistic actions of bone-resorbing
      osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. Here, we show that the transcriptional 
      coactivator/repressor interferon-related developmental regulator 1 (Ifrd1) is
      expressed in osteoclast lineages and represents a component of the machinery that
      regulates bone homeostasis. Ifrd1 expression was transcriptionally regulated in
      preosteoclasts by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand 
      (RANKL) through activator protein 1. Global deletion of murine Ifrd1 increased
      bone formation and decreased bone resorption, leading to a higher bone mass.
      Deletion of Ifrd1 in osteoclast precursors prevented RANKL-induced bone loss,
      although no bone loss was observed under normal physiological conditions.
      RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis was impaired in vitro in Ifrd1-deleted bone
      marrow macrophages (BMMs). Ifrd1 deficiency increased the acetylation of p65 at
      residues K122 and K123 via the inhibition of histone deacetylase-dependent
      deacetylation in BMMs. This repressed the NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of
      nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), an essential
      regulator of osteoclastogenesis. These findings suggest that an
      Ifrd1/NF-kappaB/NFATc1 axis plays a pivotal role in bone remodeling in vivo and
      represents a therapeutic target for bone diseases.

TI  - Role of Exchange Protein Directly Activated by Cyclic AMP Isoform 1 in Energy
      Homeostasis: Regulation of Leptin Expression and Secretion in White Adipose
      Tissue.
PG  - 2440-50
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01034-15 [doi]
AB  - Epacs (exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic AMP [cAMP]) act as
      downstream effectors of cAMP and play important roles in energy balance and
      glucose homeostasis. While global deletion of Epac1 in mice leads to heightened
      leptin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and partial protection against high-fat
      diet (HFD)-induced obesity, the physiological functions of Epac1 in white adipose
      tissue (WAT) has not been explored. Here, we report that adipose tissue-specific 
      Epac1 knockout (AEKO) mice are more prone to HFD-induced obesity, with increased 
      food intake, reduced energy expenditure, and impaired glucose tolerance. Despite 
      the fact that AEKO mice on HFD display increased body weight, these mice have
      decreased circulating leptin levels compared to their wild-type littermates. In
      vivo and in vitro analyses further reveal that suppression of Epac1 in WAT
      decreases leptin mRNA expression and secretion by inhibiting cAMP response
      element binding (CREB) protein and AKT phosphorylation, respectively. Taken
      together, our results demonstrate that Epac1 plays an important role in
      regulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis by promoting leptin expression 
      and secretion in WAT.

TI  - T cell immune deficiency in zap70 mutant zebrafish.
LID - MCB.00281-16 [pii]
AB  - The zeta-chain (TCR) associated protein kinase 70kDa (ZAP70) is required for
      T-cell activation. ZAP70 deficiencies in humans and null mutations in mice lead
      to severe combined immunodeficiency. Here, we describe a zap70 loss-of-function
      mutation in zebrafish (zap70(y442)) that was created using TALENs. In contrast to
      what has been reported in morphant zebrafish, zap70(y442) homozygous mutant
      zebrafish displayed normal development of blood and lymphatic vasculature.
      Hematopoietic cell development was also largely unaffected in mutant larvae.
      However, mutant fish had reduced lck:GFP+ thymic T cells by 5 days
      post-fertilization that persisted into adult stages. Morphological analysis, RNA 
      sequencing and single-cell gene expression profiling of whole kidney marrow cells
      of adult fish revealed complete loss of mature T cells in zap70(y442) mutant
      animals. T cell immunodeficiency was confirmed through transplantation of
      unmatched normal and malignant donor cells into zap70(y442) mutant zebrafish,
      with T cell loss being sufficient for robust allogeneic cell engraftment. zap70
      mutant zebrafish show remarkable conservation of immune cell dysfunction as found
      in mice and humans and will serve as a valuable model to study zap70
      immunodeficiency.

TI  - p66Shc couples mechanical signals to RhoA through FAK-dependent recruitment of
      p115-RhoGEF and GEF-H1.
LID - MCB.00194-16 [pii]
AB  - Tissue cells respond to changes in tensional forces with proliferation or death
      through the control of RhoA. However, the response coupling mechanisms that link 
      force with RhoA activation are poorly understood. We found that tension applied
      to fibronectin-coated microbeads caused recruitment of all three isoforms of the 
      Shc adapter (p66(Shc), p52(Shc), and p46(Shc)) to adhesion complexes. The Shc PTB
      domain was necessary and sufficient for this recruitment, and screening studies
      revealed direct interactions with the FERM domain of FAK that were required for
      Shc translocation to adhesion complexes. The FAK/p66(Shc) complex specifically
      bound and activated the Rho guanyl exchange factors p115-RhoGEF and GEF-H1,
      leading to tension-induced RhoA activation. In contrast, the FAK/p52(Shc) complex
      bound SOS1 but not the Rho GEFs to mediate tension-induced Ras activation.
      Nuclear translocation and activation of the YAP/TAZ transcription factors on firm
      substrates required the FAK/p66(Shc)/Rho GEF complex, and both proliferation on
      firm substrates and anoikis in suspension required signaling through p66(Shc) and
      its associated Rho GEFs. These studies reveal binary and exclusive assignment of 
      p66(Shc) and p52(Shc) to tension-induced Rho or Ras signals, respectively, and
      suggest an integrated role for the two Shc isoforms in coordinating the cellular 
      response to mechanical stimuli.

TI  - Follicle Depletion Provides a Permissive Environment for Ovarian Carcinogenesis.
PG  - 2418-30
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00202-16 [doi]
AB  - We modeled the etiology of postmenopausal biology on ovarian cancer risk using
      germ cell-deficient white-spotting variant (Wv) mice, incorporating oncogenic
      mutations. Ovarian cancer incidence is highest in peri- and postmenopausal women,
      and epidemiological studies have established the impact of reproductive factors
      on ovarian cancer risk. Menopause as a result of ovarian follicle depletion is
      thought to contribute to higher cancer risk. As a consequence of follicle
      depletion, female Wv mice develop ovarian tubular adenomas, a benign epithelial
      tumor corresponding to surface epithelial invaginations and papillomatosis
      frequently found in postmenopausal human ovaries. Lineage tracing using MISR2-Cre
      indicated that the tubular adenomas that developed in Wv mice were largely
      derived from the MISR2 lineage, which marked only a fraction of ovarian surface
      and oviduct epithelial cells in wild-type tissues. Deletion of p27, either
      heterozygous or homozygous, was able to convert the benign tubular adenomas into 
      more proliferative tumors. Restricted deletion of p53 in Wv/Wv mice by either
      intrabursal injection of adenoviral Cre or inclusion of the MISR2-Cre transgene
      also resulted in augmented tumor growth. This finding suggests that follicle
      depletion provides a permissive ovarian environment for oncogenic transformation 
      of epithelial cells, presenting a mechanism for the increased ovarian cancer risk
      in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Heat Shock Factor 1 Is a Substrate for p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases.
PG  - 2403-17
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00292-16 [doi]
AB  - Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) monitors the structural integrity of the proteome.
      Phosphorylation at S326 is a hallmark for HSF1 activation, but the identity of
      the kinase(s) phosphorylating this site has remained elusive. We show here that
      the dietary agent phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) inhibits heat shock protein 90
      (Hsp90), the main negative regulator of HSF1; activates p38 mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK); and increases S326 phosphorylation, trimerization, and
      nuclear translocation of HSF1, and the transcription of a luciferase reporter, as
      well as the endogenous prototypic HSF1 target Hsp70. In vitro, all members of the
      p38 MAPK family rapidly and stoichiometrically catalyze the S326 phosphorylation.
      The use of stable knockdown cell lines and inhibitors indicated that among the
      p38 MAPKs, p38gamma is the principal isoform responsible for the phosphorylation 
      of HSF1 at S326 in cells. A protease-mass spectrometry approach confirmed S326
      phosphorylation and unexpectedly revealed that p38 MAPK also catalyzes the
      phosphorylation of HSF1 at S303/307, previously known repressive
      posttranslational modifications. Thus, we have identified p38 MAPKs as highly
      efficient catalysts for the phosphorylation of HSF1. Furthermore, our findings
      suggest that the magnitude and persistence of activation of p38 MAPK are
      important determinants of the extent and duration of the heat shock response.

PG  - 2396-402
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00165-16 [doi]
AB  - The initiation of signaling in T lymphocytes in response to the binding of the T 
      cell receptor (TCR) to cognate ligands is a key step in the emergence of adaptive
      immune responses. Conventional models posit that TCR signaling is initiated by
      the phosphorylation of receptor-associated immune receptor activation motifs
      (ITAMs). The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Zap70 binds to phosphorylated ITAMs, is 
      subsequently activated, and then propagates downstream signaling. While evidence 
      for such models is provided by experiments with cell lines, in vivo, Zap70 is
      bound to phosphorylated ITAMs in resting T cells. However, Zap70 is activated
      only upon TCR binding to cognate ligand. We report the results of computational
      studies of a new model for the initiation of TCR signaling that incorporates
      these in vivo observations. Importantly, the new model is shown to allow better
      and faster TCR discrimination between self-ligands and foreign ligands. The new
      model is consistent with many past experimental observations, and experiments
      that could further test the model are proposed.

TI  - Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein Regulates the Expression and Metabolic 
      Functions of Wild-Type and Oncogenic IDH1.
PG  - 2384-95
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00163-16 [doi]
AB  - Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is a major transcriptional
      regulator of the enzymes underlying de novo lipid synthesis. However, little is
      known about the SREBP-mediated control of processes that indirectly support
      lipogenesis, for instance, by supplying reducing power in the form of NAPDH or
      directing carbon flux into lipid precursors. Here, we characterize isocitrate
      dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) as a transcriptional target of SREBP across a spectrum of 
      cancer cell lines and human cancers. IDH1 promotes the synthesis of lipids
      specifically from glutamine-derived carbons. Neomorphic mutations in IDH1 occur
      frequently in certain cancers, leading to the production of the oncometabolite
      2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). We found that SREBP induces the expression of
      oncogenic IDH1 and influences 2-HG production from glucose. Treatment of cells
      with 25-hydroxycholesterol or statins, which respectively inhibit or activate
      SREBP, further supports SREBP-mediated regulation of IDH1 and, in cells with
      oncogenic IDH1, carbon flux into 2-HG.

AB  - Targeting of transmembrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proceeds
      via either the signal recognition particle (SRP) or the guided entry of
      tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway, consisting of Get1 to -5 and Sgt2. While
      SRP cotranslationally targets membrane proteins containing one or multiple
      transmembrane domains, the GET pathway posttranslationally targets proteins
      containing a single C-terminal transmembrane domain termed the tail anchor. Here,
      we dissect the roles of the SRP and GET pathways in the sorting of homologous,
      two-membrane-spanning K(+) channel proteins termed Kcv, Kesv, and Kesv-VV. We
      show that Kcv is targeted to the ER cotranslationally via its N-terminal
      transmembrane domain, while Kesv-VV is targeted posttranslationally via its
      C-terminal transmembrane domain, which recruits Get4-5/Sgt2 and Get3.
      Unexpectedly, nascent Kcv recruited not only SRP but also the Get4-5 module of
      the GET pathway to ribosomes. Ribosome binding of Get4-5 was independent of Sgt2 
      and was strongly outcompeted by SRP. The combined data indicate a previously
      unrecognized cotranslational interplay between the SRP and GET pathways.

TI  - Coordinated Regulation of Cap-Dependent Translation and MicroRNA Function by
      Convergent Signaling Pathways.
PG  - 2360-73
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01011-15 [doi]
AB  - Cell growth and proliferation require the coordinated activation of many cellular
      processes, including cap-dependent mRNA translation. MicroRNAs oppose
      cap-dependent translation and set thresholds for expression of target proteins.
      Emerging data suggest that microRNA function is enhanced by cellular activation
      due in part to induction of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) scaffold
      protein GW182. In the current study, we demonstrate that increased expression of 
      GW182 in activated or transformed immune cells results from effects of
      phosphoinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) and 
      Jak-Stat-Pim signaling on the translation of GW182 mRNA. Both signaling pathways 
      enhanced polysome occupancy and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding
      to the 5' 7mG cap of GW182 mRNA. The effect of Jak-Stat-Pim signaling on polysome
      occupancy and expression of GW182 protein was greater than that of PI3K-Akt-mTOR 
      signaling, likely resulting from enhanced eIF4A-dependent unwinding of
      G-quadruplexes in the 5' untranslated region of GW182 mRNA. Consistent with this,
      GW182 expression and microRNA function were reduced by inhibition of mTOR or Pim 
      kinases, translation initiation complex assembly, or eIF4A function. Taken
      together, these data provide a mechanistic link between microRNA function and
      cap-dependent translation that allows activated immune cells to maintain
      microRNA-mediated repression of targets despite enhanced rates of protein
      synthesis.

TI  - Growth of the Mammalian Golgi Apparatus during Interphase.
PG  - 2344-59
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00046-16 [doi]
AB  - During the cell cycle, genetic materials and organelles are duplicated to ensure 
      that there is sufficient cellular content for daughter cells. While Golgi growth 
      in interphase has been observed in lower eukaryotes, the elaborate ribbon
      structure of the mammalian Golgi apparatus has made it challenging to monitor.
      Here we demonstrate the growth of the mammalian Golgi apparatus in its protein
      content and volume during interphase. Through ultrastructural analyses, physical 
      growth of the Golgi apparatus was revealed to occur by cisternal elongation of
      the individual Golgi stacks. By examining the timing and regulation of Golgi
      growth, we established that Golgi growth starts after passage through the cell
      growth checkpoint at late G1 phase and continues in a manner highly correlated
      with cell size growth. Finally, by identifying S6 kinase 1 as a major player in
      Golgi growth, we revealed the coordination between cell size and Golgi growth via
      activation of the protein synthesis machinery in early interphase.

TI  - The Zinc Finger of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain Protein 2 Is Essential for Efficient
      Hydroxylation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor alpha.
PG  - 2328-43
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00090-16 [doi]
AB  - Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) (also known as EGLN1) is a key oxygen 
      sensor in mammals that posttranslationally modifies hypoxia-inducible factor
      alpha (HIF-alpha) and targets it for degradation. In addition to its catalytic
      domain, PHD2 contains an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger domain, which we
      have previously proposed recruits PHD2 to the HSP90 pathway to promote HIF-alpha 
      hydroxylation. Here, we provide evidence that this recruitment is critical both
      in vitro and in vivo We show that in vitro, the zinc finger can function as an
      autonomous recruitment domain to facilitate interaction with HIF-alpha. In vivo, 
      ablation of zinc finger function by a C36S/C42S Egln1 knock-in mutation results
      in upregulation of the erythropoietin gene, erythrocytosis, and augmented hypoxic
      ventilatory response, all hallmarks of Egln1 loss of function and HIF
      stabilization. Hence, the zinc finger ordinarily performs a critical positive
      regulatory function. Intriguingly, the function of this zinc finger is impaired
      in high-altitude-adapted Tibetans, suggesting that their adaptation to high
      altitude may, in part, be due to a loss-of-function EGLN1 allele. Thus, these
      findings have important implications for understanding both the molecular
      mechanism of the hypoxic response and human adaptation to high altitude.

TI  - Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor A Acts via Platelet-Derived Growth Factor
      Receptor alpha To Promote Viability of Cells Enduring Hypoxia.
PG  - 2314-27
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01019-15 [doi]
AB  - Vascular endothelial cell growth factor A (VEGF) is a biologically and
      therapeutically important growth factor because it promotes angiogenesis in
      response to hypoxia, which underlies a wide variety of both physiological and
      pathological settings. We report here that both VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-positive
      and -negative cells depended on VEGF to endure hypoxia. VEGF enhanced the
      viability of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha)-positive 
      and VEGFR2-negative cells by enabling indirect activation of PDGFRalpha, thereby 
      reducing the level of p53. We conclude that the breadth of VEGF's influence
      extends beyond VEGFR-positive cells and propose a plausible mechanistic
      explanation of this phenomenon.

TI  - Role of Src family kinases in regulation of intestinal epithelial homeostasis.
LID - MCB.00311-16 [pii]
AB  - Proper regulation of epithelial cell turnover is important for the structural
      integrity and homeostasis of various tissues including the intestine. Here we
      show that ablation of Csk, a negative regulator of Src family kinases (SFKs),
      specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) resulted in the development of
      hyperplasia throughout the intestinal epithelium of mice. Such conditional
      ablation of Csk also increased the proliferative activity and turnover of IECs,
      disturbed the differentiation of Paneth and goblet cells, reduced the number of
      intestinal stem cells, and attenuated the expression of Wnt target genes in the
      intestine. Moreover, the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 
      as well as the activity of both Rac and Yes-associated protein (YAP) were
      increased in intestinal crypts or organoids of the mutant mice, whereas
      inhibition of Rac or YAP activity rescued the mutant phenotypes. Our results thus
      suggest that SFKs promote the proliferation of IECs in intestinal crypts through 
      activation of Rac or YAP, and that they thereby contribute to the proper
      regulation of IEC turnover and intestinal homeostasis.

TI  - Non-transcriptional Function of FOXO1/DAF-16 Contributes to Translesion DNA
      Synthesis.
LID - MCB.00265-16 [pii]
AB  - Forkhead box O (FOXO; DAF-16 in nematode) transcription factors activate a
      program of genes that control stress resistance, metabolism, and lifespan. Given 
      the adverse impact of the stochastic DNA damage on organismal development and
      ageing, we examined the role of FOXO/DAF-16 in UV-induced DNA-damage response.
      Knockdown of FOXO1, but not FOXO3a, increases sensitivity to UV irradiation when 
      exposed during S phase, suggesting a contribution of FOXO1 to translesion DNA
      synthesis (TLS), a replicative bypass of UV-induced DNA lesions. Actually, FOXO1 
      depletion results in a sustained activation of the ATR-Chk1 signaling and a
      reduction of PCNA monoubiquitination following UV irradiation. FOXO1 does not
      alter the expression of TLS-related genes but binds to the protein replication
      protein A (RPA1) that coats single-stranded DNA and acts as a scaffold for TLS.
      In Caenorhabditis elegans, daf-16 null mutants show UV-induced retardation in
      larval development and are rescued by overexpressing DAF-16 mutant lacking
      transactivation domain, but not substitution mutant unable to interact with
      RPA-1. Thus, our findings demonstrate that FOXO1/DAF-16 is a functional component
      in TLS independently of its transactivation activity.

TI  - The ribosome-associated Mba1 escorts Cox2 from insertion machinery to maturing
      assembly intermediates.
LID - MCB.00361-16 [pii]
AB  - The three conserved core subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase are
      mitochondrial-encoded in close to all eukaryotes. The Cox2 subunit spans the
      inner membrane twice, exposing N- and C-terminus into the intermembrane space.
      For this the N-terminus is exported cotranslationally by Oxa1 and subsequently
      undergoes proteolytic maturation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Little is known
      about the translocation of the C-terminus but Cox18 has been identified as a
      critical protein in this process. Here we find that the scaffold protein Cox20,
      which promotes processing of Cox2, is in complex with the ribosome-receptor Mba1 
      and translating mitochondrial ribosomes in a Cox2-dependent manner. The
      Mba1-Cox20 complex accumulates when export of the C-terminus of Cox2 is blocked
      by loss of the Cox18 protein. While Cox20 engages with Cox18, Mba1 is no longer
      present at this stage. Our analyses indicate that Cox20 associates with nascent
      Cox2 and Mba1 to promote Cox2 maturation cotranslationally. We suggest that Mba1 
      stabilizes the Cox20-ribosome complex and supports handover of Cox2 to the Cox18 
      tail export machinery.

TI  - Microglia-induced activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling aggravates
      neurodegeneration in demyelinating disorders.
LID - MCB.00139-16 [pii]
AB  - Oligodendrocytes are myelinating cells of the central nervous system. Multiple
      sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease characterized by both myelin loss and
      neuronal degeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal
      degeneration in demyelinating disorders are not fully understood. In the
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) demyelinating mouse model of MS, 
      inflammatory microglia produce cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). 
      Since microglia and non-canonical Wnt signaling components in neurons, such as
      the co-receptor Ror2, were observed in the spinal cord of EAE mice, we postulated
      that the interplay between activated microglia and spinal neurons under EAE
      conditions is mediated through non-canonical Wnt signaling. EAE treatment
      up-regulated in vivo expression of non-canonical Wnt signaling components in
      spinal neurons through microglial activation. In accordance with the neuronal
      degeneration detected in the EAE spinal cord in vivo, co-culture of spinal
      neurons with microglia or the application of recombinant IL-1beta up-regulated
      non-canonical Wnt signaling, and induced neuronal cell death, which was
      suppressed by the inhibition of the Wnt-Ror2 pathway. Ectopic non-canonical Wnt
      signaling aggravated the demyelinating pathology in another MS mouse model due to
      Wnt5a-induced neurodegeneration. The linkage between activated microglia and
      neuronal Wnt-Ror2 signaling may provide a possible candidate target for
      therapeutic approaches to demyelinating disorders.

TI  - The Evolutionarily-conserved Polyadenosine RNA Binding Protein, Nab2, Cooperates 
      with Splicing Machinery to Regulate the Fate of pre-mRNA.
LID - MCB.00402-16 [pii]
AB  - Numerous RNA binding proteins are deposited onto an mRNA transcript to modulate
      post-transcriptional processing events ensuring proper mRNA maturation. Defining 
      the interplay between RNA binding proteins that couple mRNA biogenesis events is 
      crucial for understanding how gene expression is regulated. To explore how RNA
      binding proteins control mRNA processing, we investigated a role for the
      evolutionarily conserved polyadenosine RNA binding protein, Nab2, in mRNA
      maturation within the nucleus. This work reveals that nab2 mutant cells
      accumulate intron-containing pre-mRNA in vivo We extend this analysis to identify
      genetic interactions between mutant alleles of nab2 and genes encoding the
      splicing factor, MUD2, and the RNA exosome, RRP6, with in vivo consequences of
      altered pre-mRNA splicing and poly(A) tail length control. As further evidence
      linking Nab2 proteins to splicing, an unbiased proteomic analysis of vertebrate
      Nab2, ZC3H14, identifies physical interactions with numerous components of the
      spliceosome. We validated the interaction between ZC3H14 and U2AF2/U2AF(65)
      Taking all the findings into consideration, we present a model where Nab2/ZC3H14 
      interacts with spliceosome components to allow proper coupling of splicing with
      subsequent mRNA processing steps contributing to a kinetic proofreading step that
      allows properly processed mRNA to exit the nucleus and escape Rrp6-dependent
      degradation.

AB  - Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), a lipid-metabolizing enzyme present in
      bone and cartilage, has been identified to be a key regulator of skeletal
      development. A homozygous loss-of-function mutation called fragilitas ossium
      (fro) in the Smpd3 gene causes poor bone and cartilage mineralization resulting
      in severe congenital skeletal deformities. Here we show that Smpd3 expression in 
      ATDC5 chondrogenic cells is downregulated by parathyroid hormone-related peptide 
      through transcription factor SOX9. Furthermore, we show that transgenic
      expression of Smpd3 in the chondrocytes of fro/fro mice corrects the cartilage
      but not the bone abnormalities. Additionally, we report the generation of
      Smpd3(flox/flox) mice for the tissue-specific inactivation of Smpd3 using the
      Cre-loxP system. We found that the skeletal phenotype in Smpd3(flox/flox);
      Osx-Cre mice, in which the Smpd3 gene is ablated in both late-stage chondrocytes 
      and osteoblasts, closely mimics the skeletal phenotype in fro/fro mice. On the
      other hand, Smpd3(flox/flox); Col2a1-Cre mice, in which the Smpd3 gene is knocked
      out in chondrocytes only, recapitulate the fro/fro mouse cartilage phenotype.
      This work demonstrates that Smpd3 expression in both chondrocytes and osteoblasts
      is required for normal endochondral bone development.

TI  - Oma1 Links Mitochondrial Protein Quality Control and TOR Signaling To Modulate
      Physiological Plasticity and Cellular Stress Responses.
PG  - 2300-12
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00156-16 [doi]
AB  - A network of conserved proteases known as the intramitochondrial quality control 
      (IMQC) system is central to mitochondrial protein homeostasis and cellular
      health. IMQC proteases also appear to participate in establishment of signaling
      cues for mitochondrion-to-nucleus communication. However, little is known about
      this process. Here, we show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of the
      membrane-bound IMQC protease Oma1 interferes with oxidative-stress responses
      through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during logarithmic
      growth and reduced stress signaling via the TORC1-Rim15-Msn2/Msn4 axis.
      Pharmacological or genetic prevention of ROS accumulation in Oma1-deficient cells
      restores this defective TOR signaling. Additionally, inactivation of the Oma1
      ortholog in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans also alters TOR signaling 
      and, unexpectedly, leads to increased resistance to neutrophil killing and
      virulence in the invertebrate animal model Galleria mellonella Our findings
      reveal a novel and evolutionarily conserved link between IMQC and TOR-mediated
      signaling that regulates physiological plasticity and pancellular
      oxidative-stress responses.

TI  - Gata3 Hypomorphic Mutant Mice Rescued with a Yeast Artificial Chromosome
      Transgene Suffer a Glomerular Mesangial Cell Defect.
PG  - 2272-81
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00173-16 [doi]
AB  - GATA3 is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in
      embryonic kidney development, while its precise functions in the adult kidney
      remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that GATA3 is specifically
      expressed in glomerular mesangial cells and plays a critical role in the
      maintenance of renal glomerular function. Newly generated Gata3 hypomorphic
      mutant mice exhibited neonatal lethality associated with severe renal hypoplasia.
      Normal kidney size was restored by breeding the hypomorphic mutant with a
      rescuing transgenic mouse line bearing a 662-kb Gata3 yeast artificial chromosome
      (YAC), and these animals (termed G3YR mice) survived to adulthood. However, most 
      of the G3YR mice showed degenerative changes in glomerular mesangial cells, which
      deteriorated progressively during postnatal development. Consequently, the G3YR
      adult mice suffered severe renal failure. We found that the 662-kb Gata3 YAC
      transgene recapitulated Gata3 expression in the renal tubules but failed to
      direct sufficient GATA3 activity to mesangial cells. Renal glomeruli of the G3YR 
      mice had significantly reduced amounts of platelet-derived growth factor receptor
      (PDGFR), which is known to participate in the development and maintenance of
      glomerular mesangial cells. These results demonstrate a critical role for GATA3
      in the maintenance of mesangial cells and its absolute requirement for prevention
      of glomerular disease.

TI  - Coordinated Action of Nap1 and RSC in Disassembly of Tandem Nucleosomes.
PG  - 2262-71
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00195-16 [doi]
AB  - The SWI/SNF and RSC family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers disassembles
      nucleosomes by moving nucleosomes into the vicinity of adjoining nucleosomes. We 
      found that the histone chaperone Nap1 efficiently promotes disassembly of
      adjacent nucleosomes with which RSC collides and not the disassembly of
      nucleosomes mobilized by RSC. Nap1 is specific to RSC, as it does not target
      SWI/SNF, its paralog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Extensive mutational analysis of
      Nap1 has revealed that Nap1 affinity for histones H2A-H2B and H3-H4 and its
      ability to displace histones from DNA are required for Nap1 to enhance
      RSC-mediated disassembly. Other histone chaperones, such as Vps75, that also bind
      histones are not able to enhance RSC-mediated disassembly. Our study suggests a
      mechanism by which Nap1 is recruited to actively transcribed regions and assists 
      in the passage of the transcription complex through chromatin, and it provides a 
      novel mechanism for the coordinated action of RSC and Nap1.

      Tumors.
PG  - 2246-61
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00087-16 [doi]
AB  - Identification and characterization of survival pathways active in tumor cells
      but absent in normal tissues provide opportunities to develop effective
      anticancer therapies with reduced toxicity to the patient. We show here that,
      like kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), EPH (erythropoietin-producing
      hepatocellular carcinoma) receptor B4 (EPHB4) is aberrantly overexpressed in
      human colon tumor cell lines and selectively required for their survival. KSR1
      and EPHB4 support tumor cell survival by promoting the expression of downstream
      targets, Myc and the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1beta (PGC1beta). While KSR1
      promotes the aberrant expression of Myc and the PGC1beta protein via a
      posttranscriptional mechanism, EPHB4 has a greater effect on Myc and PGC1beta
      expression via its ability to elevate mRNA levels. Subsequent analysis of the
      posttranscriptional regulation demonstrated that KSR1 promotes the translation of
      Myc protein. These findings reveal novel KSR1- and EPHB4-dependent signaling
      pathways supporting the survival of colorectal cancer cells through regulation of
      Myc and PGC1beta, suggesting that inhibition of KSR1 or EPHB4 effectors may lead 
      to selective toxicity in colorectal tumors.

TI  - Phosphatase Rtr1 Regulates Global Levels of Serine 5 RNA Polymerase II C-Terminal
      Domain Phosphorylation and Cotranscriptional Histone Methylation.
PG  - 2236-45
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00870-15 [doi]
AB  - In eukaryotes, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1 contains a heptapeptide repeat
      sequence of (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7)n that undergoes reversible phosphorylation through
      the opposing action of kinases and phosphatases. Rtr1 is a conserved protein that
      colocalizes with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and has been shown to be important
      for the transition from elongation to termination during transcription by
      removing RNAPII CTD serine 5 phosphorylation (Ser5-P) at a selection of target
      genes. In this study, we show that Rtr1 is a global regulator of the CTD code
      with deletion of RTR1 causing genome-wide changes in Ser5-P CTD phosphorylation
      and cotranscriptional histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3). Using
      chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-resolution microarrays, we show that RTR1 
      deletion results in global changes in RNAPII Ser5-P levels on genes with
      different lengths and transcription rates consistent with its role as a CTD
      phosphatase. Although Ser5-P levels increase, the overall occupancy of RNAPII
      either decreases or stays the same in the absence of RTR1 Additionally, the loss 
      of Rtr1 in vivo leads to increases in H3K36me3 levels genome-wide, while total
      histone H3 levels remain relatively constant within coding regions. Overall,
      these findings suggest that Rtr1 regulates H3K36me3 levels through changes in the
      number of binding sites for the histone methyltransferase Set2, thereby
      influencing both the CTD and histone codes.

TI  - The C-Terminal RGG Domain of Human Lsm4 Promotes Processing Body Formation
      Stimulated by Arginine Dimethylation.
PG  - 2226-35
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01102-15 [doi]
AB  - Processing bodies (PBs) are conserved cytoplasmic aggregations of translationally
      repressed mRNAs assembled with mRNA decay factors. The aggregation of
      mRNA-protein (mRNP) complexes into PBs involves interactions between
      low-complexity regions of protein components of the mRNPs. In Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, the carboxy (C)-terminal Q/N-rich domain of the Lsm4 subunit of the
      Lsm1-7 complex plays an important role in PB formation, but the C-terminal domain
      of Lsm4 in most eukaryotes is an RGG domain rather than Q/N rich. Here we show
      that the Lsm4 RGG domain promotes PB accumulation in human cells and that
      symmetric dimethylation of arginines within the RGG domain stimulates this
      process. A mutant Lsm4 protein lacking the RGG domain failed to rescue PB
      formation in cells depleted of endogenous Lsm4, although this mutant protein
      retained the ability to assemble with Lsm1-7, associate with decapping factors,
      and promote mRNA decay and translational repression. Mutation of the
      symmetrically dimethylated arginines within the RGG domain impaired the ability
      of Lsm4 to promote PB accumulation. Depletion of PRMT5, the primary protein
      arginine methyltransferase responsible for symmetric arginine dimethylation,
      including Lsm4, resulted in loss of PBs. We also uncovered the histone
      acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1)-RBBP7 lysine acetylase complex as an interaction
      partner of the Lsm4 RGG domain but found no evidence of a role for this complex
      in PB metabolism. Together, our findings suggest a stimulatory role for
      posttranslational modifications in PB accumulation and raise the possibility that
      mRNP dynamics are posttranslationally regulated.

TI  - ZDHHC3 Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulates Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule
      Palmitoylation.
PG  - 2208-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00144-16 [doi]
AB  - The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix
      adhesion. It is broadly expressed in the nervous system and regulates neurite
      outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Previous in vitro studies
      revealed that palmitoylation of NCAM is required for fibroblast growth factor 2
      (FGF2)-stimulated neurite outgrowth and identified the zinc finger DHHC
      (Asp-His-His-Cys)-containing proteins ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7 as specific
      NCAM-palmitoylating enzymes. Here, we verified that FGF2 controlled NCAM
      palmitoylation in vivo and investigated molecular mechanisms regulating NCAM
      palmitoylation by ZDHHC3. Experiments with overexpression and pharmacological
      inhibition of FGF receptor (FGFR) and Src revealed that these kinases control
      tyrosine phosphorylation of ZDHHC3 and that ZDHHC3 is phosphorylated by
      endogenously expressed FGFR and Src proteins. By site-directed mutagenesis, we
      found that Tyr18 is an FGFR1-specific ZDHHC3 phosphorylation site, while Tyr295
      and Tyr297 are specifically phosphorylated by Src kinase in cell-based and
      cell-free assays. Abrogation of tyrosine phosphorylation increased ZDHHC3
      autopalmitoylation, enhanced interaction with NCAM, and upregulated NCAM
      palmitoylation. Expression of ZDHHC3 with tyrosine mutated in cultured
      hippocampal neurons promoted neurite outgrowth. Our findings for the first time
      highlight that FGFR- and Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ZDHHC3
      modulates ZDHHC3 enzymatic activity and plays a role in neuronal morphogenesis.

PG  - 2141
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00096-16 [doi]
AB  - Lung alveolar type II cells uniquely synthesize surfactant, a developmentally
      regulated lipoprotein that is essential for breathing. Expression of the gene
      (SFTPA) encoding the major surfactant protein, SP-A, in midgestation human fetal 
      lung (HFL) is dramatically induced by cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP induction of SP-A
      expression is repressed by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and by
      hypoxia. In this study, we found that expression of the microRNA 29 (miR-29)
      family was significantly upregulated in epithelial cells isolated from mouse
      fetal lung during late gestation and in epithelial cells isolated from HFL
      explants during type II cell differentiation in culture. miR-29 expression in
      cultured HFL epithelial cells was increased by cAMP and inhibited by hypoxia,
      whereas the miR-29 target, TGF-beta2, was coordinately decreased. Knockdown of
      the miR-29 family in cultured HFL type II cells blocked cAMP-induced SP-A
      expression and accumulation of surfactant-containing lamellar bodies, suggesting 
      their physiological relevance. This occurred through derepression of TGF-beta
      signaling. Notably, cAMP increased binding of endogenous thyroid transcription
      factor 1 (TTF-1/Nkx2.1) to the miR-29ab1 promoter in HFL type II cells, and TTF-1
      increased miR-29ab1 promoter-driven luciferase activity in cotransfection assays.
      Together, these findings identify miR-29 family members as TTF-1-driven mediators
      of SP-A expression and type II cell differentiation through repression of
      TGF-beta signaling.

TI  - Novel Grb14-Mediated Cross Talk between Insulin and p62/Nrf2 Pathways Regulates
      Liver Lipogenesis and Selective Insulin Resistance.
PG  - 2168-81
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00170-16 [doi]
AB  - A long-standing paradox in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases is the
      selective insulin resistance of the liver. It is characterized by a blunted
      action of insulin to reduce glucose production, contributing to hyperglycemia,
      while de novo lipogenesis remains insulin sensitive, participating in turn to
      hepatic steatosis onset. The underlying molecular bases of this conundrum are not
      yet fully understood. Here, we established a model of selective insulin
      resistance in mice by silencing an inhibitor of insulin receptor catalytic
      activity, the growth factor receptor binding protein 14 (Grb14) in liver. Indeed,
      Grb14 knockdown enhanced hepatic insulin signaling but also dramatically
      inhibited de novo fatty acid synthesis. In the liver of obese and
      insulin-resistant mice, downregulation of Grb14 markedly decreased blood glucose 
      and improved liver steatosis. Mechanistic analyses showed that upon Grb14
      knockdown, the release of p62/sqstm1, a partner of Grb14, activated the
      transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which in
      turn repressed the lipogenic nuclear liver X receptor (LXR). Our study reveals
      that Grb14 acts as a new signaling node that regulates lipogenesis and modulates 
      insulin sensitivity in the liver by acting at a crossroad between the insulin
      receptor and the p62-Nrf2-LXR signaling pathways.

TI  - Poly(rC)-Binding Protein 2 Regulates Hippo Signaling To Control Growth in Breast 
      Epithelial Cells.
PG  - 2121-31
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00104-16 [doi]
AB  - Poly(rC)-binding proteins (PCBPs) are multifunctional adapters that mediate
      interactions between nucleic acids, iron cofactors, and other proteins, affecting
      the fates and activities of the components of these interactions. Here, we show
      that PCBP2 forms a complex with the Hippo pathway components Salvador (Sav1),
      Mst1, Mst2, and Lats1 in human cells and mouse tissues. Hippo is a kinase cascade
      that functions to phosphorylate and inactivate the transcriptional coactivators
      YAP and TAZ, which control cell growth and proliferation. PCBP2 specifically
      interacts with the scaffold protein Sav1 and prevents proteolytic cleavage of the
      Mst1 kinase, resulting in increased signaling through Hippo and suppressed
      activity of YAP and TAZ. Human breast epithelial cells lacking PCBP2 exhibit
      impaired proteasomal degradation of TAZ. They accumulate TAZ in both the nucleus 
      and the cytosol, increase expression of YAP and TAZ connective tissue growth
      factor (CTGF) and Cyr61 target genes, and exhibit anchorage-independent growth.
      Thus, PCBP2 can function as a component of the Hippo complex, enhancing
      signaling, suppressing activity of YAP and TAZ, and altering the growth
      characteristics of cells.

TI  - Allosteric Interactions by p53 mRNA Govern HDM2 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Specificity
      under Different Conditions.
PG  - 2195-205
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00113-16 [doi]
AB  - HDM2 and HDMX are key negative regulatory factors of the p53 tumor suppressor
      under normal conditions by promoting its degradation or preventing its trans
      activity, respectively. It has more recently been shown that both proteins can
      also act as positive regulators of p53 after DNA damage. This involves
      phosphorylation by ATM on serine residues HDM2(S395) and HDMX(S403), promoting
      their respective interaction with the p53 mRNA. However, the underlying molecular
      mechanisms of how these phosphorylation events switch HDM2 and HDMX from negative
      to positive regulators of p53 is not known. Our results show that these
      phosphorylation events reside within intrinsically disordered domains and change 
      the conformation of the proteins. The modifications promote the exposition of
      N-terminal interfaces that support the formation of a new HDMX-HDM2 heterodimer
      independent of the C-terminal RING-RING interaction. The E3 ubiquitin ligase
      activity of this complex toward p53 is prevented by the p53 mRNA ligand but,
      interestingly, does not affect the capacity to ubiquitinate HDMX and HDM2. These 
      results show how ATM-mediated modifications of HDMX and HDM2 switch HDM2 E3
      ubiquitin ligase activity away from p53 but toward HDMX and itself and illustrate
      how the substrate specificity of HDM2 E3 ligase activity is regulated.

      Transcriptional Regulation.
PG  - 2151-67
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00017-16 [doi]
AB  - GATA1 organizes erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by orchestrating the
      expression of multiple genes that show diversified expression profiles. Here, we 
      demonstrate that GATA1 monovalently binds to a single GATA motif (Single-GATA)
      while a monomeric GATA1 and a homodimeric GATA1 bivalently bind to two GATA
      motifs in palindromic (Pal-GATA) and direct-repeat (Tandem-GATA) arrangements,
      respectively, and form higher stoichiometric complexes on respective elements.
      The amino-terminal zinc (N) finger of GATA1 critically contributes to high
      occupancy of GATA1 on Pal-GATA. GATA1 lacking the N finger-DNA association fails 
      to trigger a rate of target gene expression comparable to that seen with the
      wild-type GATA1, especially when expressed at low level. This study revealed that
      Pal-GATA and Tandem-GATA generate transcriptional responses from GATA1 target
      genes distinct from the response of Single-GATA. Our results support the notion
      that the distinct alignments in binding motifs are part of a critical regulatory 
      strategy that diversifies and modulates transcriptional regulation by GATA1.

TI  - SCFFbl12 Increases p21Waf1/Cip1 Expression Level through Atypical Ubiquitin Chain
      Synthesis.
PG  - 2182-94
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00174-16 [doi]
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 is an unstructured protein
      regulated by multiple turnover pathways. p21 abundance is tightly regulated, and 
      its defect causes tumor development. However, the mechanisms that underlie the
      control of p21 level are not fully understood. Here, we report a novel mechanism 
      by which a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase, Fbl12, augments p21 via the
      formation of atypical ubiquitin chains. We found that Fbl12 binds and
      ubiquitinates p21. Unexpectedly, Fbl12 increases the expression level of p21 by
      enhancing the mixed-type ubiquitination, including not only K48- but also
      K63-linked ubiquitin chains, followed by promotion of binding between p21 and
      CDK2. We also found that proteasome activator PA28gamma attenuates p21
      ubiquitination by interacting with Fbl12. In addition, UV irradiation induces a
      dissociation of p21 from Fbl12 and decreases K63-linked ubiquitination, leading
      to p21 degradation. These data suggest that Fbl12 is a key factor that maintains

TI  - A Mutation in the Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide-Dependent Oxidoreductase FOXRED1
      Results in Cell-Type-Specific Assembly Defects in Oxidative Phosphorylation
      Complexes I and II.
PG  - 2132-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00066-16 [doi]
AB  - Complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a large multisubunit enzyme that
      catalyzes the first step in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In mammals,
      complex I biogenesis occurs in a stepwise manner, a process that requires the
      participation of several nucleus-encoded accessory proteins. The FAD-dependent
      oxidoreductase-containing domain 1 (FOXRED1) protein is a complex I assembly
      factor; however, its specific role in the assembly pathway remains poorly
      understood. We identified a homozygous missense mutation, c.1308 G-->A (p.V421M) 
      in FOXRED1 in a patient who presented with epilepsy and severe psychomotor
      retardation. A patient myoblast line showed a severe reduction in complex I,
      associated with the accumulation of subassemblies centered around approximately
      340 kDa, and a milder decrease in complex II, all of which were rescued by
      retroviral expression of wild-type FOXRED1. Two additional assembly factors,
      AIFM1 and ACAD9, coimmunoprecipitated with FOXRED1, and all were associated with 
      a 370-kDa complex I subassembly that, together with a 315-kDa subassembly, forms 
      the 550-kDa subcomplex. Loss of FOXRED1 function prevents efficient formation of 
      this midassembly subcomplex. Although we could not identify subassemblies of
      complex II, our results establish that FOXRED1 function is both broader than
      expected, involving the assembly of two flavoprotein-containing OXPHOS complexes,
      and cell type specific.

TI  - Histone Demethylase KDM6A Controls the Mammary Luminal Lineage through
      Enzyme-Independent Mechanisms.
PG  - 2108-20
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00089-16 [doi]
AB  - Establishment of the mammary luminal cell lineage is controlled primarily by
      hormones and through specific transcription factors (TFs). Previous studies have 
      linked histone methyltransferases to the differentiation of mammary epithelium,
      thus opening the possibility of biological significance of counteracting
      demethylases. We have now demonstrated an essential role for the H3K27me3
      demethylase KDM6A in generating a balanced alveolar compartment. Deletion of
      Kdm6a in the mammary luminal cell lineage led to a paucity of luminal cells and
      an excessive expansion of basal cells, both in vivo and in vitro The inability to
      form structurally normal ducts and alveoli during pregnancy resulted in lactation
      failure. Mutant luminal cells did not exhibit their distinctive transcription
      factor pattern and displayed basal characteristics. The genomic H3K27me3
      landscape was unaltered in mutant tissue, and support for a
      demethylase-independent mechanism came from mice expressing a catalytically
      inactive KDM6A. Mammary tissue developed normally in these mice. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments demonstrated KDM6A binding 
      to putative enhancers enriched for key mammary TFs and H3K27ac. This study
      demonstrated for the first time that the mammary luminal lineage relies on KDM6A 
      to ensure a transcription program leading to differentiated alveoli. Failure to
      fully implement this program results in structurally and functionally impaired
      mammary tissue.

TI  - Calpain Genetic Disruption and HSP90 Inhibition Combine To Attenuate Mammary
      Tumorigenesis.
PG  - 2078-88
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01062-15 [doi]
AB  - Calpain is an intracellular Ca(2+)-regulated protease system whose substrates
      include proteins involved in proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and
      sensitivity to therapeutic drugs. Genetic disruption of calpain attenuated the
      tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells and hypersensitized cells to 17AAG, 
      an inhibitor of the molecular chaperone HSP90. Calpain-1 or -2 overexpression
      rendered cells resistant to 17AAG, whereas downregulation or inhibition of
      calpain-1/2 led to increased cell death in multiple breast cancer cell lines,
      including models of HER2(+) (SKBR3) and triple-negative basal-cell-like
      (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer. In an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic xenograft model, calpain 
      knockdown or 17AAG treatment independently attenuated tumor growth and
      metastasis, while the combination was most effective. Calpain knockdown was
      associated with increased 17AAG-induced degradation of the HSP90 clients cyclin
      D1 and AKT and multidrug resistance protein 2, which correlated with increased
      expression of antimitogenic p27(KIP1) and proapoptotic BIM proteins. Like other
      therapeutics, 17AAG can be effluxed by specific ABC transporters. Calpain
      expression positively correlated with the expression of P glycoprotein in mouse
      embryonic fibroblasts. Importantly, we show that calpain affects ABC transporter 
      function and efflux of clinically relevant doxorubicin. These observations
      provide a compelling rationale for exploring the combination of calpain
      inhibition with new or existing cancer therapeutics.

TI  - Requirement for the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier in Mammalian Development
      Revealed by a Hypomorphic Allelic Series.
PG  - 2089-104
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00166-16 [doi]
AB  - Glucose and oxygen are two of the most important molecules transferred from
      mother to fetus during eutherian pregnancy, and the metabolic fates of these
      nutrients converge at the transport and metabolism of pyruvate in mitochondria.
      Pyruvate enters the mitochondrial matrix through the mitochondrial pyruvate
      carrier (MPC), a complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane that consists of two
      essential components, MPC1 and MPC2. Here, we define the requirement for
      mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism during development with a progressive allelic
      series of Mpc1 deficiency in mouse. Mpc1 deletion was homozygous lethal in
      midgestation, but Mpc1 hypomorphs and tissue-specific deletion of Mpc1 presented 
      as early perinatal lethality. The allelic series demonstrated that graded
      suppression of MPC resulted in dose-dependent metabolic and transcriptional
      changes. Steady-state metabolomics analysis of brain and liver from Mpc1
      hypomorphic embryos identified compensatory changes in amino acid and lipid
      metabolism. Flux assays in Mpc1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts also reflected
      these changes, including a dramatic increase in mitochondrial alanine
      utilization. The mitochondrial alanine transaminase GPT2 was found to be
      necessary and sufficient for increased alanine flux upon MPC inhibition. These
      data show that impaired mitochondrial pyruvate transport results in biosynthetic 
      deficiencies that can be mitigated in part by alternative anaplerotic substrates 
      in utero.

TI  - Nitric Oxide Suppresses beta-Cell Apoptosis by Inhibiting the DNA Damage
      Response.
PG  - 2067-77
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00262-16 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide, produced in pancreatic beta cells in response to proinflammatory
      cytokines, plays a dual role in the regulation of beta-cell fate. While nitric
      oxide induces cellular damage and impairs beta-cell function, it also promotes
      beta-cell survival through activation of protective pathways that promote
      beta-cell recovery. In this study, we identify a novel mechanism in which nitric 
      oxide prevents beta-cell apoptosis by attenuating the DNA damage response (DDR). 
      Nitric oxide suppresses activation of the DDR (as measured by gammaH2AX formation
      and the phosphorylation of KAP1 and p53) in response to multiple genotoxic
      agents, including camptothecin, H2O2, and nitric oxide itself, despite the
      presence of DNA damage. While camptothecin and H2O2 both induce DDR activation,
      nitric oxide suppresses only camptothecin-induced apoptosis and not H2O2-induced 
      necrosis. The ability of nitric oxide to suppress the DDR appears to be selective
      for pancreatic beta cells, as nitric oxide fails to inhibit DDR signaling in
      macrophages, hepatocytes, and fibroblasts, three additional cell types examined. 
      While originally described as the damaging agent responsible for cytokine-induced
      beta-cell death, these studies identify a novel role for nitric oxide as a
      protective molecule that promotes beta-cell survival by suppressing DDR signaling
      and attenuating DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

PG  - 2039-50
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00057-16 [doi]
AB  - Cohesin associates with distinct sites on chromosomes to mediate sister chromatid
      cohesion. Single cohesin complexes are thought to bind by encircling both sister 
      chromatids in a topological embrace. Transcriptionally repressed chromosomal
      domains in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae represent specialized sites of
      cohesion where cohesin binds silent chromatin in a Sir2-dependent fashion. In
      this study, we investigated the molecular basis for Sir2-mediated cohesion. We
      identified a cluster of charged surface residues of Sir2, collectively termed the
      EKDK motif, that are required for cohesin function. In addition, we demonstrated 
      that Esc8, a Sir2-interacting factor, is also required for silent chromatin
      cohesion. Esc8 was previously shown to associate with Isw1, the enzymatic core of
      ISW1 chromatin remodelers, to form a variant of the ISW1a chromatin remodeling
      complex. When ESC8 was deleted or the EKDK motif was mutated, cohesin binding at 
      silenced chromatin domains persisted but cohesion of the domains was abolished.
      The data are not consistent with cohesin embracing both sister chromatids within 
      silent chromatin domains. Transcriptional silencing remains largely intact in
      strains lacking ESC8 or bearing EKDK mutations, indicating that silencing and
      cohesion are separable functions of Sir2 and silent chromatin.

TI  - Occludin S471 Phosphorylation Contributes to Epithelial Monolayer Maturation.
PG  - 2051-66
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00053-16 [doi]
AB  - Multiple organ systems require epithelial barriers for normal function, and
      barrier loss is a hallmark of diseases ranging from inflammation to epithelial
      cancers. However, the molecular processes regulating epithelial barrier
      maturation are not fully elucidated. After contact, epithelial cells undergo
      size-reductive proliferation and differentiate, creating a dense, highly ordered 
      monolayer with high resistance barriers. We provide evidence that the tight
      junction protein occludin contributes to the regulation of epithelial cell
      maturation upon phosphorylation of S471 in its coiled-coil domain. Overexpression
      of a phosphoinhibitory occludin S471A mutant prevents size-reductive
      proliferation and subsequent tight junction maturation in a dominant manner.
      Inhibition of cell proliferation in cell-contacted but immature monolayers
      recapitulated this phenotype. A kinase screen identified G-protein-coupled
      receptor kinases (GRKs) targeting S471, and GRK inhibitors delayed epithelial
      packing and junction maturation. We conclude that occludin contributes to the
      regulation of size-reductive proliferation and epithelial cell maturation in a
      phosphorylation-dependent manner.

TI  - Heregulin/ErbB3 Signaling Enhances CXCR4-Driven Rac1 Activation and Breast Cancer
      Cell Motility via Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1alpha.
PG  - 2011-26
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00180-16 [doi]
AB  - The growth factor heregulin (HRG), a ligand of ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors,
      contributes to breast cancer development and the promotion of metastatic disease,
      and its expression in breast tumors has been associated with poor clinical
      outcome and resistance to therapy. In this study, we found that breast cancer
      cells exposed to sustained HRG treatment show markedly enhanced Rac1 activation
      and migratory activity in response to the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1/CXCL12, effects
      mediated by P-Rex1, a Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) aberrantly
      expressed in breast cancer. Notably, HRG treatment upregulates surface expression
      levels of CXCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) implicated in breast cancer 
      metastasis and an indicator of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. A
      detailed mechanistic analysis revealed that CXCR4 upregulation and sensitization 
      of the Rac response/motility by HRG are mediated by the transcription factor
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) via ErbB3 and independently of
      ErbB4. HRG caused prominent induction in the nuclear expression of HIF-1alpha,
      which transcriptionally activates the CXCR4 gene via binding to a responsive
      element located in positions -1376 to -1372 in the CXCR4 promoter, as revealed by
      mutagenesis analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Our results
      uncovered a novel function for ErbB3 in enhancing breast cancer cell motility and
      sensitization of the P-Rex1/Rac1 pathway through HIF-1alpha-mediated
      transcriptional induction of CXCR4.

TI  - Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2/Seipin Is Not Required for Brown
      Adipogenesis but Regulates Brown Adipose Tissue Development and Function.
PG  - 2027-38
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01120-15 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a unique role in regulating whole-body energy
      homeostasis by dissipating energy through thermogenic uncoupling.
      Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL) type 2 (BSCL2; also known as
      seipin) is a lipodystrophy-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein
      essential for white adipocyte differentiation. Whether BSCL2 directly
      participates in brown adipocyte differentiation, development, and function,
      however, is unknown. We show that BSCL2 expression is increased during brown
      adipocyte differentiation. Its deletion does not impair the classic brown
      adipogenic program but rather induces premature activation of differentiating
      brown adipocytes through cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated
      lipolysis and fatty acid and glucose oxidation, as well as uncoupling. cAMP/PKA
      signaling is physiologically activated during neonatal BAT development in
      wild-type mice and greatly potentiated in mice with genetic deletion of Bscl2 in 
      brown progenitor cells, leading to reduced BAT mass and lipid content during
      neonatal brown fat formation. However, prolonged overactivation of cAMP/PKA
      signaling during BAT development ultimately causes apoptosis of brown adipocytes 
      through inflammation, resulting in BAT atrophy and increased overall adiposity in
      adult mice. These findings reveal a key cell-autonomous role for BSCL2 in
      controlling BAT mass/activity and provide novel insights into therapeutic
      strategies targeting cAMP/PKA signaling to regulate brown adipocyte function,
      viability, and metabolic homeostasis.

      Apoptosis and Cell Growth Arrest.
PG  - 1990-2010
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01101-15 [doi]
AB  - SWI/SNF (switching/sucrose nonfermenting)-dependent chromatin remodeling
      establishes coordinated gene expression programs during development, yet
      important functional details remain to be elucidated. We show that the Brg1
      (Brahma-related gene 1; Smarca4) ATPase is globally expressed at high levels
      during postimplantation development and its conditional ablation, beginning at
      gastrulation, results in increased apoptosis, growth retardation, and,
      ultimately, embryonic death. Global gene expression analysis revealed that genes 
      upregulated in Rosa26CreERT2; Brg1(flox/flox) embryos (here referred to as
      Brg1(d/d) embryos to describe embryos with deletion of the Brg1(flox/flox)
      alleles) negatively regulate cell cycle progression and cell growth. In addition,
      the p53 (Trp53) protein, which is virtually undetectable in early wild-type
      embryos, accumulated in the Brg1(d/d) embryos and activated the p53-dependent
      pathways. Using P19 cells, we show that Brg1 and CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA 
      binding protein 4) coordinate to control target gene expression. Both proteins
      physically interact and show a substantial overlap of binding sites at
      chromatin-accessible regions adjacent to genes differentially expressed in the
      Brg1(d/d) embryos. Specifically, Brg1 deficiency results in reduced levels of the
      repressive histone H3 lysine K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) histone mark and an
      increase in the amount of open chromatin at the regulatory region of the p53 and 
      p21 (Cdkn1a) genes. These results provide insights into the mechanisms by which
      Brg1 functions, which is in part via the p53 program, to constrain gene
      expression and facilitate rapid embryonic growth.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00055-16 [doi]
AB  - The lysine acetyltransferase 6 (KAT6) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes
      are highly conserved from yeast to higher organisms. They acetylate histone H3
      and other nonhistone substrates and are involved in cell cycle regulation and
      stem cell maintenance. In addition, the human KAT6 HATs are recurrently mutated
      in leukemia and solid tumors. Therefore, it is important to understand the
      mechanisms underlying the regulation of KAT6 HATs and their roles in cell cycle
      progression. In this minireview, we summarize the identification and analysis of 
      the KAT6 complexes and discuss the regulatory mechanisms governing their
      enzymatic activities and substrate specificities. We further focus on the roles
      of KAT6 HATs in regulating cell proliferation and stem cell maintenance and
      review recent insights that aid in understanding their involvement in human
      diseases.

TI  - Novel MicroRNA Regulators of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Production.
PG  - 1977-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01114-15 [doi]
AB  - Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has a central role in regulating blood pressure 
      in humans. Recently, microRNA 425 (miR-425) was found to regulate ANP production 
      by binding to the mRNA of NPPA, the gene encoding ANP. mRNAs typically contain
      multiple predicted microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites, and binding of different
      miRNAs may independently or coordinately regulate the expression of any given
      mRNA. We used a multifaceted screening strategy that integrates bioinformatics,
      next-generation sequencing data, human genetic association data, and cellular
      models to identify additional functional NPPA-targeting miRNAs. Two novel miRNAs,
      miR-155 and miR-105, were found to modulate ANP production in human
      cardiomyocytes and target genetic variants whose minor alleles are associated
      with higher human plasma ANP levels. Both miR-155 and miR-105 repressed NPPA mRNA
      in an allele-specific manner, with the minor allele of each respective variant
      conferring resistance to the miRNA either by disruption of miRNA base pairing or 
      by creation of wobble base pairing. Moreover, miR-155 enhanced the repressive
      effects of miR-425 on ANP production in human cardiomyocytes. Our study combines 
      computational, genomic, and cellular tools to identify novel miRNA regulators of 
      ANP production that could be targeted to raise ANP levels, which may have
      applications for the treatment of hypertension or heart failure.

TI  - Evidence for Multiple Mediator Complexes in Yeast Independently Recruited by
      Activated Heat Shock Factor.
PG  - 1943-60
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00005-16 [doi]
AB  - Mediator is an evolutionarily conserved coactivator complex essential for RNA
      polymerase II transcription. Although it has been generally assumed that in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator is a stable trimodular complex, its structural
      state in vivo remains unclear. Using the "anchor away" (AA) technique to
      conditionally deplete select subunits within Mediator and its reversibly
      associated Cdk8 kinase module (CKM), we provide evidence that Mediator's tail
      module is highly dynamic and that a subcomplex consisting of Med2, Med3, and
      Med15 can be independently recruited to the regulatory regions of heat shock
      factor 1 (Hsf1)-activated genes. Fluorescence microscopy of a scaffold subunit
      (Med14)-anchored strain confirmed parallel cytoplasmic sequestration of core
      subunits located outside the tail triad. In addition, and contrary to current
      models, we provide evidence that Hsf1 can recruit the CKM independently of core
      Mediator and that core Mediator has a role in regulating postinitiation events.
      Collectively, our results suggest that yeast Mediator is not monolithic but
      potentially has a dynamic complexity heretofore unappreciated. Multiple species, 
      including CKM-Mediator, the 21-subunit core complex, the Med2-Med3-Med15 tail
      triad, and the four-subunit CKM, can be independently recruited by activated Hsf1
      to its target genes in AA strains.

TI  - AMPK Phosphorylates Desnutrin/ATGL and Hormone-Sensitive Lipase To Regulate
      Lipolysis and Fatty Acid Oxidation within Adipose Tissue.
PG  - 1961-76
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00244-16 [doi]
AB  - The role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in promoting fatty acid (FA)
      oxidation in various tissues, such as liver and muscle, has been well understood.
      However, the role of AMPK in lipolysis and FA metabolism in adipose tissue has
      been controversial. To investigate the role of AMPK in the regulation of adipose 
      lipolysis in vivo, we generated mice with adipose-tissue-specific knockout of
      both the alpha1 and alpha2 catalytic subunits of AMPK (AMPK-ASKO mice) by using
      aP2-Cre and adiponectin-Cre. Both models of AMPK-ASKO ablation show no changes in
      desnutrin/ATGL levels but have defective phosphorylation of desnutrin/ATGL at
      S406 to decrease its triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolase activity, lowering basal
      lipolysis in adipose tissue. These mice also show defective phosphorylation of
      hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) at S565, with higher phosphorylation at protein
      kinase A sites S563 and S660, increasing its hydrolase activity and
      isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. With higher overall adipose lipolysis, both
      models of AMPK-ASKO mice are lean, having smaller adipocytes with lower TAG and
      higher intracellular free-FA levels. Moreover, FAs from higher lipolysis activate
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta to induce FA oxidative genes and
      increase FA oxidation and energy expenditure. Overall, for the first time, we
      provide in vivo evidence of the role of AMPK in the phosphorylation and
      regulation of desnutrin/ATGL and HSL and thus adipose lipolysis.

TI  - A Hypertension-Associated tRNAAla Mutation Alters tRNA Metabolism and
      Mitochondrial Function.
PG  - 1920-30
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00199-16 [doi]
AB  - In this report, we investigated the pathophysiology of a novel
      hypertension-associated mitochondrial tRNA(Ala) 5655A --> G (m.5655A --> G)
      mutation. The destabilization of a highly conserved base pairing (A1-U72) at the 
      aminoacyl acceptor stem by an m.5655A --> G mutation altered the tRNA(Ala)
      function. An in vitro processing analysis showed that the m.5655A --> G mutation 
      reduced the efficiency of tRNA(Ala) precursor 5' end cleavage catalyzed by RNase 
      P. By using cybrids constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid 
      cell lines derived from a Chinese family into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-less
      (rho(o)) cells, we showed a 41% reduction in the steady-state level of tRNA(Ala) 
      in mutant cybrids. The mutation caused an improperly aminoacylated tRNA(Ala), as 
      suggested by aberrantly aminoacylated tRNA(Ala) and slower electrophoretic
      mobility of mutated tRNA. A failure in tRNA(Ala) metabolism contributed to
      variable reductions in six mtDNA-encoded polypeptides in mutant cells, ranging
      from 21% to 37.5%, with an average of a 29.1% reduction, compared to levels of
      the controls. The impaired translation caused reduced activities of mitochondrial
      respiration chains. Furthermore, marked decreases in the levels of mitochondrial 
      ATP and membrane potential were observed in mutant cells. These caused increases 
      in the production of reactive oxygen species in the mutant cybrids. The data
      provide evidence for the association of the tRNA(Ala) 5655A --> G mutation with
      hypertension.

TI  - Early Loss of Telomerase Action in Yeast Creates a Dependence on the DNA Damage
      Response Adaptor Proteins.
PG  - 1908-19
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00943-15 [doi]
AB  - Telomeres cap the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from degradation and
      inappropriate DNA repair processes that can lead to genomic instability. A short 
      telomere elicits increased telomerase action on itself that replenishes telomere 
      length, thereby stabilizing the telomere. In the prolonged absence of telomerase 
      activity in dividing cells, telomeres eventually become critically short,
      inducing a permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence). We recently showed that even
      early after telomerase inactivation (ETI), yeast cells have accelerated mother
      cell aging and mildly perturbed cell cycles. Here, we show that the complete
      disruption of DNA damage response (DDR) adaptor proteins in ETI cells causes
      severe growth defects. This synthetic-lethality phenotype was as pronounced as
      that caused by extensive DNA damage in wild-type cells but showed genetic
      dependencies distinct from such damage and was completely alleviated by SML1
      deletion, which increases deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools. Our results 
      indicated that these deleterious effects in ETI cells cannot be accounted for
      solely by the slow erosion of telomeres due to incomplete replication that leads 
      to senescence. We propose that normally occurring telomeric DNA replication
      stress is resolved by telomerase activity and the DDR in two parallel pathways
      and that deletion of Sml1 prevents this stress.

TI  - AMPK Facilitates Nuclear Accumulation of Nrf2 by Phosphorylating at Serine 550.
PG  - 1931-42
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00118-16 [doi]
AB  - Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is an antioxidant
      transcription factor. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a central 
      regulator of cell survival in response to stressful stimuli. Nrf2 should be
      coordinated with the cell survival pathway controlled by AMPK, but so far the
      mechanistic connections remain undefined. This study investigated the role of
      AMPK in Nrf2 trafficking and its activity regulation. A subnetwork integrating
      neighbor molecules suggested direct interaction between AMPK and Nrf2. In cells, 
      AMPK activation caused nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. In the in vitro kinase and
      peptide competition assays, AMPK phosphorylated Nrf2 at the Ser558 residue
      (Ser550 in mouse) located in the canonical nuclear export signal. Nrf2 with an
      S550A mutation failed to be accumulated in the nucleus after AMPK activation.
      Leptomycin B, a nuclear export inhibitor, did not enhance nuclear accumulation of
      wild-type Nrf2 (WT-Nrf2) activated by AMPK or a phospho-Ser550-mimetic Nrf2
      mutant, corroborating the finding that AMPK facilitated nuclear accumulation of
      Nrf2, probably by inhibiting nuclear export. Activated glycogen synthase kinase
      3beta (GSK3beta) diminished the basal nuclear level of Myc-S550A-Nrf2. Taking the
      data collectively, AMPK phosphorylates Nrf2 at the Ser550 residue, which, in
      conjunction with AMPK-mediated GSK3beta inhibition, promotes nuclear accumulation
      of Nrf2 for antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven gene transactivation.

TI  - Protein Kinase C-Mediated Phosphorylation of BCL11B at Serine 2 Negatively
      Regulates Its Interaction with NuRD Complexes during CD4+ T-Cell Activation.
PG  - 1881-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00062-16 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor BCL11B/CTIP2 is a major regulatory protein implicated in
      various aspects of development, function and survival of T cells.
      Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated phosphorylation and SUMOylation 
      modulate BCL11B transcriptional activity, switching it from a repressor in naive 
      murine thymocytes to a transcriptional activator in activated thymocytes. Here,
      we show that BCL11B interacts via its conserved N-terminal MSRRKQ motif with
      endogenous MTA1 and MTA3 proteins to recruit various NuRD complexes. Furthermore,
      we demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of BCL11B
      Ser2 does not significantly impact BCL11B SUMOylation but negatively regulates
      NuRD recruitment by dampening the interaction with MTA1 or MTA3 (MTA1/3) and
      RbAp46 proteins. We detected increased phosphorylation of BCL11B Ser2 upon in
      vivo activation of transformed and primary human CD4(+) T cells. We show that
      following activation of CD4(+) T cells, BCL11B still binds to IL-2 and Id2
      promoters but activates their transcription by recruiting P300 instead of MTA1.
      Prolonged stimulation results in the direct transcriptional repression of BCL11B 
      by KLF4. Our results unveil Ser2 phosphorylation as a new BCL11B
      posttranslational modification linking PKC signaling pathway to T-cell receptor
      (TCR) activation and define a simple model for the functional switch of BCL11B
      from a transcriptional repressor to an activator during TCR activation of human
      CD4(+) T cells.

TI  - Complementary Roles of GADD34- and CReP-Containing Eukaryotic Initiation Factor
      2alpha Phosphatases during the Unfolded Protein Response.
PG  - 1868-80
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00190-16 [doi]
AB  - Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) controls
      transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA translation in stressed cells. While
      phosphorylated eIF2alpha (P-eIF2alpha) attenuates global protein synthesis, mRNAs
      encoding stress proteins are more efficiently translated. Two eIF2alpha
      phosphatases, containing GADD34 and CReP, catalyze P-eIF2alpha dephosphorylation.
      The current view of GADD34, whose transcription is stress induced, is that it
      functions in a feedback loop to resolve cell stress. In contrast, CReP, which is 
      constitutively expressed, controls basal P-eIF2alpha levels in unstressed cells. 
      Our studies show that GADD34 drives substantial changes in mRNA translation in
      unstressed cells, particularly targeting the secretome. Following activation of
      the unfolded protein response (UPR), rapid translation of GADD34 mRNA occurs and 
      GADD34 is essential for UPR progression. In the absence of GADD34, eIF2alpha
      phosphorylation is persistently enhanced and the UPR translational program is
      significantly attenuated. This "stalled" UPR is relieved by the subsequent
      activation of compensatory mechanisms that include AKT-mediated suppression of
      PKR-like kinase (PERK) and increased expression of CReP mRNA, partially restoring
      protein synthesis. Our studies highlight the coordinate regulation of UPR by the 
      GADD34- and CReP-containing eIF2alpha phosphatases to control cell viability.

AB  - Antiangiogenic therapies, such as sunitinib, have revolutionized renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC) treatment. However, a precarious understanding of how resistance 
      emerges and a lack of tractable experimental systems hinder progress. We
      evaluated the potential of primary RCC cultures (derived from tumors and tumor
      grafts) to signal to endothelial cells (EC) and fibroblasts in vitro and to
      stimulate angiogenesis ex vivo in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. From 65 
      patients, 27 primary cultures, including several from patients with
      sunitinib-resistant RCC, were established. RCC cells supported EC survival in
      coculture assays and induced angiogenesis in CAM assays. RCC-induced EC survival 
      was sensitive to sunitinib in half of the tumors and was refractory in tumors
      from resistant patients. Sunitinib sensitivity correlated with vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. RCC induced paracrine extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in EC which was inhibited by sunitinib
      in sensitive but not in resistant tumors. As determined by fibroblast growth
      factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) phosphorylation in fibroblasts, RCC broadly
      induced low-level fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling. Whereas ERK
      activation in EC was uniformly inhibited by combined VEGF/platelet-derived growth
      factor (PDGF)/FGF receptor inhibitors, paracrine ERK activation in fibroblasts
      was blocked in only a fraction of tumors. Our data show that RCC activates EC
      through VEGF-dependent and -independent pathways, that sunitinib sensitivity
      correlates with VEGF-mediated ERK activation, and that combined inhibition of
      VEGF/PDGF/FGF receptors is sufficient to inhibit mitogenic signaling in EC but
      not in fibroblasts.

TI  - Noncoding Transcription Is a Driving Force for Nucleosome Instability in spt16
      Mutant Cells.
PG  - 1856-67
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00152-16 [doi]
AB  - FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) consists of two essential subunits,
      Spt16 and Pob3, and functions as a histone chaperone. Mutation of spt16 results
      in a global loss of nucleosomes as well as aberrant transcription. Here, we show 
      that the majority of nucleosome changes upon Spt16 depletion are alterations in
      nucleosome fuzziness and position shift. Most nucleosomal changes are suppressed 
      by the inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity. Surprisingly, a small
      subgroup of nucleosome changes is resistant to transcriptional inhibition.
      Notably, Spt16 and distinct histone modifications are enriched at this subgroup
      of nucleosomes. We also report 1,037 Spt16-suppressed noncoding transcripts
      (SNTs) and found that the SNT start sites are enriched with the subgroup of
      nucleosomes resistant to Pol II inhibition. Finally, the nucleosomes at genes
      overlapping SNTs are more susceptible to changes upon Spt16 depletion than those 
      without SNTs. Taken together, our results support a model in which Spt16 has a
      role in maintaining local nucleosome stability to inhibit initiation of SNT
      transcription, which once initiated drives additional nucleosome loss upon Spt16 
      depletion.

TI  - Leukemia-Associated Nup214 Fusion Proteins Disturb the XPO1-Mediated
      Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Transport Pathway and Thereby the NF-kappaB Signaling
      Pathway.
PG  - 1820-35
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00158-16 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport through nuclear pore complexes is mediated by
      nuclear transport receptors. Previous reports have suggested that aberrant
      nuclear-cytoplasmic transport due to mutations or overexpression of nuclear pore 
      complexes and nuclear transport receptors is closely linked to diseases. Nup214, 
      a component of nuclear pore complexes, has been found as chimeric fusion proteins
      in leukemia. Among various Nup214 fusion proteins, SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 have
      been shown to be engaged in tumorigenesis, but their oncogenic mechanisms remain 
      unclear. In this study, we examined the functions of the Nup214 fusion proteins
      by focusing on their effects on nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. We found that
      SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 interact with exportin-1 (XPO1)/CRM1 and nuclear RNA
      export factor 1 (NXF1)/TAP, which mediate leucine-rich nuclear export signal
      (NES)-dependent protein export and mRNA export, respectively. SET-Nup214 and
      DEK-Nup214 decreased the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of NES proteins such as
      cyclin B and proteins involved in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by tethering
      XPO1 onto nuclear dots where Nup214 fusion proteins are localized. We also
      demonstrated that SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 expression inhibited
      NF-kappaB-mediated transcription by abnormal tethering of the complex containing 
      p65 and its inhibitor, IkappaB, in the nucleus. These results suggest that
      SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 perturb the regulation of gene expression through
      alteration of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport system.

TI  - Cystatin E/M Suppresses Tumor Cell Growth through Cytoplasmic Retention of
      NF-kappaB.
PG  - 1776-92
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00878-15 [doi]
AB  - We and others have shown that the cystatin E/M gene is inactivated in primary
      human tumors, pointing to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. However, the
      molecular mechanism of tumor suppression is not yet understood. Using
      plasmid-directed cystatin E/M gene overexpression, a lentivirus-mediated
      tetracycline-inducible vector system, and human papillomavirus 16 (HPV 16) E6 and
      E7 gene-immortalized normal human epidermal keratinocytes, we demonstrated
      intracellular and non-cell-autonomous apoptotic growth inhibition of tumor cell
      lines and that growth inhibition is associated with cytoplasmic retention of
      NF-kappaB. We further demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase
      (IKKbeta) and IkappaBalpha in the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha), confirming the role of cystatin E/M in the regulation of the
      NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Growth suppression of nude mouse xenograft tumors
      carrying a tetracycline-inducible vector system was observed with the addition of
      doxycycline in drinking water, confirming that the cystatin E/M gene is a tumor
      suppressor gene. Finally, immunohistochemical analyses of cervical carcinoma in
      situ and primary tumors have shown a statistically significant inverse
      relationship between the expression of cystatin E/M and cathepsin L and a direct 
      relationship between the loss of cystatin E/M expression and nuclear expression
      of NF-kappaB. We therefore propose that the cystatin E/M suppressor gene plays an
      important role in the regulation of NF-kappaB.

TI  - Parallel Regulation of von Hippel-Lindau Disease by pVHL-Mediated Degradation of 
      B-Myb and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor alpha.
PG  - 1803-17
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00067-16 [doi]
AB  - pVHL, the protein product of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene,
      is a ubiquitin ligase that targets hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) for
      proteasomal degradation. Although HIF-alpha activation is necessary for VHL
      disease pathogenesis, constitutive activation of HIF-alpha alone did not induce
      renal clear cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas in mice, suggesting the
      involvement of an HIF-alpha-independent pathway in VHL pathogenesis. Here, we
      show that the transcription factor B-Myb is a pVHL substrate that is degraded via
      the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF)- and/or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent tyrosine 15
      phosphorylation of B-Myb prevents its degradation. Mice injected with B-Myb
      knockdown 786-O cells developed dramatically larger tumors than those bearing
      control cell tumors. Microarray screening of B-Myb-regulated genes showed that
      the expression of HIF-alpha-dependent genes was not affected by B-Myb knockdown, 
      indicating that B-Myb prevents HIF-alpha-dependent tumorigenesis through an
      HIF-alpha-independent pathway. These data indicate that the regulation of B-Myb
      by pVHL plays a critical role in VHL disease.

TI  - Zfp703 Is a Wnt/beta-Catenin Feedback Suppressor Targeting the beta-Catenin/Tcf1 
      Complex.
PG  - 1793-802
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01010-15 [doi]
AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway controls embryonic development and adult
      stem cell maintenance through the regulation of transcription. Failure to
      downregulate Wnt signaling can result in embryonic malformations and cancer,
      highlighting the important role of negative regulators of the pathway. The Wnt
      pathway activates several negative feedback targets, including axin2 and Dkk1,
      that function at different levels of the signaling cascade; however, none have
      been identified that directly target active beta-catenin/Tcf1 transcriptional
      complexes. We show that Zfp703 is a Wnt target gene that inhibits
      Wnt/beta-catenin activity in Wnt reporter assays and in Wnt-dependent mesoderm
      differentiation in embryonic stem cells. Zfp703 binds directly to Tcf1 to inhibit
      beta-catenin/Tcf1 complex formation and does so independently of the Groucho/Tle 
      transcriptional corepressor. We propose that Zfp703 is a novel feedback
      suppressor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that functions by inhibiting the
      association of beta-catenin with Tcf1 on Wnt response elements in target gene
      enhancers.

TI  - lncRHOXF1, a Long Noncoding RNA from the X Chromosome That Suppresses Viral
      Response Genes during Development of the Early Human Placenta.
PG  - 1764-75
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01098-15 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate gene expression in a cell-specific
      fashion during development. Here, we identify a novel lncRNA from the X
      chromosome that we named lncRHOXF1 and which is abundantly expressed in
      trophectoderm and primitive endoderm cells of human blastocyst-stage embryos.
      lncRHOXF1 is a spliced and polyadenylated lncRNA about 1 kb in length that is
      found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of in vitro differentiated
      human trophectoderm progenitor cells. Gain-of-function experiments in human
      embryonic stem cells, which normally lack lncRHOXF1 RNA, revealed that lncRHOXF1 
      reduced proliferation and favored cellular differentiation. lncRHOXF1 knockdown
      using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in human trophectoderm progenitors
      increased expression of viral response genes, including type I interferon. Sendai
      virus infection of human trophectoderm progenitor cells increased lncRHOXF1 RNA
      levels, and siRNA-mediated disruption of lncRHOXF1 during infection reduced the
      expression of viral response genes leading to higher virus replication. Thus,
      lncRHOXF1 RNA is the first example of a lncRNA that regulates the host response
      to viral infections in human placental progenitor cells, and we propose that it
      functions as a repressor of the viral response during early human development.

TI  - Endothelial Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase 4 Is Critical
      for Lymphatic Vascular Development and Function.
PG  - 1740-9
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01121-15 [doi]
AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying lymphatic vascular development and function
      are not well understood. Recent studies have suggested a role for endothelial
      cell (EC) mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) in
      developmental angiogenesis and atherosclerosis. Here, we show that constitutive
      loss of EC Map4k4 in mice causes postnatal lethality due to chylothorax,
      suggesting that Map4k4 is required for normal lymphatic vascular function. Mice
      constitutively lacking EC Map4k4 displayed dilated lymphatic capillaries,
      insufficient lymphatic valves, and impaired lymphatic flow; furthermore, primary 
      ECs derived from these animals displayed enhanced proliferation compared with
      controls. Yeast 2-hybrid analyses identified the Ras GTPase-activating protein
      Rasa1, a known regulator of lymphatic development and lymphatic endothelial cell 
      fate, as a direct interacting partner for Map4k4. Map4k4 silencing in ECs
      enhanced basal Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activities,
      and primary ECs lacking Map4k4 displayed enhanced lymphatic EC marker expression.
      Taken together, these results reveal that EC Map4k4 is critical for lymphatic
      vascular development by regulating EC quiescence and lymphatic EC fate.

TI  - Endogenous Hot Spots of De Novo Telomere Addition in the Yeast Genome Contain
      Proximal Enhancers That Bind Cdc13.
PG  - 1750-63
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00095-16 [doi]
AB  - DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a threat to genome stability and are
      repaired through multiple mechanisms. Rarely, telomerase, the enzyme that
      maintains telomeres, acts upon a DSB in a mutagenic process termed telomere
      healing. The probability of telomere addition is increased at specific genomic
      sequences termed sites of repair-associated telomere addition (SiRTAs). By
      monitoring repair of an induced DSB, we show that SiRTAs on chromosomes V and IX 
      share a bipartite structure in which a core sequence (Core) is directly targeted 
      by telomerase, while a proximal sequence (Stim) enhances the probability of de
      novo telomere formation. The Stim and Core sequences are sufficient to confer a
      high frequency of telomere addition to an ectopic site. Cdc13, a single-stranded 
      DNA binding protein that recruits telomerase to endogenous telomeres, is known to
      stimulate de novo telomere addition when artificially recruited to an induced
      DSB. Here we show that the ability of the Stim sequence to enhance de novo
      telomere addition correlates with its ability to bind Cdc13, indicating that
      natural sites at which telomere addition occurs at high frequency require binding
      by Cdc13 to a sequence 20 to 100 bp internal from the site at which telomerase
      acts to initiate de novo telomere addition.

TI  - Mechanism of Lysine 48 Selectivity during Polyubiquitin Chain Formation by the
      Ube2R1/2 Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme.
PG  - 1720-32
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00097-16 [doi]
AB  - Lysine selectivity is of critical importance during polyubiquitin chain formation
      because the identity of the lysine controls the biological outcome. Ubiquitins
      are covalently linked in polyubiquitin chains through one of seven lysine
      residues on its surface and the C terminus of adjacent protomers. Lys 48-linked
      polyubiquitin chains signal for protein degradation; however, the structural
      basis for Lys 48 selectivity remains largely unknown. The ubiquitin-conjugating
      enzyme Ube2R1/2 has exquisite specificity for Lys 48, and computational docking
      of Ube2R1/2 and ubiquitin predicts that Lys 48 is guided to the active site
      through a key electrostatic interaction between Arg 54 on ubiquitin and Asp 143
      on Ube2R1/2. The validity of this interaction was confirmed through biochemical
      experiments. Since structural examples involving Arg 54 in protein-ubiquitin
      complexes are exceedingly rare, these results provide additional insight into how
      ubiquitin-protein complexes can be stabilized. We discuss how these findings
      relate to how other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes direct the lysine specificity
      of polyubiquitin chains.

TI  - Janus Kinase 1 Is Essential for Inflammatory Cytokine Signaling and Mammary Gland
      Remodeling.
PG  - 1673-90
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00999-15 [doi]
AB  - Despite a wealth of knowledge about the significance of individual signal
      transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), essential functions of their
      upstream Janus kinases (JAKs) during postnatal development are less well defined.
      Using a novel mammary gland-specific JAK1 knockout model, we demonstrate here
      that this tyrosine kinase is essential for the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and
      STAT6 in the mammary epithelium. The loss of JAK1 uncouples interleukin-6-class
      ligands from their downstream effector, STAT3, which leads to the decreased
      expression of STAT3 target genes that are associated with the acute-phase
      response, inflammation, and wound healing. Consequently, JAK1-deficient mice
      exhibit impaired apoptosis and a significant delay in mammary gland remodeling.
      Using RNA sequencing, we identified several new JAK1 target genes that are
      upregulated during involution. These include Bmf and Bim, which are known
      regulators of programmed cell death. Using a BMF/BIM-double-knockout epithelial
      transplant model, we further validated that the synergistic action of these
      proapoptotic JAK1 targets is obligatory for the remodeling of the mammary
      epithelium. The collective results of this study suggest that JAK1 has
      nonredundant roles in the activation of particular STAT proteins and this
      tyrosine kinase is essential for coupling inflammatory cytokine signals to the
      cell death machinery in the differentiated mammary epithelium.

TI  - Determination of a Comprehensive Alternative Splicing Regulatory Network and
      Combinatorial Regulation by Key Factors during the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal
      Transition.
PG  - 1704-19
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00019-16 [doi]
AB  - The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential biological process
      during embryonic development that is also implicated in cancer metastasis. While 
      the transcriptional regulation of EMT has been well studied, the role of
      alternative splicing (AS) regulation in EMT remains relatively uncharacterized.
      We previously showed that the epithelial cell-type-specific proteins epithelial
      splicing regulatory proteins 1 (ESRP1) and ESRP2 are important for the regulation
      of many AS events that are altered during EMT. However, the contributions of the 
      ESRPs and other splicing regulators to the AS regulatory network in EMT require
      further investigation. Here, we used a robust in vitro EMT model to
      comprehensively characterize splicing switches during EMT in a temporal manner.
      These investigations revealed that the ESRPs are the major regulators of some but
      not all AS events during EMT. We determined that the splicing factor RBM47 is
      downregulated during EMT and also regulates numerous transcripts that switch
      splicing during EMT. We also determined that Quaking (QKI) broadly promotes
      mesenchymal splicing patterns. Our study highlights the broad role of
      posttranscriptional regulation during the EMT and the important role of
      combinatorial regulation by different splicing factors to fine tune gene
      expression programs during these physiological and developmental transitions.

TI  - Fine-Tuning of FACT by the Ubiquitin Proteasome System in Regulation of
      Transcriptional Elongation.
PG  - 1691-703
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01112-15 [doi]
AB  - FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), an evolutionarily conserved histone
      chaperone involved in transcription and other DNA transactions, is upregulated in
      cancers, and its downregulation is associated with cellular death. However, it is
      not clearly understood how FACT is fine-tuned for normal cellular functions.
      Here, we show that the FACT subunit Spt16 is ubiquitylated by San1 (an E3
      ubiquitin ligase) and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Enhanced abundance of Spt16
      in the absence of San1 impairs transcriptional elongation. Likewise, decreased
      abundance of Spt16 also reduces transcription. Thus, an optimal level of Spt16 is
      required for efficient transcriptional elongation, which is maintained by San1
      via ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Consistently, San1 associates
      with the coding sequences of active genes to regulate Spt16's abundance. Further,
      we found that enhanced abundance of Spt16 in the absence of San1 impairs
      chromatin reassembly at the coding sequence, similarly to the results seen
      following inactivation of Spt16. Efficient chromatin reassembly enhances the
      fidelity of transcriptional elongation. Taken together, our results demonstrate
      for the first time a fine-tuning of FACT by a ubiquitin proteasome system in
      promoting chromatin reassembly in the wake of elongating RNA polymerase II and
      transcriptional elongation, thus revealing novel regulatory mechanisms of gene
      expression.

TI  - Nrf2-Mediated Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Metabolism.
PG  - 1655-72
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01095-15 [doi]
AB  - Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) contributes to the maintenance of glucose
      homeostasis in vivo Nrf2 suppresses blood glucose levels by protecting pancreatic
      beta cells from oxidative stress and improving peripheral tissue glucose
      utilization. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Nrf2 contributes to
      the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, we generated skeletal muscle
      (SkM)-specific Keap1 knockout (Keap1MuKO) mice that express abundant Nrf2 in
      their SkM and then examined Nrf2 target gene expression in that tissue. In
      Keap1MuKO mice, blood glucose levels were significantly downregulated and the
      levels of the glycogen branching enzyme (Gbe1) and muscle-type PhKalpha subunit
      (Phka1) mRNAs, along with those of the glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) and the
      phosphorylase b kinase alpha subunit (PhKalpha) protein, were significantly
      upregulated in mouse SkM. Consistent with this result, chemical Nrf2 inducers
      promoted Gbe1 and Phka1 mRNA expression in both mouse SkM and C2C12 myotubes.
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that Nrf2 binds the Gbe1 and 
      Phka1 upstream promoter regions. In Keap1MuKO mice, muscle glycogen content was
      strongly reduced and forced GBE expression in C2C12 myotubes promoted glucose
      uptake. Therefore, our results demonstrate that Nrf2 induction in SkM increases
      GBE and PhKalpha expression and reduces muscle glycogen content, resulting in
      improved glucose tolerance. Our results also indicate that Nrf2 differentially
      regulates glycogen metabolism in SkM and the liver.

TI  - Structural Analysis of the Myo1c and Neph1 Complex Provides Insight into the
      Intracellular Movement of Neph1.
PG  - 1639-54
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00020-16 [doi]
AB  - The Myo1c motor functions as a cargo transporter supporting various cellular
      events, including vesicular trafficking, cell migration, and stereociliary
      movements of hair cells. Although its partial crystal structures were recently
      described, the structural details of its interaction with cargo proteins remain
      unknown. This study presents the first structural demonstration of a cargo
      protein, Neph1, attached to Myo1c, providing novel insights into the role of
      Myo1c in intracellular movements of this critical slit diaphragm protein. Using
      small angle X-ray scattering studies, models of predominant solution conformation
      of unliganded full-length Myo1c and Myo1c bound to Neph1 were constructed. The
      resulting structures show an extended S-shaped Myo1c with Neph1 attached to its
      C-terminal tail. Importantly, binding of Neph1 did not induce a significant shape
      change in Myo1c, indicating this as a spontaneous process or event. Analysis of
      interaction surfaces led to the identification of a critical residue in Neph1
      involved in binding to Myo1c. Indeed, a point mutant from this site abolished
      interaction between Neph1 and Myo1c when tested in the in vitro and in live-cell 
      binding assays. Live-cell imaging, including fluorescence recovery after
      photobleaching, provided further support for the role of Myo1c in intracellular
      vesicular movement of Neph1 and its turnover at the membrane.

      Mice.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01071-15 [doi]
AB  - The liver performs a variety of unique functions critical for metabolic
      homeostasis. Here, we show that mice lacking the splicing factor SRSF2 but not
      SRSF1 in hepatocytes have severe liver pathology and biochemical abnormalities.
      Histological analyses revealed generalized hepatitis with the presence of
      ballooned hepatocytes and evidence of fibrosis. Molecular analysis demonstrated
      that SRSF2 governs splicing of multiple genes involved in the stress-induced cell
      death pathway in the liver. More importantly, SRSF2 also functions as a potent
      transcription activator, required for efficient expression of transcription
      factors mainly responsible for energy homeostasis and bile acid metabolism in the
      liver. Consistent with the effects of SRSF2 in gene regulation, accumulation of
      total cholesterol and bile acids was prominently observed in the mutant liver,
      followed by enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and increased
      endoplasmic reticulum stress, as revealed by biochemical and ultrastructural
      analyses. Taking these observations together, inactivation of SRSF2 in liver
      caused dysregulated splicing events and hepatic metabolic disorders, which
      trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and finally liver
      failure.

TI  - Evaluating Effects of Hypomorphic Thoc1 Alleles on Embryonic Development in Rb1
      Null Mice.
PG  - 1621-7
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01003-15 [doi]
AB  - The Rb1 tumor suppressor protein is a molecular adaptor that physically links
      transcription factors like E2f with various proteins acting on DNA or RNA to
      repress gene expression. Loss of Rb1 liberates E2f to activate the expression of 
      genes mediating resulting phenotypes. Most Rb1 binding proteins, including E2f,
      interact through carboxyl-terminal protein interaction domains, but genetic
      evidence suggests that an amino-terminal protein interaction domain is also
      important. One protein that binds Rb1 through the amino-terminal domain is
      encoded by Thoc1, a required component of the THO ribonucleoprotein complex
      important for RNA processing and transport. The physiological relevance of this
      interaction is unknown. Here we tested whether Thoc1 mediates effects of Rb1 loss
      on mouse embryonic development. We found that Thoc1 deficiency delays embryo
      death, and this delay correlates with reduced apoptosis in the brain. E2f protein
      levels are reduced in Rb1:Thoc1-deficient brain tissue. Expression of apoptotic
      regulatory genes regulated by E2f, like Apaf1 and Bak1, is also reduced. These
      observations suggest that Thoc1 is required to support increased expression of
      E2f and apoptotic regulatory genes that trigger apoptosis upon Rb1 loss. These
      findings implicate Rb1 in the regulation of the THO ribonucleoprotein complex.

TI  - Intercellular Communication between Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts Induces Local
      Osteoclast Differentiation: a Mechanism Underlying Cholesteatoma-Induced Bone
      Destruction.
PG  - 1610-20
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01028-15 [doi]
AB  - Bone homeostasis is maintained by a balance in activity between bone-resorbing
      osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. Shifting the balance toward bone
      resorption causes osteolytic bone diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and
      periodontitis. Osteoclast differentiation is regulated by receptor activator of
      nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), which, under some pathological conditions, 
      is produced by T and B lymphocytes and synoviocytes. However, the mechanism
      underlying bone destruction in other diseases is little understood. Bone
      destruction caused by cholesteatoma, an epidermal cyst in the middle ear
      resulting from hyperproliferation of keratinizing squamous epithelium, can lead
      to lethal complications. In this study, we succeeded in generating a model for
      cholesteatoma, epidermal cyst-like tissue, which has the potential for inducing
      osteoclastogenesis in mice. Furthermore, an in vitro coculture system composed of
      keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and osteoclast precursors was used to demonstrate
      that keratinocytes stimulate osteoclast differentiation through the induction of 
      RANKL in fibroblasts. Thus, this study demonstrates that intercellular
      communication between keratinocytes and fibroblasts is involved in the
      differentiation and function of osteoclasts, which may provide the molecular
      basis of a new therapeutic strategy for cholesteatoma-induced bone destruction.

TI  - RNA Activation of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Gene (VEGF) Promoter by 
      Double-Stranded RNA and Hypoxia: Role of Noncoding VEGF Promoter Transcripts.
PG  - 1480-93
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01096-15 [doi]
AB  - RNA activation (RNAa) is a gene regulation process in which promoter-targeted
      short double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) or microRNAs (miRs) induce target gene
      expression at the transcriptional level. Here, we investigate the presence of
      cryptic promoter transcripts within the VEGF promoter. Single-strand sense and
      antisense noncoding vascular endothelial growth factor (NcVEGF) promoter
      transcripts are identified, and their respective expression is studied in cells
      transfected with a VEGF promoter targeted dsRNA, namely, dsVEGF706, in hypoxic
      cells and in human malignant lung tissues. Interestingly, in
      dsVEGF706-transfected, as well as in hypoxic cells, NcVEGF expression levels
      increase coordinately with coding VEGF expression. Ago2 interaction with both
      sense and antisense NcVEGFs is increased in hypoxic cells, whereas in
      dsVEGF706-transfected cells, Ago2 and the antisense strand of the dsRNA interact 
      specifically with the sense NcVEGF transcript. Furthermore, both dsVEGF706 and
      ectopic NcVEGF transcripts are able to activate the VEGF promoter endogenously
      present or in a reporter construct. Finally, using small interfering RNA
      targeting Ago2, we show that RNAa plays a role in the maintenance of increased
      VEGF and NcVEGF expression after hypoxia. Given the central role of VEGF in major
      human diseases, including cancer, this novel molecular mechanism is poised to
      reveal promising possibilities for therapeutic interventions.

      Regulates Pulmonary Artery Pressure in Mice.
PG  - 1584-94
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01055-15 [doi]
AB  - Hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF-1 and -2) control oxygen supply to tissues
      by regulating erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. HIFs are
      regulated in response to oxygen availability by prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD)
      proteins, with PHD2 being the main oxygen sensor that controls HIF activity under
      normoxia. In this study, we used a genetic approach to investigate the
      endothelial PHD2/HIF axis in the regulation of vascular function. We found that
      inactivation of Phd2 in endothelial cells specifically resulted in severe
      pulmonary hypertension ( approximately 118% increase in right ventricular
      systolic pressure) but not polycythemia and was associated with abnormal
      muscularization of peripheral pulmonary arteries and right ventricular
      hypertrophy. Concurrent inactivation of either Hif1a or Hif2a in endothelial
      cell-specific Phd2 mutants demonstrated that the development of pulmonary
      hypertension was dependent on HIF-2alpha but not HIF-1alpha. Furthermore,
      endothelial HIF-2alpha was required for the development of increased pulmonary
      artery pressures in a model of pulmonary hypertension induced by chronic hypoxia.
      We propose that these HIF-2-dependent effects are partially due to increased
      expression of vasoconstrictor molecule endothelin 1 and a concomitant decrease in
      vasodilatory apelin receptor signaling. Taken together, our data identify
      endothelial HIF-2 as a key transcription factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary 
      hypertension.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01085-15 [doi]
AB  - The dynamic exchange of histones alleviates the nucleosome barrier and
      simultaneously facilitates various aspects of cellular DNA metabolism, such as
      DNA repair and transcription. In response to DNA damage, the acetylation of Lys5 
      in the histone variant H2AX, catalyzed by TIP60, plays a key role in promoting
      histone exchange; however, the detailed molecular mechanism still is unclear.
      Here, we show that the TIP60 complex includes poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
      (PARP-1). PARP-1 is required for the rapid exchange of H2AX on chromatin at DNA
      damage sites. It is known that PARP-1 binds dynamically to damaged chromatin and 
      is crucial for the subsequent recruitment of other repair factors, and its
      auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is required for the dynamics. We also show that the
      acetylation of histone H2AX at Lys5 by TIP60, but not the phosphorylation of
      H2AX, is required for the ADP-ribosylation activity of PARP-1 and its dynamic
      binding to damaged chromatin. Our results indicate the reciprocal regulation of
      K5 acetylation of H2AX and PARP-1, which could modulate the chromatin structure
      to facilitate DNA metabolism at damage sites. This could explain the rather
      undefined roles of PARP-1 in various DNA damage responses.

AB  - Base excision repair (BER) is an essential DNA repair pathway involved in the
      maintenance of genome stability and thus in the prevention of human diseases,
      such as premature aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Protein
      posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, methylation,
      phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitylation, have emerged as important
      contributors in controlling cellular BER protein levels, enzymatic activities,
      protein-protein interactions, and protein cellular localization. These PTMs
      therefore play key roles in regulating the BER pathway and are consequently
      crucial for coordinating an efficient cellular DNA damage response. In this
      review, we summarize the presently available data on characterized PTMs of key
      BER proteins, the functional consequences of these modifications at the protein
      level, and also the impact on BER in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Myocardin-Related Transcription Factor A Activation by Competition with WH2
      Domain Proteins for Actin Binding.
PG  - 1526-39
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01097-15 [doi]
AB  - The myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) are coactivators of serum
      response factor (SRF)-mediated gene expression. Activation of MRTF-A occurs in
      response to alterations in actin dynamics and critically requires the
      dissociation of repressive G-actin-MRTF-A complexes. However, the mechanism
      leading to the release of MRTF-A remains unclear. Here we show that WH2 domains
      compete directly with MRTF-A for actin binding. Actin nucleation-promoting
      factors, such as N-WASP and WAVE2, as well as isolated WH2 domains, including
      those of Spire2 and Cobl, activate MRTF-A independently of changes in actin
      dynamics. Simultaneous inhibition of Arp2-Arp3 or mutation of the CA region only 
      partially reduces MRTF-A activation by N-WASP and WAVE2. Recombinant WH2 domains 
      and the RPEL domain of MRTF-A bind mutually exclusively to cellular and purified 
      G-actin in vitro The competition by different WH2 domains correlates with
      MRTF-SRF activation. Following serum stimulation, nonpolymerizable actin
      dissociates from MRTF-A, and de novo formation of the G-actin-RPEL complex is
      impaired by a transferable factor. Our work demonstrates that WH2 domains
      activate MRTF-A and contribute to target gene regulation by a competitive
      mechanism, independently of their role in actin filament formation.

      Polymerase I Transcriptional Activity.
PG  - 1555-68
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00004-16 [doi]
AB  - RNA polymerase I-mediated rRNA production is a key determinant of cell growth.
      Despite extensive studies, the signaling pathways that control RNA polymerase
      I-mediated rRNA production are not well understood. Here we provide original
      evidence showing that RNA polymerase I transcriptional activity is tightly
      controlled by integrin signaling. Furthermore, we show that a signaling axis
      consisting of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      (PI3K), Akt, and mTOR mediates the effect of integrin signaling on rRNA
      transcription. Additionally, we show that in kindlin-2 knockout mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts, overactivation of Ras, Akt, and Src can successfully rescue the
      defective RNA polymerase I activity induced by the loss of kindlin-2. Finally,
      through experiments with inhibitors of FAK, Src, and PI3K and rescue experiments 
      in MEFs, we found that the FAK/Src/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to control rRNA
      transcription is linear. Collectively, these studies reveal, for the first time, 
      a pivotal role of integrin signaling in regulation of RNA polymerase I
      transcriptional activity and shed light on the downstream signaling axis that
      participates in regulation of this key aspect of cell growth.

      Migration and Invasion.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00600-15 [doi]
AB  - ShcA is an important mediator of ErbB2- and transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta)-induced breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. We
      show that in the context of reduced ShcA levels, the bone morphogenetic protein
      (BMP) antagonist chordin-like 1 (Chrdl1) is upregulated in numerous breast cancer
      cells following TGF-beta stimulation. BMPs have emerged as important modulators
      of breast cancer aggressiveness, and we have investigated the ability of Chrdl1
      to block BMP-induced increases in breast cancer cell migration and invasion.
      Breast cancer-derived conditioned medium containing elevated concentrations of
      endogenous Chrdl1, as well as medium containing recombinant Chrdl1, suppresses
      BMP4-induced signaling in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Live-cell migration 
      assays reveal that BMP4 induces breast cancer migration, which is effectively
      blocked by Chrdl1. We demonstrate that BMP4 also stimulated breast cancer cell
      invasion and matrix degradation, in part, through enhanced metalloproteinase 2
      (MMP2) and MMP9 activity that is antagonized by Chrdl1. Finally, high Chrdl1
      expression was associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with breast
      cancer. Together, our data reveal that Chrdl1 acts as a negative regulator of

TI  - p38beta Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Modulates Its Own Basal Activity by
      Autophosphorylation of the Activating Residue Thr180 and the Inhibitory Residues 
      Thr241 and Ser261.
PG  - 1540-54
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01105-15 [doi]
AB  - Many enzymes are self-regulated and can either inhibit or enhance their own
      catalytic activity. Enzymes that do both are extremely rare. Many protein kinases
      autoactivate by autophosphorylating specific sites at their activation loop and
      are inactivated by phosphatases. Although mitogen-activated protein kinases
      (MAPKs) are usually activated by dual phosphorylation catalyzed by MAPK kinases
      (MAPKKs), the MAPK p38beta is exceptional and is capable of self-activation by
      cis autophosphorylation of its activation loop residue T180. We discovered that
      p38beta also autophosphorylates in trans two previously unknown sites residing
      within a MAPK-specific structural element known as the MAPK insert: T241 and
      S261. Whereas phosphorylation of T180 evokes catalytic activity, phosphorylation 
      of S261 reduces the activity of T180-phosphorylated p38beta, and phosphorylation 
      of T241 reduces its autophosphorylation in trans Both phosphorylations do not
      affect the activity of dually phosphorylated p38beta. T241 of p38beta is found
      phosphorylated in vivo in bone and muscle tissues. In myogenic cell lines,
      phosphorylation of p38beta residue T241 is correlated with differentiation to
      myotubes. T241 and S261 are also autophosphorylated in intrinsically active
      variants of p38alpha, but in this protein, they probably play a different role.
      We conclude that p38beta is an unusual enzyme that automodulates its basal,
      MAPKK-independent activity by several autophosphorylation events, which enhance
      and suppress its catalytic activity.

TI  - Both the Exact Target Site Sequence and a Long Poly(A) Tail Are Required for
      Precise Insertion of the 18S Ribosomal DNA-Specific Non-Long Terminal Repeat
      Retrotransposon R7Ag.
PG  - 1494-508
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00970-15 [doi]
AB  - Ribosomal elements (R elements) are site-specific non-long terminal repeat (LTR) 
      retrotransposons that target ribosomal DNA (rDNA). To elucidate how R elements
      specifically access their target sites, we isolated and characterized the 18S
      rDNA-specific R element R7Ag from Anopheles gambiae Using an in vivo and ex vivo 
      recombinant baculovirus retrotransposition system, we found that the exact host
      18S rDNA sequence at the target site is essential for the precise insertion of
      R7Ag. In addition, a long poly(A) tail is necessary for the accurate initiation
      of R7Ag reverse transcription, a novel mechanism found in non-LTR elements. We
      further compared the subcellular localizations of proteins in R7Ag as well as
      R1Bm, another R element that targets 28S rDNA. Although the open reading frame 1 
      proteins (ORF1ps) of both R7Ag and R1Bm localized predominantly in the cytoplasm,
      ORF2 proteins (ORF2ps) colocalized in the nucleus with the nucleolar marker
      fibrillarin. The ORF1ps and ORF2ps of both R elements colocalized largely in the 
      nuclear periphery and to a lesser extent within the nucleus. These results
      suggest that R7Ag and R1Bm proteins may access nucleolar rDNA targets in an
      ORF2p-dependent manner.

TI  - Differential Involvement of the Npl4 Zinc Finger Domains of SHARPIN and HOIL-1L
      in Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex-Mediated Cell Death Protection.
PG  - 1569-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01049-15 [doi]
AB  - The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) participates in NF-kappaB
      activation and cell death protection. Loss of any of the three LUBAC subunits
      (catalytic HOIP, accessory HOIL-1L, or accessory SHARPIN subunit) leads to
      distinct phenotypes in mice and human. cpdm mice (chronic proliferative
      dermatitis in mice [cpdm]) that lack SHARPIN exhibit chronic inflammatory
      phenotypes, whereas HOIL-1L knockout mice exhibit no overt phenotypes, despite
      sharing highly homologous ubiquitin-like (UBL) and Npl4 zinc finger (NZF)
      domains. Here, we intercrossed mice lacking HOIL-1L and SHARPIN and found that
      reduction of HOIL-1L in cpdm mice exacerbated inflammatory phenotypes without
      affecting characteristic features of cpdm disease, whereas reduction of SHARPIN
      in HOIL-1L knockout mice provoked no overt phenotypes. Hence, loss of SHARPIN and
      reduction of LUBAC triggers cpdm phenotypes. We found that the NZF domain of
      SHARPIN, but not that of HOIL-1L, is critical for effective protection from
      programmed cell death by enhancing the recruitment of LUBAC to the activated TNFR
      complex. The binding activity to K63-linked ubiquitin chains that the NZF domain 
      of SHARPIN, but not that of HOIL-1L, possesses appears to be involved in the
      recruitment. Thus, selective recognition of ubiquitin chains by NZFs in LUBAC
      underlies the regulation of LUBAC function.

TI  - SUMOylation Regulates Growth Factor Independence 1 in Transcriptional Control and
      Hematopoiesis.
PG  - 1438-50
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01001-15 [doi]
AB  - Cell fate specification requires precise coordination of transcription factors
      and their regulators to achieve fidelity and flexibility in lineage allocation.
      The transcriptional repressor growth factor independence 1 (GFI1) is comprised of
      conserved Snail/Slug/Gfi1 (SNAG) and zinc finger motifs separated by a linker
      region poorly conserved with GFI1B, its closest homolog. Moreover, GFI1 and GFI1B
      coordinate distinct developmental fates in hematopoiesis, suggesting that their
      functional differences may derive from structures within their linkers. We show a
      binding interface between the GFI1 linker and the SP-RING domain of PIAS3, an
      E3-SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) ligase. The PIAS3 binding region in
      GFI1 contains a conserved type I SUMOylation consensus element, centered on
      lysine-239 (K239). In silico prediction algorithms identify K239 as the only
      high-probability site for SUMO modification. We show that GFI1 is modified by
      SUMO at K239. SUMOylation-resistant derivatives of GFI1 fail to complement Gfi1
      depletion phenotypes in zebrafish primitive erythropoiesis and granulocytic
      differentiation in cultured human cells. LSD1/CoREST recruitment and MYC
      repression by GFI1 are profoundly impaired for SUMOylation-resistant GFI1
      derivatives, while enforced expression of MYC blocks granulocytic
      differentiation. These findings suggest that SUMOylation within the GFI1 linker
      favors LSD1/CoREST recruitment and MYC repression to govern hematopoietic
      differentiation.

AB  - Inositol levels, maintained by the biosynthetic enzyme inositol-3-phosphate
      synthase (Ino1), are altered in a range of disorders, including bipolar disorder 
      and Alzheimer's disease. To date, most inositol studies have focused on the
      molecular and cellular effects of inositol depletion without considering Ino1
      levels. Here we employ a simple eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum, to
      demonstrate distinct effects of loss of Ino1 and inositol depletion. We show that
      loss of Ino1 results in an inositol auxotrophy that can be rescued only partially
      by exogenous inositol. Removal of inositol supplementation from the ino1(-)
      mutant resulted in a rapid 56% reduction in inositol levels, triggering the
      induction of autophagy, reduced cytokinesis, and substrate adhesion. Inositol
      depletion also caused a dramatic generalized decrease in phosphoinositide levels 
      that was rescued by inositol supplementation. However, loss of Ino1 triggered
      broad metabolic changes consistent with the induction of a catabolic state that
      was not rescued by inositol supplementation. These data suggest a metabolic role 
      for Ino1 that is independent of inositol biosynthesis. To characterize this role,
      an Ino1 binding partner containing SEL1L1 domains (Q54IX5) and having homology to
      mammalian macromolecular complex adaptor proteins was identified. Our findings
      therefore identify a new role for Ino1, independent of inositol biosynthesis,
      with broad effects on cell metabolism.

AB  - The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2 controls ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
      silencing by inhibiting recombination and RNA polymerase II-catalyzed
      transcription in the rDNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2 is recruited to
      nontranscribed spacer 1 (NTS1) of the rDNA array by interaction between the RENT 
      ( RE: gulation of N: ucleolar S: ilencing and T: elophase exit) complex and the
      replication terminator protein Fob1. The latter binds to its cognate sites,
      called replication termini (Ter) or replication fork barriers (RFB), that are
      located in each copy of NTS1. This work provides new mechanistic insights into
      the regulation of rDNA silencing and intrachromatid recombination by showing that
      Sir2 recruitment is stringently regulated by Fob1 phosphorylation at specific
      sites in its C-terminal domain (C-Fob1), which also regulates long-range Ter-Ter 
      interactions. We show further that long-range Fob1-mediated Ter-Ter interactions 
      in trans are downregulated by Sir2. These regulatory mechanisms control
      intrachromatid recombination and the replicative life span (RLS).

TI  - Effects of Combined Tristetraprolin/Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Deficiency on 
      the Splenic Transcriptome.
PG  - 1395-411
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01068-15 [doi]
AB  - Tristetraprolin (TTP) acts by binding to AU-rich elements in certain mRNAs, such 
      as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA, and increasing their decay rates. TTP
      knockout mice exhibit a profound inflammatory syndrome that is largely due to
      increased TNF levels. Although TTP's effects on gene expression have been well
      studied in cultured cells, little is known about its functions in intact tissues.
      We performed deep RNA sequencing on spleens from TTP knockout mice that were also
      deficient in both TNF receptors ("triple knockout" mice) to remove the secondary 
      effects of excess TNF activity. To help identify posttranscriptionally regulated 
      transcripts, we also compared changes in mature mRNA levels to levels of
      transiently expressed pre-mRNA. In the triple knockout spleens, levels of 3,014
      transcripts were significantly affected by 1.5-fold or more, but only a small
      fraction exhibited differential mRNA/pre-mRNA changes suggestive of increased
      mRNA stability. Transferrin receptor mRNA, which contains two highly conserved
      potential TTP binding sites, was significantly upregulated relative to its
      pre-mRNA. This was reflected in increased transferrin receptor expression and
      increased splenic iron/hemosiderin deposition. Our results suggest that TTP
      deficiency has profound effects on the splenic transcriptome, even in the absence
      of secondary increases in TNF activity.

TI  - Hsp90 Maintains Proteostasis of the Galactose Utilization Pathway To Prevent Cell
      Lethality.
PG  - 1412-24
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01064-15 [doi]
AB  - Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that aids in the folding of its metastable client 
      proteins. Past studies have shown that it can exert a strong impact on some
      cellular pathways by controlling key regulators. However, it is unknown whether
      several components of a single pathway are collectively regulated by Hsp90. Here,
      we observe that Hsp90 influences the protein abundance of multiple Gal proteins
      and the efficiency of galactose utilization even after the galactose utilization 
      pathway (GAL pathway) is fully induced. The effect of Hsp90 on Gal proteins is
      not at the transcriptional level. Moreover, Gal1 is found to physically interact 
      with Hsp90, and its stability is reduced in low-Hsp90 cells. When Hsp90 is
      compromised, several Gal proteins form protein aggregates that colocalize with
      the disaggregase Hsp104. These results suggest that Gal1 and other Gal proteins
      are probably the clients of Hsp90. An unbalanced GAL pathway has been known to
      cause fatal growth arrest due to accumulation of toxic galactose metabolic
      intermediates. It is likely that Hsp90 chaperones multiple Gal proteins to
      maintain proteostasis and prevent cell lethality especially in a fluctuating
      environment.

TI  - Duplication of the Yeast Spindle Pole Body Once per Cell Cycle.
PG  - 1324-31
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00048-16 [doi]
AB  - The yeast spindle pole body (SPB) is the functional equivalent of the mammalian
      centrosome. Centrosomes and SPBs duplicate exactly once per cell cycle by
      mechanisms that use the mother structure as a platform for the assembly of the
      daughter. The conserved Sfi1 and centrin proteins are essential components of the
      SPB duplication process. Sfi1 is an elongated molecule that has, in its center,
      20 to 23 binding sites for the Ca(2+)-binding protein centrin. In the
      yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, all Sfi1 N termini are in contact with the mother 
      SPB whereas the free C termini are distal to it. During S phase and early
      mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) phosphorylation of mainly serine
      residues in the Sfi1 C termini blocks the initiation of SPB duplication ("off"
      state). Upon anaphase onset, the phosphatase Cdc14 dephosphorylates Sfi1 ("on"
      state) to promote antiparallel and shifted incorporation of cytoplasmic Sfi1
      molecules into the half-bridge layer, which thereby elongates into the bridge.
      The Sfi1 C termini of the two Sfi1 layers localize in the bridge center, whereas 
      the N termini of the newly assembled Sfi1 molecules are distal to the mother SPB.
      These free Sfi1 N termini then assemble the new SPB in G1phase. Recruitment of
      Sfi1 molecules into the anaphase SPB and bridge formation were also observed
      inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that the Sfi1 bridge cycle is conserved
      between the two organisms. Thus, restricting SPB duplication to one event per
      cell cycle requires only an oscillation between Cdk1 kinase and Cdc14 phosphatase
      activities. This clockwork regulates the "on"/"off" state of the Sfi1-centrin
      receiver.

TI  - NR4A1 Antagonists Inhibit beta1-Integrin-Dependent Breast Cancer Cell Migration.
PG  - 1383-94
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00912-15 [doi]
AB  - Overexpression of the nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1) in breast cancer patients is a
      prognostic factor for decreased survival and increased metastasis, and this has
      been linked to NR4A1-dependent regulation of transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta) signaling. Results of RNA interference studies demonstrate that basal 
      migration of aggressive SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is TGF-beta
      independent and dependent on regulation of beta1-integrin gene expression by
      NR4A1 which can be inhibited by the NR4A1 antagonists
      1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methane (DIM-C-pPhOH) and a related
      p-carboxymethylphenyl [1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-carboxymethylphenyl)methane
      (DIM-C-pPhCO2Me)] analog. The NR4A1 antagonists also inhibited TGF-beta-induced
      migration of MDA-MB-231 cells by blocking nuclear export of NR4A1, which is an
      essential step in TGF-beta-induced cell migration. We also observed that NR4A1
      regulates expression of both beta1- and beta3-integrins, and unlike other
      beta1-integrin inhibitors which induce prometastatic beta3-integrin, NR4A1
      antagonists inhibit expression of both beta1- and beta3-integrin, demonstrating a
      novel mechanism-based approach for targeting integrins and integrin-dependent
      breast cancer metastasis.

TI  - Phosphorylation-Dependent Regulation of the DNA Damage Response of Adaptor
      Protein KIBRA in Cancer Cells.
PG  - 1354-65
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01004-15 [doi]
AB  - Multifunctional adaptor proteins encompassing various protein-protein interaction
      domains play a central role in the DNA damage response pathway. In this report,
      we show that KIBRA is a physiologically interacting reversible substrate of
      ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. We identified the site of
      phosphorylation in KIBRA as threonine 1006, which is embedded within the
      serine/threonine (S/T) Q consensus motif, by site-directed mutagenesis, and we
      further confirmed the same with a phospho-(S/T) Q motif-specific antibody.
      Results from DNA repair functional assays such as the gamma-H2AX assay,
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Comet assay, terminal
      deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay,
      and clonogenic cell survival assay using stable overexpression clones of
      wild-type (wt.) KIBRA and active (T1006E) and inactive (T1006A) KIBRA
      phosphorylation mutants showed that T1006 phosphorylation on KIBRA is essential
      for optimal DNA double-strand break repair in cancer cells. Further, results from
      stable retroviral short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) clones of KIBRA and
      KIBRA knockout (KO) model cells generated by a clustered regularly interspaced
      short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system showed that depleting KIBRA levels 
      compromised the DNA repair functions in cancer cells upon inducing DNA damage.
      All these phenotypic events were reversed upon reconstitution of KIBRA into cells
      lacking KIBRA knock-in (KI) model cells. All these results point to the fact that
      phosphorylated KIBRA might be functioning as a scaffolding protein/adaptor
      protein facilitating the platform for further recruitment of other DNA damage
      response factors. In summary, these data demonstrate the imperative functional
      role of KIBRAper se(KIBRA phosphorylation at T1006 site as a molecular switch
      that regulates the DNA damage response, possibly via the nonhomologous end
      joining [NHEJ] pathway), suggesting that KIBRA could be a potential therapeutic
      target for modulating chemoresistance in cancer cells.

TI  - New Regulatory Roles of Galectin-3 in High-Affinity IgE Receptor Signaling.
PG  - 1366-82
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00064-16 [doi]
AB  - Aggregation of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) in mast cells
      initiates activation events that lead to degranulation and release of
      inflammatory mediators. To better understand the signaling pathways and genes
      involved in mast cell activation, we developed a high-throughput mast cell
      degranulation assay suitable for RNA interference experiments using
      lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivery. We tested 432 shRNAs
      specific for 144 selected genes for effects on FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell
      degranulation and identified 15 potential regulators. In further studies, we
      focused on galectin-3 (Gal3), identified in this study as a negative regulator of
      mast cell degranulation. FcepsilonRI-activated cells with Gal3 knockdown
      exhibited upregulated tyrosine phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase and
      several other signal transduction molecules and enhanced calcium response. We
      show that Gal3 promotes internalization of IgE-FcepsilonRI complexes; this may be
      related to our finding that Gal3 is a positive regulator of FcepsilonRI
      ubiquitination. Furthermore, we found that Gal3 facilitates mast cell adhesion
      and motility on fibronectin but negatively regulates antigen-induced chemotaxis. 
      The combined data indicate that Gal3 is involved in both positive and negative
      regulation of FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling events in mast cells.

TI  - Analysis of Subcellular RNA Fractions Revealed a Transcription-Independent Effect
      of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha on Splicing, Mediated by Spt5.
PG  - 1342-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01117-15 [doi]
AB  - The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) modulates
      the expression of many genes, primarily through activation of NF-kappaB. Here, we
      examined the global effects of the elongation factor Spt5 on nascent and mature
      mRNAs of TNF-alpha-induced cells using chromatin and cytosolic subcellular
      fractions. We identified several classes of TNF-alpha-induced genes controlled at
      the level of transcription, splicing, and chromatin retention. Spt5 was found to 
      facilitate splicing and chromatin release in genes displaying high induction
      rates. Further analysis revealed striking effects of TNF-alpha on the splicing of
      25% of expressed genes; the vast majority were not transcriptionally induced.
      Splicing enhancement of noninduced genes by TNF-alpha was transient and
      independent of NF-kappaB. Investigating the underlying basis, we found that Spt5 
      is required for the splicing facilitation of the noninduced genes. In line with
      this, Spt5 interacts with Sm core protein splicing factors. Furthermore,
      following TNF-alpha treatment, levels of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) but not Spt5 
      are reduced from the splicing-induced genes, suggesting that these genes become
      enriched with a Pol II-Spt5 form. Our findings revealed the Pol II-Spt5 complex
      as a highly competent coordinator of cotranscriptional splicing.

TI  - H19 Long Noncoding RNA Regulates Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function via
      MicroRNA 675 by Interacting with RNA-Binding Protein HuR.
PG  - 1332-41
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01030-15 [doi]
AB  - The disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier function occurs commonly in
      various pathologies, but the exact mechanisms responsible are unclear. The H19
      long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulates the expression of different genes and has
      been implicated in human genetic disorders and cancer. Here, we report that H19
      plays an important role in controlling the intestinal epithelial barrier function
      by serving as a precursor for microRNA 675 (miR-675). H19 overexpression
      increased the cellular abundance of miR-675, which in turn destabilized and
      repressed the translation of mRNAs encoding tight junction protein ZO-1 and
      adherens junction E-cadherin, resulting in the dysfunction of the epithelial
      barrier. Increasing the level of the RNA-binding protein HuR in cells
      overexpressing H19 prevented the stimulation of miR-675 processing from H19,
      promoted ZO-1 and E-cadherin expression, and restored the epithelial barrier
      function to a nearly normal level. In contrast, the targeted deletion of HuR in
      intestinal epithelial cells enhanced miR-675 production in the mucosa and delayed
      the recovery of the gut barrier function after exposure to mesenteric
      ischemia/reperfusion. These results indicate that H19 interacts with HuR and
      regulates the intestinal epithelial barrier function via the H19-encoded miR-675 
      by altering ZO-1 and E-cadherin expression posttranscriptionally.

TI  - Gtf2ird1-Dependent Mohawk Expression Regulates Mechanosensing Properties of the
      Tendon.
PG  - 1297-309
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00950-15 [doi]
AB  - Mechanoforces experienced by an organ are translated into biological information 
      for cellular sensing and response. In mammals, the tendon connective tissue
      experiences and resists physical forces, with tendon-specific mesenchymal cells
      called tenocytes orchestrating extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. We show that 
      Mohawk (Mkx), a tendon-specific transcription factor, is essential in
      mechanoresponsive tenogenesis through regulation of its downstream ECM genes such
      as type I collagens and proteoglycans such as fibromodulin both in vivo and in
      vitro Wild-type (WT) mice demonstrated an increase in collagen fiber diameter and
      density in response to physical treadmill exercise, whereas in Mkx(-/-) mice,
      tendons failed to respond to the same mechanical stimulation. Furthermore,
      functional screening of the Mkx promoter region identified several upstream
      transcription factors that regulate Mkx In particular, general transcription
      factor II-I repeat domain-containing protein 1 (Gtf2ird1) that is expressed in
      the cytoplasm of unstressed tenocytes translocated into the nucleus upon
      mechanical stretching to activate the Mkx promoter through chromatin regulation. 
      Here, we demonstrate that Gtf2ird1 is essential for Mkx transcription, while also
      linking mechanical forces to Mkx-mediated tendon homeostasis and regeneration.

TI  - A Remodeled Hsp90 Molecular Chaperone Ensemble with the Novel Cochaperone Aarsd1 
      Is Required for Muscle Differentiation.
PG  - 1310-21
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01099-15 [doi]
AB  - Hsp90 is the ATP-consuming core component of a very abundant molecular chaperone 
      machine that handles a substantial portion of the cytosolic proteome. Rather than
      one machine, it is in fact an ensemble of molecular machines, since most
      mammalian cells express two cytosolic isoforms of Hsp90 and a subset of up to 40 
      to 50 cochaperones and regulate their interactions and functions by a variety of 
      posttranslational modifications. We demonstrate that the Hsp90 ensemble is
      fundamentally remodeled during muscle differentiation and that this remodeling is
      not just a consequence of muscle differentiation but possibly one of the drivers 
      to accompany and to match the vast proteomic changes associated with this
      process. As myoblasts differentiate into myotubes, Hsp90alpha disappears and only
      Hsp90beta remains, which is the only isoform capable of interacting with the
      novel muscle-specific Hsp90 cochaperone Aarsd1L. Artificially maintaining
      Hsp90alpha or knocking down Aarsd1L expression interferes with the
      differentiation of C2C12 myotubes. During muscle differentiation, Aarsd1L
      replaces the more ubiquitous cochaperone p23 and in doing so dampens the activity
      of the glucocorticoid receptor, one of the Hsp90 clients relevant to muscle
      functions. This cochaperone switch protects muscle cells against the inhibitory
      effects of glucocorticoids and may contribute to preventing muscle wasting
      induced by excess glucocorticoids.

TI  - Histone Chaperone Nap1 Is a Major Regulator of Histone H2A-H2B Dynamics at the
      Inducible GAL Locus.
PG  - 1287-96
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00835-15 [doi]
AB  - Histone chaperones, like nucleosome assembly protein 1 (Nap1), play a critical
      role in the maintenance of chromatin architecture. Here, we use the GAL locus in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the influence of Nap1 on chromatin
      structure and histone dynamics during distinct transcriptional states. When the
      GAL locus is not expressed, cells lacking Nap1 show an accumulation of histone
      H2A-H2B but not histone H3-H4 at this locus. Excess H2A-H2B interacts with the
      linker DNA between nucleosomes, and the interaction is independent of the
      inherent DNA-binding affinity of H2A-H2B for these particular sequences as
      measured in vitro When the GAL locus is transcribed, excess H2A-H2B is reversed, 
      and levels of all chromatin-bound histones are depleted in cells lacking Nap1. We
      developed an in vivo system to measure histone exchange at the GAL locus and
      observed considerable variability in the rate of exchange across the locus in
      wild-type cells. We recapitulate this variability with in vitro nucleosome
      reconstitutions, which suggests a contribution of DNA sequence to histone
      dynamics. We also find that Nap1 is required for transcription-dependent H2A-H2B 
      exchange. Altogether, these results indicate that Nap1 is essential for
      maintaining proper chromatin composition and modulating the exchange of H2A-H2B
      in vivo.

TI  - Cytokine-Like Factor 1, an Essential Facilitator of Cardiotrophin-Like
      Cytokine:Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Signaling and sorLA-Mediated 
      Turnover.
PG  - 1272-86
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00917-15 [doi]
AB  - Cardiotrophin-like cytokine:cytokine-like factor-1 (CLC:CLF-1) is a heterodimeric
      neurotropic cytokine that plays a crucial role during neuronal development. Mice 
      lacking CLC:CLF-1 die soon after birth due to a suckling defect and show reduced 
      numbers of motor neurons. Humans carrying mutations in CLC:CLF-1 develop similar 
      disorders, known as Sohar-Crisponi or cold-induced sweating syndrome, and have a 
      high risk of early death. It is well known that CLC binds the ciliary
      neurotrophic factor receptor alpha (CNTFRalpha) and is a prerequisite for
      signaling through the gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFRbeta)
      heterodimer, whereas CLF-1 serves to promote the cellular release of CLC.
      However, the precise role of CLF-1 is unclear. Here, we report that CLF-1, based 
      on its binding site for CLC and on two additional and independent sites for
      CNTFRalpha and sorLA, is a key player in CLC and CNTFRalpha signaling and
      turnover. The site for CNTFRalpha enables CLF-1 to promote CLC:CNTFRalpha complex
      formation and signaling. The second site establishes a link between the endocytic
      receptor sorLA and the tripartite CLC:CLF-1:CNTFRalpha complex and allows sorLA
      to downregulate the CNTFRalpha pool in stimulated cells. Finally, sorLA may bind 
      and concentrate the tripartite soluble CLC:CLF-1:CNTFRalpha complex on cell
      membranes and thus facilitate its signaling through gp130/LIFRbeta.

TI  - Phosphorylation of Ago2 and Subsequent Inactivation of let-7a RNP-Specific
      MicroRNAs Control Differentiation of Mammalian Sympathetic Neurons.
PG  - 1260-71
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00054-16 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that regulate gene expression
      posttranscriptionally by base pairing to the target mRNAs in animal cells. KRas, 
      an oncogene known to be repressed by let-7a miRNAs, is expressed and needed for
      the differentiation of mammalian sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells. We
      documented a loss of let-7a activity during this differentiation process without 
      any significant change in the cellular level of let-7a miRNA. However, the level 
      of Ago2, an essential component that is associated with miRNAs to form
      RNP-specific miRNA (miRNP) complexes, shows an increase with neuronal
      differentiation. In this study, differentiation-induced phosphorylation and the
      subsequent loss of miRNA from Ago2 were noted, and these accounted for the loss
      of miRNA activity in differentiating neurons. Neuronal differentiation induces
      the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the downstream
      kinase mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). This in turn
      upregulates the phosphorylation of Ago2 and ensures the dissociation of miRNA
      from Ago2 in neuronal cells. MSK1-mediated miRNP inactivation is a prerequisite
      for the differentiation of neuronal cells, where let-7a miRNA gets unloaded from 
      Ago2 to ensure the upregulation of KRas, a target of let-7a. We noted that the
      inactivation of let-7a is both necessary and sufficient for the differentiation
      of sympathetic neurons.

TI  - A Novel Allosteric Mechanism of NF-kappaB Dimerization and DNA Binding Targeted
      by an Anti-Inflammatory Drug.
PG  - 1237-47
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00895-15 [doi]
AB  - The NF-kappaB family plays key roles in immune and stress responses, and its
      deregulation contributes to several diseases. Therefore its modulation has become
      an important therapeutic target. Here, we used a high-throughput screen for small
      molecules that directly inhibit dimerization of the NF-kappaB protein p65. One of
      the identified inhibitors is withaferin A (WFA), a documented anticancer and
      anti-inflammatory compound. Computational modeling suggests that WFA contacts the
      dimerization interface on one subunit and surface residues E285 and Q287 on the
      other. Despite their locations far from the dimerization site, E285 and Q287
      substitutions diminished both dimerization and the WFA effect. Further
      investigation revealed that their effects on dimerization are associated with
      their proximity to a conserved hydrophobic core domain (HCD) that is crucial for 
      dimerization and DNA binding. Our findings established NF-kappaB dimerization as 
      a drug target and uncovered an allosteric domain as a target of WFA action.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01021-15 [doi]
AB  - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) plays key roles in RNA silencing to generate 
      double-stranded RNAs. In model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and
      Neurospora crassa, two types of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), primary siRNAs
      and secondary siRNAs, are expressed; RdRP produces secondary siRNAs de novo,
      without using either Dicer or primers, while primary siRNAs are processed by
      Dicer. We reported that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has RdRP
      activity and produces endogenous siRNAs in a Dicer-dependent manner. However, de 
      novo synthesis of siRNAs by human TERT has not been elucidated. Here we show that
      the TERT RdRP generates short RNAs that are complementary to template RNAs and
      have 5'-triphosphorylated ends, which indicates de novo synthesis of the RNAs. In
      addition, we confirmed short RNA synthesis by TERT in several human carcinoma
      cell lines and found that TERT protein levels are positively correlated with RdRP
      activity.

TI  - Arrested Hematopoiesis and Vascular Relaxation Defects in Mice with a Mutation in
      Dhfr.
PG  - 1222-36
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01035-15 [doi]
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a critical enzyme in the folate metabolism
      pathway and also plays a role in regulating nitric oxide (NO) signaling in
      endothelial cells. Although both coding and noncoding mutations with phenotypic
      effects have been identified in the human DHFR gene, no mouse model is currently 
      available to study the consequences of perturbing DHFR in vivo In order to
      identify genes involved in definitive hematopoiesis, we performed a forward
      genetic screen and produced a mouse line, here referred to as Orana, with a point
      mutation in the Dhfr locus leading to a Thr136Ala substitution in the DHFR
      protein. Homozygote Orana mice initiate definitive hematopoiesis, but expansion
      of progenitors in the fetal liver is compromised, and the animals die between
      embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and E14.5. Heterozygote Orana mice survive to
      adulthood but have tissue-specific alterations in folate abundance and
      distribution, perturbed stress erythropoiesis, and impaired endothelium-dependent
      relaxation of the aorta consistent with the role of DHFR in regulating NO
      signaling. Orana mice provide insight into the dual roles of DHFR and are a
      useful model for investigating the role of environmental and dietary factors in
      the context of vascular defects caused by altered NO signaling.

TI  - SREBP-1c/MicroRNA 33b Genomic Loci Control Adipocyte Differentiation.
PG  - 1180-93
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00745-15 [doi]
AB  - White adipose tissue (WAT) is essential for maintaining metabolic function,
      especially during obesity. The intronic microRNAs miR-33a and miR-33b, located
      within the genes encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2)
      and SREBP-1, respectively, are transcribed in concert with their host genes and
      function alongside them to regulate cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose
      metabolism. SREBP-1 is highly expressed in mature WAT and plays a critical role
      in promoting in vitro adipocyte differentiation. It is unknown whether miR-33b is
      induced during or involved in adipogenesis. This is in part due to loss of
      miR-33b in rodents, precluding in vivo assessment of the impact of miR-33b using 
      standard mouse models. This work demonstrates that miR-33b is highly induced upon
      differentiation of human preadipocytes, along with SREBP-1. We further report
      that miR-33b is an important regulator of adipogenesis, as inhibition of miR-33b 
      enhanced lipid droplet accumulation. Conversely, overexpression of miR-33b
      impaired preadipocyte proliferation and reduced lipid droplet formation and the
      induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) target 
      genes during differentiation. These effects may be mediated by targeting of
      HMGA2, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), and other predicted miR-33b targets.
      Together, these findings demonstrate a novel role of miR-33b in the regulation of
      adipocyte differentiation, with important implications for the development of
      obesity and metabolic disease.

TI  - Aquaporin-3 Controls Breast Cancer Cell Migration by Regulating Hydrogen Peroxide
      Transport and Its Downstream Cell Signaling.
PG  - 1206-18
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00971-15 [doi]
AB  - Most breast cancer mortality is due to clinical relapse associated with
      metastasis. CXCL12/CXCR4-dependent cell migration is a critical process in breast
      cancer progression; however, its underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.
      Here, we show that the water/glycerol channel protein aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is
      required for CXCL12/CXCR4-dependent breast cancer cell migration through a
      mechanism involving its hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) transport function.
      Extracellular H2O2, produced by CXCL12-activated membrane NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2),
      was transported into breast cancer cells via AQP3. Transient H2O2 accumulation
      was observed around the membrane during CXCL12-induced migration, which may be
      facilitated by the association of AQP3 with Nox2. Intracellular H2O2 then
      oxidized PTEN and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) followed by activation 
      of the Akt pathway. This contributed to directional cell migration. The
      expression level of AQP3 in breast cancer cells was related to their migration
      ability both in vitro and in vivo through CXCL12/CXCR4- or H2O2-dependent
      pathways. Coincidentally, spontaneous metastasis of orthotopic xenografts to the 
      lung was reduced upon AQP3 knockdown. These findings underscore the importance of
      AQP3-transported H2O2 in CXCL12/CXCR4-dependent signaling and migration in breast
      cancer cells and suggest that AQP3 has potential as a therapeutic target for
      breast cancer.

TI  - A Minor Subset of Super Elongation Complexes Plays a Predominant Role in
      Reversing HIV-1 Latency.
PG  - 1194-205
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00994-15 [doi]
AB  - Promoter-proximal pausing by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a key rate-limiting
      step in HIV-1 transcription and latency reversal. The viral Tat protein recruits 
      human super elongation complexes (SECs) to paused Pol II to overcome this
      restriction. Despite the recent progress in understanding the functions of
      different subsets of SECs in controlling cellular and Tat-activated HIV
      transcription, little is known about the SEC subtypes that help reverse viral
      latency in CD4(+) T cells. Here, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing tool to
      knock out the gene encoding the SEC subunit ELL2, AFF1, or AFF4 in Jurkat/2D10
      cells, a well-characterized HIV-1 latency model. Depletion of these proteins
      drastically reduced spontaneous and drug-induced latency reversal by suppressing 
      HIV-1 transcriptional elongation. Surprisingly, a low-abundance subset of SECs
      containing ELL2 and AFF1 was found to play a predominant role in cooperating with
      Tat to reverse latency. By increasing the cellular level/activity of these
      Tat-friendly SECs, we could potently activate latent HIV-1 without using any
      drugs. These results implicate the ELL2/AFF1-SECs as an important target in the
      future design of a combinatorial therapeutic approach to purge latent HIV-1.

PG  - 1136-51
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00744-15 [doi]
AB  - This study is designed to examine the cellular functions of human Fas-associated 
      factor 1 (FAF1) containing multiple ubiquitin-related domains. Microarray
      analyses revealed that interferon-stimulated genes related to the antiviral
      response are significantly increased in FAF1-knockdown HeLa cells. Silencing FAF1
      enhanced the poly(I.C)- and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced production 
      of type I interferons (IFNs), the target genes of interferon regulator factor 3
      (IRF3). IRF3 is a key transcription factor in IFN-beta signaling responsible for 
      the host innate immune response. This study also found that FAF1 and IRF3
      physically associate with IPO5/importin-beta3 and that overexpression of FAF1
      reduces the interaction between IRF3 and IPO5/importin-beta3. These findings
      suggest that FAF1 negatively regulates IRF3-mediated IFN-beta production and the 
      antiviral innate immune response by regulating nuclear translocation of IRF3. We 
      conclude that FAF1 plays a novel role in negatively regulating virus-induced
      IFN-beta production and the antiviral response by inhibiting the translocation of
      active, phosphorylated IRF3 from the cytosol to the nucleus.

AB  - Molecular mechanisms governing the anterograde trafficking of nascent G
      protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are poorly understood. Here, we have studied
      the regulation of cell surface transport of alpha2-adrenergic receptors
      (alpha2-ARs) by GGA3 (Golgi-localized, gamma-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP
      ribosylation factor-binding protein 3), a multidomain clathrin adaptor protein
      that sorts cargo proteins at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the
      endosome/lysosome pathway. By using an inducible system, we demonstrated that
      GGA3 knockdown significantly inhibited the cell surface expression of newly
      synthesized alpha2B-AR without altering overall receptor synthesis and
      internalization. The receptors were arrested in the TGN. Furthermore, GGA3
      knockdown attenuated alpha2B-AR-mediated signaling, including extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation and cyclic AMP (cAMP) inhibition.
      More interestingly, GGA3 physically interacted with alpha2B-AR, and the
      interaction sites were identified as the triple Arg motif in the third
      intracellular loop of the receptor and the acidic motif EDWE in the VHS domain of
      GGA3. In contrast, alpha2A-AR did not interact with GGA3 and its cell surface
      export and signaling were not affected by GGA3 knockdown. These data reveal a
      novel function of GGA3 in export trafficking of a GPCR that is mediated via a
      specific interaction with the receptor.

TI  - Evolution and Functional Trajectory of Sir1 in Gene Silencing.
PG  - 1164-79
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01013-15 [doi]
AB  - We used the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii
      to examine the evolution of Sir-based silencing, focusing on Sir1, silencers, the
      molecular topography of silenced chromatin, and the roles of SIR and RNA
      interference (RNAi) genes in T. delbrueckii. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
      followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis of Sir proteins in T. delbrueckii
      revealed a different topography of chromatin at the HML and HMR loci than was
      observed in S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae Sir1, enriched at the silencers of
      HMLalpha and HMR A: , was absent from telomeres and did not repress subtelomeric 
      genes. In contrast to S. cerevisiae SIR1's partially dispensable role in
      silencing, the T. delbrueckii SIR1 paralog KOS3 was essential for silencing. KOS3
      was also found at telomeres with T. delbrueckii Sir2 (Td-Sir2) and Td-Sir4 and
      repressed subtelomeric genes. Silencer mapping in T. delbrueckii revealed single 
      silencers at HML and HMR, bound by Td-Kos3, Td-Sir2, and Td-Sir4. The KOS3 gene
      mapped near HMR, and its expression was regulated by Sir-based silencing,
      providing feedback regulation of a silencing protein by silencing. In contrast to
      the prominent role of Sir proteins in silencing, T. delbrueckii RNAi genes AGO1
      and DCR1 did not function in heterochromatin formation. These results highlighted
      the shifting role of silencing genes and the diverse chromatin architectures
      underlying heterochromatin.

      Epithelium.
PG  - 1124-35
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00988-15 [doi]
AB  - Wnt pathway-driven proliferation and renewal of the intestinal epithelium must be
      tightly controlled to prevent development of cancer and barrier dysfunction.
      Although type I interferons (IFN) produced in the gut under the influence of
      microbiota are known for their antiproliferative effects, the role of these
      cytokines in regulating intestinal epithelial cell renewal is largely unknown.
      Here we report a novel role for IFN in the context of intestinal knockout of
      casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha), which controls the ubiquitination and
      degradation of both beta-catenin and the IFNAR1 chain of the IFN receptor.
      Ablation of CK1alpha leads to the activation of both beta-catenin and IFN
      pathways and prevents the unlimited proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells 
      despite constitutive beta-catenin activity. IFN signaling contributes to the
      activation of the p53 pathway and the appearance of apoptotic and senescence
      markers in the CK1alpha-deficient gut. Concurrent genetic ablation of CK1alpha
      and IFNAR1 leads to intestinal hyperplasia, robust attenuation of apoptosis, and 
      rapid and lethal loss of barrier function. These data indicate that IFN play an
      important role in controlling the proliferation and function of the intestinal
      epithelium in the context of beta-catenin activation.

TI  - Scaffold Protein Ahk1, Which Associates with Hkr1, Sho1, Ste11, and Pbs2,
      Inhibits Cross Talk Signaling from the Hkr1 Osmosensor to the Kss1
      Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase.
PG  - 1109-23
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01017-15 [doi]
AB  - In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, osmostress activates the Hog1
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which regulates diverse osmoadaptive
      responses. Hkr1 is a large, highly glycosylated, single-path transmembrane
      protein that is a putative osmosensor in one of the Hog1 upstream pathways termed
      the HKR1 subbranch. The extracellular region of Hkr1 contains both a positive and
      a negative regulatory domain. However, the function of the cytoplasmic domain of 
      Hkr1 (Hkr1-cyto) is unknown. Here, using a mass spectrometric method, we
      identified a protein, termed Ahk1 (Associated with Hkr1), that binds to
      Hkr1-cyto. Deletion of the AHK1 gene (in the absence of other Hog1 upstream
      branches) only partially inhibited osmostress-induced Hog1 activation. In
      contrast, Hog1 could not be activated by constitutively active mutants of the
      Hog1 pathway signaling molecules Opy2 or Ste50 in ahk1Delta cells, whereas robust
      Hog1 activation occurred in AHK1(+) cells. In addition to Hkr1-cyto binding, Ahk1
      also bound to other signaling molecules in the HKR1 subbranch, including Sho1,
      Ste11, and Pbs2. Although osmotic stimulation of Hkr1 does not activate the Kss1 
      MAPK, deletion of AHK1 allowed Hkr1 to activate Kss1 by cross talk. Thus, Ahk1 is
      a scaffold protein in the HKR1 subbranch and prevents incorrect signal flow from 
      Hkr1 to Kss1.

TI  - MicroRNA 211 Functions as a Metabolic Switch in Human Melanoma Cells.
PG  - 1090-108
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00762-15 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA 211 (miR-211) negatively regulates genes that drive invasion of
      metastatic melanoma. Compared to normal human melanocytes, miR-211 expression is 
      significantly reduced or absent in nonpigmented melanoma cells and lost during
      human melanoma progression. To investigate the molecular mechanism of its tumor
      suppressor function, miR-211 was ectopically expressed in nonpigmented melanoma
      cells. Ectopic expression of miR-211 reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha
      (HIF-1alpha) protein levels and decreased cell growth during hypoxia. HIF-1alpha 
      protein loss was correlated with the downregulation of a miR-211 target gene,
      pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). We present evidence that resumption of
      miR-211-mediated downregulation of PDK4 in melanoma cells causes inhibition of
      invasion by nonpigmented melanomas via HIF-1alpha protein destabilization. Thus, 
      the tumor suppressor miR-211 acts as a metabolic switch, and its loss is expected
      to promote cancer hallmarks in human melanomas. Melanoma, one of the deadliest
      forms of skin cancer, kills nearly 10,000 people in the United States per year.
      We had previously shown that a small noncoding RNA, termed miR-211, suppresses
      invasion and the growth of aggressive melanoma cells. The results presented here 
      support the hypothesis that miR-211 loss in melanoma cells causes abnormal
      regulation of energy metabolism, which in turn allows cancer cells to survive
      under low oxygen concentrations-a condition that generally kills normal cells.
      These findings highlight a novel mechanism of melanoma formation: miR-211 is a
      molecular switch that is turned off in melanoma cells, raising the hope that in
      the future we might be able to turn the switch back on, thus providing a better
      treatment option for melanoma.

TI  - A Repertoire of MicroRNAs Regulates Cancer Cell Starvation by Targeting
      Phospholipase D in a Feedback Loop That Operates Maximally in Cancer Cells.
PG  - 1078-89
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00711-15 [doi]
AB  - We report a negative feedback loop between the signaling protein phospholipase D 
      (PLD), phosphatidic acid (PA), and a specific set of microRNAs (miRNAs) during
      nutrient starvation of breast cancer cells. We show that PLD expression is
      increased in four breast cancer cell lines and that hypoxia, cell overcrowding,
      and nutrient starvation for 3 to 6 h increase expression even further. However,
      after prolonged (>12-h) starvation, PLD levels return to basal or lower levels.
      The mechanism for this is as follows. First, during initial starvation, an
      elevated PA (the product of PLD enzymatic activity) activates mTOR and S6K, known
      to inhibit apoptosis, and enhances cell migration especially in
      post-epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (post-EMT) cancer cells. Second,
      continued PA production in later starvation induces expression of PLD-targeting
      microRNA 203 (miR-203), miR-887, miR-3619-5p, and miR-182, which reduce PLD
      translation. We provide direct evidence for a feedback loop, whereby PLD
      induction upon starvation leads to PA, which induces expression of miRNAs, which 
      in turn inhibits PLD2 translation. The physiological relevance for breast cancer 
      cells is that as PA can activate cell invasion, then, due to the negative
      feedback, it can deprive mTOR and S6K of their natural activator. It can further 
      prevent inhibition of apoptosis and allow cells to survive nutrient deprivation, 
      which normal cells cannot do.

TI  - An Outer Mitochondrial Translocase, Tom22, Is Crucial for Inner Mitochondrial
      Steroidogenic Regulation in Adrenal and Gonadal Tissues.
PG  - 1032-47
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01107-15 [doi]
AB  - After cholesterol is transported into the mitochondria of steroidogenic tissues, 
      the first steroid, pregnenolone, is synthesized in adrenal and gonadal tissues to
      initiate steroid synthesis by catalyzing the conversion of pregnenolone to
      progesterone, which is mediated by the inner mitochondrial enzyme
      3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (3betaHSD2). We report that the
      mitochondrial translocase Tom22 is essential for metabolic conversion, as its
      knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) completely ablated progesterone
      conversion in both steroidogenic mouse Leydig MA-10 and human adrenal NCI cells. 
      Tom22 forms a 500-kDa complex with mitochondrial proteins associated with
      3betaHSD2. Although the absence of Tom22 did not inhibit mitochondrial import of 
      cytochrome P450scc (cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme) and aldosterone
      synthase, it did inhibit 3betaHSD2 expression. Electron microscopy showed that
      Tom22 is localized at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), while 3betaHSD2 is 
      localized at the inner mitochondrial space (IMS), where it interacts through a
      specific region with Tom22 with its C-terminal amino acids and a small amino acid
      segment of Tom22 exposed to the IMS. Therefore, Tom22 is a critical regulator of 
      steroidogenesis, and thus, it is essential for mammalian survival.

PG  - 1064-77
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00770-15 [doi]
AB  - Regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration is a complex process that 
      involves several signaling pathways and transcription factors as well as
      communication between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Here we show that
      decreased expression of histones or a defect in nucleosome assembly in the yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy
      numbers, oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, and expression of genes encoding
      enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
      (OXPHOS). The metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration induced by altered
      chromatin structure is associated with the induction of the retrograde (RTG)
      pathway and requires the activity of the Hap2/3/4/5p complex as well as the
      transport and metabolism of pyruvate in mitochondria. Together, our data indicate
      that altered chromatin structure relieves glucose repression of mitochondrial
      respiration by inducing transcription of the TCA cycle and OXPHOS genes carried
      by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.

TI  - A GIPC1-Palmitate Switch Modulates Dopamine Drd3 Receptor Trafficking and
      Signaling.
PG  - 1019-31
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00916-15 [doi]
AB  - Palmitoylation is involved in several neuropsychiatric and movement disorders for
      which a dysfunctional signaling of the dopamine D3 receptor (Drd3) is
      hypothesized. Computational modeling of Drd3's homologue, Drd2, has shed some
      light on the putative role of palmitoylation as a reversible switch for
      dopaminergic receptor signaling. Drd3 is presumed to be palmitoylated, based on
      sequence homology with Drd2, but the functional attributes afforded by Drd3
      palmitoylation have not been studied. Since these receptors are major targets of 
      antipsychotic and anti-Parkinsonian drugs, a better characterization of Drd3
      signaling and posttranslational modifications, like palmitoylation, may improve
      the prospects for drug development. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we
      evaluated in silico how Drd3 palmitoylation could elicit significant remodeling
      of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain to expose docking sites for signaling
      proteins. We tested this model in cellulo by using the interaction of Drd3 with
      the G-alpha interacting protein (GAIP) C terminus 1 (GIPC1) as a template. From a
      series of biochemical studies, live imaging, and analyses of mutant proteins, we 
      propose that Drd3 palmitoylation acts as a molecular switch for Drd3-biased
      signaling via a GIPC1-dependent route, which is likely to affect the mode of
      action of antipsychotic drugs.

      suggests that thermodynamic properties of kinases, rather than primary sequences,
      are recognized by the chaperones. In concordance, we observed a striking
      difference in HSP90 binding between wild-type (WT) and kinase-dead (KD) glycogen 
      synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) forms. Using model cell lines stably expressing 
      these two GSK3beta forms, we observed no interaction between WT GSK3beta and
      HSP90, in stark contrast to KD GSK3beta forming a stable complex with HSP90 at a 
      1:1 ratio. In a survey of 91 ectopically expressed kinases in DLD-1 cells, we
      compared two parameters to measure HSP90 dependency: static binding and kinase
      stability following HSP90 inhibition. We observed no correlation between HSP90
      binding and reduced stability of a kinase after pharmacological inhibition of
      HSP90. We expanded our stability study to >50 endogenous kinases across four cell
      lines and demonstrated that HSP90 dependency is context dependent. These
      observations suggest that HSP90 binds to its kinase client in a particular
      conformation that we hypothesize to be associated with the nucleotide-processing 
      cycle. Lastly, we performed proteomics profiling of kinases and phosphopeptides
      in DLD-1 cells to globally define the impact of HSP90 inhibition on the kinome.

AB  - Chromosomal copy number changes are frequently associated with harmful
      consequences and are thought of as an underlying mechanism for the development of
      diseases. However, changes in copy number are observed during development and
      occur during normal biological processes. In this review, we highlight the causes
      and consequences of copy number changes in normal physiologic processes as well
      as cover their associations with cancer and acquired drug resistance. We discuss 
      the permanent and transient nature of copy number gains and relate these
      observations to a new mechanism driving transient site-specific copy gains
      (TSSGs). Finally, we discuss implications of TSSGs in generating intratumoral
      heterogeneity and tumor evolution and how TSSGs can influence the therapeutic
      response in cancer.

TI  - Regulation of Antisense Transcription by NuA4 Histone Acetyltransferase and Other
      Chromatin Regulatory Factors.
PG  - 992-1006
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00808-15 [doi]
AB  - NuA4 histone lysine (K) acetyltransferase (KAT) promotes transcriptional
      initiation of TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factor (TAF)-dependent
      ribosomal protein genes. TAFs have also been recently found to enhance antisense 
      transcription from the 3' end of the GAL10 coding sequence. However, it remains
      unknown whether, like sense transcription of the ribosomal protein genes,
      TAF-dependent antisense transcription of GAL10 also requires NuA4 KAT. Here, we
      show that NuA4 KAT associates with the GAL10 antisense transcription initiation
      site at the 3' end of the coding sequence. Such association of NuA4 KAT depends
      on the Reb1p-binding site that recruits Reb1p activator to the GAL10 antisense
      transcription initiation site. Targeted recruitment of NuA4 KAT to the GAL10
      antisense transcription initiation site promotes GAL10 antisense transcription.
      Like NuA4 KAT, histone H3 K4/36 methyltransferases and histone H2B ubiquitin
      conjugase facilitate GAL10 antisense transcription, while the Swi/Snf and SAGA
      chromatin remodeling/modification factors are dispensable for antisense, but not 
      sense, transcription of GAL10. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the
      first time the roles of NuA4 KAT and other chromatin regulatory factors in
      controlling antisense transcription, thus illuminating chromatin regulation of
      antisense transcription.

TI  - The INO80 Complex Requires the Arp5-Ies6 Subcomplex for Chromatin Remodeling and 
      Metabolic Regulation.
PG  - 979-91
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00801-15 [doi]
AB  - ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are essential for transcription
      regulation, and yet it is unclear how these multisubunit complexes coordinate
      their activities to facilitate diverse transcriptional responses. In this study, 
      we found that the conserved Arp5 and Ies6 subunits of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae INO80 chromatin-remodeler form an abundant and distinct subcomplex in 
      vivo and stimulate INO80-mediated activity in vitro. Moreover, our genomic
      studies reveal that the relative occupancy of Arp5-Ies6 correlates with
      nucleosome positioning at transcriptional start sites and expression levels of
      >1,000 INO80-regulated genes. Notably, these genes are significantly enriched in 
      energy metabolism pathways. Specifically, arp5Delta, ies6Delta, and ino80Delta
      mutants demonstrate decreased expression of genes involved in glycolysis and
      increased expression of genes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.
      Deregulation of these metabolic pathways results in constitutively elevated
      mitochondrial potential and oxygen consumption. Our results illustrate the
      dynamic nature of the INO80 complex assembly and demonstrate for the first time
      that a chromatin remodeler regulates glycolytic and respiratory capacity, thereby
      maintaining metabolic stability.

TI  - Utp14 Recruits and Activates the RNA Helicase Dhr1 To Undock U3 snoRNA from the
      Preribosome.
PG  - 965-78
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00773-15 [doi]
AB  - In eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, U3 snoRNA base pairs with the pre-rRNA to
      promote its processing. However, U3 must be removed to allow folding of the
      central pseudoknot, a key feature of the small subunit. Previously, we showed
      that the DEAH/RHA RNA helicase Dhr1 dislodges U3 from the pre-rRNA. DHR1 can be
      linked to UTP14, encoding an essential protein of the preribosome, through
      genetic interactions with the rRNA methyltransferase Bud23. Here, we report that 
      Utp14 regulates Dhr1. Mutations within a discrete region of Utp14 reduced
      interaction with Dhr1 that correlated with reduced function of Utp14. These
      mutants accumulated Dhr1 and U3 in a pre-40S particle, mimicking a
      helicase-inactive Dhr1 mutant. This similarity in the phenotypes led us to
      propose that Utp14 activates Dhr1. Indeed, Utp14 formed a complex with Dhr1 and
      stimulated its unwinding activity in vitro. Moreover, the utp14 mutants that
      mimicked a catalytically inactive dhr1 mutant in vivo showed reduced stimulation 
      of unwinding activity in vitro. Dhr1 binding to the preribosome was substantially
      reduced only when both Utp14 and Bud23 were depleted. Thus, Utp14 is
      bifunctional; together with Bud23, it is needed for stable interaction of Dhr1
      with the preribosome, and Utp14 activates Dhr1 to dislodge U3.

AB  - The cell wall integrity (CWI) checkpoint in the budding yeast Saccharomyces

      the HCM1 mRNA level remained unaffected when the cell wall integrity checkpoint
      was induced, the protein level decreased. The overproduction of Hcm1 resulted in 
      the failure of the cell wall integrity checkpoint. We identified 39 Hcm1
      phosphorylation sites, including 26 novel sites, by tandem mass spectrometry
      analysis. A mutational analysis revealed that phosphorylation of Hcm1 at S61,
      S65, and S66 is required for the proper onset of the cell wall integrity
      checkpoint by regulating the timely decrease in its protein level.
      Hyperactivation of the CWI mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
      pathway significantly reduced the Hcm1 protein level, and the deletion of CWI
      MAPK Slt2 resulted in a failure to decrease Hcm1 protein levels in response to
      stress, suggesting that phosphorylation is regulated by CWI MAPK. In conclusion, 
      we suggest that Hcm1 is regulated negatively by the cell wall integrity
      checkpoint through timely phosphorylation and degradation under stress to
      properly control budding yeast proliferation.

AB  - Claudin protein family members, of which there are at least 27 in humans and
      mice, polymerize to form tight junctions (TJs) between epithelial cells, in a
      tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. Claudins have a paracellular
      barrier function. In addition, certain claudins function as paracellular channels
      for small ions and/or solutes by forming selective pores at the TJs, although the
      specific claudins involved and their functional mechanisms are still in question.
      Here we show for the first time that claudin-21, which is more highly expressed
      in the embryonic than the postnatal stages, acts as a paracellular channel for
      small cations, such as Na(+), similar to the typical channel-type claudins
      claudin-2 and -15. Claudin-21 also allows the paracellular passage of larger
      solutes. Our findings suggest that claudin-21-based TJs allow the passage of
      small and larger solutes by both paracellular channel-based and some additional
      mechanisms.

TI  - A Novel Interaction of Ecdysoneless (ECD) Protein with R2TP Complex Component
      RUVBL1 Is Required for the Functional Role of ECD in Cell Cycle Progression.
PG  - 886-99
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00594-15 [doi]
AB  - Ecdysoneless (ECD) is an evolutionarily conserved protein whose germ line
      deletion is embryonic lethal. Deletion of Ecd in cells causes cell cycle arrest, 
      which is rescued by exogenous ECD, demonstrating a requirement of ECD for normal 
      mammalian cell cycle progression. However, the exact mechanism by which ECD
      regulates cell cycle is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ECD protein levels and
      subcellular localization are invariant during cell cycle progression, suggesting 
      a potential role of posttranslational modifications or protein-protein
      interactions. Since phosphorylated ECD was recently shown to interact with the
      PIH1D1 adaptor component of the R2TP cochaperone complex, we examined the
      requirement of ECD phosphorylation in cell cycle progression. Notably,
      phosphorylation-deficient ECD mutants that failed to bind to PIH1D1 in vitro
      fully retained the ability to interact with the R2TP complex and yet exhibited a 
      reduced ability to rescue Ecd-deficient cells from cell cycle arrest. Biochemical
      analyses demonstrated an additional phosphorylation-independent interaction of
      ECD with the RUVBL1 component of the R2TP complex, and this interaction is
      essential for ECD's cell cycle progression function. These studies demonstrate
      that interaction of ECD with RUVBL1, and its CK2-mediated phosphorylation,
      independent of its interaction with PIH1D1, are important for its cell cycle
      regulatory function.

TI  - Lrp5 Has a Wnt-Independent Role in Glucose Uptake and Growth for Mammary
      Epithelial Cells.
PG  - 871-85
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00800-15 [doi]
AB  - Lrp5 is typically described as a Wnt signaling receptor, albeit a less effective 
      Wnt signaling receptor than the better-studied sister isoform, Lrp6. Here we show
      that Lrp5 is only a minor player in the response to Wnt3a-type ligands in mammary
      epithelial cells; instead, Lrp5 is required for glucose uptake, and glucose
      uptake regulates the growth rate of mammary epithelial cells in culture. Thus, a 
      loss of Lrp5 leads to profound growth suppression, whether growth is induced by
      serum or by specific growth factors, and this inhibition is not due to a loss of 
      Wnt signaling. Depletion of Lrp5 decreases glucose uptake, lactate secretion, and
      oxygen consumption rates; inhibition of glucose consumption phenocopies the loss 
      of Lrp5 function. Both Lrp5 knockdown and low external glucose induce
      mitochondrial stress, as revealed by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) and the activation of the ROS-sensitive checkpoint, p38alpha. In contrast, 
      loss of function of Lrp6 reduces Wnt responsiveness but has little impact on
      growth. This highlights the distinct functions of these two Lrp receptors and an 
      important Wnt ligand-independent role of Lrp5 in glucose uptake in mammary
      epithelial cells.

TI  - A Switch in Akt Isoforms Is Required for Notch-Induced Snail1 Expression and
      Protection from Cell Death.
PG  - 923-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01074-15 [doi]
AB  - Notch activation in aortic endothelial cells (ECs) takes place at embryonic
      stages during cardiac valve formation and induces endothelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition (EndMT). Using aortic ECs, we show here that active Notch expression
      promotes EndMT, resulting in downregulation of vascular endothelial cadherin
      (VE-cadherin) and upregulation of mesenchymal genes such as those for fibronectin
      and Snail1/2. In these cells, transforming growth factor beta1 exacerbates Notch 
      effects by increasing Snail1 and fibronectin activation. When Notch-downstream
      pathways were analyzed, we detected an increase in glycogen synthase kinase 3beta
      (GSK-3beta) phosphorylation and inactivation that facilitates Snail1 nuclear
      retention and protein stabilization. However, the total activity of Akt was
      downregulated. The discrepancy between Akt activity and GSK-3beta phosphorylation
      is explained by a Notch-induced switch in the Akt isoforms, whereby Akt1, the
      predominant isoform expressed in ECs, is decreased and Akt2 transcription is
      upregulated. Mechanistically, Akt2 induction requires the stimulation of the
      beta-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional complex, which activates the Akt2 promoter.
      Active, phosphorylated Akt2 translocates to the nucleus in Notch-expressing
      cells, resulting in GSK-3beta inactivation in this compartment. Akt2, but not
      Akt1, colocalizes in the nucleus with lamin B in the nuclear envelope. In
      addition to promoting GSK-3beta inactivation, Notch downregulates Forkhead box O1
      (FoxO1), another Akt2 nuclear substrate. Moreover, Notch protects ECs from
      oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through an Akt2- and Snail1-dependent
      mechanism.

TI  - Arsenic Directly Binds to and Activates the Yeast AP-1-Like Transcription Factor 
      Yap8.
PG  - 913-22
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00842-15 [doi]
AB  - The AP-1-like transcription factor Yap8 is critical for arsenic tolerance in the 
      yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the mechanism by which Yap8 senses the
      presence of arsenic and activates transcription of detoxification genes is
      unknown. Here we demonstrate that Yap8 directly binds to trivalent arsenite
      [As(III)] in vitro and in vivo and that approximately one As(III) molecule is
      bound per molecule of Yap8. As(III) is coordinated by three sulfur atoms in
      purified Yap8, and our genetic and biochemical data identify the cysteine
      residues that form the binding site as Cys132, Cys137, and Cys274. As(III)
      binding by Yap8 does not require an additional yeast protein, and Yap8 is
      regulated neither at the level of localization nor at the level of DNA binding.
      Instead, our data are consistent with a model in which a DNA-bound form of Yap8
      acts directly as an As(III) sensor. Binding of As(III) to Yap8 triggers a
      conformational change that in turn brings about a transcriptional response. Thus,
      As(III) binding to Yap8 acts as a molecular switch that converts inactive Yap8
      into an active transcriptional regulator. This is the first report to demonstrate
      how a eukaryotic protein couples arsenic sensing to transcriptional activation.

PG  - 848-54
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00929-15 [doi]
AB  - The role of p73, the homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, in regulating
      angiogenesis has recently been extensively investigated, resulting in the
      publication of five articles. Of these, two studies suggested a suppressive role,
      while the others implied a stimulatory role for the p73 isoforms in regulating
      angiogenesis. A negative role for TAp73, the full-length form that is often
      associated with tumor suppression, in blood vessel formation, is consistent with 
      its general attributes and was proposed to be effected indirectly through the
      degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1-alpha), the master
      angiogenic regulator. In contrast, a positive role for TAp73 coincides with its
      recently understood role in supporting cellular survival and thus tumorigenesis, 
      consistent with TAp73 being not-mutated but rather often overexpressed in
      clinical contexts. In the latter case, TAp73 expression was induced by hypoxia
      via HIF1-alpha, and it appears to directly promote angiogenic target gene
      activation and blood vessel formation independent of HIF1-alpha. This mini review
      will provide an overview of these seemingly opposite recent findings as well as
      earlier data, which collectively establish the definite possibility that TAp73 is
      indeed capable of both promoting and inhibiting angiogenesis, depending on the
      cellular context.

TI  - The N Terminus of the Retinoblastoma Protein Inhibits DNA Replication via a
      Bipartite Mechanism Disrupted in Partially Penetrant Retinoblastomas.
PG  - 832-45
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00636-15 [doi]
AB  - The N-terminal domain of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein (RbN)
      harbors in-frame exon deletions in partially penetrant hereditary retinoblastomas
      and is known to impair cell growth and tumorigenesis. However, how such RbN
      deletions contribute to Rb tumor- and growth-suppressive functions is unknown.
      Here we establish that RbN directly inhibits DNA replication initiation and
      elongation using a bipartite mechanism involving N-terminal exons lost in cancer.
      Specifically, Rb exon 7 is necessary and sufficient to target and inhibit the
      replicative CMG helicase, resulting in the accumulation of inactive CMGs on
      chromatin. An independent N-terminal loop domain, which forms a projection,
      specifically blocks DNA polymerase alpha (Pol-alpha) and Ctf4 recruitment without
      affecting DNA polymerases epsilon and delta or the CMG helicase. Individual
      disruption of exon 7 or the projection in RbN or Rb, as occurs in inherited
      cancers, partially impairs the ability of Rb/RbN to inhibit DNA replication and
      block G1-to-S cell cycle transit. However, their combined loss abolishes these
      functions of Rb. Thus, Rb growth-suppressive functions include its ability to
      block replicative complexes via bipartite, independent, and additive N-terminal
      domains. The partial loss of replication, CMG, or Pol-alpha control provides a
      potential molecular explanation for how N-terminal Rb loss-of-function deletions 
      contribute to the etiology of partially penetrant retinoblastomas.

      Adult Hematopoiesis.
PG  - 900-12
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00869-15 [doi]
AB  - Polycomb chromatin modifiers regulate hematopoietic pluripotent stem and
      progenitor cell self-renewal and expansion. Polycomb complex redundancy and
      biochemical heterogeneity complicate the unraveling of the functional
      contributions of distinct components. We have studied the hematopoietic activity 
      of RYBP, a direct interactor and proposed modulator of RING1A/RING1B-dependent
      histone H2A monoubiquitylation (H2AUb). Using a mouse model to conditionally
      inactivate Rybp in adult hematopoiesis, we have found that RYBP deletion results 
      in a reversion of B-1-to-B-2 B-cell progenitor ratios, i.e., of the innate
      (predominantly fetal) to acquired (mostly adult) immunity precursors. Increased
      numbers of B-1 progenitors correlated with a loss of pre-proB cells, the B-2
      progenitors. RYBP-deficient stem and progenitor cell populations (LKS) and
      isolated common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) gave rise to increased numbers of B-1 
      progenitors in vitro. Rybp inactivation, however, did not result in changes of
      global H2AUb and did not interact genetically with Ring1A or Ring1B deletions.
      These results show that a sustained regulation of the B-1-to-B-2 switch is needed
      throughout adult life and that RYBP plays an important role in keeping B-2
      dominance, most likely independently of its Polycomb affiliation.

AB  - Biogenesis of the 12-subunit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription complex
      requires so-called GPN-loop GTPases, but the function of these enzymes is
      unknown. Here we report the first crystal structure of a eukaryotic GPN-loop
      GTPase, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme Npa3 (a homolog of human GPN1, also
      called RPAP4, XAB1, and MBDin), and analyze its catalytic mechanism. The enzyme
      was trapped in a GDP-bound closed conformation and in a novel GTP analog-bound
      open conformation displaying a conserved hydrophobic pocket distant from the
      active site. We show that Npa3 has chaperone activity and interacts with
      hydrophobic peptide regions of Pol II subunits that form interfaces in the
      assembled Pol II complex. Biochemical results are consistent with a model that
      the hydrophobic pocket binds peptides and that this can allosterically stimulate 
      GTPase activity and subsequent peptide release. These results suggest that
      GPN-loop GTPases are assembly chaperones for Pol II and other protein complexes.

AB  - Discovering and classifying long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) across all mammalian
      tissues and cell lines remains a major challenge. Previously, mouse lncRNAs were 
      identified using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a limited number of
      tissues or cell lines. Additionally, associating a few hundred lncRNA promoters
      with chromatin states in a single mouse cell line has identified two classes of
      chromatin-associated lncRNA. However, the discovery and classification of lncRNAs
      is still pending in many other tissues in mouse. To address this, we built a
      comprehensive catalog of lncRNAs by combining known lncRNAs with high-confidence 
      novel lncRNAs identified by mapping and de novo assembling billions of RNA-seq
      reads from eight tissues and a primary cell line in mouse. Next, we integrated
      this catalog of lncRNAs with multiple genome-wide chromatin state maps and found 
      two different classes of chromatin state-associated lncRNAs, including
      promoter-associated (plncRNAs) and enhancer-associated (elncRNAs) lncRNAs, across
      various tissues. Experimental knockdown of an elncRNA resulted in the
      downregulation of the neighboring protein-coding Kdm8 gene, encoding a histone
      demethylase. Our findings provide 2,803 novel lncRNAs and a comprehensive catalog
      of chromatin-associated lncRNAs across different tissues in mouse.

AB  - Genome-wide analyses of changes in gene expression, transcription factor
      occupancy on DNA, histone modification patterns on chromatin, genomic copy number
      variation, and nucleosome positioning have become popular in many modern
      laboratories, yielding a wealth of information during health and disease states. 
      However, most of these studies have overlooked an inherent normalization problem 
      that must be corrected with spike-in controls. Here we describe the reason why
      spike-in controls are so important and explain how to appropriately design and
      use spike-in controls for normalization. We also suggest ways to retrospectively 
      renormalize data sets that were wrongly interpreted due to omission of spike-in
      controls.

AB  - Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are present in very small amounts but are essential for 
      cell signaling, morphogenesis, and polarity. By mass spectrometry, we
      demonstrated that some PIPs with stearic acyl chains were strongly disturbed in a
      psi1Delta Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain deficient in the specific
      incorporation of a stearoyl chain at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylinositol.
      The absence of PIPs containing stearic acid induced disturbances in intracellular
      trafficking, although the total amount of PIPs was not diminished. Changes in
      PIPs also induced alterations in the budding pattern and defects in actin
      cytoskeleton organization (cables and patches). Moreover, when the PSI1 gene was 
      impaired, a high proportion of cells with bipolar cortical actin patches that
      occurred concomitantly with the bipolar localization of Cdc42p was specifically
      found among diploid cells. This bipolar cortical actin phenotype, never
      previously described, was also detected in a bud9Delta/bud9Delta strain. Very
      interestingly, overexpression of PSI1 reversed this phenotype.

PG  - 794-808
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00876-15 [doi]
AB  - NF-kappaB activation downstream of antigen receptor engagement is a highly
      regulated event required for lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune
      response. The pathway is often dysregulated in lymphoma, leading to constitutive 
      NF-kappaB activity that supports the aberrant proliferation of transformed
      lymphocytes. To identify novel regulators of antigen receptor signaling to
      NF-kappaB, we developed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based
      interaction cloning (BRIC), a screening strategy that can detect protein-protein 
      interactions in live mammalian cells in a high-throughput manner. Using this
      strategy, we identified the RING finger protein RNF181 as an interactor of
      CARD11, a key signaling scaffold in the antigen receptor pathway. We present
      evidence that RNF181 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to inhibit antigen
      receptor signaling to NF-kappaB downstream of CARD11. The levels of the obligate 
      signaling protein Bcl10 are reduced by RNF181 even prior to signaling, and Bcl10 
      can serve as a substrate for RNF181 E3 ligase activity in vitro. Furthermore,
      RNF181 limits the proliferation of human diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells that
      depend upon aberrant CARD11 signaling to NF-kappaB for growth and survival in
      culture. Our results define a new regulatory checkpoint that can modulate the
      output of CARD11 signaling to NF-kappaB in both normal and transformed
      lymphocytes.

TI  - Alternative Use of DNA Binding Domains by the Neurospora White Collar Complex
      Dictates Circadian Regulation and Light Responses.
PG  - 781-93
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00841-15 [doi]
AB  - In the Neurospora circadian system, the White Collar complex (WCC) of WC-1 and
      WC-2 drives transcription of the circadian pacemaker gene frequency (frq), whose 
      gene product, FRQ, as a part of the FRQ-FRH complex (FFC), inhibits its own
      expression. The WCC is also the principal Neurospora photoreceptor; WCC-mediated 
      light induction of frq resets the clock, and all acute light induction is
      triggered by WCC binding to promoters of light-induced genes. However, not all
      acutely light-induced genes are also clock regulated, and conversely, not all
      clock-regulated direct targets of WCC are light induced; the structural
      determinants governing the shift from WCC's dark circadian role to its light
      activation role are poorly described. We report that the DBD region (named for
      being defective in binding DNA), a basic region in WC-1 proximal to the
      DNA-binding zinc finger (ZnF) whose function was previously ascribed to nuclear
      localization, instead plays multiple essential roles assisting in DNA binding and
      mediating interactions with the FFC. DNA binding for light induction by the WCC
      requires only WC-2, whereas DNA binding for circadian functions requires WC-2 as 
      well as the ZnF and DBD motif of WC-1. The data suggest a means by which
      alterations in the tertiary and quaternary structures of the WCC can lead to its 
      distinct functions in the dark and in the light.

AB  - The main components regulating the pace of circadian ( congruent with24 h) clocks
      in animals are PERIOD (PER) proteins, transcriptional regulators that undergo
      daily changes in levels and nuclear accumulation by means of complex multisite
      phosphorylation programs. In the present study, we investigated the function of
      two phosphorylation sites, at Ser826 and Ser828, located in a putative nuclear
      localization signal (NLS) on the Drosophila melanogaster PER protein. These sites
      are phosphorylated by DOUBLETIME (DBT; Drosophila homolog of CK1delta/epsilon),
      the key circadian kinase regulating the daily changes in PER stability and
      phosphorylation. Mutant flies in which phosphorylation at Ser826/Ser828 is
      blocked manifest behavioral rhythms with periods slightly longer than 1 h and
      with altered temperature compensation properties. Intriguingly, although
      phosphorylation at these sites does not influence PER stability, timing of
      nuclear entry, or transcriptional autoinhibition, the phospho-occupancy at
      Ser826/Ser828 is rapidly stimulated by light and blocked by TIMELESS (TIM), the
      major photosensitive clock component in Drosophila and a crucial binding partner 
      of PER. Our findings identify the first phosphorylation sites on core clock
      proteins that are acutely regulated by photic cues and suggest that some
      phosphosites on PER proteins can modulate the pace of downstream behavioral
      rhythms without altering central aspects of the clock mechanism.

      Czeta-Mediated Phosphorylation Induced by Wnt Agonists.
PG  - 731-41
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00828-15 [doi]
AB  - The molecular events that drive Wnt-induced regulation of glycogen synthase
      kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) activity are poorly defined. In this study, we found
      that protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta) and GSK-3beta interact mainly in colon cancer
      cells. Wnt stimulation induced a rapid GSK-3beta redistribution from the
      cytoplasm to the nuclei in malignant cells and a transient PKC-mediated
      phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at a different site from serine 9. In addition,
      while Wnt treatment induced a decrease in PKC-mediated phosphorylation of
      GSK-3beta in nonmalignant cells, in malignant cells, this phosphorylation was
      increased. Pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated 
      silencing of PKCzeta abolished all of these effects, but unexpectedly, it also
      abolished the constitutive basal activity of GSK-3beta. In vitro activity assays 
      demonstrated that GSK-3beta phosphorylation mediated by PKCzeta enhanced
      GSK-3beta activity. We mapped Ser147 of GSK-3beta as the site phosphorylated by
      PKCzeta, i.e., its mutation into alanine abolished GSK-3beta activity, resulting 
      in beta-catenin stabilization and increased transcriptional activity, whereas
      phosphomimetic replacement of Ser147 by glutamic acid maintained GSK-3beta basal 
      activity. Thus, we found that PKCzeta phosphorylates GSK-3beta at Ser147 to
      maintain its constitutive activity in resting cells and that Wnt stimulation
      modifies the phosphorylation of Ser147 to regulate GSK-3beta activity in opposite
      manners in normal and malignant colon cells.

AB  - Loss of pancreatic beta-cell maturity occurs in diabetes and insulinomas.
      Although both physiological and pathological stresses are known to promote
      beta-cell dedifferentiation, little is known about the molecules involved in this
      process. Here we demonstrate that activinB, a transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta)-related ligand, is upregulated during tumorigenesis and drives the
      loss of insulin expression and beta-cell maturity in a mouse insulinoma model.
      Our data further identify Pax4 as a previously unknown activinB target and potent
      contributor to the observed beta-cell dedifferentiation. More importantly, using 
      compound mutant mice, we found that deleting activinB expression abolishes tumor 
      beta-cell dedifferentiation and, surprisingly, increases survival without
      significantly affecting tumor growth. Hence, this work reveals an unexpected role
      for activinB in the loss of beta-cell maturity, islet plasticity, and progression
      of insulinoma through its participation in beta-cell dedifferentiation.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00833-15 [doi]
AB  - The family of dynamin proteins is known to function in many eukaryotic membrane
      fusion and fission events. The yeast dynamin-related protein Vps1 functions at
      several stages of membrane trafficking, including Golgi apparatus to endosome and
      vacuole, peroxisomal fission, and endocytic scission. We have previously shown
      that in its endocytic role, Vps1 functions with the amphiphysin heterodimer
      Rvs161/Rvs167 to facilitate scission and release of vesicles. Phosphoproteome
      studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified a phosphorylation site in
      Vps1 at serine 599. In this study, we confirmed this phosphorylation event, and
      we reveal that, like Rvs167, Vps1 can be phosphorylated by the yeast
      cyclin-associated kinase Pho85 in vivo and in vitro. The importance of this
      posttranslational modification was revealed when mutagenesis of S599 to a
      phosphomimetic or nonphosphorylatable form caused defects in endocytosis but not 
      in other functions associated with Vps1. Mutation to nonphosphorylatable valine
      inhibited the Rvs167 interaction, while both S599V and S599D caused defects in
      vesicle scission, as shown by both live-cell imaging and electron microscopy of
      endocytic invaginations. Our data support a model in which phosphorylation and
      dephosphorylation of Vps1 promote distinct interactions and highlight the
      importance of such regulatory events in facilitating sequential progression of
      the endocytic process.

TI  - Human Glucocorticoid Receptor beta Regulates Gluconeogenesis and Inflammation in 
      Mouse Liver.
PG  - 714-30
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00908-15 [doi]
AB  - While in vitro studies have demonstrated that a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
      splice isoform, beta-isoform of human GR (hGRbeta), acts as a dominant-negative
      inhibitor of the classic hGRalpha and confers glucocorticoid resistance, the in
      vivo function of hGRbeta is poorly understood. To this end, we created an
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express hGRbeta in the mouse liver under the
      control of the hepatocyte-specific promoter. Genome-wide expression analysis of
      mouse livers showed that hGRbeta significantly increased the expression of
      numerous genes, many of which are involved in endocrine system disorders and the 
      inflammatory response. Physiologically, hGRbeta antagonized GRalpha's function
      and attenuated hepatic gluconeogenesis through downregulation of
      phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in wild-type (WT) mouse liver.
      Interestingly, however, hGRbeta did not repress PEPCK in GR liver knockout
      (GRLKO) mice. In contrast, hGRbeta regulates the expression of STAT1 in the
      livers of both WT and GRLKO mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and
      luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that hGRbeta binds to the intergenic
      glucocorticoid response element (GRE) of the STAT1 gene. Furthermore, treatment

      expression in vivo by both GRalpha-dependent and GRalpha-independent mechanisms.

PG  - 678-92
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00586-15 [doi]
AB  - Tissue fibrosis is a major cause of organ dysfunction during chronic diseases and
      aging. A critical step in this process is transforming growth factor beta1
      (TGF-beta1)-mediated transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, cells
      capable of synthesizing extracellular matrix. Here, we show that SIRT3 controls
      transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts via suppressing the profibrotic
      TGF-beta1 signaling. We found that Sirt3 knockout (KO) mice with age develop
      tissue fibrosis of multiple organs, including heart, liver, kidney, and lungs but
      not whole-body SIRT3-overexpressing mice. SIRT3 deficiency caused induction of
      TGF-beta1 expression and hyperacetylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta
      (GSK3beta) at residue K15, which negatively regulated GSK3beta activity to
      phosphorylate the substrates Smad3 and beta-catenin. Reduced phosphorylation led 
      to stabilization and activation of these transcription factors regulating
      expression of the profibrotic genes. SIRT3 deacetylated and activated GSK3beta
      and thereby blocked TGF-beta1 signaling and tissue fibrosis. These data reveal a 
      new role of SIRT3 to negatively regulate aging-associated tissue fibrosis and
      discloses a novel phosphorylation-independent mechanism controlling the catalytic
      activity of GSK3beta.

TI  - A Role of TMEM16E Carrying a Scrambling Domain in Sperm Motility.
PG  - 645-59
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00919-15 [doi]
AB  - Transmembrane protein 16E (TMEM16E) belongs to the TMEM16 family of proteins that
      have 10 transmembrane regions and appears to localize intracellularly. Although
      TMEM16E mutations cause bone fragility and muscular dystrophy in humans, its
      biochemical function is unknown. In the TMEM16 family, TMEM16A and -16B serve as 
      Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channels, while TMEM16C, -16D, -16F, -16G, and -16J
      support Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scrambling. Here, we show that TMEM16E
      carries a segment composed of 35 amino acids homologous to the scrambling domain 
      in TMEM16F. When the corresponding segment of TMEM16A was replaced by this
      35-amino-acid segment of TMEM16E, the chimeric molecule localized to the plasma
      membrane and supported Ca(2+)-dependent scrambling. We next established
      TMEM16E-deficient mice, which appeared to have normal skeletal muscle. However,
      fertility was decreased in the males. We found that TMEM16E was expressed in germ
      cells in early spermatogenesis and thereafter and localized to sperm tail.
      TMEM16E(-/-) sperm showed no apparent defect in morphology, beating,
      mitochondrial function, capacitation, or binding to zona pellucida. However, they
      showed reduced motility and inefficient fertilization of cumulus-free but
      zona-intact eggs in vitro. Our results suggest that TMEM16E may function as a
      phospholipid scramblase at inner membranes and that its defect affects sperm
      motility.

TI  - Snf1-Dependent Transcription Confers Glucose-Induced Decay upon the mRNA Product.
PG  - 628-44
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00436-15 [doi]
AB  - In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the switch from respiratory metabolism to 
      fermentation causes rapid decay of transcripts encoding proteins uniquely
      required for aerobic metabolism. Snf1, the yeast ortholog of AMP-activated
      protein kinase, has been implicated in this process because inhibiting Snf1
      mimics the addition of glucose. In this study, we show that the SNF1-dependent
      ADH2 promoter, or just the major transcription factor binding site, is sufficient
      to confer glucose-induced mRNA decay upon heterologous transcripts.
      SNF1-independent expression from the ADH2 promoter prevented glucose-induced mRNA
      decay without altering the start site of transcription. SNF1-dependent
      transcripts are enriched for the binding motif of the RNA binding protein Vts1,
      an important mediator of mRNA decay and mRNA repression whose expression is
      correlated with decreased abundance of SNF1-dependent transcripts during the
      yeast metabolic cycle. However, deletion of VTS1 did not slow the rate of
      glucose-induced mRNA decay. ADH2 mRNA rapidly dissociated from polysomes after
      glucose repletion, and sequences bound by RNA binding proteins were enriched in
      the transcripts from repressed cells. Inhibiting the protein kinase A pathway did
      not affect glucose-induced decay of ADH2 mRNA. Our results suggest that Snf1 may 
      influence mRNA stability by altering the recruitment activity of the
      transcription factor Adr1.

TI  - C/EBPgamma Is a Critical Regulator of Cellular Stress Response Networks through
      Heterodimerization with ATF4.
PG  - 693-713
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00911-15 [doi]
AB  - The integrated stress response (ISR) controls cellular adaptations to nutrient
      deprivation, redox imbalances, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ISR genes
      are upregulated in stressed cells, primarily by the bZIP transcription factor
      ATF4 through its recruitment to cis-regulatory C/EBP:ATF response elements
      (CAREs) together with a dimeric partner of uncertain identity. Here, we show that
      C/EBPgamma:ATF4 heterodimers, but not C/EBPbeta:ATF4 dimers, are the predominant 
      CARE-binding species in stressed cells. C/EBPgamma and ATF4 associate with
      genomic CAREs in a mutually dependent manner and coregulate many ISR genes. In
      contrast, the C/EBP family members C/EBPbeta and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) 
      were largely dispensable for induction of stress genes. Cebpg(-/-) mouse
      embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) proliferate poorly and exhibit oxidative stress due 
      to reduced glutathione levels and impaired expression of several glutathione
      biosynthesis pathway genes. Cebpg(-/-) mice (C57BL/6 background) display reduced 
      body size and microphthalmia, similar to ATF4-null animals. In addition,
      C/EBPgamma-deficient newborns die from atelectasis and respiratory failure, which
      can be mitigated by in utero exposure to the antioxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine.
      Cebpg(-/-) mice on a mixed strain background showed improved viability but, upon 
      aging, developed significantly fewer malignant solid tumors than WT animals. Our 
      findings identify C/EBPgamma as a novel antioxidant regulator and an obligatory
      ATF4 partner that controls redox homeostasis in normal and cancerous cells.

AB  - Eyes absent (Eya), a protein conserved from plants to humans and best
      characterized as a transcriptional coactivator, is also the prototype for a novel
      class of eukaryotic aspartyl protein tyrosine phosphatases. This minireview
      discusses recent breakthroughs in elucidating the substrates and cellular events 
      regulated by Eya's tyrosine phosphatase function and highlights some of the
      complexities, new questions, and surprises that have emerged from efforts to
      understand how Eya's unusual multifunctionality influences developmental
      regulation and signaling.

TI  - Shp2 Associates with and Enhances Nephrin Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Is
      Necessary for Foot Process Spreading in Mouse Models of Podocyte Injury.
PG  - 596-614
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00956-15 [doi]
AB  - In most forms of glomerular diseases, loss of size selectivity by the kidney
      filtration barrier is associated with changes in the morphology of podocytes. The
      kidney filtration barrier is comprised of the endothelial lining, the glomerular 
      basement membrane, and the podocyte intercellular junction, or slit diaphragm.
      The cell adhesion proteins nephrin and neph1 localize to the slit diaphragm and
      transduce signals in a Src family kinase Fyn-mediated tyrosine
      phosphorylation-dependent manner. Studies in cell culture suggest nephrin
      phosphorylation-dependent signaling events are primarily involved in regulation
      of actin dynamics and lamellipodium formation. Nephrin phosphorylation is a
      proximal event that occurs both during development and following podocyte injury.
      We hypothesized that abrogation of nephrin phosphorylation following injury would
      prevent nephrin-dependent actin remodeling and foot process morphological
      changes. Utilizing a biased screening approach, we found nonreceptor Src homology
      2 (sh2) domain-containing phosphatase Shp2 to be associated with phosphorylated
      nephrin. We observed an increase in nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation in the
      presence of Shp2 in cell culture studies. In the human glomerulopathies
      minimal-change nephrosis and membranous nephropathy, there is an increase in Shp2
      phosphorylation, a marker of increased Shp2 activity. Mouse podocytes lacking
      Shp2 do not develop foot process spreading when subjected to podocyte injury in
      vivo using protamine sulfate or nephrotoxic serum (NTS). In the NTS model, we
      observed a lack of foot process spreading in mouse podocytes with Shp2 deleted
      and smaller amounts of proteinuria. Taken together, these results suggest that
      Shp2-dependent signaling events are necessary for changes in foot process
      structure and function following injury.

TI  - Identifying Novel Transcriptional Regulators with Circadian Expression.
PG  - 545-58
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00701-15 [doi]
AB  - Organisms adapt their physiology and behavior to the 24-h day-night cycle to
      which they are exposed. On a cellular level, this is regulated by intrinsic
      transcriptional-translational feedback loops that are important for maintaining
      the circadian rhythm. These loops are organized by members of the core clock
      network, which further regulate transcription of downstream genes, resulting in
      their circadian expression. Despite progress in understanding circadian gene
      expression, only a few players involved in circadian transcriptional regulation, 
      including transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and long noncoding RNAs, 
      are known. Aiming to discover such genes, we performed a high-coverage
      transcriptome analysis of a circadian time course in murine fibroblast cells. In 
      combination with a newly developed algorithm, we identified many transcription
      factors, epigenetic regulators, and long intergenic noncoding RNAs that are
      cyclically expressed. In addition, a number of these genes also showed circadian 
      expression in mouse tissues. Furthermore, the knockdown of one such factor,
      Zfp28, influenced the core clock network. Mathematical modeling was able to
      predict putative regulator-effector interactions between the identified circadian
      genes and may help for investigations into the gene regulatory networks
      underlying circadian rhythms.

TI  - LARP4 Is Regulated by Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha in a Tristetraprolin-Dependent 
      Manner.
PG  - 574-84
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00804-15 [doi]
AB  - LARP4 is a protein with unknown function that independently binds to poly(A) RNA,
      RACK1, and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1). Here, we report on its
      regulation. We found a conserved AU-rich element (ARE) in the human LARP4 mRNA 3'
      untranslated region (UTR). This ARE, but not its antisense version or a
      point-mutated version, significantly decreased the stability of beta-globin
      reporter mRNA. We found that overexpression of tristetraprolin (TTP), but not its
      RNA binding mutant or the other ARE-binding proteins tested, decreased cellular
      LARP4 levels. RNA coimmunoprecipitation showed that TTP specifically associated
      with LARP4 mRNA in vivo. Consistent with this, mouse LARP4 accumulated to higher 
      levels in TTP gene knockout (KO) cells than in control cells. Stimulation of WT
      cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which rapidly induces TTP,
      robustly decreased LARP4 with a coincident time course but had no such effect on 
      LARP4B or La protein or on LARP4 in the TTP KO cells. The TNF-alpha-induced TTP
      pulse was followed by a transient decrease in LARP4 mRNA that was quickly
      followed by a subsequent transient decrease in LARP4 protein. Involvement of
      LARP4 as a target of TNF-alpha-TTP regulation provides a clue as to how its
      functional activity may be used in a physiologic pathway.

TI  - Genome-Wide Studies Reveal that H3K4me3 Modification in Bivalent Genes Is
      Dynamically Regulated during the Pluripotent Cell Cycle and Stabilized upon
      Differentiation.
PG  - 615-27
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00877-15 [doi]
AB  - Stem cell phenotypes are reflected by posttranslational histone modifications,
      and this chromatin-related memory must be mitotically inherited to maintain cell 
      identity through proliferative expansion. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), 
      bivalent genes with both activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone
      modifications are essential to sustain pluripotency. Yet, the molecular
      mechanisms by which this epigenetic landscape is transferred to progeny cells
      remain to be established. By mapping genomic enrichment of H3K4me3/H3K27me3 in
      pure populations of hESCs in G2, mitotic, and G1 phases of the cell cycle, we
      found striking variations in the levels of H3K4me3 through the G2-M-G1
      transition. Analysis of a representative set of bivalent genes revealed that
      chromatin modifiers involved in H3K4 methylation/demethylation are recruited to
      bivalent gene promoters in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. Interestingly,
      bivalent genes enriched with H3K4me3 exclusively during mitosis undergo the
      strongest upregulation after induction of differentiation. Furthermore, the
      histone modification signature of genes that remain bivalent in differentiated
      cells resolves into a cell cycle-independent pattern after lineage commitment.
      These results establish a new dimension of chromatin regulation important in the 
      maintenance of pluripotency.

TI  - Atg13 Is Essential for Autophagy and Cardiac Development in Mice.
PG  - 585-95
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01005-15 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is a major intracellular degradation system by which cytoplasmic
      components are enclosed by autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes. Formation
      of the autophagosome requires a set of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins. Among
      these proteins, the ULK1 complex, which is composed of ULK1 (or ULK2), FIP200,
      Atg13, and Atg101, acts at an initial step. Previous studies showed that ULK1 and
      FIP200 also function in pathways other than autophagy. However, whether Atg13 and
      Atg101 act similarly to ULK1 and FIP200 remains unknown. In the present study, we
      generated Atg13 knockout mice. Like FIP200-deficient mice, Atg13-deficient mice
      die in utero, which is distinct from most other types of Atg-deficient mice.
      Atg13-deficient embryos show growth retardation and myocardial growth defects. In
      cultured fibroblasts, Atg13 deficiency blocks autophagosome formation at an
      upstream step. In addition, sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha)-induced apoptosis is enhanced by deletion of Atg13 or FIP200, but not
      by other Atg proteins, as well as by simultaneous deletion of ULK1 and ULK2.
      These results suggest that Atg13 has both autophagic and nonautophagic functions 
      and that the latter are essential for cardiac development and likely shared with 
      FIP200 but not with ULK1/2.

AB  - Both proteolytic and nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitination are essential
      regulatory mechanisms for promoting DNA repair and the DNA damage response in
      mammalian cells. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have emerged as key players in
      the maintenance of genome stability. In this minireview, we discuss the recent
      findings on human DUBs that participate in genome maintenance, with a focus on
      the role of DUBs in the modulation of DNA repair and DNA damage signaling.

TI  - Deregulated KLF4 Expression in Myeloid Leukemias Alters Cell Proliferation and
      Differentiation through MicroRNA and Gene Targets.
PG  - 559-73
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00712-15 [doi]
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by increased proliferation and
      blocked differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors mediated, in part, by
      altered myeloid transcription factor expression. Decreased Kruppel-like factor 4 
      (KLF4) expression has been observed in AML, but how decreased KLF4 contributes to
      AML pathogenesis is largely unknown. We demonstrate decreased KLF4 expression in 
      AML patient samples with various cytogenetic aberrations, confirm that KLF4
      overexpression promotes myeloid differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation
      in AML cell lines, and identify new targets of KLF4. We have demonstrated that
      microRNA 150 (miR-150) expression is decreased in AML and that reintroducing
      miR-150 expression induces myeloid differentiation and inhibits proliferation of 
      AML cells. We show that KLF family DNA binding sites are necessary for miR-150
      promoter activity and that KLF2 or KLF4 overexpression induces miR-150
      expression. miR-150 silencing, alone or in combination with silencing of CDKN1A, 
      a well-described KLF4 target, did not fully reverse KLF4-mediated effects. Gene
      expression profiling and validation identified putative KLF4-regulated genes,
      including decreased MYC and downstream MYC-regulated gene expression in
      KLF4-overexpressing cells. Our findings indicate that decreased KLF4 expression
      mediates antileukemic effects through regulation of gene and microRNA networks,
      containing miR-150, CDKN1A, and MYC, and provide mechanistic support for
      therapeutic strategies increasing KLF4 expression.

      Complex Is Essential for the Dynamic Binding of NBS1 to Damaged Chromatin.
PG  - 4147-57
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00757-15 [doi]
AB  - The association and dissociation of DNA damage response (DDR) factors with
      damaged chromatin occurs dynamically, which is crucial for the activation of DDR 
      signaling in a spatiotemporal manner. We previously showed that the TIP60 histone
      acetyltransferase complex acetylates histone H2AX, to facilitate H2AX exchange at
      sites of DNA damage. However, it remained unclear how the acetylation of histone 
      H2AX by TIP60 is related to the DDR signaling. We found that the acetylation but 
      not the phosphorylation of H2AX is essential for the turnover of NBS1 on damaged 
      chromatin. The loss of H2AX acetylation at Lys 5 by TIP60 in cells disturbed the 
      accumulation of NBS1 at sites of DNA damage. Although the phosphorylation of H2AX
      is also reportedly required for the retention of NBS1 at damage sites, our data
      indicated that the acetylation-dependent NBS1 turnover by TIP60 on damaged
      chromatin restricts the dispersal of NBS1 foci from the sites of DNA damage.
      These findings indicate the importance of the acetylation-dependent dynamic
      binding of NBS1 to damaged chromatin, created by histone H2AX exchange, for the
      proper accumulation of NBS1 at DNA damage sites.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00755-15 [doi]
AB  - The lysine (K)-specific demethylase (LSD1) family of histone demethylases
      regulates chromatin structure and the transcriptional potential of genes. LSD1 is
      frequently deregulated in tumors, and depletion of LSD1 family members causes
      developmental defects. Here, we report that reductions in the expression of the
      Pumilio (PUM) translational repressor complex enhanced phenotypes due to dLsd1
      depletion in Drosophila. We show that the PUM complex is a target of LSD1
      regulation in fly and mammalian cells and that its expression is inversely
      correlated with LSD1 levels in human bladder carcinoma. Unexpectedly, we find
      that PUM posttranscriptionally regulates LSD1 family protein levels in flies and 
      human cells, indicating the existence of feedback loops between the LSD1 family
      and the PUM complex. Our results highlight a new posttranscriptional mechanism
      regulating LSD1 activity and suggest that the feedback loop between the LSD1
      family and the PUM complex may be functionally important during development and
      in human malignancies.

PG  - 4121-34
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00665-15 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like 3, hepatocyte specific
      (CREBH), is a hepatic transcription factor that functions as a key regulator of
      energy homeostasis. Here, we defined a regulatory CREBH posttranslational
      modification process, namely, lysine-specific acetylation, and its functional
      involvement in fasting-induced hepatic lipid metabolism. Fasting induces CREBH
      acetylation in mouse livers in a time-dependent manner, and this event is
      critical for CREBH transcriptional activity in regulating hepatic lipid
      homeostasis. The histone acetyltransferase PCAF-mediated acetylation and the
      deacetylase sirtuin-1-mediated deacetylation coexist to maintain CREBH
      acetylation states under fasting conditions. Site-directed mutagenesis and
      functional analyses revealed that the lysine (K) residue at position 294 (K294)
      within the bZIP domain of the CREBH protein is the site where fasting-induced
      acetylation/deacetylation occurs. Introduction of the acetylation-deficient
      (K294R) or acetylation-mimicking (K294Q) mutation inhibited or enhanced CREBH
      transcriptional activity, respectively. Importantly, CREBH acetylation at lysine 
      294 was required for the interaction and synergy between CREBH and peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in activating their target
      genes upon fasting or glucagon stimulation. Introduction of the CREBH lysine 294 
      mutation in the liver leads to hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia in animals
      under prolonged fasting. In summary, our study reveals a molecular mechanism by
      which fasting or glucagon stimulation modulates lipid homeostasis through
      acetylation of CREBH.

TI  - Cotargeting Polo-Like Kinase 1 and the Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway in
      Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 4185-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00825-15 [doi]
AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway has been identified as one of the
      predominantly upregulated pathways in castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC). However, whether targeting the beta-catenin pathway will prove effective 
      as a CRPC treatment remains unknown. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a critical
      regulator in many cell cycle events, and its level is significantly elevated upon
      castration of mice carrying xenograft prostate tumors. Indeed, inhibition of Plk1
      has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in several in vivo studies. Here, we show 
      that Plk1 is a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Plk1 inhibition 
      or depletion enhances the level of cytosolic and nuclear beta-catenin in human
      prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      significantly potentiates the antineoplastic activity of the Plk1 inhibitor
      BI2536 in both cultured prostate cancer cells and CRPC xenograft tumors.
      Mechanistically, axin2, a negative regulator of the beta-catenin pathway, serves 
      as a substrate of Plk1, and Plk1 phosphorylation of axin2 facilitates the
      degradation of beta-catenin by enhancing binding between glycogen synthase kinase
      3beta (GSK3beta) and beta-catenin. Plk1-phosphorylated axin2 also exhibits
      resistance to Cdc20-mediated degradation. Overall, this study identifies a novel 
      Plk1-Wnt signaling axis in prostate cancer, offering a promising new therapeutic 
      option to treat CRPC.

TI  - Posttranscriptional Regulation of the Inflammatory Marker C-Reactive Protein by
      the RNA-Binding Protein HuR and MicroRNA 637.
PG  - 4212-21
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00645-15 [doi]
AB  - C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase plasma protein, is a major component of 
      inflammatory reactions functioning as a mediator of innate immunity. It has been 
      widely used as a validated clinical biomarker of the inflammatory state in
      trauma, infection, and age-associated chronic diseases, including cancer and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite this, the molecular mechanisms that
      regulate CRP expression are not well understood. Given that the CRP 3'
      untranslated region (UTR) is long and AU rich, we hypothesized that CRP may be
      regulated posttranscriptionally by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and by microRNAs. 
      Here, we found that the RBP HuR bound directly to the CRP 3' UTR and affected CRP
      mRNA levels. Through this interaction, HuR selectively increased CRP mRNA
      stability and promoted CRP translation. Interestingly, treatment with the
      age-associated inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased binding of
      HuR to CRP mRNA, and conversely, HuR was required for IL-6-mediated upregulation 
      of CRP expression. In addition, we identified microRNA 637 (miR-637) as a
      microRNA that potently inhibited CRP expression in competition with HuR. Taken
      together, we have uncovered an important posttranscriptional mechanism that
      modulates the expression of the inflammatory marker CRP, which may be utilized in
      the development of treatments for inflammatory processes that cause CVD and
      age-related diseases.

TI  - Mild Glucose Starvation Induces KDM2A-Mediated H3K36me2 Demethylation through
      AMPK To Reduce rRNA Transcription and Cell Proliferation.
PG  - 4170-84
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00579-15 [doi]
AB  - Environmental conditions control rRNA transcription. Previously, we found that
      serum and glucose deprivation induces KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation in
      the rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter and reduces rRNA transcription in the human breast 
      cancer cell line MCF-7. However, the molecular mechanism and biological
      significance are still unclear. In the present study, we found that glucose
      starvation alone induced the KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription. The
      treatment of cells with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, reduced
      rRNA transcription and H3K36me2 in the rDNA promoter, both of which were
      completely dependent on KDM2A in low concentrations of 2-deoxy-d-glucose, that
      is, mild starvation conditions. The mild starvation induced these KDM2A
      activities through AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) but did not affect another AMPK
      effector of rRNA transcription, TIF-IA. In the triple-negative breast cancer cell
      line MDA-MB-231, the mild starvation also reduced rRNA transcription in a
      KDM2A-dependent manner. We detected KDM2A in breast cancer tissues irrespective
      of their estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status, including
      triple-negative cancer tissues. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, mild
      starvation reduced cell proliferation, and KDM2A knockdown suppressed the
      reduction of cell proliferation. These results suggest that under mild glucose
      starvation AMPK induces KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription to
      control cell proliferation.

TI  - BRG1 Governs Nanog Transcription in Early Mouse Embryos and Embryonic Stem Cells 
      via Antagonism of Histone H3 Lysine 9/14 Acetylation.
PG  - 4158-69
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00546-15 [doi]
AB  - During mouse preimplantation development, the generation of the inner cell mass
      (ICM) and trophoblast lineages comprises upregulation of Nanog expression in the 
      ICM and its silencing in the trophoblast. However, the underlying epigenetic
      mechanisms that differentially regulate Nanog in the first cell lineages are
      poorly understood. Here, we report that BRG1 (Brahma-related gene 1) cooperates
      with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to regulate Nanog expression. BRG1 depletion
      in preimplantation embryos and Cdx2-inducible embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
      revealed that BRG1 is necessary for Nanog silencing in the trophoblast lineage.
      Conversely, in undifferentiated ESCs, loss of BRG1 augmented Nanog expression.
      Analysis of histone H3 within the Nanog proximal enhancer revealed that H3 lysine
      9/14 (H3K9/14) acetylation increased in BRG1-depleted embryos and ESCs.
      Biochemical studies demonstrated that HDAC1 was present in BRG1-BAF155 complexes 
      and BRG1-HDAC1 interactions were enriched in the trophoblast lineage. HDAC1
      inhibition triggered an increase in H3K9/14 acetylation and a corresponding rise 
      in Nanog mRNA and protein, phenocopying BRG1 knockdown embryos and ESCs. Lastly, 
      nucleosome-mapping experiments revealed that BRG1 is indispensable for nucleosome
      remodeling at the Nanog enhancer during trophoblast development. In summary, our 
      data suggest that BRG1 governs Nanog expression via a dual mechanism involving
      histone deacetylation and nucleosome remodeling.

TI  - The Oxidation Status of Mic19 Regulates MICOS Assembly.
PG  - 4222-37
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00578-15 [doi]
AB  - The function of mitochondria depends on the proper organization of mitochondrial 
      membranes. The morphology of the inner membrane is regulated by the recently
      identified mitochondrial contact site and crista organizing system (MICOS)
      complex. MICOS mutants exhibit alterations in crista formation, leading to
      mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the mechanisms that underlie MICOS regulation
      remain poorly understood. MIC19, a peripheral protein of the inner membrane and
      component of the MICOS complex, was previously reported to be required for the
      proper function of MICOS in maintaining the architecture of the inner membrane.
      Here, we show that human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae MIC19 proteins undergo
      oxidation in mitochondria and require the mitochondrial intermembrane space
      assembly (MIA) pathway, which couples the oxidation and import of mitochondrial
      intermembrane space proteins for mitochondrial localization. Detailed analyses
      identified yeast Mic19 in two different redox forms. The form that contains an
      intramolecular disulfide bond is bound to Mic60 of the MICOS complex. Mic19
      oxidation is not essential for its integration into the MICOS complex but plays a
      role in MICOS assembly and the maintenance of the proper inner membrane
      morphology. These findings suggest that Mic19 is a redox-dependent regulator of
      MICOS function.

TI  - Nerve Growth Factor Regulates Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 2 via
      Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Signaling To Enhance Neurite Outgrowth in
      Developing Neurons.
PG  - 4238-52
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00549-15 [doi]
AB  - Neurite outgrowth is key to the formation of functional circuits during neuronal 
      development. Neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), increase neurite
      outgrowth in part by altering the function and expression of Ca(2+)-permeable
      cation channels. Here we report that transient receptor potential vanilloid 2
      (TRPV2) is an intracellular Ca(2+)-permeable TRPV channel upregulated by NGF via 
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway to augment neurite 
      outgrowth. TRPV2 colocalized with Rab7, a late endosome protein, in addition to
      TrkA and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in neurites,
      indicating that the channel is closely associated with signaling endosomes. In
      line with these results, we showed that TRPV2 acts as an ERK substrate and
      identified the motifs necessary for phosphorylation of TRPV2 by ERK. Furthermore,
      neurite length, TRPV2 expression, and TRPV2-mediated Ca(2+) signals were reduced 
      by mutagenesis of these key ERK phosphorylation sites. Based on these findings,
      we identified a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which ERK controls
      TRPV2-mediated Ca(2+) signals in developing neurons and further establish TRPV2
      as a critical intracellular ion channel in neuronal function.

TI  - PAK1 and CtBP1 Regulate the Coupling of Neuronal Activity to Muscle Chromatin and
      Gene Expression.
PG  - 4110-20
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00354-15 [doi]
AB  - Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) expression in innervated muscle is limited to the
      synaptic region. Neuron-induced electrical activity participates in this
      compartmentalization by promoting the repression of AChR expression in the
      extrasynaptic regions. Here, we show that the corepressor CtBP1 (C-terminal
      binding protein 1) is present on the myogenin promoter together with repressive
      histone marks. shRNA-mediated downregulation of CtBP1 expression is sufficient to
      derepress myogenin and AChR expression in innervated muscle. Upon denervation,
      CtBP1 is displaced from the myogenin promoter and relocates to the cytoplasm,
      while repressive histone marks are replaced by activating ones concomitantly to
      the activation of myogenin expression. We also observed that upon denervation the
      p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) expression is upregulated, suggesting that
      phosphorylation by PAK1 may be involved in the relocation of CtBP1. Indeed,
      preventing CtBP1 Ser158 phosphorylation induces CtBP1 accumulation in the nuclei 
      and abrogates the activation of myogenin and AChR expression. Altogether, these
      findings reveal a molecular mechanism to account for the coordinated control of
      chromatin modifications and muscle gene expression by presynaptic neurons via a
      PAK1/CtBP1 pathway.

TI  - Histone Acetylation near the Nucleosome Dyad Axis Enhances Nucleosome Disassembly
      by RSC and SWI/SNF.
PG  - 4083-92
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00441-15 [doi]
AB  - Signaling associated with transcription activation occurs through
      posttranslational modification of histones and is best exemplified by lysine
      acetylation. Lysines are acetylated in histone tails and the core domain/lateral 
      surface of histone octamers. While acetylated lysines in histone tails are
      frequently recognized by other factors referred to as "readers," which promote
      transcription, the mechanistic role of the modifications in the lateral surface
      of the histone octamer remains unclear. By using X-ray crystallography, we found 
      that acetylated lysines 115 and 122 in histone H3 are solvent accessible, but in 
      biochemical assays they appear not to interact with the bromodomains of SWI/SNF
      and RSC to enhance recruitment or nucleosome mobilization, as previously shown
      for acetylated lysines in H3 histone tails. Instead, we found that acetylation of
      lysines 115 and 122 increases the predisposition of nucleosomes for disassembly
      by SWI/SNF and RSC up to 7-fold, independent of bromodomains, and only in
      conjunction with contiguous nucleosomes. Thus, in combination with SWI/SNF and
      RSC, acetylation of lateral surface lysines in the histone octamer serves as a
      crucial regulator of nucleosomal dynamics distinct from the histone code readers 
      and writers.

TI  - Genomic Determinants of THAP11/ZNF143/HCFC1 Complex Recruitment to Chromatin.
PG  - 4135-46
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00477-15 [doi]
AB  - The THAP11 and ZNF143 transcription factors recognize overlapping DNA sequences
      and are reported to exhibit signs of both competitive and cooperative binding.
      HCFC1 serves as a scaffold protein, bridging interactions between transcription
      factors, including THAP11 and ZNF143, and transcriptional coregulators. The exact
      mechanism of how DNA sequences guide the recruitment of the THAP11/ZNF143/HCFC1
      complex to chromatin is still controversial. In this study, we use chromosomally 
      integrated synthetic constructs and clustered regularly interspaced short
      palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated approaches in intact cells to elucidate
      the role of the DNA sequence in the recruitment of this complex and to establish 
      its biological relevance. We show that the ACTACA submotif, shared by both THAP11
      and ZNF143, directs the recruitment of THAP11 and HCFC1 to ZNF143-occupied loci. 
      Importantly, its position, spacing, and orientation relative to the ZNF143 core
      motif are critical for this action. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated alterations of the
      ACTACA submotif at endogenous promoters recapitulated results obtained with
      synthetic constructs and resulted in altered gene transcription and histone
      modifications at targeted promoters. Our in vivo approaches provide strong
      evidence for the molecular role of the ACTACA submotif in THAP11, ZNF143, and
      HCFC1 cooperative recruitment to chromatin and its biological role in target gene
      expression.

TI  - p21-Activated Kinase 2 Regulates Endothelial Development and Function through the
      Bmk1/Erk5 Pathway.
PG  - 3990-4005
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00630-15 [doi]
AB  - p21-activated kinases (Paks) have been shown to regulate cytoskeleton
      rearrangements, cell proliferation, attachment, and migration in a variety of
      cellular contexts, including endothelial cells. However, the role of endothelial 
      Pak in embryo development has not been reported, and currently, there is no
      consensus on the endothelial function of individual Pak isoforms, in particular
      p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2), the main Pak isoform expressed in endothelial
      cells. In this work, we employ genetic and molecular studies that show that Pak2,
      but not Pak1, is a critical mediator of development and maintenance of
      endothelial cell function. Endothelial depletion of Pak2 leads to early embryo
      lethality due to flawed blood vessel formation in the embryo body and yolk sac.
      In adult endothelial cells, Pak2 depletion leads to severe apoptosis and acute
      angiogenesis defects, and in adult mice, endothelial Pak2 deletion leads to
      increased vascular permeability. Furthermore, ubiquitous Pak2 deletion is lethal 
      in adult mice. We show that many of these defects are mediated through a newly
      unveiled Pak2/Bmk1 pathway. Our results demonstrate that endothelial Pak2 is
      essential during embryogenesis and also for adult blood vessel maintenance, and
      they also pinpoint the Bmk1/Erk5 pathway as a critical mediator of endothelial
      Pak2 signaling.

TI  - Loss of PTPN12 Stimulates Progression of ErbB2-Dependent Breast Cancer by
      Enhancing Cell Survival, Migration, and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.
PG  - 4069-82
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00741-15 [doi]
AB  - PTPN12 is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) reported to be a tumor
      suppressor in breast cancer, through its capacity to dephosphorylate oncogenic
      receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as ErbB2. However, the precise
      molecular and cellular impact of PTPN12 deficiency in breast cancer progression
      remains to be fully clarified. Here, we addressed this issue by examining the
      effect of PTPN12 deficiency on breast cancer progression in vivo, in a mouse
      model of ErbB2-dependent breast cancer using a conditional PTPN12-deficient
      mouse. Our studies showed that lack of PTPN12 in breast epithelial cells
      accelerated breast cancer development and lung metastases in vivo.
      PTPN12-deficient breast cancer cells displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation 
      of the adaptor Cas, the adaptor paxillin, and the kinase Pyk2. They exhibited no 
      detectable increase in ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation. PTPN12-deficient cells
      were more resistant to anoikis and had augmented migratory and invasive
      properties. Enhanced migration was corrected by inhibiting Pyk2. PTPN12-deficient
      breast cancer cells also acquired partial features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT), a feature of more aggressive forms of breast cancer. Hence,
      loss of PTPN12 promoted tumor progression in a mouse model of breast cancer,
      supporting the notion that PTPN12 is a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer.
      This function was related to the ability of PTPN12 to suppress cell survival,
      migration, invasiveness, and EMT and to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, 
      Pyk2, and paxillin. These findings enhance our understanding of the role and
      mechanism of action of PTPN12 in the control of breast cancer progression.

TI  - RNA Binding Protein Ptbp2 Is Essential for Male Germ Cell Development.
PG  - 4030-42
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00676-15 [doi]
AB  - RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are increasingly recognized as essential factors in
      tissue development and homeostasis. The polypyrimidine tract binding (PTB)
      protein family of RBPs are important posttranscriptional regulators of gene
      expression. In the nervous system, the function and importance of PTB protein 2
      (Ptbp2) as a key alternative splicing regulator is well established. Ptbp2 is
      also abundantly expressed during spermatogenesis, but its role in this
      developmental program has not been explored. Additionally, the importance of
      alternative splicing regulation in spermatogenesis is unclear. Here, we
      demonstrate that Ptbp2 is essential for spermatogenesis. We also describe an
      improved dual fluorescence flow cytometry strategy to discriminate, quantify, and
      collect germ cells in different stages of development. Using this approach, in
      combination with traditional histological methods, we show that Ptbp2 ablation
      results in germ cell loss due to increased apoptosis of meiotic spermatocytes and
      postmeiotic arrest of spermatid differentiation. Furthermore, we show that Ptbp2 
      is required for alternative splicing regulation in the testis, as in brain.
      Strikingly, not all of the alternatively spliced RNAs examined were sensitive to 
      Ptbp2 loss in both tissues. Collectively, the data provide evidence for an
      important role for alternative splicing regulation in germ cell development and a
      central role for Ptbp2 in this process.

TI  - Regulation of the Mechanism of TWIST1 Transcription by BHLHE40 and BHLHE41 in
      Cancer Cells.
PG  - 4096-109
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00678-15 [doi]
AB  - BHLHE40 and BHLHE41 (BHLHE40/41) are basic helix-loop-helix type transcription
      factors that play key roles in multiple cell behaviors. BHLHE40/41 were recently 
      shown to be involved in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However,
      the precise mechanism of EMT control by BHLHE40/41 remains unclear. In the
      present study, we demonstrated that BHLHE40/41 expression was controlled in a
      pathological stage-dependent manner in human endometrial cancer (HEC). Our in
      vitro assays showed that BHLHE40/41 suppressed tumor cell invasion. BHLHE40/41
      also suppressed the transcription of the EMT effectors SNAI1, SNAI2, and TWIST1. 
      We identified the critical promoter regions of TWIST1 for its basal
      transcriptional activity. We elucidated that the transcription factor SP1 was
      involved in the basal transcriptional activity of TWIST1 and that BHLHE40/41
      competed with SP1 for DNA binding to regulate gene transcription. This study is
      the first to report the detailed functions of BHLHE40 and BHLHE41 in the
      suppression of EMT effectors in vitro. Our results suggest that BHLHE40/41
      suppress tumor cell invasion by inhibiting EMT in tumor cells. We propose that
      BHLHE40/41 are promising markers to predict the aggressiveness of each HEC case
      and that molecular targeting strategies involving BHLHE40/41 and SP1 may
      effectively regulate HEC progression.

TI  - An Organizational Hub of Developmentally Regulated Chromatin Loops in the
      Drosophila Antennapedia Complex.
PG  - 4018-29
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00663-15 [doi]
AB  - Chromatin boundary elements (CBEs) are widely distributed in the genome and
      mediate formation of chromatin loops, but their roles in gene regulation remain
      poorly understood. The complex expression pattern of the Drosophila homeotic gene
      Sex combs reduced (Scr) is directed by an unusually long regulatory sequence
      harboring diverse cis elements and an intervening neighbor gene fushi tarazu
      (ftz). Here we report the presence of a multitude of CBEs in the Scr regulatory
      region. Selective and dynamic pairing among these CBEs mediates developmentally
      regulated chromatin loops. In particular, the SF1 boundary plays a central role
      in organizing two subsets of chromatin loops: one subset encloses ftz, limiting
      its access by the surrounding Scr enhancers and compartmentalizing distinct
      histone modifications, and the other subset subdivides the Scr regulatory
      sequences into independent enhancer access domains. We show that these CBEs
      exhibit diverse enhancer-blocking activities that vary in strength and tissue
      distribution. Tandem pairing of SF1 and SF2, two strong CBEs that flank the ftz
      domain, allows the distal enhancers to bypass their block in transgenic
      Drosophila, providing a mechanism for the endogenous Scr enhancer to circumvent
      the ftz domain. Our study demonstrates how an endogenous CBE network, centrally
      orchestrated by SF1, could remodel the genomic environment to facilitate gene
      regulation during development.

TI  - Independent Mechanisms Target SMCHD1 to Trimethylated Histone H3 Lysine
      9-Modified Chromatin and the Inactive X Chromosome.
PG  - 4053-68
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00432-15 [doi]
AB  - The chromosomal protein SMCHD1 plays an important role in epigenetic silencing at
      diverse loci, including the inactive X chromosome, imprinted genes, and the
      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy locus. Although homology with canonical
      SMC family proteins suggests a role in chromosome organization, the mechanisms
      underlying SMCHD1 function and target site selection remain poorly understood.
      Here we show that SMCHD1 forms an active GHKL-ATPase homodimer, contrasting with 
      canonical SMC complexes, which exist as tripartite ring structures. Electron
      microscopy analysis demonstrates that SMCHD1 homodimers structurally resemble
      prokaryotic condensins. We further show that the principal mechanism for
      chromatin loading of SMCHD1 involves an LRIF1-mediated interaction with HP1gamma 
      at trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3)-modified chromatin sites on the
      chromosome arms. A parallel pathway accounts for chromatin loading at a minority 
      of sites, notably the inactive X chromosome. Together, our results provide key
      insights into SMCHD1 function and target site selection.

PG  - 4043-52
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00742-15 [doi]
AB  - The tRNA methytransferase NSun2 promotes cell proliferation, but the molecular
      mechanism has not been elucidated. Here, we report that NSun2 regulates
      cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) expression in a cell cycle-dependent manner.
      Knockdown of NSun2 decreased the CDK1 protein level, while overexpression of
      NSun2 elevated it without altering CDK1 mRNA levels. Further studies revealed
      that NSun2 methylated CDK1 mRNA in vitro and in cells and that methylation by
      NSun2 enhanced CDK1 translation. Importantly, NSun2-mediated regulation of CDK1
      expression had an impact on the cell division cycle. These results provide new
      insight into the regulation of CDK1 during the cell division cycle.

TI  - Deregulation of Internal Ribosome Entry Site-Mediated p53 Translation in Cancer
      Cells with Defective p53 Response to DNA Damage.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00365-15 [doi]
AB  - Synthesis of the p53 tumor suppressor and its subsequent activation following DNA
      damage are critical for its protection against tumorigenesis. We previously
      discovered an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) at the 5' untranslated region
      of the p53 mRNA. However, the connection between IRES-mediated p53 translation
      and p53's tumor suppressive function is unknown. In this study, we identified two
      p53 IRES trans-acting factors, translational control protein 80 (TCP80), and RNA 
      helicase A (RHA), which positively regulate p53 IRES activity. Overexpression of 
      TCP80 and RHA also leads to increased expression and synthesis of p53.
      Furthermore, we discovered two breast cancer cell lines that retain wild-type p53
      but exhibit defective p53 induction and synthesis following DNA damage. The
      levels of TCP80 and RHA are extremely low in both cell lines, and expression of
      both proteins is required to significantly increase the p53 IRES activity in
      these cells. Moreover, we found cancer cells transfected with a shRNA against
      TCP80 not only exhibit decreased expression of TCP80 and RHA but also display
      defective p53 induction and diminished ability to induce senescence following DNA
      damage. Therefore, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation that
      links deregulation of IRES-mediated p53 translation with tumorigenesis.

TI  - Differential and Concordant Roles for Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 and
      Poly(ADP-Ribose) in Regulating WRN and RECQL5 Activities.
PG  - 3974-89
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00427-15 [doi]
AB  - Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase 1 (PARP1) catalyzes the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation 
      (PARylation) of proteins, a posttranslational modification which forms the
      nucleic acid-like polymer PAR. PARP1 and PAR are integral players in the early
      DNA damage response, since PARylation orchestrates the recruitment of repair
      proteins to sites of damage. Human RecQ helicases are DNA unwinding proteins that
      are critical responders to DNA damage, but how their recruitment and activities
      are regulated by PARPs and PAR is poorly understood. Here we report that all
      human RecQ helicases interact with PAR noncovalently. Furthermore, we define the 
      effects that PARP1, PARylated PARP1, and PAR have on RECQL5 and WRN, using both
      in vitro and in vivo assays. We show that PARylation is involved in the
      recruitment of RECQL5 and WRN to laser-induced DNA damage and that RECQL5 and WRN
      have differential responses to PARylated PARP1 and PAR. Furthermore, we show that
      the loss of RECQL5 or WRN resulted in increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition.
      In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PARP1 and PAR actively, and in some
      instances differentially, regulate the activities and cellular localization of
      RECQL5 and WRN, suggesting that PARylation acts as a fine-tuning mechanism to
      coordinate their functions in time and space during the genotoxic stress
      response.

TI  - Identification by Random Mutagenesis of Functional Domains in KREPB5 That
      Differentially Affect RNA Editing between Life Cycle Stages of Trypanosoma
      brucei.
PG  - 3945-61
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00790-15 [doi]
AB  - KREPB5 is an essential component of approximately 20S editosomes in Trypanosoma
      brucei which contains a degenerate, noncatalytic RNase III domain. To explore the
      function of this protein, we used a novel approach to make and screen numerous
      conditional null T. brucei bloodstream form cell lines that express randomly
      mutagenized KREPB5 alleles. We identified nine single amino acid substitutions
      that could not complement the conditional loss of wild-type KREPB5. Seven of
      these were within the RNase III domain, and two were in the C-terminal region
      that has no homology to known motifs. Exclusive expression of these mutated
      KREPB5 alleles in the absence of wild-type allele expression resulted in growth
      inhibition, the loss of approximately 20S editosomes, and inhibition of RNA
      editing in BF cells. Eight of these mutations were lethal in bloodstream form
      parasites but not in procyclic-form parasites, showing that multiple domains
      function in a life cycle-dependent manner. Amino acid changes at a substantial
      number of positions, including up to 7 per allele, allowed complementation and
      thus did not block KREPB5 function. Hence, the degenerate RNase III domain and a 
      newly identified domain are critical for KREPB5 function and have differential
      effects between the life cycle stages of T. brucei that differentially edit
      mRNAs.

TI  - High CO2 Leads to Na,K-ATPase Endocytosis via c-Jun Amino-Terminal Kinase-Induced
      LMO7b Phosphorylation.
PG  - 3962-73
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00813-15 [doi]
AB  - The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) plays a role in inflammation,
      proliferation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion and cell migration by phosphorylating
      paxillin and beta-catenin. JNK phosphorylation downstream of AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK) activation is required for high CO2 (hypercapnia)-induced
      Na,K-ATPase endocytosis in alveolar epithelial cells. Here, we provide evidence
      that during hypercapnia, JNK promotes the phosphorylation of LMO7b, a scaffolding
      protein, in vitro and in intact cells. LMO7b phosphorylation was blocked by
      exposing the cells to the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and by infecting cells with
      dominant-negative JNK or AMPK adenovirus. The knockdown of the endogenous LMO7b
      or overexpression of mutated LMO7b with alanine substitutions of five potential
      JNK phosphorylation sites (LMO7b-5SA) or only Ser-1295 rescued both LMO7b
      phosphorylation and the hypercapnia-induced Na,K-ATPase endocytosis. Moreover,
      high CO2 promoted the colocalization and interaction of LMO7b and the Na,K-ATPase
      alpha1 subunit at the plasma membrane, which were prevented by SP600125 or by
      transfecting cells with LMO7b-5SA. Collectively, our data suggest that
      hypercapnia leads to JNK-induced LMO7b phosphorylation at Ser-1295, which
      facilitates the interaction of LMO7b with Na,K-ATPase at the plasma membrane
      promoting the endocytosis of Na,K-ATPase in alveolar epithelial cells.

TI  - Global Transcriptome Analysis Reveals That Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1
      Regulates Gene Expression through EZH2.
PG  - 3934-44
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00635-15 [doi]
AB  - Posttranslational modifications, such as poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation),
      regulate chromatin-modifying enzymes, ultimately affecting gene expression. This 
      study explores the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) on global gene
      expression in a lymphoblastoid B cell line. We found that inhibition of PARP
      catalytic activity with olaparib resulted in global gene deregulation, affecting 
      approximately 11% of the genes expressed. Gene ontology analysis revealed that
      PARP could exert these effects through transcription factors and
      chromatin-remodeling enzymes, including the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) 
      member EZH2. EZH2 mediates the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27
      (H3K27me3), a modification associated with chromatin compaction and gene
      silencing. Both pharmacological inhibition of PARP and knockdown of PARP1 induced
      the expression of EZH2, which resulted in increased global H3K27me3. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation confirmed that PARP1 inhibition led to H3K27me3 deposition at
      EZH2 target genes, which resulted in gene silencing. Moreover, increased EZH2
      expression is attributed to the loss of the occupancy of the transcription
      repressor E2F4 at the EZH2 promoter following PARP inhibition. Together, these
      data show that PARP plays an important role in global gene regulation and
      identifies for the first time a direct role of PARP1 in regulating the expression
      and function of EZH2.

TI  - Role of Ostm1 Cytosolic Complex with Kinesin 5B in Intracellular Dispersion and
      Trafficking.
PG  - 507-21
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00656-15 [doi]
AB  - In humans and in mice, mutations in the Ostm1 gene cause the most severe form of 
      osteopetrosis, a major bone disease, and neuronal degeneration, both of which are
      associated with early death. To gain insight into Ostm1 function, we first
      investigated by sequence and biochemical analysis an immature 34-kDa type I
      transmembrane Ostm1 protein with a unique cytosolic tail. Mature Ostm1 is
      posttranslationally processed and highly N-glycosylated and has an apparent mass 
      of approximately 60 kDa. Analysis the subcellular localization of Ostm1 showed
      that it is within the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and
      endosomes/lysosomes. By a wide protein screen under physiologic conditions,
      several novel cytosolic Ostm1 partners were identified and validated, for which a
      direct interaction with the kinesin 5B heavy chains was demonstrated. These
      results determined that Ostm1 is part of a cytosolic scaffolding multiprotein
      complex, imparting an adaptor function to Ostm1. Moreover, we uncovered a role
      for the Ostm1/KIF5B complex in intracellular trafficking and dispersion of cargos
      from the endoplasmic reticulum to late endosomal/lysosomal subcellular
      compartments. These Ostm1 molecular and cellular functions could elucidate all of
      the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the wide phenotypic spectrum of
      Ostm1-deficient mice.

TI  - Binding of the Extracellular Eight-Cysteine Motif of Opy2 to the Putative
      Osmosensor Msb2 Is Essential for Activation of the Yeast High-Osmolarity Glycerol
      Pathway.
PG  - 475-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00853-15 [doi]
AB  - To adapt to environmental high osmolarity, the budding yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae activates the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which regulates
      diverse osmoadaptive responses. Hog1 is activated through the high-osmolarity
      glycerol (HOG) pathway, which consists of independent upstream signaling routes
      termed the SLN1 branch and the SHO1 branch. Here, we report that the
      extracellular cysteine-rich (CR) domain of the transmembrane-anchor protein Opy2 
      binds to the Hkr1-Msb2 homology (HMH) domain of the putative osmosensor Msb2 and 
      that formation of the Opy2-Msb2 complex is essential for osmotic activation of
      Hog1 through the MSB2 subbranch of the SHO1 branch. By analyzing the phenotypes
      of mutants with Opy2 cysteine-to-alanine mutations, we deduced that the CR domain
      forms four intramolecular disulfide bonds. To probe for the potential induction
      of conformational changes in the Opy2-Msb2 complex by osmostress, we constructed 
      mutants with a site-specific Cys-to-Ala mutation of the Opy2 CR domain and
      mutants with a Cys substitution of the Msb2 HMH domain. Each of these mutants had
      a reduced cysteine. These mutants were then combinatorially cross-linked using
      chemical cross-linkers of different lengths. Cross-linking between Opy2 Cys48 and
      Msb2 Cys1023 was sensitive to osmotic changes, suggesting that osmostress induced
      a conformational change. We therefore propose that the Opy2-Msb2 complex might
      serve as an osmosensor.

TI  - Essential Nonredundant Function of the Catalytic Activity of Histone Deacetylase 
      2 in Mouse Development.
PG  - 462-74
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00639-15 [doi]
AB  - The class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC2 play partially redundant
      roles in the regulation of gene expression and mouse development. As part of
      multisubunit corepressor complexes, these two deacetylases exhibit both enzymatic
      and nonenzymatic functions. To examine the impact of the catalytic activities of 
      HDAC1 and HDAC2, we generated knock-in mice expressing catalytically inactive
      isoforms, which are still incorporated into the HDAC1/HDAC2 corepressor
      complexes. Surprisingly, heterozygous mice expressing catalytically inactive
      HDAC2 die within a few hours after birth, while heterozygous HDAC1 mutant mice
      are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Heterozygous HDAC2 mutant mice 
      show an unaltered composition but reduced associated deacetylase activity of
      corepressor complexes and exhibit a more severe phenotype than HDAC2-null mice.
      They display changes in brain architecture accompanied by premature expression of
      the key regulator protein kinase C delta. Our study reveals a dominant negative
      effect of catalytically inactive HDAC2 on specific corepressor complexes
      resulting in histone hyperacetylation, transcriptional derepression, and,
      ultimately, perinatal lethality.

TI  - LMO2 Oncoprotein Stability in T-Cell Leukemia Requires Direct LDB1 Binding.
PG  - 488-506
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00901-15 [doi]
AB  - LMO2 is a component of multisubunit DNA-binding transcription factor complexes
      that regulate gene expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell
      development. Enforced expression of LMO2 causes leukemia by inducing
      hematopoietic stem cell-like features in T-cell progenitor cells, but the
      biochemical mechanisms of LMO2 function have not been fully elucidated. In this
      study, we systematically dissected the LMO2/LDB1-binding interface to investigate
      the role of this interaction in T-cell leukemia. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of 
      the LIM interaction domain of LDB1 revealed a discrete motif, R(320)LITR,
      required for LMO2 binding. Most strikingly, coexpression of full-length,
      wild-type LDB1 increased LMO2 steady-state abundance, whereas coexpression of
      mutant proteins deficient in LMO2 binding compromised LMO2 stability. These
      mutant LDB1 proteins also exerted dominant negative effects on growth and
      transcription in diverse leukemic cell lines. Mass spectrometric analysis of LDB1
      binding partners in leukemic lines supports the notion that LMO2/LDB1 function in
      leukemia occurs in the context of multisubunit complexes, which also protect the 
      LMO2 oncoprotein from degradation. Collectively, these data suggest that the
      assembly of LMO2 into complexes, via direct LDB1 interaction, is a potential
      molecular target that could be exploited in LMO2-driven leukemias resistant to
      existing chemotherapy regimens.

TI  - Natural Functions of PLIN2 Mediating Wnt/LiCl Signaling and Glycogen Synthase
      Kinase 3 (GSK3)/GSK3 Substrate-Related Effects Are Modulated by Lipid.
PG  - 421-37
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00510-15 [doi]
AB  - Belonging to the PLIN family, PLIN2 associates with lipid storage droplets
      (LSDs), but other functions of PLIN2 remain unclear. Here, we suggest that PLIN2 
      mediates Wnt signaling because PLIN2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppresses
      activation of Wnt/coreceptor pathways. The mediation in the Wnt/Frizzled pathway 
      seems to occur from Dishevelleds to axin/glycogen synthase kinase
      3(GSK3)/beta-catenin complexes (AGbetaC) as Wnt decreases Dishevelled/PLIN2 but
      increases AGbetaC/PLIN2 associations. Augmenting cellular LSDs that affect PLIN2 
      associations with these proteins, oleic acid (OA) treatment inhibits
      Wnt-increased AGbetaC/PLIN2 associations and beta-catenin T-cell factor signaling
      (beta-CTS). Revealing that PLIN2 is a GSK3-associated protein, the study explored
      PLIN2-mediated effects on GSK3/GSK3 substrates. PLIN2 siRNA reduces inhibitory
      GSK3 levels and lithium chloride (LiCl)-upregulated beta-catenin or
      CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (c/EBPalpha) expression. OA treatment
      decreases LiCl-increased c/EBPalpha via PLIN2-c/EBPalpha dissociation. In
      addition to PLIN2 overexpression increasing beta-CTS, PLIN2 depletion or
      overexpression drops or adds expression of GSK3 substrates, such as beta-catenin,
      c/EBPalpha,c-Myc, cyclin D1, and insulin receptor substrate 1, and cell
      growth/survival. PLIN2 N or C terminus overexpression that is associated with
      higher levels of the substrates suggests that those substrates bind to specific
      regions of PLIN2. Mimicking the possible high lipid concentrations in cells in
      the human body under conditions of hyperlipidemia/obesity, OA-treated cells gain 
      or reduce GSK3 substrate expression in parallel with a decrease (a Wnt-like
      effect) or increase in GSK3 activity, likely regulated by GSK3/PLIN2/GSK3
      substrate associations.

TI  - Tet1 and Tet2 Protect DNA Methylation Canyons against Hypermethylation.
PG  - 452-61
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00587-15 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification with an important role in
      cell fate specification and reprogramming. The Ten eleven translocation (Tet)
      family of enzymes converts 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which
      promotes passive DNA demethylation and functions as an intermediate in an active 
      DNA demethylation process. Tet1/Tet2 double-knockout mice are characterized by
      developmental defects and epigenetic instability, suggesting a requirement for
      Tet-mediated DNA demethylation for the proper regulation of gene expression
      during differentiation. Here, we used whole-genome bisulfite and transcriptome
      sequencing to characterize the underlying mechanisms. Our results uncover the
      hypermethylation of DNA methylation canyons as the genomic key feature of
      Tet1/Tet2 double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Canyon hypermethylation
      coincided with disturbed regulation of associated genes, suggesting a mechanistic
      explanation for the observed Tet-dependent differentiation defects. Based on
      these results, we propose an important regulatory role of Tet-dependent DNA
      demethylation for the maintenance of DNA methylation canyons, which prevents
      invasive DNA methylation and allows functional regulation of canyon-associated
      genes.

TI  - p53 Restoration in Induction and Maintenance of Senescence: Differential Effects 
      in Premalignant and Malignant Tumor Cells.
PG  - 438-51
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00747-15 [doi]
AB  - The restoration of p53 has been suggested as a therapeutic approach in tumors.
      However, the timing of p53 restoration in relation to its efficacy during tumor
      progression still is unclear. We now show that the restoration of p53 in murine
      premalignant proliferating pineal lesions resulted in cellular senescence, while 
      p53 restoration in invasive pineal tumors did not. The effectiveness of p53
      restoration was not dependent on p19(Arf) expression but showed an inverse
      correlation with Mdm2 expression. In tumor cells, p53 restoration became
      effective when paired with either DNA-damaging therapy or with nutlin, an
      inhibitor of p53-Mdm2 interaction. Interestingly, the inactivation of p53 after
      senescence resulted in reentry into the cell cycle and rapid tumor progression.
      The evaluation of a panel of human supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal
      tumors (sPNET) showed low activity of the p53 pathway. Together, these data
      suggest that the restoration of the p53 pathway has different effects in
      premalignant versus invasive pineal tumors, and that p53 activation needs to be
      continually sustained, as reversion from senescence occurs rapidly with
      aggressive tumor growth when p53 is lost again. Finally, p53 restoration
      approaches may be worth exploring in sPNET, where the p53 gene is intact but the 
      pathway is inactive in the majority of examined tumors.

TI  - The Mediator Subunit MED16 Transduces NRF2-Activating Signals into Antioxidant
      Gene Expression.
PG  - 407-20
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00785-15 [doi]
AB  - The KEAP1-NRF2 system plays a central role in cytoprotection. NRF2 is stabilized 
      in response to electrophiles and activates transcription of antioxidant genes.
      Although robust induction of NRF2 target genes confers resistance to oxidative
      insults, how NRF2 triggers transcriptional activation after binding to DNA has
      not been elucidated. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying
      NRF2-dependent transcriptional activation, we purified the NRF2 nuclear protein
      complex and identified the Mediator subunits as NRF2 cofactors. Among them, MED16
      directly associated with NRF2. Disruption of Med16 significantly attenuated the
      electrophile-induced expression of NRF2 target genes but did not affect
      hypoxia-induced gene expression, suggesting a specific requirement for MED16 in
      NRF2-dependent transcription. Importantly, we found that 75% of NRF2-activated
      genes exhibited blunted inductions by electrophiles in Med16-deficient cells
      compared to wild-type cells, which strongly argues that MED16 is a major
      contributor supporting NRF2-dependent transcriptional activation. NRF2-dependent 
      phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain was absent in
      Med16-deficient cells, suggesting that MED16 serves as a conduit to transmit
      NRF2-activating signals to RNA polymerase II. MED16 indeed turned out to be
      essential for cytoprotection against oxidative insults. Thus, the
      KEAP1-NRF2-MED16 axis has emerged as a new regulatory pathway mediating the
      antioxidant response through the robust activation of NRF2 target genes.

TI  - Inhibition of Acid Sphingomyelinase Depletes Cellular Phosphatidylserine and
      Mislocalizes K-Ras from the Plasma Membrane.
PG  - 363-74
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00719-15 [doi]
AB  - K-Ras must localize to the plasma membrane for biological activity; thus,
      preventing plasma membrane interaction blocks K-Ras signal output. Here we show
      that inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) mislocalizes both the K-Ras
      isoforms K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B from the plasma membrane to the endomembrane and
      inhibits their nanoclustering. We found that fendiline, a potent ASM inhibitor,
      reduces the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and cholesterol content of the inner
      plasma membrane. These lipid changes are causative because supplementation of
      fendiline-treated cells with exogenous PtdSer rapidly restores K-Ras4A and
      K-Ras4B plasma membrane binding, nanoclustering, and signal output. Conversely,
      supplementation with exogenous cholesterol restores K-Ras4A but not K-Ras4B
      nanoclustering. These experiments reveal different operational pools of PtdSer on
      the plasma membrane. Inhibition of ASM elevates cellular sphingomyelin and
      reduces cellular ceramide levels. Concordantly, delivery of recombinant ASM or
      exogenous ceramide to fendiline-treated cells rapidly relocalizes K-Ras4B and
      PtdSer to the plasma membrane. K-Ras4B mislocalization is also recapitulated in
      ASM-deficient Neimann-Pick type A and B fibroblasts. This study identifies
      sphingomyelin metabolism as an indirect regulator of K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B
      signaling through the control of PtdSer plasma membrane content. It also
      demonstrates the critical and selective importance of PtdSer to K-Ras4A and
      K-Ras4B plasma membrane binding and nanoscale spatial organization.

      Obesity-Induced Brown Adipose Tissue Dysfunction and Metabolic Dysregulation.
PG  - 376-93
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00430-15 [doi]
AB  - Angiogenesis is a central regulator for white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose
      tissue adaptation in the course of obesity. Here we show that deletion of
      hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2alpha) in adipocytes (by using Fabp4-Cre
      transgenic mice) but not in myeloid or endothelial cells negatively impacted WAT 
      angiogenesis and promoted WAT inflammation, WAT dysfunction, hepatosteatosis, and
      systemic insulin resistance in obesity. Importantly, adipocyte HIF2alpha
      regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and angiogenesis
      of obese BAT as well as its thermogenic function. Consistently, obese
      adipocyte-specific HIF2alpha-deficient mice displayed BAT dysregulation,
      associated with reduced levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and a dysfunctional
      thermogenic response to cold exposure. VEGF administration reversed WAT and BAT
      inflammation and BAT dysfunction in adipocyte HIF2alpha-deficient mice. Together,
      our findings show that adipocyte HIF2alpha is protective against maladaptation to
      obesity and metabolic dysregulation by promoting angiogenesis in both WAT and BAT
      and by counteracting obesity-mediated BAT dysfunction.

TI  - UV Damage-Induced Phosphorylation of HBO1 Triggers CRL4DDB2-Mediated Degradation 
      To Regulate Cell Proliferation.
PG  - 394-406
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00809-15 [doi]
AB  - Histone acetyltransferase binding to ORC-1 (HBO1) is a critically important
      histone acetyltransferase for forming the prereplicative complex (pre-RC) at the 
      replication origin. Pre-RC formation is completed by loading of the MCM2-7
      heterohexameric complex, which functions as a helicase in DNA replication. HBO1
      recruited to the replication origin by CDT1 acetylates histone H4 to relax the
      chromatin conformation and facilitates loading of the MCM complex onto
      replication origins. However, the acetylation status and mechanism of regulation 
      of histone H3 at replication origins remain elusive. HBO1 positively regulates
      cell proliferation under normal cell growth conditions. Whether HBO1 regulates
      proliferation in response to DNA damage is poorly understood. In this study, we
      demonstrated that HBO1 was degraded after DNA damage to suppress cell
      proliferation. Ser50 and Ser53 of HBO1 were phosphorylated in an ATM/ATR DNA
      damage sensor-dependent manner after UV treatment. ATM/ATR-dependently
      phosphorylated HBO1 preferentially interacted with DDB2 and was ubiquitylated by 
      CRL4(DDB2). Replacement of endogenous HBO1 in Ser50/53Ala mutants maintained
      acetylation of histone H3K14 and impaired cell cycle regulation in response to UV
      irradiation. Our findings demonstrate that HBO1 is one of the targets in the DNA 
      damage checkpoint. These results show that ubiquitin-dependent control of the
      HBO1 protein contributes to cell survival during UV irradiation.

TI  - A p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Regulated Myocyte Enhancer Factor
      2-beta-Catenin Interaction Enhances Canonical Wnt Signaling.
PG  - 330-46
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00832-15 [doi]
AB  - Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a major role in various biological
      contexts, such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, and cancer
      progression. Previously, a connection between p38 mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) signaling and Wnt-mediated activation of beta-catenin was implied
      but poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated potential cross talk
      between p38 MAPK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Here we show that a loss of p38 
      MAPK alpha/beta function reduces beta-catenin nuclear accumulation in
      Wnt3a-stimulated primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Conversely, active
      p38 MAPK signaling increases beta-catenin nuclear localization and target gene
      activity in multiple cell types. Furthermore, the effect of p38 MAPK alpha/beta
      on beta-catenin activity is mediated through phosphorylation of a key p38 MAPK
      target, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Here we report a p38 MAPK-mediated,
      phosphorylation-dependent interaction between MEF2 and beta-catenin in multiple
      cell types and primary VSMCs that results in (i) increased beta-catenin nuclear
      retention, which is reversed by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated MEF2 gene 
      silencing; (ii) increased activation of MEF2 and Wnt/beta-catenin target genes;
      and (iii) increased Wnt-stimulated cell proliferation. These observations provide
      mechanistic insight into a fundamental level of cross talk between p38 MAPK/MEF2 
      signaling and canonical Wnt signaling.

TI  - Filamin A Expression Negatively Regulates Sphingosine-1-Phosphate-Induced
      NF-kappaB Activation in Melanoma Cells by Inhibition of Akt Signaling.
PG  - 320-9
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00554-15 [doi]
AB  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid mediator that regulates many
      processes in inflammation and cancer. S1P is a ligand for five G-protein-coupled 
      receptors, S1PR1 to -5, and also has important intracellular actions. Previously,
      we showed that intracellular S1P is involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF)-induced NF-kappaB activation in melanoma cell lines that express filamin A 
      (FLNA). Here, we show that extracellular S1P activates NF-kappaB only in melanoma
      cells that lack FLNA. In these cells, S1P, but not TNF, promotes IkappaB kinase
      (IKK) and p65 phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p65 nuclear
      translocation, and NF-kappaB reporter activity. NF-kappaB activation induced by
      S1P was mediated via S1PR1 and S1PR2. Exogenous S1P enhanced the phosphorylation 
      of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), and its downregulation reduced S1P-induced
      the phosphorylation of IKK and p65. In addition, silencing of Bcl10 also
      inhibited S1P-induced IKK phosphorylation. Surprisingly, S1P reduced Akt
      activation in melanoma cells that express FLNA, whereas in the absence of FLNA,
      high phosphorylation levels of Akt were maintained, enabling S1P-mediated
      NF-kappaB signaling. In accord, inhibition of Akt suppressed S1P-mediated IKK and
      p65 phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Hence, these results support
      a negative role of FLNA in S1P-mediated NF-kappaB activation in melanoma cells
      through modulation of Akt.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00920-15 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria are vital and highly dynamic organelles that continuously fuse and
      divide to maintain mitochondrial quality. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs
      cellular integrity and is known to be associated with various human diseases.
      However, the mechanism by which the quality of mitochondria is maintained remains
      largely unexplored. Here we show that impaired proteasome function recovers the
      growth of yeast cells lacking Fzo1, a pivotal protein for mitochondrial fusion.
      Decreased proteasome activity increased the mitochondrial oxidoreductase protein 
      Mia40 and the ratio of the short isoform of mitochondrial intermembrane protein
      Mgm1 (s-Mgm1) to the long isoform (l-Mgm1). The increase in Mia40 restored
      mitochondrial membrane potential, while the increase in the s-Mgm1/l-Mgm1 ratio
      promoted mitochondrial fusion in an Fzo1-independent manner. Our findings
      demonstrate a new pathway for mitochondrial quality control that is induced by
      proteasome impairment.

TI  - Coordination of RNA Polymerase II Pausing and 3' End Processing Factor
      Recruitment with Alternative Polyadenylation.
PG  - 295-303
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00898-15 [doi]
AB  - Most mammalian genes produce transcripts whose 3' ends are processed at multiple 
      alternative positions by cleavage/polyadenylation (CPA). Poly(A) site cleavage
      frequently occurs cotranscriptionally and is facilitated by CPA factor binding to
      the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylated on Ser2
      residues of its heptad repeats (YS2PTSPS). The function of cotranscriptional
      events in the selection of alternative poly(A) sites is poorly understood. We
      investigated Pol II pausing, CTD Ser2 phosphorylation, and processing factor CstF
      recruitment at wild-type and mutant IgM transgenes that use alternative poly(A)
      sites to produce mRNAs encoding the secreted and membrane-bound forms of the
      immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain. The results show that the sites of Pol II
      pausing and processing factor recruitment change depending on which poly(A) site 
      is utilized. In contrast, the extent of Pol II CTD Ser2 phosphorylation does not 
      closely correlate with poly(A) site selection. We conclude that changes in
      properties of the transcription elongation complex closely correlate with
      utilization of different poly(A) sites, suggesting that cotranscriptional events 
      may influence the decision between alternative modes of pre-mRNA 3' end
      processing.

TI  - A MARCH6 and IDOL E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Circuit Uncouples Cholesterol Synthesis
      from Lipoprotein Uptake in Hepatocytes.
PG  - 285-94
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00890-15 [doi]
AB  - Cholesterol synthesis and lipoprotein uptake are tightly coordinated to ensure
      that the cellular level of cholesterol is adequately maintained. Hepatic
      dysregulation of these processes is associated with pathological conditions, most
      notably cardiovascular disease. Using a genetic approach, we have recently
      identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 as a regulator of cholesterol
      biosynthesis, owing to its ability to promote degradation of the rate-limiting
      enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and squalene
      epoxidase (SQLE). Here, we present evidence for MARCH6 playing a multifaceted
      role in the control of cholesterol homeostasis in hepatocytes. We identify MARCH6
      as an endogenous inhibitor of the sterol regulatory element binding protein
      (SREBP) transcriptional program. Accordingly, loss of MARCH6 increases expression
      of SREBP-regulated genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipoprotein
      uptake. Unexpectedly, this is associated with a decrease in cellular lipoprotein 
      uptake, induced by enhanced lysosomal degradation of the low-density lipoprotein 
      receptor (LDLR). Finally, we provide evidence that induction of the E3 ubiquitin 
      ligase IDOL represents the molecular mechanism underlying this MARCH6-induced
      phenotype. Our study thus highlights a MARCH6-dependent mechanism to direct
      cellular cholesterol accretion that relies on uncoupling of cholesterol synthesis
      from lipoprotein uptake.

TI  - The Poly(C) Binding Protein Pcbp2 and Its Retrotransposed Derivative Pcbp1 Are
      Independently Essential to Mouse Development.
PG  - 304-19
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00936-15 [doi]
AB  - RNA-binding proteins participate in a complex array of posttranscriptional
      controls essential to cell type specification and somatic development. Despite
      their detailed biochemical characterizations, the degree to which each
      RNA-binding protein impacts mammalian embryonic development remains incompletely 
      defined, and the level of functional redundancy among subsets of these proteins
      remains open to question. The poly(C) binding proteins, PCBPs (alphaCPs and hnRNP
      E proteins), are encoded by a highly conserved and broadly expressed gene family.
      The two major Pcbp isoforms, Pcbp2 and Pcbp1, are robustly expressed in a wide
      range of tissues and exert both nuclear and cytoplasmic controls over gene
      expression. Here, we report that Pcbp1-null embryos are rendered nonviable in the
      peri-implantation stage. In contrast, Pcbp2-null embryos undergo normal
      development until midgestation (12.5 to 13.5 days postcoitum), at which time they
      undergo a dramatic loss in viability associated with combined cardiovascular and 
      hematopoietic abnormalities. Mice heterozygous for either Pcbp1 or Pcbp2 null
      alleles display a mild and nondisruptive defect in initial postpartum weight
      gain. These data reveal that Pcbp1 and Pcbp2 are individually essential for mouse
      embryonic development and have distinct impacts on embryonic viability and that
      Pcpb2 has a nonredundant in vivo role in hematopoiesis. These data further
      provide direct evidence that Pcbp1, a retrotransposed derivative of Pcpb2, has
      evolved an essential function(s) in the mammalian genome.

AB  - Crk and CrkL are noncatalytic adaptor proteins necessary for the formation of
      neuromuscular synapses which function downstream of muscle-specific kinase
      (MuSK), a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in skeletal muscle, and the MuSK
      binding protein Dok-7. How Crk/CrkL regulate neuromuscular endplate formation is 
      not known. To better understand the roles of Crk/CrkL, we identified CrkL binding
      proteins using mass spectrometry and have identified Sorbs1 and Sorbs2 as two
      functionally redundant proteins that associate with the initiating
      MuSK/Dok-7/Crk/CrkL complex, regulate acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering in
      vitro, and are localized at synapses in vivo.

TI  - Characterizations of Three Major Cysteine Sensors of Keap1 in Stress Response.
PG  - 271-84
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00868-15 [doi]
AB  - The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a central role in cytoprotection against
      electrophilic/oxidative stresses. Although Cys151, Cys273, and Cys288 of Keap1
      are major sensor cysteine residues for detecting these stresses, it has not been 
      technically feasible to evaluate the functionality of Cys273 or Cys288, since
      Keap1 mutants that harbor substitutions in these residues and maintain the
      ability to repress Nrf2 accumulation do not exist. To overcome this problem, we
      systematically introduced amino acid substitutions into Cys273/Cys288 and finally
      identified Cys273Trp and Cys288Glu mutations that do not affect Keap1's ability
      to repress Nrf2 accumulation. Utilizing these Keap1 mutants, we generated stable 
      murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines and knock-in mouse lines. Our
      analyses with the MEFs and peritoneal macrophages from the knock-in mice revealed
      that three major cysteine residues, Cys151, Cys273, and Cys288, individually
      and/or redundantly act as sensors. Based on the functional necessity of these
      three cysteine residues, we categorized chemical inducers of Nrf2 into four
      classes. Class I and II utilizes Cys151 and Cys288, respectively, while class III
      requires all three residues (Cys151/Cys273/Cys288), while class IV inducers
      function independently of all three of these cysteine residues. This study thus
      demonstrates that Keap1 utilizes multiple cysteine residues specifically and/or
      collaboratively as sensors for the detection of a wide range of environmental
      stresses.

TI  - Tristetraprolin Recruits Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E2 To Repress Translation 
      of AU-Rich Element-Containing mRNAs.
PG  - 3921-32
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00845-15 [doi]
AB  - Tristetraprolin (TTP) regulates the expression of AU-rich element-containing
      mRNAs through promoting the degradation and repressing the translation of target 
      mRNA. While the mechanism for promoting target mRNA degradation has been
      extensively studied, the mechanism underlying translational repression is not
      well established. Here, we show that TTP recruits eukaryotic initiation factor
      4E2 (eIF4E2) to repress target mRNA translation. TTP interacted with eIF4E2 but
      not with eIF4E. Overexpression of eIF4E2 enhanced TTP-mediated translational
      repression, and downregulation of endogenous eIF4E2 or overexpression of a
      truncation mutant of eIF4E2 impaired TTP-mediated translational repression.
      Overexpression of an eIF4E2 mutant that lost the cap-binding activity also
      impaired TTP's activity, suggesting that the cap-binding activity of eIF4E2 is
      important in TTP-mediated translational repression. We further show that TTP
      promoted eIF4E2 binding to target mRNA. These results imply that TTP recruits
      eIF4E2 to compete with eIF4E to repress the translation of target mRNA. This
      notion is supported by the finding that downregulation of endogenous eIF4E2
      increased the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) protein
      without affecting the mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. Collectively, these results
      uncover a novel mechanism by which TTP represses target mRNA translation.

PG  - 3800-9
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00512-15 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 technology has rapidly changed the landscape for how biologists and
      bioengineers study and manipulate the genome. Derived from the bacterial adaptive
      immune system, CRISPR-Cas9 has been coopted and repurposed for a variety of new
      functions, including the activation or repression of gene expression (termed
      CRISPRa or CRISPRi, respectively). This represents an exciting alternative to
      previously used repression or activation technologies such as RNA interference
      (RNAi) or the use of gene overexpression vectors. We have only just begun
      exploring the possibilities that CRISPR technology offers for gene regulation and
      the control of cell identity and behavior. In this review, we describe the recent
      advances of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for gene regulation and outline advantages and
      disadvantages of CRISPRa and CRISPRi (CRISPRa/i) relative to alternative
      technologies.

TI  - Histone H3 Lysine 36 Trimethylation Is Established over the Xist Promoter by
      Antisense Tsix Transcription and Contributes to Repressing Xist Expression.
PG  - 3909-20
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00561-15 [doi]
AB  - One of the two X chromosomes in female mammals is inactivated by the noncoding
      Xist RNA. In mice, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is regulated by the antisense 
      RNA Tsix, which represses Xist on the active X chromosome. In the absence of
      Tsix, PRC2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is established
      over the Xist promoter. Simultaneous disruption of Tsix and PRC2 leads to
      derepression of Xist and in turn silencing of the single X chromosome in male
      embryonic stem cells. Here, we identified histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation
      (H3K36me3) as a modification that is recruited by Tsix cotranscriptionally and
      extends over the Xist promoter. Reduction of H3K36me3 by expression of a mutated 
      histone H3.3 with a substitution of methionine for lysine at position 36 causes a
      significant derepression of Xist. Moreover, depletion of the H3K36 methylase
      Setd2 leads to upregulation of Xist, suggesting H3K36me3 as a modification that
      contributes to the mechanism of Tsix function in regulating XCI. Furthermore, we 
      found that reduction of H3K36me3 does not facilitate an increase in H3K27me3 over
      the Xist promoter, indicating that additional mechanisms exist by which Tsix
      blocks PRC2 recruitment to the Xist promoter.

TI  - AMPK Promotes Aberrant PGC1beta Expression To Support Human Colon Tumor Cell
      Survival.
PG  - 3866-79
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00528-15 [doi]
AB  - A major goal of cancer research is the identification of tumor-specific
      vulnerabilities that can be exploited for the development of therapies that are
      selectively toxic to the tumor. We show here that the transcriptional
      coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1beta
      (PGC1beta) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) are aberrantly
      expressed in human colon cell lines and tumors. With kinase suppressor of Ras 1
      (KSR1) depletion as a reference standard, we used functional signature ontology
      (FUSION) analysis to identify the gamma1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase 
      (AMPK) as an essential contributor to PGC1beta expression and colon tumor cell
      survival. Subsequent analysis revealed that a subunit composition of AMPK
      (alpha2beta2gamma1) is preferred for colorectal cancer cell survival, at least in
      part, by stabilizing the tumor-specific expression of PGC1beta. In contrast,
      PGC1beta and ERRalpha are not detectable in nontransformed human colon epithelial
      cells, and depletion of the AMPKgamma1 subunit has no effect on their viability. 
      These data indicate that Ras oncogenesis relies on the aberrant activation of a
      PGC1beta-dependent transcriptional pathway via a specific AMPK isoform.

TI  - The Stationary-Phase Cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Display Dynamic Actin
      Filaments Required for Processes Extending Chronological Life Span.
PG  - 3892-908
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00811-15 [doi]
AB  - Stationary-growth-phase Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cultures consist of
      nondividing cells that undergo chronological aging. For their successful
      survival, the turnover of proteins and organelles, ensured by autophagy and the
      activation of mitochondria, is performed. Some of these processes are engaged in 
      by the actin cytoskeleton. In S. cerevisiae stationary-phase cells, F actin has
      been shown to form static aggregates named actin bodies, subsequently cited to be
      markers of quiescence. Our in vivo analyses revealed that stationary-phase
      cultures contain cells with dynamic actin filaments, besides the cells with
      static actin bodies. The cells with dynamic actin displayed active endocytosis
      and autophagy and well-developed mitochondrial networks. Even more,
      stationary-phase cell cultures grown under calorie restriction predominantly
      contained cells with actin cables, confirming that the presence of actin cables
      is linked to successful adaptation to stationary phase. Cells with actin bodies
      were inactive in endocytosis and autophagy and displayed aberrations in
      mitochondrial networks. Notably, cells of the respiratory activity-deficient
      cox4Delta strain displayed the same mitochondrial aberrations and actin bodies
      only. Additionally, our results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction precedes 
      the formation of actin bodies and the appearance of actin bodies corresponds to
      decreased cell fitness. We conclude that the F-actin status reflects the extent
      of damage that arises from exponential growth.

TI  - Long-Range Transcriptional Control of the Il2 Gene by an Intergenic Enhancer.
PG  - 3880-91
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00592-15 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine with roles in both immunity and
      tolerance. Genetic studies in humans and mice demonstrate a role for Il2 in
      autoimmune disease susceptibility, and for decades the proximal Il2 upstream
      regulatory region has served as a paradigm of tissue-specific, inducible gene
      regulation. In this study, we have identified a novel long-range enhancer of the 
      Il2 gene located 83 kb upstream of the transcription start site. This element can
      potently enhance Il2 transcription in recombinant reporter assays in vitro, and
      the native region undergoes chromatin remodeling, transcribes a bidirectional
      enhancer RNA, and loops to physically interact with the Il2 gene in vivo in a
      CD28-dependent manner in CD4(+) T cells. This cis regulatory element is
      evolutionarily conserved and is situated near a human single-nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) associated with multiple autoimmune disorders. These results
      indicate that the regulatory architecture of the Il2 locus is more complex than
      previously appreciated and suggest a novel molecular basis for the genetic
      association of Il2 polymorphism with autoimmune disease.

TI  - BRCA1 Is Required for Maintenance of Phospho-Chk1 and G2/M Arrest during DNA
      Cross-Link Repair in DT40 Cells.
PG  - 3829-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01497-14 [doi]
AB  - The Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway is pivotal for the efficient repair of DNA 
      interstrand cross-links. Here, we show that FA-defective (Fancc(-)) DT40 cells
      arrest in G2 phase following cross-link damage and trigger apoptosis. Strikingly,
      cell death was reduced in Fancc(-) cells by additional deletion of the BRCA1
      tumor suppressor, resulting in elevated clonogenic survival. Increased resistance
      to cross-link damage was not due to loss of toxic BRCA1-mediated homologous
      recombination but rather through the loss of a G2 checkpoint. This proapoptotic
      role also required the BRCA1-A complex member ABRAXAS (FAM175A). Finally, we show
      that BRCA1 promotes G2 arrest and cell death by prolonging phosphorylation of
      Chk1 on serine 345 after DNA damage to sustain arrest. Our data imply that
      DNA-induced cross-link death in cells defective in the FA pathway is dependent on
      the ability of BRCA1 to prolong cell cycle arrest in G2 phase.

PG  - 3854-65
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00706-15 [doi]
AB  - Hdac3 is a key target for Hdac inhibitors that are efficacious in cutaneous T
      cell lymphoma. Moreover, the regulation of chromatin structure is critical as
      thymocytes transition from an immature cell with open chromatin to a mature T
      cell with tightly condensed chromatin. To define the phenotypes controlled by
      Hdac3 during T cell development, we conditionally deleted Hdac3 using the Lck-Cre
      transgene. This strategy inactivated Hdac3 in the double-negative stages of
      thymocyte development and caused a significant impairment at the CD8 immature
      single-positive (ISP) stage and the CD4/CD8 double-positive stage, with few
      mature CD4(+) or CD8(+) single-positive cells being produced. When Hdac3(-/-)
      mice were crossed with Bcl-xL-, Bcl2-, or TCRbeta-expressing transgenic mice, a
      modest level of complementation was found. However, when the null mice were
      crossed with mice expressing a fully rearranged T cell receptor alphabeta
      transgene, normal levels of CD4 single-positive cells were produced. Thus, Hdac3 
      is required for the efficient transit from double-negative stage 4 through
      positive selection.

TI  - PPM1G Binds 7SK RNA and Hexim1 To Block P-TEFb Assembly into the 7SK snRNP and
      Sustain Transcription Elongation.
PG  - 3810-28
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00226-15 [doi]
AB  - Transcription elongation programs are vital for the precise regulation of several
      biological processes. One key regulator of such programs is the P-TEFb kinase,
      which phosphorylates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) once released from the inhibitory
      7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. Although mechanisms of
      P-TEFb release from the snRNP are becoming clearer, how P-TEFb remains in the
      7SK-unbound state to sustain transcription elongation programs remains unknown.
      Here we report that the PPM1G phosphatase (inducibly recruited by nuclear factor 
      kappaB [NF-kappaB] to target promoters) directly binds 7SK RNA and the kinase
      inhibitor Hexim1 once P-TEFb has been released from the 7SK snRNP. This dual
      binding activity of PPM1G blocks P-TEFb reassembly onto the snRNP to sustain
      NF-kappaB-mediated Pol II transcription in response to DNA damage. Notably, the
      PPM1G-7SK RNA interaction is direct, kinetically follows the recruitment of PPM1G
      to promoters to activate NF-kappaB transcription, and is reversible, since the
      complex disassembles before resolution of the program. Strikingly, we found that 
      the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase regulates the interaction between 
      PPM1G and the 7SK snRNP through site-specific PPM1G phosphorylation. The precise 
      and temporally regulated interaction of a cellular enzyme and a noncoding RNA
      provides a new paradigm for simultaneously controlling the activation and
      maintenance of inducible transcription elongation programs.

      Transcriptional Activity in T Lymphocytes.
PG  - 3841-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00677-15 [doi]
AB  - Trithorax group (TrxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are two mutually
      antagonistic chromatin modifying complexes, however, how they together mediate
      transcriptional counter-regulation remains unknown. Genome-wide analysis revealed
      that binding of Ezh2 and menin, central members of the PcG and TrxG complexes,
      respectively, were reciprocally correlated. Moreover, we identified a
      developmental change in the positioning of Ezh2 and menin in differentiated T
      lymphocytes compared to embryonic stem cells. Ezh2-binding upstream and
      menin-binding downstream of the transcription start site was frequently found at 
      genes with higher transcriptional levels, and Ezh2-binding downstream and
      menin-binding upstream was found at genes with lower expression in T lymphocytes.
      Interestingly, of the Ezh2 and menin cooccupied genes, those exhibiting occupancy
      at the same position displayed greatly enhanced sensitivity to loss of Ezh2.
      Finally, we also found that different combinations of Ezh2 and menin occupancy
      were associated with expression of specific functional gene groups important for 
      T cell development. Therefore, spatial cooperative gene regulation by the PcG and
      TrxG complexes may represent a novel mechanism regulating the transcriptional
      identity of differentiated cells.

TI  - Evidence for Homodimerization of the c-Fos Transcription Factor in Live Cells
      Revealed by Fluorescence Microscopy and Computer Modeling.
PG  - 3785-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00346-15 [doi]
AB  - The c-Fos and c-Jun transcription factors, members of the activator protein 1
      (AP-1) complex, form heterodimers and bind to DNA via a basic leucine zipper and 
      regulate the cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation, etc. Purified c-Jun leucine 
      zipper fragments could also form stable homodimers, whereas c-Fos leucine zipper 
      homodimers were found to be much less stable in earlier in vitro studies. The
      importance of c-Fos overexpression in tumors and the controversy in the
      literature concerning c-Fos homodimerization prompted us to investigate Fos
      homodimerization. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and molecular
      brightness analysis of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data from live HeLa 
      cells transfected with fluorescent-protein-tagged c-Fos indicated that c-Fos
      formed homodimers. We developed a method to determine the absolute concentrations
      of transfected and endogenous c-Fos and c-Jun, which allowed us to determine
      dissociation constants of c-Fos homodimers (Kd = 6.7 +/- 1.7 muM) and c-Fos-c-Jun
      heterodimers (on the order of 10 to 100 nM) from FRET titrations. Imaging
      fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (SPIM-FCCS) and molecular dynamics
      modeling confirmed that c-Fos homodimers were stably associated and could bind to
      the chromatin. Our results establish c-Fos homodimers as a novel form of the AP-1
      complex that may be an autonomous transcription factor in c-Fos-overexpressing
      tissues and could contribute to tumor development.

TI  - Functional Requirements for Fab-7 Boundary Activity in the Bithorax Complex.
PG  - 3739-52
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00456-15 [doi]
AB  - Chromatin boundaries are architectural elements that determine the
      three-dimensional folding of the chromatin fiber and organize the chromosome into
      independent units of genetic activity. The Fab-7 boundary from the Drosophila
      bithorax complex (BX-C) is required for the parasegment-specific expression of
      the Abd-B gene. We have used a replacement strategy to identify sequences that
      are necessary and sufficient for Fab-7 boundary function in the BX-C. Fab-7
      boundary activity is known to depend on factors that are stage specific, and we
      describe a novel approximately 700-kDa complex, the late boundary complex (LBC), 
      that binds to Fab-7 sequences that have insulator functions in late embryos and
      adults. We show that the LBC is enriched in nuclear extracts from late, but not
      early, embryos and that it contains three insulator proteins, GAF, Mod(mdg4), and
      E(y)2. Its DNA binding properties are unusual in that it requires a minimal
      sequence of >65 bp; however, other than a GAGA motif, the three Fab-7 LBC
      recognition elements display few sequence similarities. Finally, we show that
      mutations which abrogate LBC binding in vitro inactivate the Fab-7 boundary in
      the BX-C.

TI  - Group IVA Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 Regulates the G2-to-M Transition by
      Modulating the Activity of Tumor Suppressor SIRT2.
PG  - 3768-84
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00184-15 [doi]
AB  - The G2-to-M transition (or prophase) checkpoint of the cell cycle is a critical
      regulator of mitotic entry. SIRT2, a tumor suppressor gene, contributes to the
      control of this checkpoint by blocking mitotic entry under cellular stress.
      However, the mechanism underlying both SIRT2 activation and regulation of the
      G2-to-M transition remains largely unknown. Here, we report the formation of a
      multiprotein complex at the G2-to-M transition in vitro and in vivo. Group IVA
      cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2alpha) acts as a bridge in this complex to
      promote binding of SIRT2 to cyclin A-Cdk2. Cyclin A-Cdk2 then phosphorylates
      SIRT2 at Ser331. This phosphorylation reduces SIRT2 catalytic activity and its
      binding affinity to centrosomes and mitotic spindles, promoting G2-to-M
      transition. We show that the inhibitory effect of cPLA2alpha on SIRT2 activity
      impacts various cellular processes, including cellular levels of histone H4
      acetylated at K16 (Ac-H4K16) and Ac-alpha-tubulin. This regulatory effect of
      cPLA2alpha on SIRT2 defines a novel function of cPLA2alpha independent of its
      phospholipase activity and may have implications for the impact of SIRT2-related 
      effects on tumorigenesis and age-related diseases.

TI  - Mutagenesis of ARS2 Domains To Assess Possible Roles in Cell Cycle Progression
      and MicroRNA and Replication-Dependent Histone mRNA Biogenesis.
PG  - 3753-67
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00272-15 [doi]
AB  - ARS2 is a regulator of RNA polymerase II transcript processing through its role
      in the maturation of distinct nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC)-controlled RNA
      families. In this study, we examined ARS2 domain function in transcript
      processing. Structural modeling based on the plant ARS2 orthologue, SERRATE,
      revealed 2 previously uncharacterized domains in mammalian ARS2: an N-terminal
      domain of unknown function (DUF3546), which is also present in SERRATE, and an
      RNA recognition motif (RRM) that is present in metazoan ARS2 but not in plants.
      Both the DUF3546 and zinc finger domain (ZnF) were required for association with 
      microRNA and replication-dependent histone mRNA. Mutations in the ZnF disrupted
      interaction with FLASH, a key component in histone pre-mRNA processing. Mutations
      targeting the Mid domain implicated it in DROSHA interaction and microRNA
      biogenesis. The unstructured C terminus was required for interaction with the CBC
      protein CBP20, while the RRM was required for cell cycle progression and for
      binding to FLASH. Together, our results support a bridging model in which ARS2
      plays a central role in RNA recognition and processing through multiple protein
      and RNA interactions.

TI  - The DEK Oncoprotein Is a Critical Component of the EKLF/KLF1 Enhancer in
      Erythroid Cells.
PG  - 3726-38
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00382-15 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how transcriptional regulators are themselves controlled is
      important in attaining a complete picture of the intracellular effects that
      follow signaling cascades during early development and cell-restricted
      differentiation. We have addressed this issue by focusing on the regulation of
      EKLF/KLF1, a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a necessary role in the 
      global regulation of erythroid gene expression. Using biochemical affinity
      purification, we have identified the DEK oncoprotein as a critical factor that
      interacts with an essential upstream enhancer element of the EKLF promoter and
      exerts a positive effect on EKLF levels. This element also binds a core set of
      erythroid transcription factors, suggesting that DEK is part of a
      tissue-restricted enhanceosome that contains BMP4-dependent and -independent
      components. Together with local enrichment of properly coded histones and an open
      chromatin domain, optimal transcriptional activation of the EKLF locus can be
      established.

TI  - The Set3 Complex Antagonizes the MYST Acetyltransferase Esa1 in the DNA Damage
      Response.
PG  - 3714-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00298-15 [doi]
AB  - Acetylation is a dynamic posttranslational modification that contributes to
      chromatin-regulated processes, including DNA replication, repair, recombination, 
      and gene expression. Acetylation is controlled by complexes containing opposing
      lysine and histone acetyltransferase (KAT and HAT) and deacetylase (KDAC and
      HDAC) activities. The essential MYST family Esa1 KAT acetylates core histones and
      many nonhistone substrates. Phenotypes of esa1 mutants include transcriptional
      silencing and activation defects, impaired growth at high temperatures, and
      sensitivity to DNA damage. The KDAC Rpd3 was previously identified as an activity
      opposing Esa1, as its deletion suppresses growth and silencing defects of esa1
      mutants. However, loss of Rpd3 does not suppress esa1 DNA damage sensitivity. In 
      this work, we identified Hos2 as a KDAC counteracting ESA1 in the damage
      response. Deletion of HOS2 resulted in changes of esa1's transcriptional response
      upon damage. Further, loss of HOS2 or components of the Set3 complex (Set3C) in
      which it acts specifically suppressed damage sensitivity and restored esa1
      histone H4 acetylation. This rescue was mediated via loss of either Set3C
      integrity or of its binding to dimethylated histone H3K4. Our results thus add
      new insight into the interactions of an essential MYST acetyltransferase with
      diverse deacetylases to respond specifically to environmental and physiological
      challenges.

TI  - Recruitment of RAG1 and RAG2 to Chromatinized DNA during V(D)J Recombination.
PG  - 3701-13
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00219-15 [doi]
AB  - V(D)J recombination is initiated by the binding of the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins to 
      recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that consist of conserved heptamer and
      nonamer sequences separated by a spacer of either 12 or 23 bp. Here, we used
      RAG-inducible pro-B v-Abl cell lines in conjunction with chromatin
      immunoprecipitation to better understand the protein and RSS requirements for RAG
      recruitment to chromatin. Using a catalytic mutant form of RAG1 to prevent
      recombination, we did not observe cooperation between RAG1 and RAG2 in their
      recruitment to endogenous Jkappa gene segments over a 48-h time course. Using
      retroviral recombination substrates, we found that RAG1 was recruited
      inefficiently to substrates lacking an RSS or containing a single RSS, better to 
      substrates with two 12-bp RSSs (12RSSs) or two 23-bp RSSs (23RSSs), and more
      efficiently to a substrate with a 12/23RSS pair. RSS mutagenesis demonstrated a
      major role for the nonamer element in RAG1 binding, and correspondingly, a
      cryptic RSS consisting of a repeat of CA dinucleotides, which poorly re-creates
      the nonamer, was ineffective in recruiting RAG1. Our findings suggest that
      12RSS-23RSS cooperation (the "12/23 rule") is important not only for regulating
      RAG-mediated DNA cleavage but also for the efficiency of RAG recruitment to
      chromatin.

TI  - Neuroinflammation-Induced Interactions between Protease-Activated Receptor 1 and 
      Proprotein Convertases in HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder.
PG  - 3684-700
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00764-15 [doi]
AB  - The proprotein convertases (PCs) furin, PC5, PACE4, and PC7 cleave secretory
      proteins after basic residues, including the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp160)
      and Vpr. We evaluated the abundance of PC mRNAs in postmortem brains of
      individuals exhibiting HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), likely
      driven by neuroinflammation and neurotoxic HIV proteins (e.g., envelope and Vpr).
      Concomitant with increased inflammation-related gene expression
      (interleukin-1beta [IL-1beta]), the mRNA levels of the above PCs are
      significantly increased, together with those of the proteinase-activated receptor
      1 (PAR1), an inflammation-associated receptor that is cleaved by thrombin at
      ProArg41 downward arrow (where the down arrow indicates the cleavage location),
      and potentially by PCs at Arg41XXXXArg46 downward arrow. The latter motif in
      PAR1, but not its R46A mutant, drives its interactions with PCs. Indeed, PAR1
      upregulation leads to the inhibition of membrane-bound furin, PC5B, and PC7 and
      inhibits gp160 processing and HIV infectivity. Additionally, a proximity ligation
      assay revealed that furin and PC7 interact with PAR1. Reciprocally, increased
      furin expression reduces the plasma membrane abundance of PAR1 by trapping it in 
      the trans-Golgi network. Furthermore, soluble PC5A/PACE4 can target/disarm cell
      surface PAR1 through cleavage at Arg46 downward arrow. PACE4/PC5A decreased
      calcium mobilization induced by thrombin stimulation. Our data reveal a new
      PC-PAR1-interaction pathway, which offsets the effects of HIV-induced
      neuroinflammation, viral infection, and potentially the development of HAND.

TI  - Cdc14A and Cdc14B Redundantly Regulate DNA Double-Strand Break Repair.
PG  - 3657-68
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00233-15 [doi]
AB  - Cdc14 is a phosphatase that controls mitotic exit and cytokinesis in budding
      yeast. In mammals, the two Cdc14 homologues, Cdc14A and Cdc14B, have been
      proposed to regulate DNA damage repair, whereas the mitotic exit and cytokinesis 
      rely on another phosphatase, PP2A-B55alpha. It is unclear if the two Cdc14s work 
      redundantly in DNA repair and which repair pathways they participate in. More
      importantly, their target(s) in DNA repair remains elusive. Here we report that
      Cdc14B knockout (Cdc14B(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed defects
      in repairing ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),
      which occurred only at late passages when Cdc14A levels were low. This repair
      defect could occur at early passages if Cdc14A levels were also compromised.
      These results indicate redundancy between Cdc14B and Cdc14A in DSB repair.
      Further, we found that Cdc14B deficiency impaired both homologous recombination
      (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), the two major DSB repair pathways. We 
      also provide evidence that Cdh1 is a downstream target of Cdc14B in DSB repair.

TI  - Loss of ADAM17-Mediated Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Signaling in Intestinal Cells
      Attenuates Mucosal Atrophy in a Mouse Model of Parenteral Nutrition.
PG  - 3604-21
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00143-15 [doi]
AB  - Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is commonly used clinically to sustain patients;
      however, TPN is associated with profound mucosal atrophy, which may adversely
      affect clinical outcomes. Using a mouse TPN model, removing enteral nutrition
      leads to decreased crypt proliferation, increased intestinal epithelial cell
      (IEC) apoptosis and increased mucosal tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)
      expression that ultimately produces mucosal atrophy. Upregulation of TNF-alpha
      signaling plays a central role in mediating TPN-induced mucosal atrophy without
      intact epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Currently, the
      mechanism and the tissue-specific contributions of TNF-alpha signaling to
      TPN-induced mucosal atrophy remain unclear. ADAM17 is an ectodomain sheddase that
      can modulate the signaling activity of several cytokine/growth factor receptor
      families, including the TNF-alpha/TNF receptor and ErbB ligand/EGFR pathways.
      Using TPN-treated IEC-specific ADAM17-deficient mice, the present study
      demonstrates that a loss of soluble TNF-alpha signaling from IECs attenuates
      TPN-induced mucosal atrophy. Importantly, this response remains dependent on the 
      maintenance of functional EGFR signaling in IECs. TNF-alpha blockade in wild-type
      mice receiving TPN confirmed that soluble TNF-alpha signaling is responsible for 
      downregulation of EGFR signaling in IECs. These results demonstrate that
      ADAM17-mediated TNF-alpha signaling from IECs has a significant role in the
      development of the proinflammatory state and mucosal atrophy observed in
      TPN-treated mice.

PG  - 3669-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00729-15 [doi]
AB  - Cells respond to environmental stimuli by fine-tuned regulation of gene
      expression. Here we investigated the dose-dependent modulation of gene expression
      at high temporal resolution in response to nutrient and stress signals in yeast. 
      The GAL1 activity in cell populations is modulated in a well-defined range of
      galactose concentrations, correlating with a dynamic change of histone remodeling
      and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) association. This behavior is the result of a
      heterogeneous induction delay caused by decreasing inducer concentrations across 
      the population. Chromatin remodeling appears to be the basis for the dynamic GAL1
      expression, because mutants with impaired histone dynamics show severely
      truncated dose-response profiles. In contrast, the GRE2 promoter operates like a 
      rapid off/on switch in response to increasing osmotic stress, with almost
      constant expression rates and exclusively temporal regulation of histone
      remodeling and RNAPII occupancy. The Gal3 inducer and the Hog1 mitogen-activated 
      protein (MAP) kinase seem to determine the different dose-response strategies at 
      the two promoters. Accordingly, GAL1 becomes highly sensitive and dose
      independent if previously stimulated because of residual Gal3 levels, whereas
      GRE2 expression diminishes upon repeated stimulation due to acquired stress
      resistance. Our analysis reveals important differences in the way dynamic signals
      create dose-sensitive gene expression outputs.

TI  - Role of the Exocyst Complex Component Sec6/8 in Genomic Stability.
PG  - 3633-45
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00768-15 [doi]
AB  - The exocyst is a heterooctomeric complex well appreciated for its role in the
      dynamic assembly of specialized membrane domains. Accumulating evidence indicates
      that this macromolecular machine also serves as a physical platform that
      coordinates regulatory cascades supporting biological systems such as host
      defense signaling, cell fate, and energy homeostasis. The isolation of multiple
      components of the DNA damage response (DDR) as exocyst-interacting proteins,
      together with the identification of Sec8 as a suppressor of the p53 response,
      suggested functional interactions between the exocyst and the DDR. We found that 
      exocyst perturbation resulted in resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and
      accelerated resolution of DNA damage. This occurred at the expense of genomic
      integrity, as enhanced recombination frequencies correlated with the accumulation
      of aberrant chromatid exchanges. Sec8 perturbation resulted in the accumulation
      of ATF2 and RNF20 and the promiscuous accumulation of DDR-associated chromatin
      marks and Rad51 repairosomes. Thus, the exocyst supports DNA repair fidelity by
      limiting the formation of repair chromatin in the absence of DNA damage.

TI  - Notch1 Autoactivation via Transcriptional Regulation of Furin, Which Sustains
      Notch1 Signaling by Processing Notch1-Activating Proteases ADAM10 and Membrane
      Type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase.
PG  - 3622-32
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00116-15 [doi]
AB  - Notch1 is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor involved in melanoma
      growth. Notch1 is first cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus to produce the
      biologically active heterodimer. Following ligand binding, Notch1 is cleaved at
      the cell membrane by proteases such as ADAM10 and -17 and membrane type 1 matrix 
      metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), the latter of which we recently identified as a
      novel protease involved in Notch1 processing. The final cleavage is
      gamma-secretase dependent and releases the active Notch intracellular domain
      (NIC). We now demonstrate that Notch1 directly regulates furin expression. Aside 
      from activating Notch1, furin cleaves and activates several proteases, including 
      MT1-MMP, ADAM10, and ADAM17. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and a reporter
      assay, we demonstrate that Notch1 binds at position -1236 of the furin promoter
      and drives furin expression. The Notch1-dependent enhancement of furin expression
      increases the activities of MT1-MMP and ADAM10 but not that of ADAM17, as
      demonstrated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of furin, and promotes the
      cleavage of Notch1 itself. These data highlight a novel positive-feedback loop
      whereby Notch1-dependent furin expression can induce Notch1 signaling by
      increasing Notch1 processing and by potentiating the activity of the proteases
      responsible for Notch1 activation. This leads to Notch1 signal amplification,
      which can promote melanoma tumor growth and progression, as demonstrated by the
      inhibition of cell migration and invasion upon furin inhibition downstream of
      Notch1. Disruption of such feedback signaling might represent an avenue for the
      treatment of melanoma.

TI  - A Synthetic Lethal Interaction between Glutathione Synthesis and Mitochondrial
      Reactive Oxygen Species Provides a Tumor-Specific Vulnerability Dependent on
      STAT3.
PG  - 3646-56
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00541-15 [doi]
AB  - Increased production of mitochondrion-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) is
      characteristic of a metabolic shift observed during malignant transformation.
      While the exact sources and roles of ROS in tumorigenesis remain to be defined,
      it has become clear that maintaining redox balance is critical for cancer cell
      proliferation and survival and, as such, may represent a vulnerability that can
      be exploited therapeutically. STAT3, a latent cytosolic transcription factor
      activated by diverse cytokines and growth factors, has been shown to exhibit an
      additional, nontranscriptional function in mitochondria, including modulation of 
      electron transport chain activity. In particular, malignant transformation by Ras
      oncogenes exploits mitochondrial STAT3 functions. We used mass spectrometry-based
      metabolomics profiling to explore the biochemical basis for the STAT3 dependence 
      of Ras transformation. We identified the gamma-glutamyl cycle, the production of 
      glutathione, and the regulation of ROS as a mitochondrion-STAT3-dependent pathway
      in Ras-transformed cells. Experimental inhibition of key enzymes in the
      glutathione cycle resulted in the depletion of glutathione, accumulation of ROS, 
      oxidative DNA damage, and cell death in an oncogenic Ras- and mitochondrial
      STAT3-dependent manner. These data uncover a synthetic lethal interaction
      involving glutathione production and mitochondrial ROS regulation in
      Ras-transformed cells that is governed by mitochondrial STAT3 and might be
      exploited therapeutically.

TI  - Physical Connectivity Mapping by Circular Permutation of Human Telomerase RNA
      Reveals New Regions Critical for Activity and Processivity.
PG  - 251-61
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00794-15 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase is a specialized ribonucleoprotein complex that extends the 3' ends of
      chromosomes to counteract telomere shortening. However, increased telomerase
      activity is associated with approximately 90% of human cancers. The telomerase
      enzyme minimally requires an RNA (hTR) and a specialized reverse transcriptase
      protein (TERT) for activity in vitro. Understanding the structure-function
      relationships within hTR has important implications for human disease. For the
      first time, we have tested the physical-connectivity requirements in the
      451-nucleotide hTR RNA using circular permutations, which reposition the 5' and
      3' ends. Our extensive in vitro analysis identified three classes of hTR circular
      permutants with altered function. First, circularly permuting 3' of the template 
      causes specific defects in repeat-addition processivity, revealing that the
      template recognition element found in ciliates is conserved in human telomerase
      RNA. Second, seven circular permutations residing within the catalytically
      important core and CR4/5 domains completely abolish telomerase activity,
      unveiling mechanistically critical portions of these domains. Third, several
      circular permutations between the core and CR4/5 significantly increase
      telomerase activity. Our extensive circular permutation results provide insights 
      into the architecture and coordination of human telomerase RNA and highlight
      where the RNA could be targeted for the development of antiaging and anticancer
      therapeutics.

TI  - High Fractional Occupancy of a Tandem Maf Recognition Element and Its Role in
      Long-Range beta-Globin Gene Regulation.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00723-15 [doi]
AB  - Enhancers and promoters assemble protein complexes that ultimately regulate the
      recruitment and activity of RNA polymerases. Previous work has shown that at
      least some enhancers form stable protein complexes, leading to the formation of
      enhanceosomes. We analyzed protein-DNA interactions in the murine beta-globin
      gene locus using the methyltransferase accessibility protocol for individual
      templates (MAPit). The data show that a tandem Maf recognition element (MARE) in 
      locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) reveals a remarkably high 
      degree of occupancy during differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells. Most
      of the other transcription factor binding sites in LCR HS2 or in the adult
      beta-globin gene promoter regions exhibit low fractional occupancy, suggesting
      highly dynamic protein-DNA interactions. Targeting of an artificial zinc finger
      DNA-binding domain (ZF-DBD) to the HS2 tandem MARE caused a reduction in the
      association of MARE-binding proteins and transcription complexes at LCR HS2 and
      the adult betamajor-globin gene promoter but did not affect expression of the
      betaminor-globin gene. The data demonstrate that a stable MARE-associated
      footprint in LCR HS2 is important for the recruitment of transcription complexes 
      to the adult betamajor-globin gene promoter during erythroid cell
      differentiation.

TI  - Recruitment of beta-Arrestin into Neuronal Cilia Modulates Somatostatin Receptor 
      Subtype 3 Ciliary Localization.
PG  - 223-35
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00765-15 [doi]
AB  - Primary cilia are essential sensory and signaling organelles present on nearly
      every mammalian cell type. Defects in primary cilia underlie a class of human
      diseases collectively termed ciliopathies. Primary cilia are restricted
      subcellular compartments, and specialized mechanisms coordinate the localization 
      of proteins to cilia. Moreover, trafficking of proteins into and out of cilia is 
      required for proper ciliary function, and this process is disrupted in
      ciliopathies. The somatostatin receptor subtype 3 (Sstr3) is selectively targeted
      to primary cilia on neurons in the mammalian brain and is implicated in learning 
      and memory. Here, we show that Sstr3 localization to cilia is dynamic and
      decreases in response to somatostatin treatment. We further show that
      somatostatin treatment stimulates beta-arrestin recruitment into Sstr3-positive
      cilia and this recruitment can be blocked by mutations in Sstr3 that impact
      agonist binding or phosphorylation. Importantly, somatostatin treatment fails to 
      decrease Sstr3 ciliary localization in neurons lacking beta-arrestin 2. Together,
      our results implicate beta-arrestin in the modulation of Sstr3 ciliary
      localization and further suggest a role for beta-arrestin in the mediation of
      Sstr3 ciliary signaling.

TI  - A Positive Feedback Loop between Glial Cells Missing 1 and Human Chorionic
      Gonadotropin (hCG) Regulates Placental hCGbeta Expression and Cell
      Differentiation.
PG  - 197-209
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00655-15 [doi]
AB  - Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is composed of a common alpha subunit and a
      placenta-specific beta subunit. Importantly, hCG is highly expressed in the
      differentiated and multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast, which is formed via
      trophoblast cell fusion and stimulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP). Although the
      ubiquitous activating protein 2 (AP2) transcription factors TFAP2A and TFAP2C may
      regulate hCGbeta expression, it remains unclear how cAMP stimulates
      placenta-specific hCGbeta gene expression and trophoblastic differentiation. Here
      we demonstrated that the placental transcription factor glial cells missing 1
      (GCM1) binds to a highly conserved promoter region in all six hCGbeta paralogues 
      by chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-chip) analyses. We further showed 
      that cAMP stimulates GCM1 and the CBP coactivator to activate the hCGbeta
      promoter through a GCM1-binding site (GBS1), which also constitutes a previously 
      identified AP2 site. Given that TFAP2C may compete with GCM1 for GBS1, cAMP
      enhances the association between the hCGbeta promoter and GCM1 but not TFAP2C.
      Indeed, the hCG-cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway also stimulates
      Ser269 and Ser275 phosphorylation of GCM1, which recruits CBP to mediate GCM1
      acetylation and stabilization. Consequently, hCG stimulates the expression of
      GCM1 target genes, including the fusogenic protein syncytin-1, to promote
      placental cell fusion. Our study reveals a positive feedback loop between GCM1
      and hCG regulating placental hCGbeta expression and cell differentiation.

TI  - The Insertion in Fingers Domain in Human Telomerase Can Mediate Enzyme
      Processivity and Telomerase Recruitment to Telomeres in a TPP1-Dependent Manner.
PG  - 210-22
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00746-15 [doi]
AB  - In most human cancer cells, cellular immortalization relies on the activation and
      recruitment of telomerase to telomeres. The telomere-binding protein TPP1 and the
      TEN domain of the telomerase catalytic subunit TERT regulate telomerase
      recruitment. TERT contains a unique domain, called the insertion in fingers
      domain (IFD), located within the conserved reverse transcriptase domain. We
      report the role of specific hTERT IFD residues in the regulation of telomerase
      activity and processivity, recruitment to telomeres, and cell survival. One hTERT
      IFD variant, hTERT-L805A, with reduced activity and processivity showed impaired 
      telomere association, which could be partially rescued by overexpression of
      TPP1-POT1. Another previously reported hTERT IFD mutant enzyme with similarly low
      levels of activity and processivity, hTERT-V791Y, displayed defects in telomere
      binding and was insensitive to TPP1-POT1 overexpression. Our results provide the 
      first evidence that the IFD can mediate enzyme processivity and telomerase
      recruitment to telomeres in a TPP1-dependent manner. Moreover, unlike
      hTERT-V791Y, hTERT-V763S, a variant with reduced activity but increased
      processivity, and hTERT-L805A, could both immortalize limited-life-span cells,
      but cells expressing these two mutant enzymes displayed growth defects, increased
      apoptosis, DNA damage at telomeres, and short telomeres. Our results highlight
      the importance of the IFD in maintaining short telomeres and in cell survival.

TI  - Brown Adipose YY1 Deficiency Activates Expression of Secreted Proteins Linked to 
      Energy Expenditure and Prevents Diet-Induced Obesity.
PG  - 184-96
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00722-15 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial oxidative and thermogenic functions in brown and beige adipose
      tissues modulate rates of energy expenditure. It is unclear, however, how beige
      or white adipose tissue contributes to brown fat thermogenic function or
      compensates for partial deficiencies in this tissue and protects against obesity.
      Here, we show that the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in brown adipose
      tissue activates the canonical thermogenic and uncoupling gene expression
      program. In contrast, YY1 represses a series of secreted proteins, including
      fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), bone morphogenetic protein 8b (BMP8b),
      growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), angiopoietin-like 6 (Angptl6),
      neuromedin B, and nesfatin, linked to energy expenditure. Despite substantial
      decreases in mitochondrial thermogenic proteins in brown fat, mice lacking YY1 in
      this tissue are strongly protected against diet-induced obesity and exhibit
      increased energy expenditure and oxygen consumption in beige and white fat
      depots. The increased expression of secreted proteins correlates with elevation
      of energy expenditure and promotion of beige and white fat activation. These
      results indicate that YY1 in brown adipose tissue controls antagonistic gene
      expression programs associated with energy balance and maintenance of body
      weight.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00806-15 [doi]
AB  - Erythroid development and differentiation from multiprogenitor cells into red
      blood cells requires precise transcriptional regulation. Key erythroid
      transcription factors, GATA1 and TAL1, cooperate, along with other proteins, to
      regulate many aspects of this process. How GATA1 and TAL1 are juxtaposed along
      the DNA and their cognate DNA binding site across the mouse genome remains
      unclear. We applied high-resolution ChIP-exo (chromatin immunoprecipitation
      followed by 5'-to-3' exonuclease treatment and then massively parallel DNA
      sequencing) to GATA1 and TAL1 to study their positional organization across the
      mouse genome during GATA1-dependent maturation. Two complementary methods,
      MultiGPS and peak pairing, were used to determine high-confidence binding
      locations by ChIP-exo. We identified approximately 10,000 GATA1 and approximately
      15,000 TAL1 locations, which were essentially confirmed by ChIP-seq (chromatin
      immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing). Of these,
      approximately 4,000 locations were bound by both GATA1 and TAL1. About
      three-quarters of them were tightly linked to a partial E-box located 7 or 8 bp
      upstream of a WGATAA motif. Both TAL1 and GATA1 generated distinct characteristic
      ChIP-exo peaks around WGATAA motifs that reflect their positional arrangement
      within a complex. We show that TAL1 and GATA1 form a precisely organized complex 
      at a compound motif consisting of a TG 7 or 8 bp upstream of a WGATAA motif
      across thousands of genomic locations.

TI  - The Catalytic Activity of the Ubp3 Deubiquitinating Protease Is Required for
      Efficient Stress Granule Assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 173-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00609-15 [doi]
AB  - The interior of the eukaryotic cell is a highly compartmentalized space
      containing both membrane-bound organelles and the recently identified
      nonmembranous ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. This study examines in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae the assembly of one conserved type of the latter
      compartment, known as the stress granule. Stress granules form in response to
      particular environmental cues and have been linked to a variety of human
      diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To further our understanding
      of these structures, a candidate genetic screen was employed to identify
      regulators of stress granule assembly in quiescent cells. These studies
      identified a ubiquitin-specific protease, Ubp3, as having an essential role in
      the assembly of these RNP granules. This function was not shared by other members
      of the Ubp protease family and required Ubp3 catalytic activity as well as its
      interaction with the cofactor Bre5. Interestingly, the loss of stress granules
      was correlated with a decrease in the long-term survival of stationary-phase
      cells. This phenotype is similar to that observed in mutants defective for the
      formation of a related RNP complex, the Processing body. Altogether, these
      observations raise the interesting possibility of a general role for these types 
      of cytoplasmic RNP granules in the survival of G0-like resting cells.

TI  - Estrogen Exhibits a Biphasic Effect on Prostate Tumor Growth through the Estrogen
      Receptor beta-KLF5 Pathway.
PG  - 144-56
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00625-15 [doi]
AB  - Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer; however, the effects
      of estrogens on prostate cancer are enigmatic. In this study, we demonstrated
      that estrogen (17beta-estradiol [E2]) has biphasic effects on prostate tumor
      growth. A lower dose of E2 increased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models using
      DU145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, whereas a higher dose significantly
      decreased tumor growth. We found that anchorage-independent apoptosis in these
      cells was inhibited by E2 treatment. Similarly, in vivo angiogenesis was
      suppressed by E2. Interestingly, these effects of E2 were abolished by knockdown 
      of either estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) or Kruppel-like zinc finger
      transcription factor 5 (KLF5). Iotan addition, E2 suppressed KLF5-mediated
      transcription through ERbeta, which inhibits proapoptotic FOXO1 and proangiogenic
      PDGFA expression. Furthermore, we revealed that a nonagonistic ER ligand GS-1405 
      inhibited FOXO1 and PDGFA expression through the ERbeta-KLF5 pathway and
      regulated prostate tumor growth without ERbeta transactivation. Therefore, these 
      results suggest that E2 biphasically modulates prostate tumor formation by
      regulating KLF5-dependent transcription through ERbeta and provide a new strategy
      for designing ER modulators, which will be able to regulate prostate cancer
      progression with minimal adverse effects due to ER transactivation.

TI  - Identification of Novel Death-Associated Protein Kinase 2 Interaction Partners by
      Proteomic Screening Coupled with Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation.
PG  - 132-43
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00515-15 [doi]
AB  - Death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent
      Ser/Thr kinase that possesses tumor-suppressive functions and regulates
      programmed cell death, autophagy, oxidative stress, hematopoiesis, and motility. 
      As only few binding partners of DAPK2 have been determined, the molecular
      mechanisms governing these biological functions are largely unknown. We report
      the identification of 180 potential DAPK2 interaction partners by affinity
      purification-coupled mass spectrometry, 12 of which are known DAPK binding
      proteins. A small subset of established and potential binding proteins detected
      in this screen was further investigated by bimolecular fluorescence
      complementation (BiFC) assays, a method to visualize protein interactions in
      living cells. These experiments revealed that alpha-actinin-1 and 14-3-3-beta are
      novel DAPK2 binding partners. The interaction of DAPK2 with alpha-actinin-1 was
      localized at the plasma membrane, resulting in massive membrane blebbing and
      reduced cellular motility, whereas the interaction of DAPK2 with 14-3-3-beta was 
      localized to the cytoplasm, with no impact on blebbing, motility, or viability.
      Our results therefore suggest that DAPK2 effector functions are influenced by the
      protein's subcellular localization and highlight the utility of combining mass
      spectrometry screening with bimolecular fluorescence complementation to identify 
      and characterize novel protein-protein interactions.

TI  - NFAT2 Isoforms Differentially Regulate Gene Expression, Cell Death, and
      Transformation through Alternative N-Terminal Domains.
PG  - 119-31
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00501-15 [doi]
AB  - The NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family of transcription factors is
      composed of four calcium-responsive proteins (NFAT1 to -4). The NFAT2 (also
      called NFATc1) gene encodes the isoforms NFAT2alpha and NFAT2beta that result
      mainly from alternative initiation exons that provide two different N-terminal
      transactivation domains. However, the specific roles of the NFAT2 isoforms in
      cell physiology remain unclear. Because previous studies have shown oncogenic
      potential for NFAT2, this study emphasized the role of the NFAT2 isoforms in cell
      transformation. Here, we show that a constitutively active form of NFAT2alpha
      (CA-NFAT2alpha) and CA-NFAT2beta distinctly control death and transformation in
      NIH 3T3 cells. While CA-NFAT2alpha strongly induces cell transformation,
      CA-NFAT2beta leads to reduced cell proliferation and intense cell death through
      the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). CA-NFAT2beta also
      increases cell death and upregulates Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF-alpha in CD4(+) T 
      cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that differential roles of NFAT2 isoforms in
      NIH 3T3 cells depend on the N-terminal domain, where the NFAT2beta-specific
      N-terminal acidic motif is necessary to induce cell death. Interestingly, the
      NFAT2alpha isoform is upregulated in Burkitt lymphomas, suggesting an
      isoform-specific involvement of NFAT2 in cancer development. Finally, our data
      suggest that alternative N-terminal domains of NFAT2 could provide differential
      mechanisms for the control of cellular functions.

      Reticulum Stress in Skeletal Muscle to Insulin Resistance.
PG  - 108-18
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00921-15 [doi]
AB  - Insulin resistance is critical in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
      Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in liver and adipose tissues plays an important
      role in the development of insulin resistance. Although skeletal muscle is a
      primary site for insulin-dependent glucose disposal, it is unclear if ER stress
      in those tissues contributes to insulin resistance. In this study, we show that
      skeletal muscle kidney-enriched inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (SKIP), a PIP3
      (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate) phosphatase, links ER stress to
      insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. SKIP expression was increased due to ER
      stress and was higher in the skeletal muscle isolated from high-fat-diet-fed mice
      and db/db mice than in that from wild-type mice. Mechanistically, ER stress
      promotes activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and X-box binding protein 1
      (XBP1)-dependent expression of SKIP. These findings underscore the specific and
      prominent role of SKIP in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal
      muscle.

      Control in G Protein-Coupled Receptor- and RhoA-Mediated Transcriptional
      Regulation and Cell Proliferation.
PG  - 39-49

AB  - The ability of a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to activate RhoA
      endows them with unique growth-regulatory properties. Two transcriptional
      pathways are activated through GPCRs and RhoA, one utilizing the transcriptional 
      coactivator myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) and serum response 
      factor (SRF) and the other using the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated
      protein (YAP) and TEA domain family members (TEAD). These pathways have not been 
      compared for their relative levels of importance and potential interactions in
      RhoA target gene expression. GPCRs for thrombin and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)
      on human glioblastoma cells robustly couple to RhoA and induce the matricelluar
      protein CCN1. Knockdown of either MRTF-A or YAP abrogates S1P-stimulated CCN1
      expression, demonstrating that both coactivators are required. MRTF-A and YAP are
      also both required for transcriptional control of other S1P-regulated genes in
      various cell types and for S1P-stimulated glioblastoma cell proliferation.
      Interactions between MRTF-A and YAP are suggested by their synergistic effects on
      SRE.L- and TEAD-luciferase expression. Moreover, MRTF-A and YAP associate in
      coimmunoprecipitations from S1P-stimulated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
      (ChIP) analysis of the CCN1 gene promoter demonstrated that S1P increases
      coactivator binding at the canonical transcription factor sequences.
      Unexpectedly, S1P also enhances MRTF-A binding at TEA sites. Our findings reveal 
      that GPCR- and RhoA-regulated gene expression requires dual input and integration
      of two distinct transcriptional pathways.

TI  - MicroRNA 140 Promotes Expression of Long Noncoding RNA NEAT1 in Adipogenesis.
PG  - 30-8
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00702-15 [doi]
AB  - More than 40% of the U.S. population are clinically obese and suffer from
      metabolic syndrome with an increased risk of postmenopausal estrogen
      receptor-positive breast cancer. Adipocytes are the primary component of adipose 
      tissue and are formed through adipogenesis from precursor mesenchymal stem cells.
      While the major molecular pathways of adipogenesis are understood, little is
      known about the noncoding RNA signaling networks involved in adipogenesis. Using 
      adipocyte-derived stem cells (ADSCs) isolated from wild-type and microRNA 140
      (miR-140) knockout mice, we identify a novel miR-140/long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
      NEAT1 signaling network necessary for adipogenesis. miR-140 knockout ADSCs have
      dramatically decreased adipogenic capabilities associated with downregulation of 
      NEAT1 expression. We identified a miR-140 binding site in NEAT1 and found that
      mature miR-140 in the nucleus can physically interact with NEAT1, leading to
      increased NEAT1 expression. We demonstrated that reexpression of NEAT1 in miR-140
      knockout ADSCs is sufficient to restore their ability to undergo differentiation.
      Our results reveal an exciting new noncoding RNA signaling network that regulates
      adipogenesis and that is a potential new target in the prevention or treatment of
      obesity.

TI  - Hepatic Long Intergenic Noncoding RNAs: High Promoter Conservation and Dynamic,
      Sex-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation by Growth Hormone.
PG  - 50-69
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00861-15 [doi]
AB  - Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are increasingly recognized as key
      chromatin regulators, yet few studies have characterized lincRNAs in a single
      tissue under diverse conditions. Here, we analyzed 45 mouse liver RNA sequencing 
      (RNA-Seq) data sets collected under diverse conditions to systematically
      characterize 4,961 liver lincRNAs, 59% of them novel, with regard to gene
      structures, species conservation, chromatin accessibility, transcription factor
      binding, and epigenetic states. To investigate the potential for functionality,
      we focused on the responses of the liver lincRNAs to growth hormone stimulation, 
      which imparts clinically relevant sex differences to hepatic metabolism and liver
      disease susceptibility. Sex-biased expression characterized 247 liver lincRNAs,
      with many being nuclear RNA enriched and regulated by growth hormone. The
      sex-biased lincRNA genes are enriched for nearby and correspondingly sex-biased
      accessible chromatin regions, as well as sex-biased binding sites for growth
      hormone-regulated transcriptional activators (STAT5, hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 
      [HNF6], FOXA1, and FOXA2) and transcriptional repressors (CUX2 and BCL6).
      Repression of female-specific lincRNAs in male liver, but not that of
      male-specific lincRNAs in female liver, was associated with enrichment of
      H3K27me3-associated inactive states and poised (bivalent) enhancer states.
      Strikingly, we found that liver-specific lincRNA gene promoters are more highly
      species conserved and have a significantly higher frequency of proximal binding
      by liver transcription factors than liver-specific protein-coding gene promoters.
      Orthologs for many liver lincRNAs were identified in one or more supraprimates,
      including two rat lincRNAs showing the same growth hormone-regulated, sex-biased 
      expression as their mouse counterparts. This integrative analysis of liver
      lincRNA chromatin states, transcription factor occupancy, and growth hormone
      regulation provides novel insights into the expression of sex-specific lincRNAs
      and their potential for regulation of sex differences in liver physiology and
      disease.

TI  - Dynein Light Chain LC8 Is Required for RNA Polymerase I-Mediated Transcription in
      Trypanosoma brucei, Facilitating Assembly and Promoter Binding of Class I
      Transcription Factor A.
PG  - 95-107
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00705-15 [doi]
AB  - Dynein light chain LC8 is highly conserved among eukaryotes and has both
      dynein-dependent and dynein-independent functions. Interestingly, LC8 was
      identified as a subunit of the class I transcription factor A (CITFA), which is
      essential for transcription by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) in the parasite
      Trypanosoma brucei. Given that LC8 has never been identified with a basal
      transcription factor and that T. brucei relies on RNA Pol I for expressing the
      variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), the key protein in antigenic variation, we
      investigated the CITFA-specific role of LC8. Depletion of LC8 from
      mammalian-infective bloodstream trypanosomes affected cell cycle progression,
      reduced the abundances of rRNA and VSG mRNA, and resulted in rapid cell death.
      Sedimentation analysis, coimmunoprecipitation of recombinant proteins, and
      bioinformatic analysis revealed an LC8 binding site near the N terminus of the
      subunit CITFA2. Mutation of this site prevented the formation of a CITFA2-LC8
      heterotetramer and, in vivo, was lethal, affecting assembly of a functional CITFA
      complex. Gel shift assays and UV cross-linking experiments identified CITFA2 as a
      promoter-binding CITFA subunit. Accordingly, silencing of LC8 or CITFA2 resulted 
      in a loss of CITFA from RNA Pol I promoters. Hence, we discovered an LC8
      interaction that, unprecedentedly, has a basal function in transcription.

TI  - Dissection of Thrombospondin-4 Domains Involved in Intracellular Adaptive
      Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Responsive Signaling.
PG  - 2-12
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00607-15 [doi]
AB  - Thrombospondins are a family of stress-inducible secreted glycoproteins that
      underlie tissue remodeling. We recently reported that thrombospondin-4 (Thbs4)
      has a critical intracellular function, regulating the adaptive endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) stress pathway through activating transcription factor 6alpha
      (Atf6alpha). In the present study, we dissected the domains of Thbs4 that mediate
      interactions with ER proteins, such as BiP (Grp78) and Atf6alpha, and the domains
      mediating activation of the ER stress response. Functionally, Thbs4 localized to 
      the ER and post-ER vesicles and was actively secreted from cardiomyocytes, as
      were the type III repeat (T3R) and TSP-C domains, while the LamG domain localized
      to the Golgi apparatus. We also mutated the major calcium-binding motifs within
      the T3R domain of full-length Thbs4, causing ER retention and secretion blockade.
      The T3R and TSP-C domains as well as wild-type Thbs4 and the calcium-binding
      mutant interacted with Atf6alpha, induced an adaptive ER stress response, and
      caused expansion of intracellular vesicles. In contrast, overexpression of a
      related secreted oligomeric glycoprotein, Nell2, which lacks only the T3R and
      TSP-C domains, did not cause these effects. Finally, deletion of Atf6alpha
      abrogated Thbs4-induced vesicular expansion. Taken together, these data identify 
      the critical intracellular functional domains of Thbs4, which was formerly
      thought to have only extracellular functions.

TI  - Autism-Associated Chromatin Regulator Brg1/SmarcA4 Is Required for Synapse
      Development and Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2-Mediated Synapse Remodeling.
PG  - 70-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00534-15 [doi]
AB  - Synapse development requires normal neuronal activities and the precise
      expression of synapse-related genes. Dysregulation of synaptic genes results in
      neurological diseases such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Mutations in genes
      encoding chromatin-remodeling factor Brg1/SmarcA4 and its associated proteins are
      the genetic causes of several developmental diseases with neurological defects
      and autistic symptoms. Recent large-scale genomic studies predicted Brg1/SmarcA4 
      as one of the key nodes of the ASD gene network. We report that Brg1 deletion in 
      early postnatal hippocampal neurons led to reduced dendritic spine density and
      maturation and impaired synapse activities. In developing mice, neuronal Brg1
      deletion caused severe neurological defects. Gene expression analyses indicated
      that Brg1 regulates a significant number of genes known to be involved in synapse
      function and implicated in ASD. We found that Brg1 is required for dendritic
      spine/synapse elimination mediated by the ASD-associated transcription factor
      myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and that Brg1 regulates the activity-induced
      expression of a specific subset of genes that overlap significantly with the
      targets of MEF2. Our analyses showed that Brg1 interacts with MEF2 and that MEF2 
      is required for Brg1 recruitment to target genes in response to neuron
      activation. Thus, Brg1 plays important roles in both synapse
      development/maturation and MEF2-mediated synapse remodeling. Our study reveals
      specific functions of the epigenetic regulator Brg1 in synapse development and
      provides insights into its role in neurological diseases such as ASD.

PG  - 84-94
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00589-15 [doi]
AB  - The cell cycle of neurons remains suppressed to maintain the state of
      differentiation and aberrant cell cycle reentry results in loss of neurons, which
      is a feature in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Present studies revealed that the expression of microRNA 34a (miR-34a) needs to
      be optimal in neurons, as an aberrant increase or decrease in its expression
      causes apoptosis. miR-34a keeps the neuronal cell cycle under check by preventing
      the expression of cyclin D1 and promotes cell cycle arrest. Neurotoxic amyloid
      beta1-42 peptide (Abeta42) treatment of cortical neurons suppressed miR-34a,
      resulting in unscheduled cell cycle reentry, which resulted in apoptosis. The
      repression of miR-34a was a result of degradation of TAp73, which was mediated by
      aberrant activation of the MEK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
      pathway by Abeta42. A significant decrease in miR-34a and TAp73 was observed in
      the cortex of a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD, which correlated well with
      cell cycle reentry observed in the neurons of these animals. Importantly, the
      overexpression of TAp73alpha and miR-34a reversed cell cycle-related neuronal
      apoptosis (CRNA). These studies provide novel insights into how modulation of
      neuronal cell cycle machinery may lead to neurodegeneration and may contribute to
      the understanding of disorders like AD.

TI  - beta-Catenin Upregulates the Constitutive and Virus-Induced Transcriptional
      Capacity of the Interferon Beta Promoter through T-Cell Factor Binding Sites.
PG  - 13-29
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00641-15 [doi]
AB  - Rapid upregulation of interferon beta (IFN-beta) expression following virus
      infection is essential to set up an efficient innate antiviral response.
      Biological roles related to the antiviral and immune response have also been
      associated with the constitutive production of IFN-beta in naive cells. However, 
      the mechanisms capable of modulating constitutive IFN-beta expression in the
      absence of infection remain largely unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that
      inhibition of the kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) leads to the
      upregulation of the constitutive level of IFN-beta expression in noninfected
      cells, provided that GSK-3 inhibition is correlated with the binding of
      beta-catenin to the IFN-beta promoter. Under these conditions, IFN-beta
      expression occurred through the T-cell factor (TCF) binding sites present on the 
      IFN-beta promoter independently of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3).
      Enhancement of the constitutive level of IFN-beta per se was able to confer an
      efficient antiviral state to naive cells and acted in synergy with virus
      infection to stimulate virus-induced IFN-beta expression. Further emphasizing the
      role of beta-catenin in the innate antiviral response, we show here that highly
      pathogenic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) targets the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway
      and the formation of active TCF/beta-catenin complexes at the transcriptional and
      protein level in RVFV-infected cells and mice.

AB  - Chronic inflammation underlies the pathological progression of various diseases, 
      and thus many efforts have been made to quantitatively evaluate the inflammatory 
      status of the diseases. In this study, we generated a highly sensitive
      inflammation-monitoring mouse system using a bacterial artificial chromosome
      (BAC) clone containing extended flanking sequences of the human interleukin 6
      gene (hIL6) locus, in which the luciferase (Luc) reporter gene is integrated
      (hIL6-BAC-Luc). We successfully monitored lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic
      inflammation in various tissues of the hIL6-BAC-Luc mice using an in vivo
      bioluminescence imaging system. When two chronic inflammatory disease models,
      i.e., a genetic model of atopic dermatitis and a model of experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE), were applied to the hIL6-BAC-Luc mice, luciferase
      bioluminescence was specifically detected in the atopic skin lesion and central
      nervous system, respectively. Moreover, the Luc activities correlated well with
      the disease severity. Nrf2 is a master transcription factor that regulates
      antioxidative and detoxification enzyme genes. Upon EAE induction, the
      Nrf2-deficient mice crossed with the hIL6-BAC-Luc mice exhibited enhanced
      neurological symptoms concomitantly with robust luciferase luminescence in the
      neuronal tissue. Thus, whole-body in vivo monitoring using the hIL6-BAC-Luc
      transgenic system (WIM-6 system) provides a new and powerful diagnostic tool for 
      real-time in vivo monitoring of inflammatory status in multiple different disease
      models.

TI  - Critical Roles of the LIM Domains of Lhx3 in Recruiting Coactivators to the Motor
      Neuron-Specifying Isl1-Lhx3 Complex.
PG  - 3579-89
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00335-15 [doi]
AB  - During spinal cord development, the LIM domains of the LIM homeodomain factor
      Lhx3 bind to either the LIM cofactor nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) or another LIM 
      homeodomain factor, Isl1, assembling the tetrameric V2 interneuron-specifying
      Lhx3 complex (2NLI:2Lhx3) or the hexameric motor neuron-specifying Isl1-Lhx3
      complex (2NLI:2Isl1:2Lhx3). However, the detailed molecular basis by which the
      Lhx3-LIM domains contribute to motor neuron specification still remains poorly
      understood. Here, we show that the Lhx3-LIM domains are essential for recruiting 
      transcriptional coactivators to the Isl1-Lhx3 complex. Using a yeast genetic
      screening system, we identify Lhx3 point mutants that bind to NLI but not Isl1.
      Accordingly, these mutants fail to assemble the Isl1-Lhx3 complex. However, their
      interaction with coactivators is relatively intact, and they are fully functional
      in the Lhx3 complex and V2 interneuron specification. Interestingly, when these
      Lhx3 mutants are directly fused to Isl1, their transcriptional activity in the
      Isl1-Lhx3 complex is restored. We further show that this restoration reflects an 
      unexpected role of the Lhx3-LIM domains, likely together with Isl1, to form an
      interaction interface for coactivators. Our results suggest that the Lhx3-LIM
      domains play critical roles in transactivation of the Isl1-Lhx3 complex by not
      only directing the assembly of the Isl1-Lhx3 complex but also recruiting
      coactivators to the complex.

      Chromatin Organization.
PG  - 3504-16
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00514-15 [doi]
AB  - Developmental stage-specific enhancer-promoter-insulator interactions regulate
      the chromatin configuration necessary for transcription at various loci and
      additionally for VDJ recombination at antigen receptor loci that encode
      immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors. To investigate these regulatory
      interactions, we analyzed the epigenetic landscape of the murine T-cell receptor 
      beta (TCRbeta) locus in the presence and absence of an ectopic CTCF-dependent
      enhancer-blocking insulator, H19-ICR, in genetically manipulated mice. Our
      analysis demonstrated the ability of the H19-ICR insulator to restrict several
      aspects of enhancer-based chromatin alterations that are observed during
      activation of the TCRbeta locus for transcription and recombination. The H19-ICR 
      insulator abrogated enhancer-promoter contact-dependent chromatin alterations and
      additionally prevented Ebeta-mediated histone modifications that have been
      suggested to be independent of enhancer-promoter interaction. Observed
      enhancer-promoter-insulator interactions, in conjunction with the chromatin
      structure of the Ebeta-regulated domain at the nucleosomal level, provide useful 
      insights regarding the activity of the regulatory elements in addition to
      supporting the accessibility hypothesis of VDJ recombination. Analysis of H19-ICR
      in the heterologous context of the developmentally regulated TCRbeta locus
      suggests that different mechanisms proposed for CTCF-dependent insulator action
      might be manifested simultaneously or selectively depending on the genomic
      context and the nature of enhancer activity being curtailed.

      Let-7-HMGA2-Cyclin A2 Pathway.
PG  - 3547-65
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00400-15 [doi]
AB  - Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2,
      suggesting HDACs as therapeutic targets for cancer and diseases linked to
      abnormal cell growth and proliferation. Many HDACs are transcriptional
      repressors. Some may alter cell cycle progression by deacetylating histones and
      repressing transcription of key cell cycle regulatory genes. Here, we report that
      HDAC10 regulates the cell cycle via modulation of cyclin A2 expression, and
      cyclin A2 overexpression rescues HDAC10 knockdown-induced G2/M transition arrest.
      HDAC10 regulates cyclin A2 expression by deacetylating histones near the let-7
      promoter, thereby repressing transcription. In HDAC10 knockdown cells, let-7f and
      microRNA 98 (miR-98) were upregulated and the let-7 family target, HMGA2, was
      downregulated. HMGA2 loss resulted in enrichment of the transcriptional repressor
      E4F at the cyclin A2 promoter. These findings support a role for HDACs in cell
      cycle regulation, reveal a novel mechanism of HDAC10 action, and extend the
      potential of HDACs as targets in diseases of cell cycle dysregulation.

      and T-Cell Factor 4/AP-1 Interactions in Human Colorectal Cancer Cells.
PG  - 3471-90
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00030-15 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) is tumor
      suppressive in the liver but amplified in colon cancer, suggesting that it also
      might be oncogenic. To investigate whether this discrepancy is due to different
      HNF4alpha isoforms derived from its two promoters (P1 and P2), we generated
      Tet-On-inducible human colon cancer (HCT116) cell lines that express either the
      P1-driven (HNF4alpha2) or P2-driven (HNF4alpha8) isoform and analyzed them for
      tumor growth and global changes in gene expression (transcriptome sequencing
      [RNA-seq] and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]). The results
      show that while HNF4alpha2 acts as a tumor suppressor in the HCT116 tumor
      xenograft model, HNF4alpha8 does not. Each isoform regulates the expression of
      distinct sets of genes and recruits, colocalizes, and competes in a distinct
      fashion with the Wnt/beta-catenin mediator T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) at CTTTG motifs
      as well as at AP-1 motifs (TGAXTCA). Protein binding microarrays (PBMs) show that
      HNF4alpha and TCF4 share some but not all binding motifs and that single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in sites bound by both HNF4alpha and TCF4 can
      alter binding affinity in vitro, suggesting that they could play a role in cancer
      susceptibility in vivo. Thus, the HNF4alpha isoforms play distinct roles in colon
      cancer, which could be due to differential interactions with the
      Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF4 and AP-1 pathways.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01286-14 [doi]
AB  - Aurora kinase B, one of the three members of the mammalian Aurora kinase family, 
      is the catalytic component of the chromosomal passenger complex, an essential
      regulator of chromosome segregation in mitosis. Aurora B is overexpressed in
      human tumors although whether this kinase may function as an oncogene in vivo is 
      not established. Here, we report a new mouse model in which expression of the
      endogenous Aurkb locus can be induced in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of
      Aurora B in cultured cells induces defective chromosome segregation and
      aneuploidy. Long-term overexpression of Aurora B in vivo results in aneuploidy
      and the development of multiple spontaneous tumors in adult mice, including a
      high incidence of lymphomas. Overexpression of Aurora B also results in a reduced
      DNA damage response and decreased levels of the p53 target p21(Cip1) in vitro and
      in vivo, in line with an inverse correlation between Aurora B and p21(Cip1)
      expression in human leukemias. Thus, overexpression of Aurora B may contribute to
      tumor formation not only by inducing chromosomal instability but also by
      suppressing the function of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1).

TI  - S6 Kinase- and beta-TrCP2-Dependent Degradation of p19Arf Is Required for Cell
      Proliferation.
PG  - 3517-27
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00343-15 [doi]
AB  - The kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) promotes translation as well as
      cell survival and proliferation under nutrient-rich conditions. Whereas mTOR
      activates translation through ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), how it facilitates cell
      proliferation has remained unclear. We have now identified p19(Arf), an inhibitor
      of cell cycle progression, as a novel substrate of S6K that is targeted to
      promote cell proliferation. Serum stimulation induced activation of the mTOR-S6K 
      axis and consequent phosphorylation of p19(Arf) at Ser(75). Phosphorylated
      p19(Arf) was then recognized by the F-box protein beta-TrCP2 and degraded by the 
      proteasome. Ablation of beta-TrCP2 thus led to the arrest of cell proliferation
      as a result of the stabilization and accumulation of p19(Arf). The beta-TrCP2
      paralog beta-TrCP1 had no effect on p19(Arf) stability, suggesting that
      phosphorylated p19(Arf) is a specific substrate of beta-TrCP2. Mice deficient in 
      beta-TrCP2 manifested accumulation of p19(Arf) in the yolk sac and died in utero.
      Our results suggest that the mTOR pathway promotes cell proliferation via
      beta-TrCP2-dependent p19(Arf) degradation under nutrient-rich conditions.

TI  - The NF45/NF90 Heterodimer Contributes to the Biogenesis of 60S Ribosomal Subunits
      and Influences Nucleolar Morphology.
PG  - 3491-503
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00306-15 [doi]
AB  - The interleukin enhancer binding factors ILF2 (NF45) and ILF3 (NF90/NF110) have
      been implicated in various cellular pathways, such as transcription, microRNA
      (miRNA) processing, DNA repair, and translation, in mammalian cells. Using tandem
      affinity purification, we identified human NF45 and NF90 as components of
      precursors to 60S (pre-60S) ribosomal subunits. NF45 and NF90 are enriched in
      nucleoli and cosediment with pre-60S ribosomal particles in density gradient
      analysis. We show that association of the NF45/NF90 heterodimer with pre-60S
      ribosomal particles requires the double-stranded RNA binding domains of NF90,
      while depletion of NF45 and NF90 by RNA interference leads to a defect in 60S
      biogenesis. Nucleoli of cells depleted of NF45 and NF90 have altered morphology
      and display a characteristic spherical shape. These effects are not due to
      impaired rRNA transcription or processing of the precursors to 28S rRNA.
      Consistent with a role of the NF45/NF90 heterodimer in nucleolar steps of 60S
      subunit biogenesis, downregulation of NF45 and NF90 leads to a p53 response,
      accompanied by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/CIP1, which
      can be counteracted by depletion of RPL11. Together, these data indicate that
      NF45 and NF90 are novel higher-eukaryote-specific factors required for the
      maturation of 60S ribosomal subunits.

      Hypertension-Driven Renal Dysfunctions.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00518-15 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension-associated cardiorenal diseases represent one of the heaviest
      burdens for current health systems. In addition to hemodynamic damage, recent
      results have revealed that hematopoietic cells contribute to the development of
      these diseases by generating proinflammatory and profibrotic environments in the 
      heart and kidney. However, the cell subtypes involved remain poorly
      characterized. Here we report that CD39(+) regulatory T (TREG) cells utilize an
      immunosuppression-independent mechanism to counteract renal and possibly cardiac 
      damage during angiotensin II (AngII)-dependent hypertension. This mechanism
      relies on the direct apoptosis of tissue-resident neutrophils by the ecto-ATP
      diphosphohydrolase activity of CD39. In agreement with this, experimental and
      genetic alterations in TREG/TH cell ratios have a direct impact on
      tissue-resident neutrophil numbers, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiorenal
      fibrosis, and, to a lesser extent, arterial pressure elevation during
      AngII-driven hypertension. These results indicate that TREG cells constitute a
      first protective barrier against hypertension-driven tissue fibrosis and, in
      addition, suggest new therapeutic avenues to prevent hypertension-linked
      cardiorenal diseases.

TI  - A Pro-Nerve Growth Factor (proNGF) and NGF Binding Protein, alpha2-Macroglobulin,
      Differentially Regulates p75 and TrkA Receptors and Is Relevant to
      Neurodegeneration Ex Vivo and In Vivo.
PG  - 3396-408
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00544-15 [doi]
AB  - Nerve growth factor (NGF) is generated from a precursor, proNGF, that is
      proteolytically processed. NGF preferentially binds a trophic tyrosine kinase
      receptor, TrkA, while proNGF binds a neurotrophin receptor (NTR), p75(NTR), that 
      can have neurotoxic activity. Previously, we along with others showed that the
      soluble protein alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) is neurotoxic. Toxicity is due in 
      part to alpha2M binding to NGF and inhibiting trophic activity, presumably by
      preventing NGF binding to TrkA. However, the mechanisms remained unclear. Here,
      we show ex vivo and in vivo three mechanisms for alpha2M neurotoxicity. First,
      unexpectedly the alpha2M-NGF complexes do bind TrkA receptors but do not induce
      TrkA dimerization or activation, resulting in deficient trophic support. Second, 
      alpha2M makes stable complexes with proNGF, conveying resistance to proteolysis
      that results in more proNGF and less NGF. Third, alpha2M-proNGF complexes bind
      p75(NTR) and are more potent agonists than free proNGF, inducing tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production. Hence, alpha2M regulates proNGF/p75(NTR)
      positively and mature NGF/TrkA negatively, causing neuronal death ex vivo. These 
      three mechanisms are operative in vivo, and alpha2M causes neurodegeneration in a
      p75(NTR)- and proNGF-dependent manner. alpha2M could be exploited as a
      therapeutic target, or as a modifier of neurotrophin signals.

TI  - CRB3A Controls the Morphology and Cohesion of Cancer Cells through
      Ehm2/p114RhoGEF-Dependent Signaling.
PG  - 3423-35
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00673-15 [doi]
AB  - The transmembrane protein CRB3A controls epithelial cell polarization.
      Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of CRB3A function is essential as this
      protein prevents the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which
      contributes to tumor progression. To investigate the functional impact of altered
      CRB3A expression in cancer cells, we expressed CRB3A in HeLa cells, which are
      devoid of endogenous CRB3A. While control HeLa cells display a patchy F-actin
      distribution, CRB3A-expressing cells form a circumferential actomyosin belt. This
      reorganization of the cytoskeleton is accompanied by a transition from an ameboid
      cell shape to an epithelial-cell-like morphology. In addition, CRB3A increases
      the cohesion of HeLa cells. To perform these functions, CRB3A recruits p114RhoGEF
      and its activator Ehm2 to the cell periphery using both functional motifs of its 
      cytoplasmic tail and increases RhoA activation levels. ROCK1 and ROCK2 (ROCK1/2),
      which are critical effectors of RhoA, are also essential to modulate the
      cytoskeleton and cell shape downstream of CRB3A. Overall, our study highlights
      novel roles for CRB3A and deciphers the signaling pathway conferring to CRB3A the
      ability to fulfill these functions. Thereby, our data will facilitate further
      investigation of CRB3A functions and increase our understanding of the cellular
      defects associated with the loss of CRB3A expression in cancer cells.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00189-15 [doi]
AB  - Starvation of diploid cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces
      them to enter meiosis and differentiate into haploid spores. During meiosis, the 
      precise timing of gene expression is controlled at the level of transcription,
      and also translation. If cells are returned to rich medium after they have
      committed to meiosis, the transcript levels of most meiotically upregulated genes
      decrease rapidly. However, for a subset of transcripts whose translation is
      delayed until the end of meiosis II, termed protected transcripts, the transcript
      levels remain stable even after nutrients are reintroduced. The Ime2-Rim4
      regulatory circuit controls both the delayed translation and the stability of
      protected transcripts. These protected mRNAs localize in discrete foci, which are
      not seen for transcripts of genes with different translational timing and are
      regulated by Ime2. These results suggest that Ime2 and Rim4 broadly regulate
      translational delay but that additional factors, such as mRNA localization,
      modulate this delay to tune the timing of gene expression to developmental
      transitions during sporulation.

TI  - Characterization of the Human Transcription Elongation Factor Rtf1: Evidence for 
      Nonoverlapping Functions of Rtf1 and the Paf1 Complex.
PG  - 3459-70
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00601-15 [doi]
AB  - Restores TBP function 1 (Rtf1) is generally considered to be a subunit of the
      Paf1 complex (PAF1C), a multifunctional protein complex involved in histone
      modification and transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation. Rtf1,
      however, is not stably associated with the PAF1C in most species except
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its biochemical functions are not well understood. 
      Here, we show that human Rtf1 is a transcription elongation factor that may
      function independently of the PAF1C. Rtf1 requires "Rtf1 coactivator" activity,
      which is most likely unrelated to the PAF1C or DSIF, for transcriptional
      activation in vitro. A mutational study revealed that the Plus3 domain of human
      Rtf1 is critical for its coactivator-dependent function. Transcriptome sequencing
      (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies in HeLa cells showed that
      Rtf1 and the PAF1C play distinct roles in regulating the expression of a subset
      of genes. Moreover, contrary to the finding in S. cerevisiae, the PAF1C was
      apparently recruited to the genes examined in an Rtf1-independent manner. The
      present study establishes a role for human Rtf1 as a transcription elongation
      factor and highlights the similarities and differences between the S. cerevisiae 
      and human Rtf1 proteins.

TI  - C/EBPbeta and Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells Differentially Regulate
      Adamts-1 Induction by Stimuli Associated with Vascular Remodeling.
PG  - 3409-22
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00494-15 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that the metalloproteinase Adamts-1 plays a
      significant role in the pathophysiology of vessel remodeling, but little is known
      about the signaling pathways that control Adamts-1 expression. We show that
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiotensin-II, interleukin-1beta, and
      tumor necrosis factor alpha, stimuli implicated in pathological vascular
      remodeling, increase Adamts-1 expression in endothelial and vascular smooth
      muscle cells. Analysis of the intracellular signaling pathways implicated in this
      process revealed that VEGF and angiotensin-II upregulate Adamts-1 expression via 
      activation of differential signaling pathways that ultimately promote functional 
      binding of the NFAT or C/EBPbeta transcription factors, respectively, to the
      Adamts-1 promoter. Infusion of mice with angiotensin-II triggered phosphorylation
      and nuclear translocation of C/EBPbeta proteins in aortic cells concomitantly
      with an increase in the expression of Adamts-1, further underscoring the
      importance of C/EBPbeta signaling in angiotensin-II-induced upregulation of
      Adamts-1. Similarly, VEGF promoted NFAT activation and subsequent Adamts-1
      induction in aortic wall in a calcineurin-dependent manner. Our results
      demonstrate that Adamts-1 upregulation by inducers of pathological vascular
      remodeling is mediated by specific signal transduction pathways involving NFAT or
      C/EBPbeta transcription factors. Targeting of these pathways may prove useful in 
      the treatment of vascular disease.

AB  - Loss of the RNA-binding protein Bicaudal-C (Bicc1) provokes renal and pancreatic 
      cysts as well as ectopic Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during visceral left-right
      patterning. Renal cysts are linked to defective silencing of Bicc1 target mRNAs, 
      including adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6). RNA binding of Bicc1 is mediated by
      N-terminal KH domains, whereas a C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM)
      self-polymerizes in vitro and localizes Bicc1 in cytoplasmic foci in vivo. To
      assess a role for multimerization in silencing, we conducted structure modeling
      and then mutated the SAM domain residues which in this model were predicted to
      polymerize Bicc1 in a left-handed helix. We show that a SAM-SAM interface
      concentrates Bicc1 in cytoplasmic clusters to specifically localize and silence
      bound mRNA. In addition, defective polymerization decreases Bicc1 stability and
      thus indirectly attenuates inhibition of Dishevelled 2 in the Wnt/beta-catenin
      pathway. Importantly, aberrant C-terminal extension of the SAM domain in bpk
      mutant Bicc1 phenocopied these defects. We conclude that polymerization is a
      novel disease-relevant mechanism both to stabilize Bicc1 and to present
      associated mRNAs in specific silencing platforms.

TI  - Distinct Intracellular Domain Substrate Modifications Selectively Regulate
      Ectodomain Cleavage of NRG1 or CD44.
PG  - 3381-95
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00500-15 [doi]
AB  - Ectodomain cleavage by A-disintegrin and -metalloproteases (ADAMs) releases many 
      important biologically active substrates and is therefore tightly controlled.
      Part of the regulation occurs on the level of the enzymes and affects their cell 
      surface abundance and catalytic activity. ADAM-dependent proteolysis occurs
      outside the plasma membrane but is mostly controlled by intracellular signals.
      However, the intracellular domains (ICDs) of ADAM10 and -17 can be removed
      without consequences for induced cleavage, and so far it is unclear how
      intracellular signals address cleavage. We therefore explored whether substrates 
      themselves could be chosen for proteolysis via ICD modification. We report here
      that CD44 (ADAM10 substrate), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) coreceptor
      required for cellular migration, and pro-NRG1 (ADAM17 substrate), which releases 
      the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand neuregulin required for axonal outgrowth
      and myelination, are indeed posttranslationally modified at their ICDs.
      Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)-induced CD44 cleavage requires
      dephosphorylation of ICD serine 291, while induced neuregulin release depends on 
      the phosphorylation of several NRG1-ICD serines, in part mediated by protein
      kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta). Downregulation of PKCdelta inhibits neuregulin release 
      and reduces ex vivo neurite outgrowth and myelination of trigeminal ganglion
      explants. Our results suggest that specific selection among numerous substrates
      of a given ADAM is determined by ICD modification of the substrate.

TI  - Structures and Functions of the Multiple KOW Domains of Transcription Elongation 
      Factor Spt5.
PG  - 3354-69
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00520-15 [doi]
AB  - The eukaryotic Spt4-Spt5 heterodimer forms a higher-order complex with RNA
      polymerase II (and I) to regulate transcription elongation. Extensive genetic and
      functional data have revealed diverse roles of Spt4-Spt5 in coupling elongation
      with chromatin modification and RNA-processing pathways. A mechanistic
      understanding of the diverse functions of Spt4-Spt5 is hampered by challenges in 
      resolving the distribution of functions among its structural domains, including
      the five KOW domains in Spt5, and a lack of their high-resolution structures. We 
      present high-resolution crystallographic results demonstrating that distinct
      structures are formed by the first through third KOW domains (KOW1-Linker1 [K1L1]
      and KOW2-KOW3) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt5. The structure reveals that K1L1 
      displays a positively charged patch (PCP) on its surface, which binds nucleic
      acids in vitro, as shown in biochemical assays, and is important for in vivo
      function, as shown in growth assays. Furthermore, assays in yeast have shown that
      the PCP has a function that partially overlaps that of Spt4. Synthesis of our
      results with previous evidence suggests a model in which Spt4 and the K1L1 domain
      of Spt5 form functionally overlapping interactions with nucleic acids upstream of
      the transcription bubble, and this mechanism may confer robustness on processes
      associated with transcription elongation.

      Element.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00509-15 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic gene expression is often controlled by distant regulatory elements. In
      developing B lymphocytes, transcription is associated with V(D)J recombination at
      immunoglobulin loci. This process is regulated by remote cis-acting elements. At 
      the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus, the 3' regulatory region (3'RR)
      promotes transcription in mature B cells. This led to the notion that the 3'RR
      orchestrates the IgH locus activity at late stages of B cell maturation only.
      However, long-range interactions involving the 3'RR were detected in early B
      cells, but the functional consequences of these interactions were unknown. Here
      we show that not only does the 3'RR affect transcription at distant sites within 
      the IgH variable region but also it conveys a transcriptional silencing activity 
      on both sense and antisense transcription. The 3'RR-mediated silencing activity
      is switched off upon completion of VH-DJH recombination. Our findings reveal a
      developmentally controlled, stage-dependent shift in the transcriptional activity
      of a master regulatory element.

TI  - Orphan Nuclear Receptor Nur77 Inhibits Cardiac Hypertrophic Response to
      Beta-Adrenergic Stimulation.
PG  - 3312-23
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00229-15 [doi]
AB  - The orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 plays critical roles in cardiovascular
      diseases, and its expression is markedly induced in the heart after
      beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) activation. However, the functional
      significance of Nur77 in beta-AR signaling in the heart remains unclear. By using
      Northern blot, Western blot, and immunofluorescent staining assays, we showed
      that Nur77 expression was markedly upregulated in cardiomyocytes in response to
      multiple hypertrophic stimuli, including isoproterenol (ISO), phenylephrine (PE),
      and endothelin-1 (ET-1). In a time- and dose-dependent manner, ISO increases
      Nur77 expression in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of Nur77
      markedly inhibited ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy by inducing nuclear
      translocation of Nur77 in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, cardiac overexpression of 
      Nur77 by intramyocardial injection of Ad-Nur77 substantially inhibited cardiac
      hypertrophy and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction after chronic infusion of ISO in 
      mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Nur77 functionally interacts with
      NFATc3 and GATA4 and inhibits their transcriptional activities, which are
      critical for the development of cardiac hypertrophy. These results demonstrate
      for the first time that Nur77 is a novel negative regulator for the
      beta-AR-induced cardiac hypertrophy through inhibiting the NFATc3 and GATA4
      transcriptional pathways. Targeting Nur77 may represent a potentially novel
      therapeutic strategy for preventing cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

TI  - RIP1 Cleavage in the Kinase Domain Regulates TRAIL-Induced NF-kappaB Activation
      and Lymphoma Survival.
PG  - 3324-38
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00692-15 [doi]
AB  - Although TRAIL is considered a potential anticancer agent, it enhances tumor
      progression by activating NF-kappaB in apoptosis-resistant cells. Cellular
      FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) overexpression and caspase-8 activation
      have been implicated in TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB activation; however, the
      underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that caspase-8-dependent
      cleavage of RIP1 in the kinase domain (KD) and intermediate domain (ID)
      determines the activation state of the NF-kappaB pathway in response to tumor
      necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment. In
      apoptosis-sensitive cells, caspase-8 cleaves RIP1 in the KD and ID immediately
      after the recruitment of RIP1 to the receptor complex, impairing IkappaB kinase
      (IKK) recruitment and NF-kappaB activation. In apoptosis-resistant cells, cFLIP
      restricts caspase-8 activity, resulting in limited RIP1 cleavage and generation
      of a KD-cleaved fragment capable of activating NF-kappaB but not apoptosis.
      Notably, depletion of the cytoplasmic pool of TRAF2 and cIAP1 in lymphomas by
      CD40 ligation inhibits basal RIP1 ubiquitination but does not prompt cell death, 
      due to CD40L-induced cFLIP expression and limited RIP1 cleavage. Inhibition of
      RIP1 cleavage at the KD suppresses NF-kappaB activation and cell survival even in
      cFLIP-overexpressing lymphomas. Importantly, RIP1 is constitutively cleaved in
      human and mouse lymphomas, suggesting that cFLIP-mediated and caspase-8-dependent
      limited cleavage of RIP1 is a new layer of mechanism that promotes NF-kappaB
      activation and lymphoma survival.

TI  - Deubiquitinase USP47/UBP64E Regulates beta-Catenin Ubiquitination and Degradation
      and Plays a Positive Role in Wnt Signaling.
PG  - 3301-11
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00373-15 [doi]
AB  - Wnt signaling plays important roles in development and tumorigenesis. A central
      question about the Wnt pathway is the regulation of beta-catenin. Phosphorylation
      of beta-catenin by CK1alpha and GSK3 promotes beta-catenin binding to beta-TrCP, 
      leading to beta-catenin degradation through the proteasome. The phosphorylation
      and ubiquitination of beta-catenin have been well characterized; however, it is
      unknown whether and how a deubiquitinase is involved. In this study, by screening
      RNA interference (RNAi) libraries, we identified USP47 as a deubiquitinase that
      prevents beta-catenin ubiquitination. Inactivation of USP47 by RNAi increased
      beta-catenin ubiquitination, attenuated Wnt signaling, and repressed cancer cell 
      growth. Furthermore, USP47 deubiquitinates itself, whereas beta-TrCP promotes
      USP47 ubiquitination through interaction with an atypical motif in USP47.
      Finally, in vivo studies in the Drosophila wing suggest that UBP64E, the USP47
      counterpart in Drosophila, is required for Armadillo stabilization and plays a
      positive role in regulating Wnt target gene expression.

      Independently of p110alpha Kinase Activity.
PG  - 3258-73
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00471-15 [doi]
AB  - The phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit
      p110alpha is the most frequently mutated kinase in human cancer, and the hot spot
      mutations E542K, E545K, and H1047R are the most common mutations in p110alpha.
      Very little is known about the metabolic consequences of the hot spot mutations
      of p110alpha in vivo. In this study, we used adenoviral gene transfer in mice to 
      investigate the effects of the E545K and H1047R mutations on hepatic and
      whole-body glucose metabolism. We show that hepatic expression of these hot spot 
      mutations results in rapid hepatic steatosis, paradoxically accompanied by
      increased glucose tolerance, and marked glycogen accumulation. In contrast,
      wild-type p110alpha expression does not lead to hepatic accumulation of lipids or
      glycogen despite similar degrees of upregulated glycolysis and expression of
      lipogenic genes. The reprogrammed metabolism of the E545K and H1047R p110alpha
      mutants was surprisingly not dependent on altered p110alpha lipid kinase
      activity.

TI  - Islet Cells Serve as Cells of Origin of Pancreatic Gastrin-Positive Endocrine
      Tumors.
PG  - 3274-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00302-15 [doi]
AB  - The cells of origin of pancreatic gastrinomas remain an enigma, since no
      gastrin-expressing cells are found in the normal adult pancreas. It was proposed 
      that the cellular origin of pancreatic gastrinomas may come from either the
      pancreatic cells themselves or gastrin-expressing cells which have migrated from 
      the duodenum. In the current study, we further characterized previously described
      transient pancreatic gastrin-expressing cells using cell lineage tracing in a
      pan-pancreatic progenitor and a pancreatic endocrine progenitor model. We provide
      evidence showing that pancreatic gastrin-expressing cells, found from embryonic
      day 12.5 until postnatal day 7, are derived from pancreatic Ptf1a(+) and
      neurogenin 3-expressing (Ngn3(+)) progenitors. Importantly, the majority of them 
      coexpress glucagon, with 4% coexpressing insulin, indicating that they are a
      temporary subpopulation of both alpha and beta cells. Interestingly, Men1
      disruption in both Ngn3 progenitors and beta and alpha cells resulted in the
      development of pancreatic gastrin-expressing tumors, suggesting that the latter
      developed from islet cells. Finally, we detected gastrin expression using three
      human cohorts with pancreatic endocrine tumors (pNETs) that have not been
      diagnosed as gastrinomas (in 9/34 pNETs from 6/14 patients with multiple
      endocrine neoplasia type 1, in 5/35 sporadic nonfunctioning pNETs, and in 2/20
      sporadic insulinomas), consistent with observations made in mouse models. Our
      work provides insight into the histogenesis of pancreatic gastrin-expressing
      tumors.

TI  - Expression of the CTCFL Gene during Mouse Embryogenesis Causes Growth
      Retardation, Postnatal Lethality, and Dysregulation of the Transforming Growth
      Factor beta Pathway.
PG  - 3436-45
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00381-15 [doi]
AB  - CTCFL, a paralog of CTCF, also known as BORIS (brother of regulator of imprinted 
      sites), is a testis-expressed gene whose function is largely unknown. Its product
      is a cancer testis antigen (CTA), and it is often expressed in tumor cells and
      also seen in two benign human vascular malformations, juvenile angiofibromas and 
      infantile hemangiomas. To understand the function of Ctcfl, we created
      tetracycline-inducible Ctcfl transgenic mice. We show that Ctcfl expression
      during embryogenesis results in growth retardation, eye malformations, multiorgan
      pathologies, vascular defects, and neonatal death. This phenotype resembles prior
      mouse models that perturb the transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) pathway.
      Embryonic stem (ES) cells with the Ctcfl transgene reproduce the phenotype in ES 
      cell-tetraploid chimeras. Transcriptome sequencing of the Ctcfl ES cells revealed
      14 genes deregulated by Ctcfl expression. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the
      TGFB pathway as most affected by embryonic Ctcfl expression. Understanding the
      consequence of Ctcfl expression in nontesticular cells and elucidating downstream
      targets of Ctcfl could explain the role of its product as a CTA and its
      involvement in two, if not more, human vascular malformations.

TI  - Impact of the N-Terminal Domain of STAT3 in STAT3-Dependent Transcriptional
      Activity.
PG  - 3284-300
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00060-15 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor STAT3 is constitutively active in many cancers, where it
      mediates important biological effects, including cell proliferation,
      differentiation, survival, and angiogenesis. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of STAT3
      performs multiple functions, such as cooperative DNA binding, nuclear
      translocation, and protein-protein interactions. However, it is unclear which
      subsets of STAT3 target genes depend on the NTD for transcriptional regulation.
      To identify such genes, we compared gene expression in STAT3-null mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts (MEFs) stably expressing wild-type STAT3 or STAT3 from which NTD was 
      deleted. NTD deletion reduced the cytokine-induced expression of specific STAT3
      target genes by decreasing STAT3 binding to their regulatory regions. To better
      understand the potential mechanisms of this effect, we determined the crystal
      structure of the STAT3 NTD and identified a dimer interface responsible for
      cooperative DNA binding in vitro. We also observed an Ni(2+)-mediated oligomer
      with an as yet unknown biological function. Mutations on both dimer and
      Ni(2+)-mediated interfaces affected the cytokine induction of STAT3 target genes.
      These studies shed light on the role of the NTD in transcriptional regulation by 
      STAT3 and provide a structural template with which to design STAT3 NTD inhibitors
      with potential therapeutic value.

TI  - Hypogonadism Associated with Cyp19a1 (Aromatase) Posttranscriptional Upregulation
      in Celf1 Knockout Mice.
PG  - 3244-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00074-15 [doi]
AB  - CELF1 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that controls several aspects of
      RNA fate. The targeted disruption of the Celf1 gene in mice causes male
      infertility due to impaired spermiogenesis, the postmeiotic differentiation of
      male gametes. Here, we investigated the molecular reasons that underlie this
      testicular phenotype. By measuring sex hormone levels, we detected low
      concentrations of testosterone in Celf1-null mice. We investigated the effect of 
      Celf1 disruption on the expression levels of steroidogenic enzyme genes, and we
      observed that Cyp19a1 was upregulated. Cyp19a1 encodes aromatase, which
      transforms testosterone into estradiol. Administration of testosterone or the
      aromatase inhibitor letrozole partly rescued the spermiogenesis defects,
      indicating that a lack of testosterone associated with excessive aromatase
      contributes to the testicular phenotype. In vivo and in vitro interaction assays 
      demonstrated that CELF1 binds to Cyp19a1 mRNA, and reporter assays supported the 
      conclusion that CELF1 directly represses Cyp19a1 translation. We conclude that
      CELF1 downregulates Cyp19a1 (Aromatase) posttranscriptionally to achieve high
      concentrations of testosterone compatible with spermiogenesis completion. We
      discuss the implications of these findings with respect to reproductive defects
      in men, including patients suffering from isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 
      and myotonic dystrophy type I.

TI  - ARTD1 Suppresses Interleukin 6 Expression by Repressing MLL1-Dependent Histone H3
      Trimethylation.
PG  - 3189-99
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00196-15 [doi]
AB  - ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria-toxin like 1/poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
      (ARTD1/PARP1) is a chromatin-associated protein in the nucleus and plays an
      important role in different cellular processes such as regulation of gene
      transcription. ARTD1 has been shown to coregulate the inflammatory response by
      modulating the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB
      (NF-kappaB), the principal regulator of interleukin 6 (IL-6), an important
      inflammatory cytokine implicated in a variety of diseases such as cancer.
      However, to what extent and how ARTD1 regulates IL-6 transcription has not been
      clear. Here, we show that ARTD1 suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 
      expression in macrophages, without affecting the recruitment of the NF-kappaB
      subunit RelA to the IL-6 promoter and independent of its enzymatic activity.
      Interestingly, knockdown of ARTD1 did not alter H3 occupancy but increased
      LPS-induced trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a hallmark of
      transcriptionally active genes. We found that ARTD1 mediates its effect through
      the methyltransferase MLL1, by catalyzing H3K4me3 at the IL-6 promoter and
      forming a complex with NF-kappaB. These results demonstrate that ARTD1 modulates 
      IL-6 expression by regulating the function of an NF-kappaB enhanceosome complex, 
      which involves MLL1 and does not require ADP-ribosylation.

TI  - PU.1-Regulated Long Noncoding RNA lnc-MC Controls Human Monocyte/Macrophage
      Differentiation through Interaction with MicroRNA 199a-5p.
PG  - 3212-24
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00429-15 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in mammalian
      development, but little is known about their roles in monocyte/macrophage
      differentiation. Here we identified a long noncoding monocytic RNA (lnc-MC) that 
      exhibits increased expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of THP-1
      and HL-60 cells as well as CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs)
      and is transcriptionally activated by PU.1. Gain- and loss-of-function assays
      demonstrate that lnc-MC promotes monocyte/macrophage differentiation of THP-1
      cells and CD34(+) HSPCs. Mechanistic investigation reveals that lnc-MC acts as a 
      competing endogenous RNA to sequester microRNA 199a-5p (miR-199a-5p) and
      alleviate repression on the expression of activin A receptor type 1B (ACVR1B), an
      important regulator of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. We also noted a
      repressive effect of miR-199a-5p on lnc-MC expression and function, but
      PU.1-dominant downregulation of miR-199a-5p weakens the role of miR-199a-5p in
      the reciprocal regulation between miR-199a-5p and lnc-MC. Altogether, our work
      demonstrates that two PU.1-regulated noncoding RNAs, lnc-MC and miR-199a-5p, have
      opposing roles in monocyte/macrophage differentiation and that lnc-MC facilitates
      the differentiation process, enhancing the effect of PU.1, by soaking up
      miR-199a-5p and releasing ACVR1B expression. Thus, we reveal a novel regulatory
      mechanism, comprising PU.1, lnc-MC, miR-199a-5p, and ACVR1B, in
      monocyte/macrophage differentiation.

      Differentiation.
PG  - 3163-77
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00118-15 [doi]
AB  - Placentation is a process that establishes the maternal-fetal interface and is
      required for successful pregnancy. The epithelial component of the placenta
      consists of trophoblast cells, which possess the capacity for multilineage
      differentiation and are responsible for placenta-specific functions. FOS-like
      antigen 1 (FOSL1), a component of AP-1 transcription factor complexes,
      contributes to the regulation of placental development. FOSL1 expression is
      restricted to trophoblast giant cells and invasive trophoblast cells. In the
      present study, we characterized the FOSL1 regulatory pathway in rat trophoblast
      cells. Transcriptome profiling in control and FOSL1 knockdown cells identified
      FOSL1-dependent gene sets linked to endocrine and invasive functions. FOSL1 was
      shown to occupy AP-1 binding sites within these gene loci, as determined by
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Complementary in vivo experiments using
      trophoblast-specific lentiviral delivery of FOSL1 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
      provided in vivo validation of FOSL1 targets. FOSL1 actions require a
      dimerization partner. Coimmunoprecipitation, coimmunolocalization, and ChIP
      analyses showed that FOSL1 interacts with JUNB and, to a lesser extent, JUN in
      differentiating trophoblast cells. Knockdown of FOSL1 and JUNB expression
      inhibited both endocrine and invasive properties of trophoblast cells. In
      summary, FOSL1 recruits JUNB to form AP-1 transcriptional complexes that
      specifically regulate the endocrine and invasive trophoblast phenotypes.

TI  - LIN28A Modulates Splicing and Gene Expression Programs in Breast Cancer Cells.
PG  - 3225-43
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00426-15 [doi]
AB  - LIN28 is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein with critical functions 
      in developmental timing and cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      LIN28's oncogenic properties are yet to be described. RNA-protein
      immunoprecipitation coupled with genome-wide sequencing (RIP-Seq) analysis
      revealed significant LIN28 binding within 843 mRNAs in breast cancer cells. Many 
      of the LIN28-bound mRNAs are implicated in the regulation of RNA and cell
      metabolism. We identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1), a 
      protein with multiple roles in mRNA metabolism, as a LIN28-interacting partner.
      Subsequently, we used a custom computational method to identify differentially
      spliced gene isoforms in LIN28 and hnRNP A1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-treated
      cells. The results reveal that these proteins regulate alternative splicing and
      steady-state mRNA expression of genes implicated in aspects of breast cancer
      biology. Notably, cells lacking LIN28 undergo significant isoform switching of
      the ENAH gene, resulting in a decrease in the expression of the ENAH exon 11a
      isoform. The expression of ENAH isoform 11a has been shown to be elevated in
      breast cancers that express HER2. Intriguingly, analysis of publicly available
      array data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that LIN28 expression in
      the HER2 subtype is significantly different from that in other breast cancer
      subtypes. Collectively, our data suggest that LIN28 may regulate splicing and
      gene expression programs that drive breast cancer subtype phenotypes.

TI  - Regulation of Transcription Elongation by the XPG-TFIIH Complex Is Implicated in 
      Cockayne Syndrome.
PG  - 3178-88
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01401-14 [doi]
AB  - XPG is a causative gene underlying the photosensitive disorder xeroderma
      pigmentosum group G (XP-G) and is involved in nucleotide excision repair. Here,
      we show that XPG knockdown represses epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced FOS
      transcription at the level of transcription elongation with little effect on EGF 
      signal transduction. XPG interacted with transcription elongation factors in
      concert with TFIIH, suggesting that the XPG-TFIIH complex serves as a
      transcription elongation factor. The XPG-TFIIH complex was recruited to promoter 
      and coding regions of both EGF-induced (FOS) and housekeeping (EEF1A1) genes.
      Further, EGF-induced recruitment of RNA polymerase II and TFIIH to FOS was
      reduced by XPG knockdown. Importantly, EGF-induced FOS transcription was markedly
      lower in XP-G/Cockayne syndrome (CS) cells expressing truncated XPG than in
      control cells expressing wild-type (WT) XPG, with less significant decreases in
      XP-G cells with XPG nuclease domain mutations. In corroboration of this finding, 
      both WT XPG and a missense XPG mutant from an XP-G patient were recruited to FOS 
      upon EGF stimulation, but an XPG mutant mimicking a C-terminal truncation from an
      XP-G/CS patient was not. These results suggest that the XPG-TFIIH complex is
      involved in transcription elongation and that defects in this association may
      partly account for Cockayne syndrome in XP-G/CS patients.

TI  - Genome-Wide Screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Highlight a Role for Cardiolipin 
      in Biogenesis of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Multispan Proteins.
PG  - 3200-11
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00107-15 [doi]
AB  - A special group of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins spans the membrane
      several times via multiple helical segments. Such multispan proteins are
      synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes before their targeting to mitochondria and
      insertion into the MOM. Previous work recognized the import receptor Tom70 and
      the mitochondrial import (MIM) complex, both residents of the MOM, as required
      for optimal biogenesis of these proteins. However, their involvement is not
      sufficient to explain either the entire import pathway or its regulation. To
      identify additional factors that are involved in the biogenesis of MOM multispan 
      proteins, we performed complementary high-throughput visual and growth screens in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cardiolipin (CL) synthase (Crd1) appeared as a
      candidate in both screens. Our results indeed demonstrate lower steady-state
      levels of the multispan proteins Ugo1, Scm4, and Om14 in mitochondria from
      crd1Delta cells. Importantly, MOM single-span proteins were not affected by this 
      mutation. Furthermore, organelles lacking Crd1 had a lower in vitro capacity to
      import newly synthesized Ugo1 and Scm4 molecules. Crd1, which is located in the
      mitochondrial inner membrane, condenses phosphatidylglycerol together with
      CDP-diacylglycerol to obtain de novo synthesized CL molecules. Hence, our
      findings suggest that CL is an important component in the biogenesis of MOM
      multispan proteins.

TI  - Ezrin Binds to DEAD-Box RNA Helicase DDX3 and Regulates Its Function and Protein 
      Level.
PG  - 3145-62
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00332-15 [doi]
AB  - Ezrin is a key regulator of cancer metastasis that links the extracellular matrix
      to the actin cytoskeleton and regulates cell morphology and motility. We
      discovered a small-molecule inhibitor, NSC305787, that directly binds to ezrin
      and inhibits its function. In this study, we used a nano-liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS-MS)-based proteomic approach 
      to identify ezrin-interacting proteins that are competed away by NSC305787. A
      large number of the proteins that interact with ezrin were implicated in protein 
      translation and stress granule dynamics. We validated direct interaction between 
      ezrin and the RNA helicase DDX3, and NSC305787 blocked this interaction.
      Downregulation or long-term pharmacological inhibition of ezrin led to reduced
      DDX3 protein levels without changes in DDX3 mRNA. Ectopic overexpression of ezrin
      in low-ezrin-expressing osteosarcoma cells caused a notable increase in DDX3
      protein levels. Ezrin inhibited the RNA helicase activity of DDX3 but increased
      its ATPase activity. Our data suggest that ezrin controls the translation of
      mRNAs preferentially with a structured 5' untranslated region, at least in part, 
      by sustaining the protein level of DDX3 and/or regulating its function.
      Therefore, our findings suggest a novel function for ezrin in regulation of gene 
      translation that is distinct from its canonical role as a cytoskeletal scaffold
      at the cell membrane.

TI  - Concentration and Localization of Coexpressed ELAV/Hu Proteins Control
      Specificity of mRNA Processing.
PG  - 3104-15
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00473-15 [doi]
AB  - Neuronally coexpressed ELAV/Hu proteins comprise a family of highly related RNA
      binding proteins which bind to very similar cognate sequences. How this
      redundancy is linked to in vivo function and how gene-specific regulation is
      achieved have not been clear. Analysis of mutants in Drosophila ELAV/Hu family
      proteins ELAV, FNE, and RBP9 and of genetic interactions among them indicates
      that they have mostly independent roles in neuronal development and function but 
      have converging roles in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Conversely, ELAV,
      FNE, RBP9, and human HuR bind ELAV target RNA in vitro with similar affinities.
      Likewise, all can regulate alternative splicing of ELAV target genes in
      nonneuronal wing disc cells and substitute for ELAV in eye development upon
      artificially increased expression; they can also substantially restore ELAV's
      biological functions when expressed under the control of the elav gene.
      Furthermore, ELAV-related Sex-lethal can regulate ELAV targets, and ELAV/Hu
      proteins can interfere with sexual differentiation. An ancient relationship to
      Sex-lethal is revealed by gonadal expression of RBP9, providing a maternal
      fail-safe for dosage compensation. Our results indicate that highly related
      ELAV/Hu RNA binding proteins select targets for mRNA processing through
      alteration of their expression levels and subcellular localization but only
      minimally by altered RNA binding specificity.

PG  - 3116-30
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00093-15 [doi]
AB  - Studies of proteins involved in microRNA (miRNA) processing, maturation, and
      silencing have indicated the importance of miRNAs in skeletogenesis, but the
      specific miRNAs involved in this process are incompletely defined. Here, we
      identified miRNA 665 (miR-665) as a potential repressor of odontoblast
      maturation. Studies with cultured cell lines and primary embryonic cells showed
      that miR-665 represses the expression of early and late odontoblast marker genes 
      and stage-specific proteases involved in dentin maturation. Notably, miR-665
      directly targeted Dlx3 mRNA and decreased Dlx3 expression. Furthermore,
      RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) immunoprecipitation and biotin-labeled
      miR-665 pulldown studies identified Kat6a as another potential target of miR-665.
      KAT6A interacted physically and functionally with RUNX2, activating
      tissue-specific promoter activity and prompting odontoblast differentiation.
      Overexpression of miR-665 reduced the recruitment of KAT6A to Dspp and Dmp1
      promoters and prevented KAT6A-induced chromatin remodeling, repressing gene
      transcription. Taken together, our results provide novel molecular evidence that 
      miR-665 functions in an miRNA-epigenetic regulatory network to control
      dentinogenesis.

TI  - Phosphatidic Acid Increases Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Expression by
      Stabilizing mRNA Decay and by Inhibiting Lysosomal and Proteasomal Degradation of
      the Internalized Receptor.
PG  - 3131-44
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00286-15 [doi]
AB  - Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the frequent 
      mechanisms implicated in cancer progression, and so is the overexpression of the 
      enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) and its reaction product, phosphatidic acid (PA).
      However, an understanding of how these signaling molecules interact at the level 
      of gene expression is lacking. Catalytically active PLD enhanced expression of
      EGFR in human breast cancer cells. Overexpression of the PLD2 isoform increased
      EGFR mRNA and protein expression. It also negated an EGFR downregulation mediated
      by small interfering RNA targeting EGFR (siEGFR). Several mechanisms contributed 
      to the alteration in EGFR expression. First was the stabilization of EGFR
      transcripts as PLD2 delayed mRNA decay, which prolonged their half-lives. Second,
      RNase enzymatic activity was inhibited by PA. Third, protein stabilization also
      occurred, as indicated by PLD resistance to cycloheximide-induced EGFR protein
      degradation. Fourth, PA inhibited lysosomal and proteasomal degradation of
      internalized EGFR. PLD2 and EGFR colocalized at the cell membrane, and JAK3
      phosphorylation at Tyr980/Tyr981 followed receptor endocytosis. Further, the
      presence of PLD2 increased stabilization of intracellular EGFR in large recycling
      vesicles at approximately 15 min of EGF stimulation. Thus, PLD2-mediated
      production of PA contributed to the control of EGFR exposure to ligand through a 
      multipronged transcriptional and posttranscriptional program during the
      out-of-control accumulation of EGFR signaling in cancer cells.

TI  - SRSF2 Is Essential for Hematopoiesis, and Its Myelodysplastic Syndrome-Related
      Mutations Dysregulate Alternative Pre-mRNA Splicing.
PG  - 3071-82
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00202-15 [doi]
AB  - Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of neoplasms characterized by
      ineffective myeloid hematopoiesis and various risks for leukemia. SRSF2, a member
      of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors, is one of the
      mutation targets associated with poor survival in patients suffering from
      myelodysplastic syndromes. Here we report the biological function of SRSF2 in
      hematopoiesis by using conditional knockout mouse models. Ablation of SRSF2 in
      the hematopoietic lineage caused embryonic lethality, and Srsf2-deficient fetal
      liver cells showed significantly enhanced apoptosis and decreased levels of
      hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Induced ablation of SRSF2 in adult Mx1-Cre
      Srsf2(flox/flox) mice upon poly(I):poly(C) injection demonstrated a significant
      decrease in lineage(-) Sca(+) c-Kit(+) cells in bone marrow. To reveal the
      functional impact of myelodysplastic syndromes-associated mutations in SRSF2, we 
      analyzed splicing responses on the MSD-L cell line and found that the missense
      mutation of proline 95 to histidine (P95H) and a P95-to-R102 in-frame
      8-amino-acid deletion caused significant changes in alternative splicing. The
      affected genes were enriched in cancer development and apoptosis. These findings 
      suggest that intact SRSF2 is essential for the functional integrity of the
      hematopoietic system and that its mutations likely contribute to development of
      myelodysplastic syndromes.

TI  - Analysis of the Role of the C-Terminal Tail in the Regulation of the Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor.
PG  - 3083-102
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00248-15 [doi]
AB  - The approximately 230-residue C-terminal tail of the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) is phosphorylated upon activation. We examined whether this
      phosphorylation is affected by deletions within the tail and whether the two
      tails in the asymmetric active EGFR dimer are phosphorylated differently. We
      monitored autophosphorylation in cells using flow cytometry and found that the
      first approximately 80 residues of the tail are inhibitory, as demonstrated
      previously. The entire approximately 80-residue span is important for
      autoinhibition and needs to be released from both kinases that form the dimer.
      These results are interpreted in terms of crystal structures of the inactive
      kinase domain, including two new ones presented here. Deletions in the remaining 
      portion of the tail do not affect autophosphorylation, except for a six-residue
      segment spanning Tyr 1086 that is critical for activation loop phosphorylation.
      Phosphorylation of the two tails in the dimer is asymmetric, with the activator
      tail being phosphorylated somewhat more strongly. Unexpectedly, we found that
      reconstitution of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of EGFR in vesicles
      leads to a peculiar phenomenon in which kinase domains appear to be trapped
      between stacks of lipid bilayers. This artifactual trapping of kinases between
      membranes enhances an intrinsic functional asymmetry in the two tails in a dimer.

TI  - 129-Derived Mouse Strains Express an Unstable but Catalytically Active DNA
      Polymerase Iota Variant.
PG  - 3059-70
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00371-15 [doi]
AB  - Mice derived from the 129 strain have a nonsense codon mutation in exon 2 of the 
      polymerase iota (Poliota) gene and are therefore considered Poliota deficient.
      When we amplified Poliota mRNA from 129/SvJ or 129/Ola testes, only a small
      fraction of the full-length cDNA contained the nonsense mutation; the major
      fraction corresponded to a variant Poliota isoform lacking exon 2. Poliota mRNA
      lacking exon 2 contains an open reading frame, and the corresponding protein was 
      detected using a polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of the murine 
      Poliota protein. The identity of the corresponding protein was further confirmed 
      by mass spectrometry. Although the variant protein was expressed at only 5 to 10%
      of the level of wild-type Poliota, it retained de novo DNA synthesis activity,
      the capacity to form replication foci following UV irradiation, and the ability
      to rescue UV light sensitivity in Poliota(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts derived from
      a new, fully deficient Poliota knockout (KO) mouse line. Furthermore, in vivo
      treatment of 129-derived male mice with Velcade, a drug that inhibits proteasome 
      function, stabilized and restored a substantial amount of the variant Poliota in 
      these animals, indicating that its turnover is controlled by the proteasome. An
      analysis of two xeroderma pigmentosum-variant (XPV) cases corresponding to
      missense mutants of Poleta, a related translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase in
      the same family, similarly showed a destabilization of the catalytically active
      mutant protein by the proteasome. Collectively, these data challenge the
      prevailing hypothesis that 129-derived strains of mice are completely deficient
      in Poliota activity. The data also document, both for 129-derived mouse strains
      and for some XPV patients, new cases of genetic defects corresponding to the
      destabilization of an otherwise functional protein, the phenotype of which is
      reversible by proteasome inhibition.

TI  - Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 1 Regulates Autophagy through Turning On
      TBC1D2-Dependent Rab7 Inactivation.
PG  - 3044-58
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00085-15 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is a conserved process that enables catabolic and degradative pathways.
      Rab family proteins, which are active in the GTP-bound form, regulate the
      transport and fusion of autophagosomes. However, it remains unclear how each
      cycle of Rab activation and inactivation is precisely regulated. Here, we show
      that leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 (LRRK1) regulates autophagic flux by
      controlling Rab7 activity in autolysosome formation. Upon induction of autophagy,
      LRRK1 was recruited via an association with VAMP7 to the autolysosome, where it
      activated the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D2, thereby switching off 
      Rab7 signaling. Consistent with this model, LRRK1 deletion caused mice to be
      vulnerable to starvation and disrupted autolysosome formation, as evidenced by
      the accumulation of enlarged autolysosomes with undegraded LC3-II and
      persistently high levels of Rab7-GTP. This defect in autophagic flux was
      partially rescued by a mutant form of TBC1D2 with elevated Rab7-GAP activity.
      Thus, the spatiotemporal regulation of Rab7 activity during tunicamycin-induced
      autophagy is regulated by LRRK1.

TI  - Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog Affects the Replication Stress Response through
      Regulation of RNA Processing.
PG  - 2979-90
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01276-14 [doi]
AB  - Accurate replication of DNA is imperative for the maintenance of genomic
      integrity. We identified Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog (ERH) using a
      whole-genome RNA interference (RNAi) screen to discover novel proteins that
      function in the replication stress response. Here we report that ERH is important
      for DNA replication and recovery from replication stress. ATR pathway activity is
      diminished in ERH-deficient cells. The reduction in ATR signaling corresponds to 
      a decrease in the expression of multiple ATR pathway genes, including ATR itself.
      ERH interacts with multiple RNA processing complexes, including splicing
      regulators. Furthermore, splicing of ATR transcripts is deficient in ERH-depleted
      cells. Transcriptome-wide analysis indicates that ERH depletion affects the
      levels of approximately 1,500 transcripts, with DNA replication and repair genes 
      being highly enriched among those with reduced expression. Splicing defects were 
      evident in approximately 750 protein-coding genes, which again were enriched for 
      DNA metabolism genes. Thus, ERH regulation of RNA processing is needed to ensure 
      faithful DNA replication and repair.

TI  - Fine-Tuning of the RIG-I-Like Receptor/Interferon Regulatory Factor 3-Dependent
      Antiviral Innate Immune Response by the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/beta-Catenin
      Pathway.
PG  - 3029-43
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00344-15 [doi]
AB  - Induction of an antiviral innate immune response relies on pattern recognition
      receptors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLR), to
      detect invading pathogens, resulting in the activation of multiple latent
      transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Upon
      sensing of viral RNA and DNA, IRF3 is phosphorylated and recruits coactivators to
      induce type I interferons (IFNs) and selected sets of IRF3-regulated
      IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as those for ISG54 (Ifit2), ISG56 (Ifit1), and
      viperin (Rsad2). Here, we used wild-type, glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha
      knockout (GSK-3alpha(-/-)), GSK-3beta(-/-), and GSK-3alpha/beta double-knockout
      (DKO) embryonic stem (ES) cells, as well as GSK-3beta(-/-) mouse embryonic
      fibroblast cells in which GSK-3alpha was knocked down to demonstrate that both
      isoforms of GSK-3, GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta, are required for this antiviral
      immune response. Moreover, the use of two selective small-molecule GSK-3
      inhibitors (CHIR99021 and BIO-acetoxime) or ES cells reconstituted with the
      catalytically inactive versions of GSK-3 isoforms showed that GSK-3 activity is
      required for optimal induction of antiviral innate immunity. Mechanistically,
      GSK-3 isoform activation following Sendai virus infection results in
      phosphorylation of beta-catenin at S33/S37/T41, promoting IRF3 DNA binding and
      activation of IRF3-regulated ISGs. This study identifies the role of a
      GSK-3/beta-catenin axis in antiviral innate immunity.

TI  - Salmonella Engages Host MicroRNAs To Modulate SUMOylation: a New Arsenal for
      Intracellular Survival.
PG  - 2932-46
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00397-15 [doi]
AB  - Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) can alter many fundamental properties of a
      protein. One or combinations of them have been known to regulate the dynamics of 
      many cellular pathways and consequently regulate all vital processes.
      Understandably, pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to subvert these 
      mechanisms to achieve instantaneous control over host functions. Here, we present
      the first report of modulation by intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar
      Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) of host SUMOylation, a PTM pathway central to all
      fundamental cellular processes. Both in cell culture and in a mouse model, we
      observed that S. Typhimurium infection led to a dynamic SUMO-conjugated proteome 
      alteration. The intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium was dependent on SUMO
      status as revealed by reduced infection and Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs)
      in SUMO-upregulated cells. S. Typhimurium-dependent SUMO modulation was seen as a
      result of depletion of crucial SUMO pathway enzymes Ubc-9 and PIAS1, at both the 
      protein and the transcript levels. Mechanistically, depletion of Ubc-9 relied on 
      upregulation of small noncoding RNAs miR30c and miR30e during S. Typhimurium
      infection. This was necessary and sufficient for both down-modulation of Ubc-9
      and a successful infection. Thus, we demonstrate a novel strategy of
      pathogen-mediated perturbation of host SUMOylation, an integral mechanism
      underlying S. Typhimurium infection and intracellular survival.

TI  - The DHX33 RNA Helicase Promotes mRNA Translation Initiation.
PG  - 2918-31
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00315-15 [doi]
AB  - DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases play essential roles in numerous RNA metabolic
      processes, such as mRNA translation, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and 
      double-stranded RNA sensing. Herein we show that a recently characterized
      DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicase, DHX33, promotes mRNA translation initiation. We
      isolated intact DHX33 protein/RNA complexes in cells and identified several
      ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and mRNAs. Reduction of DHX33 protein
      levels markedly reduced polyribosome formation and caused the global inhibition
      of mRNA translation that was rescued with wild-type DHX33 but not
      helicase-defective DHX33. Moreover, we observed an accumulation of mRNA complexes
      with the 80S ribosome in the absence of functional DHX33, consistent with a
      stalling in initiation, and DHX33 more preferentially promoted structured mRNA
      translation. We conclude that DHX33 functions to promote elongation-competent 80S
      ribosome assembly at the late stage of mRNA translation initiation. Our results
      reveal a newly recognized function of DHX33 in mRNA translation initiation,
      further solidifying its central role in promoting cell growth and proliferation.

TI  - XRCC4/XLF Interaction Is Variably Required for DNA Repair and Is Not Required for
      Ligase IV Stimulation.
PG  - 3017-28
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01503-14 [doi]
AB  - The classic nonhomologous end-joining (c-NHEJ) pathway is largely responsible for
      repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. XLF stimulates the
      XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex by an unknown mechanism. XLF interacts with XRCC4 to 
      form filaments of alternating XRCC4 and XLF dimers that bridge DNA ends in vitro,
      providing a mechanism by which XLF might stimulate ligation. Here, we
      characterize two XLF mutants that do not interact with XRCC4 and cannot form
      filaments or bridge DNA in vitro. One mutant is fully sufficient in stimulating
      ligation by XRCC4/Lig4 in vitro; the other is not. This separation-of-function
      mutant (which must function as an XLF homodimer) fully complements the c-NHEJ
      deficits of some XLF-deficient cell strains but not others, suggesting a variable
      requirement for XRCC4/XLF interaction in living cells. To determine whether the
      lack of XRCC4/XLF interaction (and potential bridging) can be compensated for by 
      other factors, candidate repair factors were disrupted in XLF- or XRCC4-deficient
      cells. The loss of either ATM or the newly described XRCC4/XLF-like factor, PAXX,
      accentuates the requirement for XLF. However, in the case of ATM/XLF loss (but
      not PAXX/XLF loss), this reflects a greater requirement for XRCC4/XLF
      interaction.

TI  - RNA-Binding Protein Musashi1 Is a Central Regulator of Adhesion Pathways in
      Glioblastoma.
PG  - 2965-78
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00410-15 [doi]
AB  - The conserved RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (MSI1) has emerged as a key oncogenic 
      factor in numerous solid tumors, including glioblastoma. However, its mechanism
      of action has not yet been established comprehensively. To identify its target
      genes comprehensively and determine the main routes by which it influences
      glioblastoma phenotypes, we conducted individual-nucleotide resolution
      cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. We confirmed that MSI1
      has a preference for UAG sequences contained in a particular structural context, 
      especially in 3' untranslated regions. Although numerous binding sites were also 
      identified in intronic sequences, our RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis does 
      not favor the idea that MSI1 is a major regulator of splicing in glioblastoma
      cells. MSI1 target mRNAs encode proteins that function in multiple pathways of
      cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Since these associations indicate
      potentially new roles for MSI1, we investigated its impact on glioblastoma cell
      adhesion, morphology, migration, and invasion. These processes are known to
      underpin the spread and relapse of glioblastoma, in contrast to other tumors
      where metastasis is the main driver of recurrence and progression.

      through Multiple Signaling Pathways.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00421-15 [doi]
AB  - The histone acetyltransferase p300 has been implicated in the regulation of liver
      biology; however, molecular mechanisms of this regulation are not known. In this 
      paper, we examined these mechanisms using transgenic mice expressing a dominant
      negative p300 molecule (dnp300). While dnp300 mice did not show abnormal growth
      within 1 year, these mice have many alterations in liver biology and liver
      functions. We found that the inhibition of p300 leads to the accumulation of
      heterochromatin foci in the liver of 2-month-old mice. Transcriptome sequencing
      (RNA-Seq) analysis showed that this inhibition of p300 also causes alterations of
      gene expression in many signaling pathways, including chromatin remodeling,
      apoptosis, DNA damage, translation, and activation of the cell cycle. Livers of
      dnp300 mice have a high rate of proliferation and a much higher rate of
      proliferation after partial hepatectomy. We found that livers of dnp300 mice are 
      resistant to CCl4-mediated injury and have reduced apoptosis but have increased
      proliferation after injury. Underlying mechanisms of resistance to liver injury
      and increased proliferation in dnp300 mice include ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated 
      degradation of C/EBPalpha and translational repression of the p53 protein by the 
      CUGBP1-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) repressor complex. Our data
      demonstrate that p300 regulates a number of critical signaling pathways that
      control liver functions.

TI  - Type 1 Insulin-Like Growth Factor Receptor/Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 Signaling
      Confers Pathogenic Activity on Breast Tumor Cells Lacking REST.
PG  - 2991-3004
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01149-14 [doi]
AB  - Loss of repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) occurs in 20%
      of breast cancers and correlates with a poor patient prognosis. However, the
      molecular basis for enhanced malignancy in tumors lacking REST (RESTless) is only
      partially understood. We used multiplatform array data from the Cancer Genome
      Atlas to identify consistent changes in key signaling pathways. Of the proteins
      screened in the reverse-phase protein array, we found that insulin receptor
      substrate 1 (IRS1) is the most highly upregulated protein in RESTless breast
      tumors. Analysis of breast tumor cell lines showed that REST directly represses
      IRS1, and cells lacking REST have increased levels of IRS1 mRNA and protein. We
      find that the upregulation of IRS1 function is both necessary and sufficient for 
      enhanced signaling and growth in breast cancer cells lacking REST. IRS1
      overexpression is sufficient to phenocopy the enhanced activation of the
      signaling hubs AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of MCF7 cells
      lacking REST. Loss of REST renders MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells
      dependent on IRS1 activity for colony formation in soft agar. Inhibition of the
      type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) reduces the enhanced
      signaling, growth, and migration in breast tumor cells that occur upon REST loss.
      We show that loss of REST induces a pathogenic program that works through the
      IGF1R/IRS1 pathway.

TI  - Eaf1p Is Required for Recruitment of NuA4 in Targeting TFIID to the Promoters of 
      the Ribosomal Protein Genes for Transcriptional Initiation In Vivo.
PG  - 2947-64
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01524-14 [doi]
AB  - NuA4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4) promotes transcriptional initiation of 
      TFIID (a complex of TBP and TBP-associated factors [TAFs])-dependent ribosomal
      protein genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. However, it is not clearly
      understood how NuA4 regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein genes. Here,
      we show that NuA4 is recruited to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes, such 
      as RPS5, RPL2B, and RPS11B, for TFIID recruitment to initiate transcription, and 
      the recruitment of NuA4 to these promoters is impaired in the absence of its
      Eaf1p component. Intriguingly, impaired NuA4 recruitment in a Deltaeaf1 strain
      depletes recruitment of TFIID (a TAF-dependent form of TBP) but not the
      TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes. However,
      in the absence of NuA4, SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) is involved in
      targeting the TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of ribosomal protein
      genes for transcriptional initiation. Thus, NuA4 plays an important role in
      targeting TFIID to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes for transcriptional
      initiation in vivo. Such a function is mediated via its targeted histone
      acetyltransferase activity. In the absence of NuA4, ribosomal protein genes lose 
      TFIID dependency and become SAGA dependent for transcriptional initiation.
      Collectively, these results provide significant insights into the regulation of
      ribosomal protein gene expression and, hence, ribosome biogenesis and functions.

TI  - A Single Conserved Residue Mediates Binding of the Ribonucleotide Reductase
      Catalytic Subunit RRM1 to RRM2 and Is Essential for Mouse Development.
PG  - 2910-7
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00475-15 [doi]
AB  - The ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex, composed of a catalytic subunit
      (RRM1) and a regulatory subunit (RRM2), is thought to be a rate-limiting
      enzymatic complex for the production of nucleotides. In humans, the Rrm1 gene
      lies at 11p15.5, a tumor suppressor region, and RRM1 expression in cancer has
      been shown to predict responses to chemotherapy. Nevertheless, whether RRM1 is
      essential in mammalian cells and what the effects of its haploinsufficiency are
      remain unknown. To model RNR function in mice we used a mutation previously
      described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Rnr1-W688G) which, despite being viable,
      leads to increased interaction of the RNR complex with its allosteric inhibitor
      Sml1. In contrast to yeast, homozygous mutant mice carrying the Rrm1 mutation
      (Rrm1(WG/WG)) are not viable, even at the earliest embryonic stages. Proteomic
      analyses failed to identify proteins that specifically bind to the mutant RRM1
      but revealed that, in mammals, the mutation prevents RRM1 binding to RRM2.
      Despite the impact of the mutation, Rrm1(WG/+) mice and cells presented no
      obvious phenotype, suggesting that the RRM1 protein exists in excess. Our work
      reveals that binding of RRM1 to RRM2 is essential for mammalian cells and
      provides the first loss-of-function model of the RNR complex for genetic studies.

TI  - A Pitx2-MicroRNA Pathway Modulates Cell Proliferation in Myoblasts and
      Skeletal-Muscle Satellite Cells and Promotes Their Commitment to a Myogenic Cell 
      Fate.
PG  - 2892-909
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00536-15 [doi]
AB  - The acquisition of a proliferating-cell status from a quiescent state as well as 
      the shift between proliferation and differentiation are key developmental steps
      in skeletal-muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to provide proper muscle
      regeneration. However, how satellite cell proliferation is regulated is not fully
      understood. Here, we report that the c-isoform of the transcription factor Pitx2 
      increases cell proliferation in myoblasts by downregulating microRNA 15b
      (miR-15b), miR-23b, miR-106b, and miR-503. This Pitx2c-microRNA (miRNA) pathway
      also regulates cell proliferation in early-activated satellite cells, enhancing
      Myf5(+) satellite cells and thereby promoting their commitment to a myogenic cell
      fate. This study reveals unknown functions of several miRNAs in myoblast and
      satellite cell behavior and thus may have future applications in regenerative
      medicine.

TI  - MicroRNA 224 Regulates Ion Transporter Expression in Ameloblasts To Coordinate
      Enamel Mineralization.
PG  - 2875-90
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01266-14 [doi]
AB  - Enamel mineralization is accompanied by the release of protons into the
      extracellular matrix, which is buffered to regulate the pH value in the local
      microenvironment. The present study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA 224
      (miR-224) as a regulator of SLC4A4 and CFTR, encoding the key buffering ion
      transporters, in modulating enamel mineralization. miR-224 was significantly
      downregulated as ameloblasts differentiated, in parallel with upregulation of
      SLC4A4 and CFTR. Overexpression of miR-224 downregulated SLC4A4 and CFTR
      expression in cultured human epithelial cells. A microRNA luciferase assay
      confirmed the specific binding of miR-224 to the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs)
      of SLC4A4 and CFTR mRNAs, thereby inhibiting protein translation. miR-224 agomir 
      injection in mouse neonatal incisors resulted in normal enamel length and
      thickness, but with disturbed organization of the prism structure and deficient
      crystal growth. Moreover, the enamel Ca/P ratio and microhardness were markedly
      reduced after miR-224 agomir administration. These results demonstrate that
      miR-224 plays a pivotal role in fine tuning enamel mineralization by modulating
      SLC4A4 and CFTR to maintain pH homeostasis and support enamel mineralization.

TI  - TRIM28 Is an E3 Ligase for ARF-Mediated NPM1/B23 SUMOylation That Represses
      Centrosome Amplification.
PG  - 2851-63
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01064-14 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor ARF enhances the SUMOylation of target proteins; however,
      the physiological function of ARF-mediated SUMOylation has been unclear due to
      the lack of a known, associated E3 SUMO ligase. Here we uncover TRIM28/KAP1 as a 
      novel ARF-binding protein and SUMO E3 ligase for NPM1/B23. ARF and TRIM28
      cooperate to SUMOylate NPM1, a nucleolar protein that regulates centrosome
      duplication and genomic stability. ARF-mediated SUMOylation of NPM1 was
      attenuated by TRIM28 depletion and enhanced by TRIM28 overexpression.
      Coexpression of ARF and TRIM28 promoted NPM1 centrosomal localization by
      enhancing its SUMOylation and suppressed centrosome amplification; these
      functions required the E3 ligase activity of TRIM28. Conversely, depletion of ARF
      or TRIM28 increased centrosome amplification. ARF also counteracted oncogenic
      Ras-induced centrosome amplification. Centrosome amplification is often induced
      by oncogenic insults, leading to genomic instability. However, the mechanisms
      employed by tumor suppressors to protect the genome are poorly understood. Our
      findings suggest a novel role for ARF in maintaining genome integrity by
      facilitating TRIM28-mediated SUMOylation of NPM1, thus preventing centrosome
      amplification.

TI  - A Region of Bdp1 Necessary for Transcription Initiation That Is Located within

PG  - 2831-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00263-15 [doi]
AB  - The RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-specific transcription factor Bdp1 is crucial to
      Pol III recruitment and promoter opening in transcription initiation, yet
      structural information is sparse. To examine its protein-binding targets within
      the preinitiation complex at the residue level, photoreactive amino acids were
      introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bdp1. Mutations within the highly
      conserved SANT domain cross-linked to the transcription factor IIB
      (TFIIB)-related transcription factor Brf1, consistent with the findings of
      previous studies. In addition, we identified an essential N-terminal region that 
      cross-linked with the Pol III catalytic subunit C128 as well as Brf1. Closer
      examination revealed that this region interacted with the C128 N-terminal region,
      the N-terminal half of Brf1, and the C-terminal domain of the C37 subunit,
      together positioning this region within the active site cleft of the
      preinitiation complex. With our functional data, our analyses identified an
      essential region of Bdp1 that is positioned within the active site cleft of Pol
      III and necessary for transcription initiation.

TI  - Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Serum Retinol-Binding Protein Develop Progressive 
      Retinal Degeneration through a Retinoid-Independent Mechanism.
PG  - 2771-89
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00181-15 [doi]
AB  - Serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is the sole specific transport protein for
      retinol in the blood, but it is also an adipokine with retinol-independent,
      proinflammatory activity associated with obesity, insulin resistance, type 2
      diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, two separate studies reported
      that patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy have increased serum RBP4
      levels compared to patients with mild or no retinopathy, yet the effect of
      increased levels of RBP4 on the retina has not been studied. Here we show that
      transgenic mice overexpressing RBP4 (RBP4-Tg mice) develop progressive retinal
      degeneration, characterized by photoreceptor ribbon synapse deficiency and
      subsequent bipolar cell loss. Ocular retinoid and bisretinoid levels are normal
      in RBP4-Tg mice, demonstrating that a retinoid-independent mechanism underlies
      retinal degeneration. Increased expression of pro-interleukin-18 (pro-IL-18) mRNA
      and activated IL-18 protein and early-onset microglia activation in the retina
      suggest that retinal degeneration is driven by a proinflammatory mechanism.
      Neither chronic systemic metabolic disease nor other retinal insults are required
      for RBP4 elevation to promote retinal neurodegeneration, since RBP4-Tg mice do
      not have coincident retinal vascular pathology, obesity, dyslipidemia, or
      hyperglycemia. These findings suggest that elevation of serum RBP4 levels could
      be a risk factor for retinal damage and vision loss in nondiabetic as well as
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Smad7 Modulates Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Turnover through Sequestration
      of c-Cbl.
PG  - 2841-50
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00274-15 [doi]
AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates various cellular events, including
      proliferation, differentiation, migration, and tumorigenesis. For the maintenance
      of homeostasis, EGF signaling should be tightly regulated to prevent the aberrant
      activation. Smad7 has been known as inhibitory Smad that blocks the signal
      transduction of transforming growth factor beta. In the process of cell
      proliferation or transformation, Smad7 has been shown the opposite activities as 
      a promoter or suppressor depending on cell types or microenvironments. We found
      that the overexpression of Smad7 in human HaCaT keratinocyte cells and mouse skin
      tissues elevated EGF receptor (EGFR) activity by impairing ligand-induced
      ubiquitination and degradation of activated receptor, which is induced by the E3 
      ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. The C-terminal MH2 region but not MH1 region of Smad7 is 
      critical for interaction with c-Cbl to inhibit the ubiquitination of EGFR.
      Interestingly, wild-type Smad7, but not Smad6 or mutant Smad7, destabilized the
      EGF-induced complex formation of c-Cbl and EGFR. These data suggest a novel role 
      for Smad7 as a promoter for prolonging the EGFR signal in keratinocyte and skin
      tissue by reducing its ligand-induced ubiquitination and degradation.

TI  - Genetic Inactivation of ATRX Leads to a Decrease in the Amount of Telomeric
      Cohesin and Level of Telomere Transcription in Human Glioma Cells.
PG  - 2818-30
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01317-14 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked), a
      chromatin-remodeling protein, are associated with the telomerase-independent ALT 
      (alternative lengthening of telomeres) pathway of telomere maintenance in several
      types of cancer, including human gliomas. In telomerase-positive glioma cells, we
      found by immunofluorescence that ATRX localized not far from the chromosome ends 
      but not exactly at the telomere termini. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
      experiments confirmed a subtelomeric localization for ATRX, yet short hairpin RNA
      (shRNA)-mediated genetic inactivation of ATRX failed to trigger the ALT pathway. 
      Cohesin has been recently shown to be part of telomeric chromatin. Here, using
      ChIP, we showed that genetic inactivation of ATRX provoked diminution in the
      amount of cohesin in subtelomeric regions of telomerase-positive glioma cells.
      Inactivation of ATRX also led to diminution in the amount of TERRAs, noncoding
      RNAs resulting from transcription of telomeric DNA, as well as to a decrease in
      RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) levels at the telomeres. Our data suggest that ATRX
      might establish functional interactions with cohesin on telomeric chromatin in
      order to control TERRA levels and that one or the other or both of these events
      might be relevant to the triggering of the ALT pathway in cancer cells that
      exhibit genetic inactivation of ATRX.

TI  - Probing the Biology of Giardia intestinalis Mitosomes Using In Vivo Enzymatic
      Tagging.
PG  - 2864-74
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00448-15 [doi]
AB  - Giardia intestinalis parasites contain mitosomes, one of the simplest
      mitochondrion-related organelles. Strategies to identify the functions of
      mitosomes have been limited mainly to homology detection, which is not suitable
      for identifying species-specific proteins and their functions. An in vivo
      enzymatic tagging technique based on the Escherichia coli biotin ligase (BirA)
      has been introduced to G. intestinalis; this method allows for the
      compartment-specific biotinylation of a protein of interest. Known proteins
      involved in the mitosomal protein import were in vivo tagged, cross-linked, and
      used to copurify complexes from the outer and inner mitosomal membranes in a
      single step. New proteins were then identified by mass spectrometry. This
      approach enabled the identification of highly diverged mitosomal Tim44 (GiTim44),
      the first known component of the mitosomal inner membrane translocase (TIM). In
      addition, our subsequent bioinformatics searches returned novel diverged Tim44
      paralogs, which mediate the translation and mitosomal insertion of
      mitochondrially encoded proteins in other eukaryotes. However, most of the
      identified proteins are specific to G. intestinalis and even absent from the
      related diplomonad parasite Spironucleus salmonicida, thus reflecting the unique 
      character of the mitosomal metabolism. The in vivo enzymatic tagging also showed 
      that proteins enter the mitosome posttranslationally in an unfolded state and
      without vesicular transport.

TI  - Glucocorticoid Receptor Transcriptional Activation via the BRG1-Dependent
      Recruitment of TOP2beta and Ku70/86.
PG  - 2799-817
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00230-15 [doi]
AB  - BRG1, the central ATPase of the human SWI/SNF complex, is critical for biological
      functions, including nuclear receptor (NR)-regulated transcription. Analysis of
      BRG1 mutants demonstrated that functional motifs outside the ATPase domain are
      important for transcriptional activity. In the course of experiments examining
      protein interactions mediated through these domains, Ku70 (XRCC6) was found to
      associate with a BRG1 fragment encompassing the conserved
      helicase-SANT-associated (HSA) and BRK domains of BRG1. Subsequent
      transcriptional activation assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies
      showed that Ku70/86 and components of the topoisomerase IIbeta
      (TOP2beta)/poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) complex are necessary for
      NR-mediated SWI/SNF-dependent transcriptional activation from endogenous
      promoters. In addition to establishing Ku-BRG1 binding and TOP2beta/PARP1
      recruitment by nuclear receptor transactivation, we demonstrate that the
      transient appearance of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)/BRG1-dependent,
      TOP2beta-mediated double-strand DNA breaks is required for efficient
      GR-stimulated transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that a direct 
      interaction between Ku70/86 and BRG1 brings together SWI/SNF remodeling
      capabilities and TOP2beta activity to enhance the transcriptional response to
      hormone stimulation.

TI  - Novel Protein Kinase C-Mediated Control of Orai1 Function in Invasive Melanoma.
PG  - 2790-8
AB  - The incidence of malignant melanoma, a cancer of the melanocyte cell lineage, has
      nearly doubled in the past 20 years. Wnt5A, akey driver of melanoma invasiveness,
      induces Ca2 signals. To understand how store-operated calcium entry (SOCE)
      contributes to Wnt5A-induced malignancy in melanoma models, we examined the
      expression and function of STIM1 and Orai1 in patient-derived malignant melanoma 
      cells, previously characterized as either highly invasive (metastatic) or
      noninvasive. Using both fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiological
      approaches, we show that SOCE is greatly diminished in invasive melanoma compared
      to its level in noninvasive cell types. However, no loss of expression of any
      members of the STIM and Orai families was observed in invasive melanoma cells.
      Moreover, overexpressed wild-type STIM1 and Orai1 failed to restore SOCE in
      invasive melanoma cells, and we observed no defects in their localization before 
      or after store depletion in any of the invasive celllines. Importantly, however, 
      we determined that SOCE was restored by inhibition of protein kinase C, a known
      downstream target of Wnt5A. Furthermore, coexpression of STIM1 with an Orai1
      mutant insensitive to protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation fully restored
      SOCE in invasive melanoma. These findings reveal a level of control for STIM/Orai
      function in invasive melanoma not previously reported.

TI  - IRE1alpha-Dependent Decay of CReP/Ppp1r15b mRNA Increases Eukaryotic Initiation
      Factor 2alpha Phosphorylation and Suppresses Protein Synthesis.
PG  - 2761-70
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00215-15 [doi]
AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      homeostasis and protects cells from ER stress. IRE1alpha is a central regulator
      of the UPR that activates the transcription factor XBP1s through an
      unconventional splicing mechanism using its endoribonuclease activity. IRE1alpha 
      also cleaves certain mRNAs containing XBP1-like secondary structures to promote
      the degradation of these mRNAs, a process known as regulated IRE1alpha-dependent 
      decay (RIDD). We show here that the mRNA of CReP/Ppp1r15b, a regulatory subunit
      of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphatase, is a 
      RIDD substrate. eIF2alpha plays a central role in the integrated stress response 
      by mediating the translational attenuation to decrease the stress level in the
      cell. CReP expression was markedly suppressed in XBP1-deficient mice livers due
      to hyperactivated IRE1alpha. Decreased CReP expression caused the induction of
      eIF2alpha phosphorylation and the attenuation of protein synthesis in
      XBP1-deficient livers. ER stress also suppressed CReP expression in an
      IRE1alpha-dependent manner, which increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation and
      consequently attenuated protein synthesis. Taken together, the results of our
      study reveal a novel function of IRE1alpha in the regulation of eIF2alpha
      phosphorylation and the translational control.

AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are characterized by their ability to self-renew and 
      to differentiate into all cell types of a given organism. Understanding the
      molecular mechanisms that govern the ESC state is of great interest not only for 
      basic research-for instance, ESCs represent a perfect system to study cellular
      differentiation in vitro-but also for their potential implications in human
      health, as these mechanisms are likewise involved in cancer progression and could
      be exploited in regenerative medicine. In this minireview, we focus on the latest
      insights into the molecular mechanisms mediated by the pluripotency factors as
      well as their roles during differentiation. We also discuss recent advances in
      understanding the function of the epigenetic regulators, Polycomb and MLL
      complexes, in ESC biology.

TI  - Transient Receptor Potential Channel 1 Deficiency Impairs Host Defense and
      Proinflammatory Responses to Bacterial Infection by Regulating Protein Kinase
      Calpha Signaling.
PG  - 2729-39
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00256-15 [doi]
AB  - Transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) is a nonselective cation channel
      that is required for Ca(2+) homeostasis necessary for cellular functions.
      However, whether TRPC1 is involved in infectious disease remains unknown. Here,
      we report a novel function for TRPC1 in host defense against Gram-negative
      bacteria. TRPC1(-/-) mice exhibited decreased survival, severe lung injury, and
      systemic bacterial dissemination upon infection. Furthermore, silencing of TRPC1 
      showed decreased Ca(2+) entry, reduced proinflammatory cytokines, and lowered
      bacterial clearance. Importantly, TRPC1 functioned as an endogenous Ca(2+) entry 
      channel critical for proinflammatory cytokine production in both alveolar
      macrophages and epithelial cells. We further identified that bacterium-mediated
      activation of TRPC1 was dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which induced
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store depletion. After activation of phospholipase
      Cgamma (PLC-gamma), TRPC1 mediated Ca(2+) entry and triggered protein kinase
      Calpha (PKCalpha) activity to facilitate nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/Jun
      N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and augment the proinflammatory response, leading
      to tissue damage and eventually mortality. These findings reveal that TRPC1 is
      required for host defense against bacterial infections through the
      TLR4-TRPC1-PKCalpha signaling circuit.

PG  - 2570-82
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00195-15 [doi]
AB  - The ability of cells to sense the physical nature of their surroundings is
      critical to the survival of multicellular organisms. Cellular response to
      physical cues from adjacent cells and the extracellular matrix leads to a dynamic
      cycle in which cells respond by remodeling their local microenvironment,
      fine-tuning cell stiffness, polarity, and shape. Mechanical regulation is
      important in cellular development, normal morphogenesis, and wound healing. The
      mechanisms by which these finely balanced mechanotransduction events occur,
      however, are not well understood. In large part, this is due to the limited
      availability of tools to study molecular mechanotransduction events in live
      cells. Several classes of molecular tension probes have been recently developed
      which are rapidly transforming the study of mechanotransduction. Molecular
      tension probes are primarily based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer
      (FRET) and report on piconewton scale tension events in live cells. In this
      minireview, we describe the two main classes of tension probes, genetically
      encoded tension sensors and immobilized tension sensors, and discuss the
      advantages and limitations of each type. We discuss future opportunities to
      address major biological questions and outline the challenges facing the next
      generation of molecular tension probes.

TI  - The Role of PDE3B Phosphorylation in the Inhibition of Lipolysis by Insulin.
PG  - 2752-60
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00422-15 [doi]
AB  - Inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis by insulin is important for whole-body energy
      homeostasis; its disruption has been implicated as contributing to the
      development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The main target
      of the antilipolytic action of insulin is believed to be phosphodiesterase 3B
      (PDE3B), whose phosphorylation by Akt leads to accelerated degradation of the
      prolipolytic second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). To test this hypothesis
      genetically, brown adipocytes lacking PDE3B were examined for their regulation of
      lipolysis. In Pde3b knockout (KO) adipocytes, insulin was unable to suppress
      beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated glycerol release. Reexpressing wild-type
      PDE3B in KO adipocytes fully rescued the action of insulin against lipolysis.
      Surprisingly, a mutant form of PDE3B that ablates the major Akt phosphorylation
      site, murine S273, also restored the ability of insulin to suppress lipolysis.
      Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of PDE3B by Akt is not
      required for insulin to suppress adipocyte lipolysis.

TI  - Sestrin2 Protects Dopaminergic Cells against Rotenone Toxicity through
      AMPK-Dependent Autophagy Activation.
PG  - 2740-51
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00285-15 [doi]
AB  - Dysfunction of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and the ubiquitin-proteasome
      system (UPS) was thought to be an important pathogenic mechanism in synuclein
      pathology and Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we investigated the
      role of sestrin2 in autophagic degradation of alpha-synuclein and preservation of
      cell viability in a rotenone-induced cellular model of PD. We speculated that
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was involved in regulation of autophagy and
      protection of dopaminergic cells against rotenone toxicity by sestrin2. The
      results showed that both the mRNA and protein levels of sestrin2 were increased
      in a TP53-dependent manner in Mes 23.5 cells after treatment with rotenone.
      Genetic knockdown of sestrin2 compromised the autophagy induction in response to 
      rotenone, while overexpression of sestrin2 increased the basal autophagy
      activity. Sestrin2 presumably enhanced autophagy in an AMPK-dependent fashion, as
      sestrin2 overexpression activated AMPK, and genetic knockdown of AMPK abrogated
      autophagy induction by rotenone. Restoration of AMPK activity by metformin after 
      sestrin2 knockdown recovered the autophagy activity. Sestrin2 overexpression
      ameliorated alpha-synuclein accumulation, inhibited caspase 3 activation, and
      reduced the cytotoxicity of rotenone. These results suggest that sestrin2
      upregulation attempts to maintain autophagy activity and suppress rotenone
      cytotoxicity through activation of AMPK, and that sestrin2 exerts a protective
      effect on dopaminergic cells.

TI  - The Lineage-Specific Transcription Factor PU.1 Prevents Polycomb-Mediated
      Heterochromatin Formation at Macrophage-Specific Genes.
PG  - 2610-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00027-15 [doi]
AB  - Lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) are important determinants of
      cellular identity, but their exact mode of action has remained unclear. Here we
      show using a macrophage differentiation system that the lineage-specific TF PU.1 
      keeps macrophage-specific genes accessible during differentiation by preventing
      Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) binding to transcriptional regulatory
      elements. We demonstrate that the distal enhancer of a gene becomes bound by PRC2
      as cells differentiate in the absence of PU.1 binding and that the gene is
      wrapped into heterochromatin, which is characterized by increased nucleosome
      occupancy and H3K27 trimethylation. This renders the gene inaccessible to the
      transcriptional machinery and prevents induction of the gene in response to an
      external signal in mature cells. In contrast, if PU.1 is bound at the
      transcriptional regulatory region of a gene during differentiation, PRC2 is not
      recruited, nucleosome occupancy is kept low, and the gene can be induced in
      mature macrophages. Similar results were obtained at the enhancers of other
      macrophage-specific genes that fail to bind PU.1 as an estrogen receptor fusion
      (PUER) in this system. These results show that one role of PU.1 is to exclude
      PRC2 and to prevent heterochromatin formation at macrophage-specific genes.

TI  - Hypoxia Signaling Cascade for Erythropoietin Production in Hepatocytes.
PG  - 2658-72
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00161-15 [doi]
AB  - Erythropoietin (Epo) is produced in the kidney and liver in a hypoxia-inducible
      manner via the activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) to
      maintain oxygen homeostasis. Accelerating Epo production in hepatocytes is one
      plausible therapeutic strategy for treating anemia caused by kidney diseases. To 
      elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of hepatic Epo production, we analyzed mouse 
      lines harboring liver-specific deletions of genes encoding HIF-prolyl-hydroxylase
      isoforms (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) that mediate the inactivation of HIF1alpha and
      HIF2alpha under normal oxygen conditions. The loss of all PHD isoforms results in
      both polycythemia, which is caused by Epo overproduction, and fatty livers. We
      found that deleting any combination of two PHD isoforms induces polycythemia
      without steatosis complications, whereas the deletion of a single isoform induces
      no apparent phenotype. Polycythemia is prevented by the loss of either HIF2alpha 
      or the hepatocyte-specific Epo gene enhancer (EpoHE). Chromatin analyses show
      that the histones around EpoHE dissociate from the nucleosome structure after
      HIF2alpha activation. HIF2alpha also induces the expression of HIF3alpha, which
      is involved in the attenuation of Epo production. These results demonstrate that 
      the total amount of PHD activity is more important than the specific function of 
      each isoform for hepatic Epo expression regulated by a PHD-HIF2alpha-EpoHE
      cascade in vivo.

      Cell Carcinoma Cells.
PG  - 2684-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00019-15 [doi]
AB  - We provide evidence that human SLFN5, an interferon (IFN)-inducible member of the
      Schlafen (SLFN) family of proteins, exhibits key roles in controlling motility
      and invasiveness of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. Our studies define the
      mechanism by which this occurs, demonstrating that SLFN5 negatively controls
      expression of the matrix metalloproteinase 1 gene (MMP-1), MMP-13, and several
      other genes involved in the control of malignant cell motility. Importantly, our 
      data establish that SLFN5 expression correlates with a better overall survival in
      a large cohort of patients with RCC. The inverse relationship between SLFN5
      expression and RCC aggressiveness raises the possibility of developing unique
      therapeutic approaches in the treatment of RCC, by modulating SLFN5 expression.

TI  - Bimodal Interaction of Mammalian Polo-Like Kinase 1 and a Centrosomal Scaffold,
      Cep192, in the Regulation of Bipolar Spindle Formation.
PG  - 2626-40
AB  - Serving as microtubule-organizing centers, centrosomes play a key role in forming
      bipolar spindles. The mechanism of how centrosomes promote bipolar spindle
      assembly in various organisms remains largely unknown. A recent study with
      Xenopus laevis egg extracts suggested that the Plk1 ortholog Plx1 interacts with 
      the phospho-T46 (p-T46) motif of Xenopus Cep192 (xCep192) to form an
      xCep192-mediated xAurA-Plx1 cascade that is critical for bipolar spindle
      formation. Here, we demonstrated that in cultured human cells, Cep192 recruits
      AurA and Plk1 in a cooperative manner, and this event is important for the
      reciprocal activation of AurA and Plk1. Strikingly, Plk1 interacted with Cep192
      through either the p-T44 (analogous to Xenopus p-T46) or the newly identified
      p-S995 motif via its C-terminal noncatalytic polo-box domain. The interaction
      between Plk1 and the p-T44 motif was prevalent in the presence of Cep192-bound
      AurA, whereas the interaction of Plk1 with the p-T995 motif was preferred in the 
      absence of AurA binding. Notably, the loss of p-T44- and p-S995-dependent
      Cep192-Plk1 interactions induced an additive defect in recruiting Plk1 and
      gamma-tubulin to centrosomes, which ultimately led to a failure in proper bipolar
      spindle formation and mitotic progression. Thus, we propose that Plk1 promotes
      centrosome-based bipolar spindle formation by forming two functionally
      nonredundant complexes with Cep192.

TI  - Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Induces Nrf2 Pathway Activation through
      p62-Triggered Keap1 Degradation.
PG  - 2673-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00105-15 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induce inflammation and tissue repair through multiple
      signaling pathways. The Nrf2 pathway plays a key role in defending against the
      tissue damage incurred by microbial infection or inflammation-associated
      diseases. The critical event that mediates TLR-induced Nrf2 activation is still
      poorly understood. In this study, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
      other Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists activate Nrf2 signaling and the
      activation is due to the reduction of Keap1, the key Nrf2 inhibitor. TLR
      signaling-induced Keap1 reduction promoted Nrf2 translocation from the cytoplasm 
      to the nucleus, where it activated transcription of its target genes. TLR
      agonists modulated Keap1 at the protein posttranslation level through autophagy. 
      TLR signaling increased the expression of autophagy protein p62 and LC3-II and
      induced their association with Keap1 in the autophagosome-like structures. We
      also characterized the interaction between p62 and Keap1 and found that p62 is
      indispensable for TLR-mediated Keap1 reduction: TLR signaling had no effect on
      Keap1 if cells lacked p62 or if cells expressed a mutant Keap1 that could not
      interact with p62. Our study indicates that p62-mediated Keap1 degradation
      through autophagy represents a critical linkage for TLR signaling regulation of
      the major defense network, the Nrf2 signaling pathway.

TI  - Phosphorylation of SAF-A/hnRNP-U Serine 59 by Polo-Like Kinase 1 Is Required for 
      Mitosis.
PG  - 2699-713
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01312-14 [doi]
AB  - Scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), also called heterogenous nuclear
      ribonuclear protein U (hnRNP-U), is phosphorylated on serine 59 by the
      DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in response to DNA damage. Since SAF-A,
      DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), and protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), which
      interacts with DNA-PKcs, have all been shown to have roles in mitosis, we asked
      whether DNA-PKcs phosphorylates SAF-A in mitosis. We show that SAF-A is
      phosphorylated on serine 59 in mitosis, that phosphorylation requires polo-like
      kinase 1 (PLK1) rather than DNA-PKcs, that SAF-A interacts with PLK1 in
      nocodazole-treated cells, and that serine 59 is dephosphorylated by protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in mitosis. Moreover, cells expressing SAF-A in which
      serine 59 is mutated to alanine have multiple characteristics of aberrant
      mitoses, including misaligned chromosomes, lagging chromosomes, polylobed nuclei,
      and delayed passage through mitosis. Our findings identify serine 59 of SAF-A as 
      a new target of both PLK1 and PP2A in mitosis and reveal that both
      phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of SAF-A serine 59 by PLK1 and PP2A,
      respectively, are required for accurate and timely exit from mitosis.

PG  - 2641-57
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00380-15 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is the most abundant inner membrane phospholipid.
      PE synthesis from ethanolamine and diacylglycerol is regulated primarily by
      CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2). Pcyt2(+/-) mice have
      reduced PE synthesis and, as a consequence, perturbed glucose and fatty acid
      metabolism, which gradually leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, obesity, 
      and insulin resistance. Glucose and fatty acid uptake and the corresponding
      transporters Glut4 and Cd36 are similarly impaired in male and female Pcyt2(+/-) 
      hearts. These mice also have similarly reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      (PI3K)/Akt1 signaling and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in
      the heart. However, only Pcyt2(+/-) males develop hypertension and cardiac
      hypertrophy. Pcyt2(+/-) males have upregulated heart AceI expression, heart
      phospholipids enriched in arachidonic acid and other n-6 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids, and dramatically increased ROS production in the aorta. In contrast,
      Pcyt2(+/-) females have unmodified heart phospholipids but have reduced heart
      triglyceride levels and altered expression of the structural genes Acta (low) and
      Myh7 (high). These changes together protect Pcyt2(+/-) females from cardiac
      dysfunction under conditions of reduced glucose and fatty acid uptake and heart
      insulin resistance. Our data identify Pcyt2 and membrane PE biogenesis as
      important determinants of gender-specific differences in cardiac lipids and heart
      function.

      (TGF-beta) pathway, promoting cell invasion, a loss of cell polarity, increased
      cell survival, and other hallmarks of early neoplasia. Overexpression of eIF4E is
      shown to facilitate the selective translation of integrin beta1 mRNA, which
      drives the translationally controlled assembly of a TGF-beta receptor signaling
      complex containing alpha3beta1 integrins, beta-catenin, TGF-beta receptor I,
      E-cadherin, and phosphorylated Smad2/3. This receptor complex acutely sensitizes 
      nonmalignant breast epithelial cells to activation by typically substimulatory
      levels of activated TGF-beta. TGF-beta can promote cellular differentiation or
      invasion and transformation. As a translational coactivator of TGF-beta, eIF4E
      confers selective mRNA translation, reprogramming nonmalignant cells to an
      invasive phenotype by reducing the set point for stimulation by activated
      TGF-beta. Overexpression of eIF4E may be a proinvasive facilitator of TGF-beta
      activity.

TI  - Rax Homeoprotein Regulates Photoreceptor Cell Maturation and Survival in
      Association with Crx in the Postnatal Mouse Retina.
PG  - 2583-96
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00048-15 [doi]
AB  - The Rax homeobox gene plays essential roles in multiple processes of vertebrate
      retina development. Many vertebrate species possess Rax and Rax2 genes, and
      different functions have been suggested. In contrast, mice contain a single Rax
      gene, and its functional roles in late retinal development are still unclear. To 
      clarify mouse Rax function in postnatal photoreceptor development and
      maintenance, we generated conditional knockout mice in which Rax in maturing or
      mature photoreceptor cells was inactivated by tamoxifen treatment (Rax iCKO
      mice). When Rax was inactivated in postnatal Rax iCKO mice, developing
      photoreceptor cells showed a significant decrease in the level of the expression 
      of rod and cone photoreceptor genes and mature adult photoreceptors exhibited a
      specific decrease in cone cell numbers. In luciferase assays, we found that Rax
      and Crx cooperatively transactivate Rhodopsin and cone opsin promoters and that
      an optimum Rax expression level to transactivate photoreceptor gene expression
      exists. Furthermore, Rax and Crx colocalized in maturing photoreceptor cells, and
      their coimmunoprecipitation was observed in cultured cells. Taken together, these
      results suggest that Rax plays essential roles in the maturation of both cones
      and rods and in the survival of cones by regulating photoreceptor gene expression
      with Crx in the postnatal mouse retina.

TI  - Pharmacological Induction of Human Fetal Globin Gene in Hydroxyurea-Resistant
      Primary Adult Erythroid Cells.
PG  - 2541-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00035-15 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological induction of the fetal gamma globin gene and the consequent
      formation of HbF (alpha2/gamma2) in adult erythroid cells are one feasible
      therapeutic strategy for sickle cell disease (SCD) and severe beta-thalassemias. 
      Hydroxyurea (HU) is the current drug of choice for SCD, but serious side effects 
      limit its clinical use. Moreover, 30 to 50% of patients are irresponsive to HU
      treatment. We have used high-throughput screening to identify
      benzo[de]benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-7-one and its derivatives (compounds
      I to VI) as potent gamma globin inducers. Of the compounds, I to V exert superior
      gamma globin induction and have better therapeutic potential than HU, likely
      because of their activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      signaling pathway and modulation of expression levels and/or chromosome binding
      of gamma globin gene regulators, including BCL11A, and chromatin structure over
      the gamma globin promoter. Unlike sodium butyrate (NaB), the global levels of
      acetylated histones H3 and H4 are not changed by compound II treatment.
      Remarkably, compound II induces the gamma globin gene in HU-resistant primary
      human adult erythroid cells, the p38 signaling pathway of which appears to be
      irresponsive to HU and NaB as well as compound II. This study provides a new
      framework for the development of new and superior compounds for treating SCD and 
      severe beta-thalassemias.

TI  - Chromatin-Mediated Reversible Silencing of Sense-Antisense Gene Pairs in
      Embryonic Stem Cells Is Consolidated upon Differentiation.
PG  - 2436-47
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00029-15 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide gene expression studies have indicated that the eukaryotic genome
      contains many gene pairs showing overlapping sense and antisense transcription.
      Regulation of these coding and/or noncoding gene pairs involves intricate
      regulatory mechanisms. In the present study, we utilized an enhanced green
      fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged reporter plasmid cis linked to a
      doxycycline-inducible antisense promoter, generating antisense transcription that
      fully overlaps EGFP, to study the mechanism and dynamics of gene silencing after 
      induction of noncoding antisense transcription in undifferentiated and
      differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We found that EGFP silencing
      is reversible in ESCs but is locked into a stable state upon ESC differentiation.
      Reversible silencing in ESCs is chromatin dependent and is associated with
      accumulation of trimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me3) at the EGFP
      promoter region. In differentiating ESCs, antisense transcription-induced
      accumulation of H3K36me3 was associated with an increase in CpG methylation at
      the EGFP promoter. Repression of the sense promoter was affected by
      small-molecule inhibitors which interfere with DNA methylation and histone
      demethylation pathways. Our results indicate a general mechanism for silencing of
      fully overlapping sense-antisense gene pairs involving antisense
      transcription-induced accumulation of H3K36me3 at the sense promoter, resulting
      in reversible silencing of the sense partner, which is stabilized during ESC
      differentiation by CpG methylation.

TI  - Bhlhe40 Represses PGC-1alpha Activity on Metabolic Gene Promoters in Myogenic
      Cells.
PG  - 2518-29
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00387-15 [doi]
AB  - PGC-1alpha is a transcriptional coactivator promoting oxidative metabolism in
      many tissues. Its expression in skeletal muscle (SKM) is induced by hypoxia and
      reactive oxidative species (ROS) generated during exercise, suggesting that
      PGC-1alpha might mediate the cross talk between oxidative metabolism and cellular
      responses to hypoxia and ROS. Here we found that PGC-1alpha directly interacted
      with Bhlhe40, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressor induced
      by hypoxia, and protects SKM from ROS damage, and they cooccupied
      PGC-1alpha-targeted gene promoters/enhancers, which in turn repressed PGC-1alpha 
      transactivational activity. Bhlhe40 repressed PGC-1alpha activity through
      recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and preventing the relief of PGC-1alpha
      intramolecular repression caused by its own intrinsic suppressor domain.
      Knockdown of Bhlhe40 mRNA increased levels of ROS, fatty acid oxidation,
      mitochondrial DNA, and expression of PGC-1alpha target genes. Similar effects
      were also observed when the Bhlhe40-mediated repression was rescued by a
      dominantly active form of the PGC-1alpha-interacting domain (PID) from Bhlhe40.
      We further found that Bhlhe40-mediated repression can be largely relieved by
      exercise, in which its recruitment to PGC-1alpha-targeted cis elements was
      significantly reduced. These observations suggest that Bhlhe40 is a novel
      regulator of PGC-1alpha activity repressing oxidative metabolism gene expression 
      and mitochondrion biogenesis in sedentary SKM.

TI  - Regulation of MicroRNA 183 by Cyclooxygenase 2 in Liver Is DEAD-Box Helicase p68 
      (DDX5) Dependent: Role in Insulin Signaling.
PG  - 2554-67
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00198-15 [doi]
AB  - Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis and
      exists as two isoforms. COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme involved in physiological 
      processes, whereas COX-2 is induced by a variety of stimuli. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
      are noncoding RNAs that function as key posttranscriptional regulators of gene
      expression. Although it is known that COX-2 expression is regulated by miRNAs,
      there are no data regarding COX-2 involvement in miRNA regulation. Considering
      our previous results showing that COX-2 expression in hepatocytes protects
      against insulin resistance, we evaluated the role of COX-2 in the regulation of a
      specific set of miRNAs implicated in insulin signaling in liver cells. Our
      results provide evidence of the molecular basis for a novel function of COX-2 in 
      miRNA processing. COX-2 represses miRNA 23b (miR-23b), miR-146b, and miR-183
      expression in liver cells by increasing the level of DEAD-box helicase p68 (DDX5)
      through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/p300 signaling and by modulating the
      enzymatic function of the Drosha (RNase type III) complex through its physical
      association with DDX5. The decrease of miR-183 expression promotes protection
      against insulin resistance by increasing insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)
      levels. These results indicate that the modulation of miRNA processing by COX-2
      is a key event in insulin signaling in liver and has potential clinical
      implications for the management of various hepatic dysfunctions.

TI  - Uncoupling Stress-Inducible Phosphorylation of Heat Shock Factor 1 from Its
      Activation.
PG  - 2530-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00816-14 [doi]
AB  - In mammals the stress-inducible expression of genes encoding heat shock proteins 
      is under the control of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). Activation 
      of HSF1 is a multistep process, involving trimerization, acquisition of
      DNA-binding and transcriptional activities, which coincide with several
      posttranslational modifications. Stress-inducible phosphorylation of HSF1, or
      hyperphosphorylation, which occurs mainly within the regulatory domain (RD), has 
      been proposed as a requirement for HSF-driven transcription and is widely used
      for assessing HSF1 activation. Nonetheless, the contribution of
      hyperphosphorylation to the activity of HSF1 remains unknown. In this study, we
      generated a phosphorylation-deficient HSF1 mutant (HSF1Delta approximately PRD), 
      where the 15 known phosphorylation sites within the RD were disrupted. Our
      results show that the phosphorylation status of the RD does not affect the
      subcellular localization and DNA-binding activity of HSF1. Surprisingly, under
      stress conditions, HSF1Delta approximately PRD is a potent transactivator of both
      endogenous targets and a reporter gene, and HSF1Delta approximately PRD has a
      reduced activation threshold. Our results provide the first direct evidence for
      uncoupling stress-inducible phosphorylation of HSF1 from its activation, and we
      propose that the phosphorylation signature alone is not an appropriate marker for
      HSF1 activity.

TI  - Regulated Intron Retention and Nuclear Pre-mRNA Decay Contribute to PABPN1
      Autoregulation.
PG  - 2503-17
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00070-15 [doi]
AB  - The poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 is encoded by the PABPN1 gene, whose
      mutations result in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, a late-onset disorder for
      which the molecular basis remains unknown. Despite recent studies investigating
      the functional roles of PABPN1, little is known about its regulation. Here, we
      show that PABPN1 negatively controls its own expression to maintain homeostatic
      levels in human cells. Transcription from the PABPN1 gene results in the
      accumulation of two major isoforms: an unspliced nuclear transcript that retains 
      the 3'-terminal intron and a fully spliced cytoplasmic mRNA. Increased dosage of 
      PABPN1 protein causes a significant decrease in the spliced/unspliced ratio,
      reducing the levels of endogenous PABPN1 protein. We also show that PABPN1
      autoregulation requires inefficient splicing of its 3'-terminal intron. Our data 
      suggest that autoregulation occurs via the binding of PABPN1 to an adenosine
      (A)-rich region in its 3' untranslated region, which promotes retention of the
      3'-terminal intron and clearance of intron-retained pre-mRNAs by the nuclear
      exosome. Our findings unveil a mechanism of regulated intron retention coupled to
      nuclear pre-mRNA decay that functions in the homeostatic control of PABPN1
      expression.

TI  - Dysregulated Inflammatory Signaling upon Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 1C Mutation of 
      SIMPLE Protein.
PG  - 2464-78
AB  - Endosomal trafficking is a key mechanism to modulate signal propagation and cross
      talk. Ubiquitin adaptors, along with endosomal sorting complex required for
      transport (ESCRT) complexes, are also integrated to terminate ligand-receptor
      activation in late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Within these
      pathways, we recently demonstrated that the protein SIMPLE is a novel player in
      MVB regulation. SIMPLE is also clinically important and its mutation accounts for
      the Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1C (CMT1C) disease. MVB defects of mutation and
      deletion of SIMPLE, however, are distinct. Here, we show that MVB defects found
      in mutation but not deletion of SIMPLE lead to impaired turnover and accumulation
      of ESCRT-0 protein Hrs punctain late endosomes. We further uncover increased
      colocalization of ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and Hrs in late endosomes. Upon
      stimulation with interkeukin-1 or transforming growth factor , prolonged
      activation of p38 kinase/JNK is detected, while nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB
      and phosphorylation of SMAD2 is reduced with CMT1C mutation. The aberrant
      kinetics we observed in inflammatory signaling may contribute to increased tumor 
      susceptibility and changes in the levels of chemokines/cytokines that result from
      CMT1C mutation. We propose that altered endosomal trafficking due to
      malformations of MVBs and subsequent atypical signaling kinetic may account for a
      toxic gain of function in CMT1C pathogenesis.

TI  - Rap1 Spatially Controls ArhGAP29 To Inhibit Rho Signaling during Endothelial
      Barrier Regulation.
PG  - 2495-502
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01453-14 [doi]
AB  - The small GTPase Rap1 controls the actin cytoskeleton by regulating Rho GTPase
      signaling. We recently established that the Rap1 effectors Radil and Rasip1,
      together with the Rho GTPase activating protein ArhGAP29, mediate Rap1-induced
      inhibition of Rho signaling in the processes of epithelial cell spreading and
      endothelial barrier function. Here, we show that Rap1 induces the independent
      translocations of Rasip1 and a Radil-ArhGAP29 complex to the plasma membrane.
      This results in the formation of a multimeric protein complex required for
      Rap1-induced inhibition of Rho signaling and increased endothelial barrier
      function. Together with the previously reported spatiotemporal control of the Rap
      guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1, these findings elucidate a signaling
      pathway for spatiotemporal control of Rho signaling that operates by successive
      protein translocations to and complex formation at the plasma membrane.

TI  - Amino Acid-Dependent mTORC1 Regulation by the Lysosomal Membrane Protein SLC38A9.
PG  - 2479-94
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00125-15 [doi]
AB  - The serine/threonine kinase mTORC1 regulates cellular homeostasis in response to 
      many cues, such as nutrient status and energy level. Amino acids induce mTORC1
      activation on lysosomes via the small Rag GTPases and the Ragulator complex,
      thereby controlling protein translation and cell growth. Here, we identify the
      human 11-pass transmembrane protein SLC38A9 as a novel component of the
      Rag-Ragulator complex. SLC38A9 localizes with Rag-Ragulator complex components on
      lysosomes and associates with Rag GTPases in an amino acid-sensitive and
      nucleotide binding state-dependent manner. Depletion of SLC38A9 inhibits mTORC1
      activity in the presence of amino acids and in response to amino acid
      replenishment following starvation. Conversely, SLC38A9 overexpression causes
      RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase-dependent hyperactivation of mTORC1
      and partly sustains mTORC1 activity upon amino acid deprivation. Intriguingly,
      during amino acid starvation mTOR is retained at the lysosome upon SLC38A9
      depletion but fails to be activated. Together, the findings of our study reveal
      SLC38A9 as a Rag-Ragulator complex member transducing amino acid availability to 
      mTORC1 activity.

TI  - Spindle Checkpoint Factors Bub1 and Bub2 Promote DNA Double-Strand Break Repair
      by Nonhomologous End Joining.
PG  - 2448-63
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00007-15 [doi]
AB  - The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is essential for the preservation of
      genome integrity, as it efficiently repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).
      Previous biochemical and genetic investigations have indicated that, despite the 
      importance of this pathway, the entire complement of genes regulating NHEJ
      remains unknown. To address this, we employed a plasmid-based NHEJ DNA repair
      screen in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using 369 putative
      nonessential DNA repair-related components as queries. Among the newly identified
      genes associated with NHEJ deficiency upon disruption are two spindle assembly
      checkpoint kinases, Bub1 and Bub2. Both observation of resulting phenotypes and
      chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bub1 and -2, either alone or in
      combination with cell cycle regulators, are recruited near the DSB, where
      phosphorylated Rad53 or H2A accumulates. Large-scale proteomic analysis of Bub
      kinases phosphorylated in response to DNA damage identified previously unknown
      kinase substrates on Tel1 S/T-Q sites. Moreover, Bub1 NHEJ function appears to be
      conserved in mammalian cells. 53BP1, which influences DSB repair by NHEJ,
      colocalizes with human BUB1 and is recruited to the break sites. Thus, while Bub 
      is not a core component of NHEJ machinery, our data support its dual role in
      mitotic exit and promotion of NHEJ repair in yeast and mammals.

TI  - Overexpression of the Insulin-Like Growth Factor II Receptor Increases
      beta-Amyloid Production and Affects Cell Viability.
PG  - 2368-84
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01338-14 [doi]
AB  - Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides originating from amyloid precursor protein (APP) in
      the endosomal-lysosomal compartments play a critical role in the development of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of senile dementia affecting the
      elderly. Since insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptors facilitate the
      delivery of nascent lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, 
      we evaluated their role in APP metabolism and cell viability using mouse
      fibroblast MS cells deficient in the murine IGF-II receptor and corresponding
      MS9II cells overexpressing the human IGF-II receptors. Our results show that
      IGF-II receptor overexpression increases the protein levels of APP. This is
      accompanied by an increase of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 levels and an
      increase of beta- and gamma-secretase enzyme activities, leading to enhanced
      Abeta production. At the cellular level, IGF-II receptor overexpression causes
      localization of APP in perinuclear tubular structures, an increase of lipid raft 
      components, and increased lipid raft partitioning of APP. Finally, MS9II cells
      are more susceptible to staurosporine-induced cytotoxicity, which can be
      attenuated by beta-secretase inhibitor. Together, these results highlight the
      potential contribution of IGF-II receptor to AD pathology not only by regulating 
      expression/processing of APP but also by its role in cellular vulnerability.

TI  - Drosophila DBT Autophosphorylation of Its C-Terminal Domain Antagonized by SPAG
      and Involved in UV-Induced Apoptosis.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00390-15 [doi]
AB  - Drosophila DBT and vertebrate CKIepsilon/delta phosphorylate the period protein
      (PER) to produce circadian rhythms. While the C termini of these orthologs are
      not conserved in amino acid sequence, they inhibit activity and become
      autophosphorylated in the fly and vertebrate kinases. Here, sites of C-terminal
      autophosphorylation were identified by mass spectrometry and analysis of DBT
      truncations. Mutation of 6 serines and threonines in the C terminus (DBT(C/ala)) 
      prevented autophosphorylation-dependent DBT turnover and electrophoretic mobility
      shifts in S2 cells. Unlike the effect of autophosphorylation on CKIdelta, DBT
      autophosphorylation in S2 cells did not reduce its in vitro activity. Moreover,
      overexpression of DBT(C/ala) did not affect circadian behavior differently from
      wild-type DBT (DBT(WT)), and neither exhibited daily electrophoretic mobility
      shifts, suggesting that DBT autophosphorylation is not required for clock
      function. While DBT(WT) protected S2 cells and larvae from UV-induced apoptosis
      and was phosphorylated and degraded by the proteasome, DBT(C/ala) did not protect
      and was not degraded. Finally, we show that the HSP-90 cochaperone spaghetti
      protein (SPAG) antagonizes DBT autophosphorylation in S2 cells. These results
      suggest that DBT autophosphorylation regulates cell death and suggest a potential
      mechanism by which the circadian clock might affect apoptosis.

TI  - SOCS3 Drives Proteasomal Degradation of TBK1 and Negatively Regulates Antiviral
      Innate Immunity.
PG  - 2400-13
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00090-15 [doi]
AB  - TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFN) plays 
      a critical role in host antiviral responses and immune homeostasis. The negative 
      regulation of TBK1 activity is largely unknown. We report that suppressor of
      cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) inhibits the IFN-beta signaling pathway by promoting
      proteasomal degradation of TBK1. Overexpression and knockdown experiments
      indicated that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
      phosphorylation and IFN-beta transcription. Moreover, SOCS3 directly associates
      with TBK1, and they colocalize in the cytoplasm. SOCS3 catalyzes K48-linked
      polyubiquitination of TBK1 at Lys341 and Lys344 and promotes subsequent TBK1
      degradation. On the contrary, SOCS3 knockdown markedly increases the abundance of
      TBK1. Interestingly, both the BOX domain of SOCS3 and Ser172 phosphorylation of
      TBK1 are indispensable for the processes of ubiquitination and degradation.
      Ectopic expression of SOCS3 significantly inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus
      (VSV) and influenza A virus strain A/WSN/33 (WSN)-induced IRF3 phosphorylation
      and facilitates the replication of WSN virus by detecting the transcription of
      its viral RNA (vRNA). Knockdown of SOCS3 represses WSN replication. Collectively,
      these results demonstrate that SOCS3 acts as a negative regulator of IFN-beta
      signal by ubiquitinating and degrading TBK1, shed light on the understanding of
      antiviral innate immunity, and provide a potential target for developing
      antiviral agents.

TI  - Disruption of Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling and Telomeric Shortening Are
      Inextricable Consequences of Tankyrase Inhibition in Human Cells.
PG  - 2425-35
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00392-15 [doi]
AB  - Maintenance of chromosomal ends (telomeres) directly contributes to cancer cell
      immortalization. The telomere protection enzymes belonging to the tankyrase
      (Tnks) subfamily of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) have recently been shown
      to also control transcriptional response to secreted Wnt signaling molecules.
      Whereas Tnks inhibitors are currently being developed as therapeutic agents for
      targeting Wnt-related cancers and as modulators of Wnt signaling in
      tissue-engineering agendas, their impact on telomere length maintenance remains
      unclear. Here, we leveraged a collection of Wnt pathway inhibitors with
      previously unassigned mechanisms of action to identify novel pharmacophores
      supporting Tnks inhibition. A multifaceted experimental approach that included
      structural, biochemical, and cell biological analyses revealed two distinct
      chemotypes with selectivity for Tnks enzymes. Using these reagents, we revealed
      that Tnks inhibition rapidly induces DNA damage at telomeres and telomeric
      shortening upon long-term chemical exposure in cultured cells. On the other hand,
      inhibitors of the Wnt acyltransferase Porcupine (Porcn) elicited neither effect. 
      Thus, Tnks inhibitors impact telomere length maintenance independently of their
      affects on Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We discuss the implications of these
      findings for anticancer and regenerative medicine agendas dependent upon chemical
      inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

      Interactions with KEAP1.
PG  - 2385-99
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00087-15 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease
      characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. Various factors contribute 
      to the disease, including RNA binding protein dysregulation and oxidative stress,
      but their exact role in pathogenic mechanisms remains unclear. We have recently
      linked another RNA binding protein, RBM45, to ALS via increased levels of protein
      in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients and its localization to cytoplasmic
      inclusions in ALS motor neurons. Here we show RBM45 nuclear exit in ALS spinal
      cord motor neurons compared to controls, a phenotype recapitulated in vitro in
      motor neurons treated with oxidative stressors. We find that RBM45 binds and
      stabilizes KEAP1, the inhibitor of the antioxidant response transcription factor 
      NRF2. ALS lumbar spinal cord lysates similarly show increased cytoplasmic binding
      of KEAP1 and RBM45. Binding of RBM45 to KEAP1 impedes the protective antioxidant 
      response, thus contributing to oxidative stress-induced cellular toxicity. Our
      findings thus describe a novel link between a mislocalized RNA binding protein
      implicated in ALS (RBM45) and dysregulation of the neuroprotective antioxidant
      response seen in the disease.

TI  - Tip110 Regulates the Cross Talk between p53 and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1alpha
      under Hypoxia and Promotes Survival of Cancer Cells.
PG  - 2254-64
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00001-15 [doi]
AB  - Hypoxia often occurs under various physiological and pathophysiological
      conditions, including solid tumors; it is linked to malignant transformation,
      metastatic progression, and treatment failure or resistance. Tip110 protein plays
      important roles in several known physiological and pathophysiological processes, 
      including cancers. Thus, in the present study we investigated the regulation of
      Tip110 expression under hypoxia. Hypoxia led to Tip110 protein degradation
      through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Under hypoxia, Tip110 stabilized p53,
      which in return destabilized Tip110. In addition, Tip110 regulated
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), likely through enhancement of its
      protein stability. Furthermore, Tip110 upregulated p300, a known coactivator for 
      both p53 and HIF-1alpha. Expression of a p53(22/23) mutant deficient in p300
      binding accelerated Tip110 degradation under hypoxia. Tip110 knockdown resulted
      in the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death in the presence of p53.
      Finally, significantly less Tip110, p53, and HIF-1alpha was detected in the
      hypoxic region of bone metastasis tumors in a mouse model of human melanoma
      cells. Taken together, these results suggest Tip110 is an important mediator in
      the cross talk between p53 and HIF-1alpha in response to hypoxic stress.

TI  - Inducible Deletion of Protein Kinase Map4k4 in Obese Mice Improves Insulin
      Sensitivity in Liver and Adipose Tissues.
PG  - 2356-65
AB  - Studies in vitro suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
      kinase 4 (Map4k4) attenuates insulin signaling, but confirmation in vivo is
      lacking since Map4k4 knockout is lethal during embryogenesis. We thus generated
      mice with floxed Map4k4 alleles and a tamoxifen-inducible Cre/ERT2 recombinase
      under the control of the ubiquitin C promoter to induce whole-body Map4k4
      deletion after these animals reached maturity. Tamoxifen administration to these 
      mice induced Map4k4 deletion in all tissues examined, causing decreased fasting
      blood glucose concentrations and enhanced insulin signaling to AKT in adipose
      tissue and liver but not in skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, however, mice
      generated with a conditional Map4k4 deletion in adiponectin-positive adipocytes
      or in albumin-positive hepatocytes displayed no detectable metabolic phenotypes. 
      Instead, mice with Map4k4 deleted in Myf5-positive tissues, including all
      skeletal muscles tested, were protected from obesity-induced glucose intolerance 
      and insulin resistance. Remarkably, these mice also showed increased insulin
      sensitivity in adipose tissue but not skeletal muscle, similar to the metabolic
      phenotypes observed in inducible whole-body knockout mice. Taken together, these 
      results indicate that (i) Map4k4 controls a pathway in Myf5-positive cells that
      suppresses whole-body insulin sensitivity and (ii) Map4k4 is a potential
      therapeutic target for improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in
      type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Noncanonical Effects of IRF9 in Intestinal Inflammation: More than Type I and
      Type III Interferons.
PG  - 2332-43
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01498-14 [doi]
AB  - The interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription factor with
      its Stat1, Stat2, and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) subunits is employed 
      for transcriptional responses downstream of receptors for type I interferons
      (IFN-I) that include IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and type III interferons (IFN-III),
      also called IFN-lambda. Here, we show in a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis that IRF9 deficiency protects animals, whereas the combined
      loss of IFN-I and IFN-III receptors worsens their condition. We explain the
      different phenotypes by demonstrating a function of IRF9 in a noncanonical
      transcriptional complex with Stat1, apart from IFN-I and IFN-III signaling.
      Together, Stat1 and IRF9 produce a proinflammatory activity that overrides the
      benefits of the IFN-III response on intestinal epithelial cells. Our results
      further suggest that the CXCL10 chemokine gene is an important mediator of this
      proinflammatory activity. We thus establish IFN-lambda as a potentially
      anticolitogenic cytokine and propose an important role for IRF9 as a component of
      noncanonical Stat complexes in the development of colitis.

TI  - mTOR Complex 2 Stabilizes Mcl-1 Protein by Suppressing Its Glycogen Synthase
      Kinase 3-Dependent and SCF-FBXW7-Mediated Degradation.
PG  - 2344-55
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01525-14 [doi]
AB  - mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) regulates cell survival and growth through undefined
      mechanisms. Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family protein, functions as an oncogenic protein. The
      connection between mTORC2 and Mcl-1 stability has not been established and was
      thus the focus of this study. Mcl-1 levels in cancer cells were decreased by mTOR
      kinase inhibitors (TORKinibs), which inhibit both mTORCs, by knocking down rictor
      and by knocking out rictor or Sin1 but not by silencing raptor. TORKinib
      treatment and rictor knockdown did not alter Mcl-1 mRNA levels but rather
      decreased its protein stability. Moreover, TORKinib-induced Mcl-1 reduction was
      rescued by proteasome inhibition. Consistently, TORKinib increased Mcl-1
      ubiquitination. Hence, it is clear that inhibition of mTORC2 enhances Mcl-1
      degradation, resulting in Mcl-1 reduction. Suppression of glycogen synthase
      kinase 3 (GSK3) or FBXW7 rescued Mcl-1 reduction induced by TORKinibs or rictor
      knockdown. Thus, mTORC2 inhibition apparently induces Mcl-1 degradation through a
      GSK3-dependent and SCF-FBXW7-mediated mechanism. Intriguingly, we detected a
      direct association between mTORC2 and SCF-FBXW7; this association could be
      inhibited by TORKinib treatment, suggesting that mTORC2 may directly associate
      with and inhibit the SCF-FBXW7 complex, resulting in delayed Mcl-1 degradation.
      Collectively, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which mTORC2 regulates 
      cell survival and growth by stabilizing Mcl-1.

      Drosophila Cells.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01346-14 [doi]
AB  - The translation and degradation of mRNAs are two key steps in gene expression
      that are highly regulated and targeted by many factors, including microRNAs
      (miRNAs). While it is well established that translation and mRNA degradation are 
      tightly coupled, it is still not entirely clear where in the cell mRNA
      degradation takes place. In this study, we investigated the possibility of mRNA
      degradation on the ribosome in Drosophila cells. Using polysome profiles and
      ribosome affinity purification, we could demonstrate the copurification of
      various deadenylation and decapping factors with ribosome complexes. Also, AGO1
      and GW182, two key factors in the miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation pathway, were
      associated with ribosome complexes. Their copurification was dependent on intact 
      mRNAs, suggesting the association of these factors with the mRNA rather than the 
      ribosome itself. Furthermore, we isolated decapped mRNA degradation intermediates
      from ribosome complexes and performed high-throughput sequencing analysis.
      Interestingly, 93% of the decapped mRNA fragments (approximately 12,000) could be
      detected at the same relative abundance on ribosome complexes and in cell
      lysates. In summary, our findings strongly indicate the association of the
      majority of bulk mRNAs as well as mRNAs targeted by miRNAs with the ribosome
      during their degradation.

TI  - Overexpression of NF90-NF45 Represses Myogenic MicroRNA Biogenesis, Resulting in 
      Development of Skeletal Muscle Atrophy and Centronuclear Muscle Fibers.
PG  - 2295-308
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01297-14 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the progression and suppression of various
      diseases through translational inhibition of target mRNAs. Therefore, the
      alteration of miRNA biogenesis induces several diseases. The nuclear factor 90
      (NF90)-NF45 complex is known as a negative regulator in miRNA biogenesis. Here,
      we showed that NF90-NF45 double-transgenic (dbTg) mice develop skeletal muscle
      atrophy and centronuclear muscle fibers in adulthood. Subsequently, we found that
      the levels of myogenic miRNAs, including miRNA 133a (miR-133a), which promote
      muscle maturation, were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscle of
      NF90-NF45 dbTg mice compared with those in wild-type mice. However, levels of
      primary transcripts of the miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) were clearly elevated in NF90-NF45
      dbTg mice. This result indicated that the NF90-NF45 complex suppressed miRNA
      production through inhibition of pri-miRNA processing. This finding was supported
      by the fact that processing of pri-miRNA 133a-1 (pri-miR-133a-1) was inhibited
      via binding of NF90-NF45 to the pri-miRNA. Finally, the level of dynamin 2, a
      causative gene of centronuclear myopathy and concomitantly a target of miR-133a, 
      was elevated in the skeletal muscle of NF90-NF45 dbTg mice. Taken together, we
      conclude that the NF90-NF45 complex induces centronuclear myopathy through
      increased dynamin 2 expression by an NF90-NF45-induced reduction of miR-133a
      expression in vivo.

TI  - NOS1AP Functionally Associates with YAP To Regulate Hippo Signaling.
PG  - 2265-77
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00062-15 [doi]
AB  - Deregulation of cellular polarity proteins and their associated complexes leads
      to changes in cell migration and proliferation. The nitric oxide synthase 1
      adaptor protein (NOS1AP) associates with the tumor suppressor protein Scribble to
      control cell migration and oncogenic transformation. However, how NOS1AP is
      linked to the cell signaling events that curb oncogenic progression has remained 
      elusive. Here we identify several novel NOS1AP isoforms, NOS1APd, NOS1APe, and
      NOS1APf, with distinct cellular localizations. We show that isoforms with a
      membrane-interacting phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain can associate with
      Scribble and recognize acidic phospholipids. In a screen to identify novel
      binding proteins, we have discovered a complex consisting of NOS1AP and the
      transcriptional coactivator YAP linking NOS1AP to the Hippo signaling pathway.
      Silencing of NOS1AP reduces the phosphorylation of YAP and of the upstream kinase
      Lats1. Conversely, expression of NOS1AP promotes YAP and Lats1 phosphorylation,
      which correlates with reduced TEAD activity and restricted cell proliferation.
      Together, these data implicate a role for NOS1AP in the regulation of core Hippo 
      signaling and are consistent with the idea that NOS1AP functions as a tumor
      suppressor.

TI  - Spt6 Is Essential for rRNA Synthesis by RNA Polymerase I.
PG  - 2321-31
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01499-14 [doi]
AB  - Spt6 (suppressor of Ty6) has many roles in transcription initiation and
      elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II. These effects are mediated through
      interactions with histones, transcription factors, and the RNA polymerase. Two
      lines of evidence suggest that Spt6 also plays a role in rRNA synthesis. First,
      Spt6 physically associates with a Pol I subunit (Rpa43). Second, Spt6 interacts
      physically and genetically with Spt4/5, which directly affects Pol I
      transcription. Utilizing a temperature-sensitive allele, spt6-1004, we show that 
      Spt6 is essential for Pol I occupancy of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rRNA
      synthesis. Our data demonstrate that protein levels of an essential Pol I
      initiation factor, Rrn3, are reduced when Spt6 is inactivated, leading to low
      levels of Pol I-Rrn3 complex. Overexpression of RRN3 rescues Pol I-Rrn3 complex
      formation; however, rRNA synthesis is not restored. These data suggest that Spt6 
      is involved in either recruiting the Pol I-Rrn3 complex to the rDNA or
      stabilizing the preinitiation complex. The findings presented here identify an
      unexpected, essential role for Spt6 in synthesis of rRNA.

TI  - Argonaute 2 Binds Directly to tRNA Genes and Promotes Gene Repression in cis.
PG  - 2278-94
AB  - To further our understanding of the RNAi machinery within the human nucleus, we
      analyzed the chromatin and RNA binding of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) within human cancer 
      cell lines. Our data indicated that AGO2 binds directly to nascent tRNA and 5S
      rRNA, and to the genomic loci from which these RNAs are transcribed, in a small
      RNA- and DICER-independent manner. AGO2 chromatin binding was not observed at
      non-TFIIIC-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol III) genes or at extra-TFIIIC (ETC) 
      sites, indicating that the interaction is specific for TFIIIC-dependent Pol III
      genes. A genome-wide analysis indicated that loss of AGO2 caused a global
      increase in mRNA expression level among genes that flank AGO2-bound tRNA genes.
      This effect was shown to be distinct from that of the disruption of DICER,
      DROSHA, or CTCF. We propose that AGO2 binding to tRNA genes has a novel and
      important regulatory role in human cells.

TI  - Divergent Alanyl-tRNA Synthetase Genes of Vanderwaltozyma polyspora Descended
      from a Common Ancestor through Whole-Genome Duplication Followed by Asymmetric
      Evolution.
PG  - 2242-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00018-15 [doi]
AB  - Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of a eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
      (aaRS) are generally encoded by two distinct nuclear genes, one of eukaryotic
      origin and the other of mitochondrial origin. However, in most known yeasts, only
      the mitochondrial-origin alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) gene is retained and
      plays a dual-functional role. Here, we present a novel scenario of AlaRS
      evolution in the yeast Vanderwaltozyma polyspora. V. polyspora possesses two
      significantly diverged AlaRS gene homologues, one encoding the cytoplasmic form
      and the other its mitochondrial counterpart. Clever selection of transcription
      and translation initiation sites enables the two isoforms to be localized and
      thus functional in their respective cellular compartments. However, the two
      isoforms can also be stably expressed and function in the reciprocal compartments
      by insertion or removal of a mitochondrial targeting signal. Synteny and
      phylogeny analyses revealed that the AlaRS homologues of V. polyspora arose from 
      a dual-functional common ancestor through whole-genome duplication (WGD).
      Moreover, the mitochondrial form had higher synonymous (1.6-fold) and
      nonsynonymous (2.8-fold) substitution rates than did its cytoplasmic counterpart,
      presumably due to a lesser constraint imposed on components of the mitochondrial 
      translational apparatus. Our study suggests that asymmetric evolution confers the
      divergence between the AlaRS paralogues of V. polyspora.

      the Splicing and Degradation of a Subset of Human Pre-mRNAs.

AB  - Most human protein-encoding transcripts contain multiple introns that are removed
      by splicing. Although splicing catalysis is frequently cotranscriptional, some
      introns are excised after polyadenylation. Accumulating evidence suggests that
      delayed splicing has regulatory potential, but the mechanisms are still not well 
      understood. Here we identify a terminal poly(A) tail as being important for a
      subset of intron excision events that follow cleavage and polyadenylation. In
      these cases, splicing is promoted by the nuclear poly(A) binding protein, PABPN1,
      and poly(A) polymerase (PAP). PABPN1 promotes intron excision in the context of
      3'-end polyadenylation but not when bound to internal A-tracts. Importantly, the 
      ability of PABPN1 to promote splicing requires its RNA binding and, to a lesser
      extent, PAP-stimulatory functions. Interestingly, an N-terminal alanine expansion
      in PABPN1 that is thought to cause oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy cannot
      completely rescue the effects of PABPN1 depletion, suggesting that this pathway
      may have relevance to disease. Finally, inefficient polyadenylation is associated
      with impaired recruitment of splicing factors to affected introns, which are
      consequently degraded by the exosome. Our studies uncover a new function for
      polyadenylation in controlling the expression of a subset of human genes via
      pre-mRNA splicing.

TI  - Complete cis Exclusion upon Duplication of the Emu Enhancer at the Immunoglobulin
      Heavy Chain Locus.
PG  - 2231-41
AB  - Developing lymphocytes somatically diversify their antigen-receptor loci through 
      V(D)J recombination. The process is associated with allelic exclusion, which
      results in monoallelic expression of an antigen receptor locus. Various
      cis-regulatory elements control V(D)J recombination in a developmentally
      regulated manner, but their role in allelic exclusion is still unclear. At the
      immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH), the Emu enhancer plays a critical role in
      V(D)J recombination. We generated a mouse line with a replacement mutation in the
      constant region of the locus that duplicates the Emu enhancer and allows
      premature expression of the gamma3 heavy chain. Strikingly, IgM expression was
      completely and specifically excluded in cis from the mutant allele. This cis
      exclusion recapitulated the main features of allelic exclusion, including
      differential exclusion of variable genes. Notably, sense and antisense
      transcription within the distal variable domain and distal V(H)-DJ(H)
      recombination were inhibited. cis exclusion was established and stably maintained
      despite an active endogenous Emu enhancer. The data reveal the importance of the 
      dynamic, developmental stage-dependent interplay between IgH locus enhancers and 
      signaling in the induction and maintenance of allelic exclusion.

TI  - Mcm2-7 Is an Active Player in the DNA Replication Checkpoint Signaling Cascade
      via Proposed Modulation of Its DNA Gate.
PG  - 2131-43
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01357-14 [doi]
AB  - The DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) monitors and responds to stalled replication
      forks to prevent genomic instability. How core replication factors integrate into
      this phosphorylation cascade is incompletely understood. Here, through analysis
      of a unique mcm allele targeting a specific ATPase active site (mcm2DENQ), we
      show that the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase has a novel DRC function as part of the
      signal transduction cascade. This allele exhibits normal downstream mediator
      (Mrc1) phosphorylation, implying DRC sensor kinase activation. However, the
      mutant also exhibits defective effector kinase (Rad53) activation and classic DRC
      phenotypes. Our previous in vitro analysis showed that the mcm2DENQ mutation
      prevents a specific conformational change in the Mcm2-7 hexamer. We infer that
      this conformational change is required for its DRC role and propose that it
      allosterically facilitates Rad53 activation to ensure a replication-specific
      checkpoint response.

TI  - SMAD1 and SMAD5 Expression Is Coordinately Regulated by FLI1 and GATA2 during
      Endothelial Development.
PG  - 2165-72
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00239-15 [doi]
AB  - The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling pathway is a critical
      regulator of angiogenic sprouting and is involved in vascular development in the 
      embryo. SMAD1 and SMAD5, the core mediators of BMP signaling, are vital for this 
      activity, yet little is known about their transcriptional regulation in
      endothelial cells. Here, we have integrated multispecies sequence conservation,
      tissue-specific chromatin, in vitro reporter assay, and in vivo transgenic data
      to identify and validate Smad1+63 and the Smad5 promoter as tissue-specific
      cis-regulatory elements that are active in the developing endothelium. The
      activity of these elements in the endothelium was dependent on highly conserved
      ETS, GATA, and E-box motifs, and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed high levels
      of enrichment of FLI1, GATA2, and SCL at these sites in endothelial cell lines
      and E11 dorsal aortas in vivo. Knockdown of FLI1 and GATA2 but not SCL reduced
      the expression of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in endothelial cells in vitro. In contrast,
      CD31(+) cKit(-) endothelial cells harvested from embryonic day 9 (E9)
      aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) regions of GATA2 null embryos showed reduced Smad1 
      but not Smad5 transcript levels. This is suggestive of a degree of in vivo
      selection where, in the case of reduced SMAD1 levels, endothelial cells with more
      robust SMAD5 expression have a selective advantage.

      translocation, resulting in enhanced NF-kappaB activity and altered expression of
      its target genes, such as the Sox9 transcriptional factor, which plays a critical
      role in chondrogenic differentiation and endochondral ossification. In this
      report, we unveil the role of CypA in signal-induced chondrogenic differentiation
      and endochondral ossification. Expression levels of the chondrogenic
      differentiation markers and transcriptional regulators Sox9 and Runx2 were all
      significantly lower in CypA knockdown chondrogenic cells than in wild-type cells,
      indicating that CypA plays a functional role in chondrogenic differentiation. In 
      vitro differentiation studies using micromass cultures of mouse limb bud cells
      further supported the conclusion that CypA is needed for chondrogenic
      differentiation. Newborn CypA-deficient pups double stained with alcian blue and 
      alizarin red exhibited generalized, pronounced skeletal defects, while
      high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) analyses of the femurs and
      lumbar vertebrae revealed delayed or incomplete endochondral ossification.
      Comparative histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses further verified
      the effects of CypA deficiency on chondrogenic differentiation. Our results
      provide evidence for the important contribution of CypA as a pertinent component 
      acting through NF-kappaB-Sox9 in regulation of chondrogenesis signaling. These
      findings are important to better understand signal-induced chondrogenesis of
      chondrogenic progenitors in physiological and pathophysiological contexts.

TI  - TAF10 Interacts with the GATA1 Transcription Factor and Controls Mouse
      Erythropoiesis.
PG  - 2103-18
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01370-14 [doi]
AB  - The ordered assembly of a functional preinitiation complex (PIC), composed of
      general transcription factors (GTFs), is a prerequisite for the transcription of 
      protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II. TFIID, comprised of the TATA binding
      protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), is the GTF that is thought to
      recognize the promoter sequences allowing site-specific PIC assembly.
      Transcriptional cofactors, such as SAGA, are also necessary for tightly regulated
      transcription initiation. The contribution of the two TAF10-containing complexes 
      (TFIID, SAGA) to erythropoiesis remains elusive. By ablating TAF10 specifically
      in erythroid cells in vivo, we observed a differentiation block accompanied by
      deregulated GATA1 target genes, including Gata1 itself, suggesting functional
      cross talk between GATA1 and TAF10. Additionally, we analyzed by mass
      spectrometry the composition of TFIID and SAGA complexes in mouse and human cells
      and found that their global integrity is maintained, with minor changes, during
      erythroid cell differentiation and development. In agreement with our functional 
      data, we show that TAF10 interacts directly with GATA1 and that TAF10 is enriched
      on the GATA1 locus in human fetal erythroid cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate
      a cross talk between canonical TFIID and SAGA complexes and cell-specific
      transcription activators during development and differentiation.

TI  - Genetic Analysis of Connective Tissue Growth Factor as an Effector of
      Transforming Growth Factor beta Signaling and Cardiac Remodeling.
PG  - 2154-64
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00199-15 [doi]
AB  - The matricellular secreted protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is
      upregulated in response to cardiac injury or with transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta) stimulation, where it has been suggested to function as a fibrotic
      effector. Here we generated transgenic mice with inducible heart-specific CTGF
      overexpression, mice with heart-specific expression of an activated TGF-beta
      mutant protein, mice with heart-specific deletion of Ctgf, and mice in which Ctgf
      was also deleted from fibroblasts in the heart. Remarkably, neither gain nor loss
      of CTGF in the heart affected cardiac pathology and propensity toward early
      lethality due to TGF-beta overactivation in the heart. Also, neither
      heart-specific Ctgf deletion nor CTGF overexpression altered cardiac remodeling
      and function with aging or after multiple acute stress stimuli. Cardiac fibrosis 
      was also unchanged by modulation of CTGF levels in the heart with aging, pressure
      overload, agonist infusion, or TGF-beta overexpression. However, CTGF mildly
      altered the overall cardiac response to TGF-beta when pressure overload
      stimulation was applied. CTGF has been proposed to function as a critical
      TGF-beta effector in underlying tissue remodeling and fibrosis throughout the
      body, although our results suggest that CTGF is of minimal importance and is an
      unlikely therapeutic vantage point for the heart.

TI  - Cleavage of BLOC1S1 mRNA by IRE1 Is Sequence Specific, Temporally Separate from
      XBP1 Splicing, and Dispensable for Cell Viability under Acute Endoplasmic
      Reticulum Stress.
PG  - 2186-202
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00013-15 [doi]
AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) remediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
      IRE1, a component of the UPR, senses misfolded protein and cleaves XBP1 mRNA,
      which is ligated to code for the prosurvival transcription factor. IRE1 also
      cleaves other mRNAs preceding their degradation, termed regulated IRE1-dependent 
      mRNA decay (RIDD). It has been reported that RIDD may be involved in cell
      viability under stress and therefore may contribute to cancer cell viability. To 
      investigate RIDD targets that may have functional relevance in cell survival, we 
      identified conserved RIDD targets containing stringent IRE1 RNase target
      sequences. Using a systematic bioinformatics approach with quantitative-PCR
      (qPCR) validation, we show that only BLOC1S1 is consistently a RIDD target in all
      systems tested. Using cancer cell lines, we show that BLOC1S1 is specifically
      cleaved by IRE1 at guanine 444, but only under conditions of IRE1
      hyperactivation. BLOC1S1 cleavage is temporally separate from XBP1 splicing,
      occurring after depletion of unspliced XBP1. Expression of an uncleavable BLOC1S1
      mutant or inhibition of RIDD using an IRE1 RNase inhibitor did not affect
      cellular recovery from acute ER stress. These data demonstrate that although
      hyperactivated IRE1 specifically cleaves BLOC1S1, this cleavage event and RIDD as
      a whole are dispensable for cell viability under acute stress.

PG  - 2173-85
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01518-14 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. C1q/tumor necrosis
      factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9) is an adipokine that is downregulated by
      obesity. We investigated the role of CTRP9 in cardiac injury with
      loss-of-function genetic manipulations and defined the receptor-mediated
      signaling pathway downstream of this adipokine. CTRP9-knockout (CTRP9-KO) mice at
      the age of 12 weeks were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) mice under basal
      conditions. CTRP9-KO mice had exacerbated contractile left ventricle dysfunction 
      following intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to WT
      mice. Administration of LPS to CTRP9-KO mice also resulted in increased
      expression of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in the heart
      compared to WT mice. Likewise, CTRP9-KO mice showed increased myocardial infarct 
      size and elevated expression of inflammatory mediators in ischemic heart
      following ischemia and reperfusion compared to WT mice. Treatment of cardiac
      myocytes with CTRP9 protein led to suppression of LPS-induced expression of
      proinflammatory genes, which was reversed by blockade of AMPK or ablation of
      adiponectin receptor I (AdipoR1). Systemic delivery of CTRP9 attenuated
      LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction in WT mice but not in muscle-specific transgenic 
      mice expressing dominant-negative mutant form of AMPK or in AdipoR1-knockout
      mice. CTRP9 protects against acute cardiac damage in response to pathological
      stimuli by suppressing inflammatory reactions through AdipoR1/AMPK-dependent
      mechanisms.

AB  - Alternative splicing contributes greatly to the diversification of mammalian
      proteomes, but the molecular basis for the evolutionary emergence of splice
      variants remains poorly understood. We have recently found a novel class of
      splicing regulatory elements between the polypyrimidine tract (Py) and 3' AG
      (REPA) at intron ends in many human genes, including the multifunctional PRMT5
      (for protein arginine methyltransferase 5) gene. The PRMT5 element is comprised
      of two G tracts that arise in most mammals and accompany significant exon
      skipping in human transcripts. The G tracts inhibit splicing by recruiting
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and F (H/F) to reduce U2AF65
      binding to the Py, causing exon skipping. The resulting novel shorter variant
      PRMT5S exhibits a histone H4R3 methylation effect similar to that seen with the
      original longer PRMT5L isoform but exhibits a distinct localization and
      preferential control of critical genes for cell cycle arrest at interphase in
      comparison to PRMT5L. This report thus provides a molecular mechanism for the
      evolutionary emergence of a novel splice variant with an opposite function in a
      fundamental cell process. The presence of REPA elements in a large group of genes
      implies their wider impact on different cellular processes for increased protein 
      diversity in humans.

TI  - Competition between Decapping Complex Formation and Ubiquitin-Mediated
      Proteasomal Degradation Controls Human Dcp2 Decapping Activity.
PG  - 2144-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01517-14 [doi]
AB  - mRNA decapping is a central step in eukaryotic mRNA decay that simultaneously
      shuts down translation initiation and activates mRNA degradation. A major complex
      responsible for decapping consists of the decapping enzyme Dcp2 in association
      with decapping enhancers. An important question is how the activity and
      accumulation of Dcp2 are regulated at the cellular level to ensure the
      specificity and fidelity of the Dcp2 decapping complex. Here, we show that human 
      Dcp2 levels and activity are controlled by a competition between decapping
      complex assembly and Dcp2 degradation. This is mediated by a regulatory domain in
      the Dcp2 C terminus, which, on the one hand, promotes Dcp2 activation via
      decapping complex formation mediated by the decapping enhancer Hedls and, on the 
      other hand, targets Dcp2 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation in the
      absence of Hedls association. This competition between Dcp2 activation and
      degradation restricts the accumulation and activity of uncomplexed Dcp2, which
      may be important for preventing uncontrolled decapping or for regulating Dcp2
      levels and activity according to cellular needs.

TI  - Epigenetic Determinants of Erythropoiesis: Role of the Histone Methyltransferase 
      SetD8 in Promoting Erythroid Cell Maturation and Survival.
PG  - 2073-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01422-14 [doi]
AB  - Erythropoiesis, in which committed progenitor cells generate millions of
      erythrocytes daily, involves dramatic changes in the chromatin structure and
      transcriptome of erythroblasts, prior to their enucleation. While the involvement
      of the master-regulatory transcription factors GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1)
      and GATA-2 in this process is established, the mechanistic contributions of many 
      chromatin-modifying/remodeling enzymes in red cell biology remain enigmatic. We
      demonstrated that SetD8, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes
      monomethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), is a context-dependent
      GATA-1 corepressor in erythroid cells. To determine whether SetD8 controls
      erythroid maturation and/or function, we used a small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based
      loss-of-function strategy in a primary murine erythroblast culture system. In
      this system, SetD8 promoted erythroblast maturation and survival, and this did
      not involve upregulation of the established regulator of erythroblast survival
      Bcl-x(L). SetD8 catalyzed H4K20me1 at a critical Gata2 cis element and restricted
      occupancy by an enhancer of Gata2 transcription, Scl/TAL1, thereby repressing
      Gata2 transcription. Elevating GATA-2 levels in erythroid precursors yielded a
      maturation block comparable to that induced by SetD8 downregulation. As lowering 
      GATA-2 expression in the context of SetD8 knockdown did not rescue erythroid
      maturation, we propose that SetD8 regulation of erythroid maturation involves
      multiple target genes. These results establish SetD8 as a determinant of
      erythroid cell maturation and provide a framework for understanding how a broadly
      expressed histone-modifying enzyme mediates cell-type-specific GATA factor
      function.

TI  - Role for Protein Kinase A in the Neurospora Circadian Clock by Regulating White
      Collar-Independent frequency Transcription through Phosphorylation of RCM-1.
PG  - 2088-102
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00709-14 [doi]
AB  - Rhythmic activation and repression of clock gene expression is essential for the 
      eukaryotic circadian clock functions. In the Neurospora circadian oscillator, the
      transcription of the frequency (frq) gene is periodically activated by the White 
      Collar (WC) complex and suppressed by the FRQ-FRH complex. We previously showed
      that there is WC-independent frq transcription and its repression is required for
      circadian gene expression. How WC-independent frq transcription is regulated is
      not known. We show here that elevated protein kinase A (PKA) activity results in 
      WC-independent frq transcription and the loss of clock function. We identified
      RCM-1 as the protein partner of RCO-1 and an essential component of the clock
      through its role in suppressing WC-independent frq transcription. RCM-1 is a
      phosphoprotein and is a substrate of PKA in vivo and in vitro. Mutation of the
      PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites on RCM-1 results in WC-independent
      transcription of frq and impaired clock function. Furthermore, we showed that
      RCM-1 is associated with the chromatin at the frq locus, a process that is
      inhibited by PKA. Together, our results demonstrate that PKA regulates frq
      transcription by inhibiting RCM-1 activity through RCM-1 phosphorylation.

TI  - Histone methyltransferase Setd8 represses Gata2 expression and regulates
      erythroid maturation.
PG  - 2059-72
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01413-14 [doi]
AB  - Setd8 is the sole histone methyltransferase in mammals capable of monomethylating
      histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1). Setd8 is expressed at significantly higher
      levels in erythroid cells than any other cell or tissue type, suggesting that
      Setd8 has an erythroid-cell-specific function. To test this hypothesis, stable
      Setd8 knockdown was established in extensively self-renewing erythroblasts
      (ESREs), a well-characterized, nontransformed model of erythroid maturation.
      Knockdown of Setd8 resulted in impaired erythroid maturation characterized by a
      delay in hemoglobin accumulation, larger mean cell area, persistent ckit
      expression, incomplete nuclear condensation, and lower rates of enucleation.
      Setd8 knockdown did not alter ESRE proliferation or viability or result in
      accumulation of DNA damage. Global gene expression analyses following Setd8
      knockdown demonstrated that in erythroid cells, Setd8 functions primarily as a
      repressor. Most notably, Gata2 expression was significantly higher in knockdown
      cells than in control cells and Gata2 knockdown rescued some of the maturation
      impairments associated with Setd8 disruption. Setd8 occupies critical regulatory 
      elements in the Gata2 locus, and knockdown of Setd8 resulted in loss of H4K20me1 
      and gain of H4 acetylation at the Gata2 1S promoter. These results suggest that
      Setd8 is an important regulator of erythroid maturation that works in part
      through repression of Gata2 expression.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00131-15 [doi]
AB  - tRNAs perform an essential role in translating the genetic code. They are
      long-lived RNAs that are generated via numerous posttranscriptional steps.
      Eukaryotic cells have evolved numerous layers of quality control mechanisms to
      ensure that the tRNAs are appropriately structured, processed, and modified. We
      describe the known tRNA quality control processes that check tRNAs and correct or
      destroy aberrant tRNAs. These mechanisms employ two types of exonucleases, CCA
      end addition, tRNA nuclear aminoacylation, and tRNA subcellular traffic. We
      arrange these processes in order of the steps that occur from generation of
      precursor tRNAs by RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription to end maturation and
      modification in the nucleus to splicing and additional modifications in the
      cytoplasm. Finally, we discuss the tRNA retrograde pathway, which allows tRNA
      reimport into the nucleus for degradation or repair.

TI  - Modulation of Macrophage Gene Expression via Liver X Receptor alpha Serine 198
      Phosphorylation.
PG  - 2024-34
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00985-14 [doi]
AB  - In mouse models of atherosclerosis, normalization of hyperlipidemia promotes
      macrophage emigration and regression of atherosclerotic plaques in part by liver 
      X receptor (LXR)-mediated induction of the chemokine receptor CCR7. Here we
      report that LXRalpha serine 198 (S198) phosphorylation modulates CCR7 expression.
      Low levels of S198 phosphorylation are observed in plaque macrophages in the
      regression environment where high levels of CCR7 expression are observed.
      Consistent with these findings, CCR7 gene expression in human and mouse
      macrophages cell lines is induced when LXRalpha at S198 is nonphosphorylated. In 
      bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), we also observed induction of CCR7 by
      ligands that promote nonphosphorylated LXRalpha S198, and this was lost in
      LXR-deficient BMDMs. LXRalpha occupancy at the CCR7 promoter is enhanced and
      histone modifications associated with gene repression are reduced in RAW264.7
      cells expressing nonphosphorylated LXRalpha (RAW-LXRalpha S198A) compared to
      RAW264.7 cells expressing wild-type (WT) phosphorylated LXRalpha (RAW-LXRalpha
      WT). Expression profiling of ligand-treated RAW-LXRalpha S198A cells compared to 
      RAW-LXRalpha WT cells revealed induction of cell migratory and anti-inflammatory 
      genes and repression of proinflammatory genes. Modeling of LXRalpha S198 in the
      nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated states identified phosphorylation-dependent 
      conformational changes in the hinge region commensurate with the presence of
      sites for protein interaction. Therefore, gene transcription is regulated by
      LXRalpha S198 phosphorylation, including that of antiatherogenic genes such as
      CCR7.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00133-15 [doi]
AB  - Neurons exploit local mRNA translation and retrograde transport of transcription 
      factors to regulate gene expression in response to signaling events at distal
      neuronal ends. Whether epigenetic factors could also be involved in such
      regulation is not known. We report that the mRNA encoding the high-mobility group
      N5 (HMGN5) chromatin binding protein localizes to growth cones of both
      neuron-like cells and of hippocampal neurons, where it has the potential to be
      translated, and that HMGN5 can be retrogradely transported into the nucleus along
      neurites. Loss of HMGN5 function induces transcriptional changes and impairs
      neurite outgrowth, while HMGN5 overexpression induces neurite outgrowth and
      chromatin decompaction; these effects are dependent on growth cone localization
      of Hmgn5 mRNA. We suggest that the localization and local translation of
      transcripts coding for epigenetic factors couple the dynamic neuronal outgrowth
      process with chromatin regulation in the nucleus.

TI  - Molecular Role of RNF43 in Canonical and Noncanonical Wnt Signaling.
PG  - 2007-23
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00159-15 [doi]
AB  - Wnt signaling pathways are tightly regulated by ubiquitination, and dysregulation
      of these pathways promotes tumorigenesis. It has been reported that the ubiquitin
      ligase RNF43 plays an important role in frizzled-dependent regulation of the
      Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Here, we show that RNF43 suppresses both
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and noncanonical Wnt signaling by distinct mechanisms.
      The suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling requires interaction between the
      extracellular protease-associated (PA) domain and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) 
      of frizzled and the intracellular RING finger domain of RNF43. In contrast, these
      N-terminal domains of RNF43 are not required for inhibition of noncanonical Wnt
      signaling, but interaction between the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of RNF43 and
      the PDZ domain of dishevelled is essential for this suppression. We further show 
      the mechanism by which missense mutations in the extracellular portion of RNF43
      identified in patients with tumors activate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Missense 
      mutations of RNF43 change their localization from the endosome to the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER), resulting in the failure of frizzled-dependent suppression of
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. However, these mutants retain the ability to suppress
      noncanonical Wnt signaling, probably due to interaction with dishevelled. RNF43
      is also one of the potential target genes of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Our
      results reveal the molecular role of RNF43 and provide an insight into
      tumorigenesis.

TI  - Serum- and Glucocorticoid-Inducible Kinase 1 Confers Protection in Cell-Based and
      in In Vivo Neurotoxin Models via the c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 1992-2006

AB  - Serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1) has been shown to be protective in models of
      Parkinson's disease, but the details by which it confers benefit is unknown. The 
      current study was designed to investigate the details by which SGK1 confers
      neuroprotection. To do this we employed a cellular neurodegeneration model to
      investigate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) stress induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. SGK1-expressing adenovirus was created 
      and used to overexpress SGK1 in SH-SY5Y cells, and dexamethasone was used to
      increase endogenous expression of SGK1. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial
      dysfunction, and cell death were monitored to test the protective effect of SGK1.
      To investigate the effect of SGK1 overexpression in vivo, SGK1-expressing
      adenovirus was injected into the striatum of mice treated with
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, and protection of dopaminergic
      neurons was quantitatively assessed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry.
      SGK1 overexpression was found to decrease reactive oxygen species generation,
      alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction, and rescue cell death in vitro and in vivo
      by inactivating mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), JNK, and
      glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and thereby decreasing ER and oxidative
      stress. These results suggest that therapeutic strategies for activation of SGK1 
      may have the potential to be neuroprotective by deactivating the JNK and GSK3beta
      pathways.

TI  - The Tomato Defensin TPP3 Binds Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-Bisphosphate via a
      Conserved Dimeric Cationic Grip Conformation To Mediate Cell Lysis.
PG  - 1964-78
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00282-15 [doi]
AB  - Defensins are a class of ubiquitously expressed cationic antimicrobial peptides
      (CAPs) that play an important role in innate defense. Plant defensins are active 
      against a broad range of microbial pathogens and act via multiple mechanisms,
      including cell membrane permeabilization. The cytolytic activity of defensins has
      been proposed to involve interaction with specific lipid components in the target
      cell wall or membrane and defensin oligomerization. Indeed, the defensin
      Nicotiana alata defensin 1 (NaD1) binds to a broad range of membrane
      phosphatidylinositol phosphates and forms an oligomeric complex with
      phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) that facilitates membrane lysis of
      both mammalian tumor and fungal cells. Here, we report that the tomato defensin
      TPP3 has a unique lipid binding profile that is specific for PIP2 with which it
      forms an oligomeric complex that is critical for cytolytic activity. Structural
      characterization of TPP3 by X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis
      demonstrated that it forms a dimer in a "cationic grip" conformation that
      specifically accommodates the head group of PIP2 to mediate cooperative
      higher-order oligomerization and subsequent membrane permeabilization. These
      findings suggest that certain plant defensins are innate immune receptors for
      phospholipids and adopt conserved dimeric configurations to mediate PIP2 binding 
      and membrane permeabilization. This mechanism of innate defense may be conserved 
      across defensins from different species.

TI  - Loss of Androgen-Regulated MicroRNA 1 Activates SRC and Promotes Prostate Cancer 
      Bone Metastasis.
PG  - 1940-51
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00008-15 [doi]
AB  - Bone metastasis is the hallmark of progressive and castration-resistant prostate 
      cancers. MicroRNA 1 (miR-1) levels are decreased in clinical samples of primary
      prostate cancer and further reduced in metastases. SRC has been implicated as a
      critical factor in bone metastasis, and here we show that SRC is a direct target 
      of miR-1. In prostate cancer patient samples, miR-1 levels are inversely
      correlated with SRC expression and a SRC-dependent gene signature. Ectopic miR-1 
      expression inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and
      bone metastasis in a xenograft model. In contrast, SRC overexpression was
      sufficient to reconstitute bone metastasis and ERK signaling in cells expressing 
      high levels of miR-1. Androgen receptor (AR) activity, defined by an AR output
      signature, is low in a portion of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We show
      that AR binds to the miR-1-2 regulatory region and regulates miR-1 transcription.
      Patients with low miR-1 levels displayed correlated low canonical AR gene
      signatures. Our data support the existence of an AR-miR-1-SRC regulatory network.
      We propose that loss of miR-1 is one mechanistic link between low canonical AR
      output and SRC-promoted metastatic phenotypes.

TI  - Gossypol Acetic Acid Prevents Oxidative Stress-Induced Retinal Pigment Epithelial
      Necrosis by Regulating the FoxO3/Sestrin2 Pathway.
PG  - 1952-63
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00178-15 [doi]
AB  - The late stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or geographic
      atrophy (GA), is characterized by extensive retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell
      death, and a cure is not available currently. We have recently demonstrated that 
      RPE cells die from necrosis in response to oxidative stress, providing a
      potential novel mechanism for RPE death in AMD. In this study, we screened U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration-approved natural compounds and identified gossypol
      acetic acid (GAA) as a potent inhibitor of oxidative stress-induced RPE cell
      death. GAA induces antioxidative response and inhibits accumulation of excessive 
      reactive oxygen species in cells, through which it prevents the activation of
      intrinsic necrotic pathway in response to oxidative stress. Sestrin2 (SESN2) is
      found to mediate GAA function in antioxidative response and RPE survival upon
      oxidative stress. Moreover, Forkhead box O3 transcription factor (FoxO3) is
      further found to be required for GAA-mediated SESN2 expression and RPE survival. 
      Mechanistically, GAA promotes FoxO3 nuclear translocation and binding to the
      SESN2 enhancer, which in turn increases its transcriptional activity. Taken
      together, we have identified GAA as a potent inhibitor of oxidative
      stress-induced RPE necrosis by regulating the FoxO3/SESN2 pathway. This study may
      have significant implications in the therapeutics of age-related diseases,
      especially GA.

AB  - The Wnt coreceptors Lrp5 and Lrp6 are essential for normal postnatal bone accrual

      increase in body fat with corresponding reductions in energy expenditure.
      Conversely, mice expressing a high bone mass mutant Lrp5 allele are leaner with
      reduced plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels. In this context,
      Wnt-initiated signals downstream of Lrp5, but not the closely related Lrp6
      coreceptor, regulate the activation of beta-catenin and thereby induce the
      expression of key enzymes required for fatty acid beta-oxidation. These results
      suggest that Wnt-Lrp5 signaling regulates basic cellular activities beyond those 
      associated with fate specification and differentiation in bone and that the
      skeleton influences global energy homeostasis via mechanisms independent of
      osteocalcin and glucose metabolism.

AB  - Three classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, members of the Cbl, Hakai, and
      SOCS-Cul5-RING ligase families, stimulate the ubiquitination of
      phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, including receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine 
      kinases and their phosphorylated substrates. Because ubiquitination frequently
      routes proteins for degradation by the lysosome or proteasome, these E3 ligases
      are able to potently inhibit tyrosine kinase signaling. Their loss or mutational 
      inactivation can contribute to cancer, autoimmunity, or endocrine disorders, such
      as diabetes. However, these ligases also have biological functions that are
      independent of their ubiquitination activity. Here we review relevant literature 
      and then focus on more-recent developments in understanding the structures,
      substrates, and pathways through which the phosphotyrosine-specific ubiquitin
      ligases regulate diverse aspects of cell biology.

TI  - Ccr4-Not and TFIIS Function Cooperatively To Rescue Arrested RNA Polymerase II.
PG  - 1915-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00044-15 [doi]
AB  - Expression of the genome requires RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to transcribe across
      many natural and unnatural barriers, and this transcription across barriers is
      facilitated by protein complexes called elongation factors (EFs). Genetic studies
      in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast suggest that multiple EFs collaborate to assist
      RNAPII in completing the transcription of genes, but the molecular mechanisms of 
      how they cooperate to promote elongation are not well understood. The Ccr4-Not
      complex participates in multiple steps of mRNA metabolism and has recently been
      shown to be an EF. Here we describe how Ccr4-Not and TFIIS cooperate to stimulate
      elongation. We find that Ccr4-Not and TFIIS mutations show synthetically enhanced
      phenotypes, and biochemical analyses indicate that Ccr4-Not and TFIIS work
      synergistically to reactivate arrested RNAPII. Ccr4-Not increases the recruitment
      of TFIIS into elongation complexes and enhances the cleavage of the displaced
      transcript in backtracked RNAPII. This is mediated by an interaction between
      Ccr4-Not and the N terminus of TFIIS. In addition to revealing insights into how 
      these two elongation factors cooperate to promote RNAPII elongation, our study
      extends the growing body of evidence suggesting that the N terminus of TFIIS acts
      as a docking/interacting site that allows it to synergize with other EFs to
      promote RNAPII transcription.

TI  - H-ras distribution and signaling in plasma membrane microdomains are regulated by
      acylation and deacylation events.
PG  - 1898-914
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01398-14 [doi]
AB  - H-Ras must adhere to the plasma membrane to be functional. This is accomplished
      by posttranslational modifications, including palmitoylation, a reversible
      process whereby H-Ras traffics between the plasma membrane and the Golgi complex.
      At the plasma membrane, H-Ras has been proposed to occupy distinct sublocations, 
      depending on its activation status: lipid rafts/detergent-resistant membrane
      fractions when bound to GDP, diffusing to disordered membrane/soluble fractions
      in response to GTP loading. Herein, we demonstrate that H-Ras sublocalization is 
      dictated by its degree of palmitoylation in a cell type-specific manner. Whereas 
      H-Ras localizes to detergent-resistant membrane fractions in cells with low
      palmitoylation activity, it locates to soluble membrane fractions in lineages
      where it is highly palmitoylated. Interestingly, in both cases GTP loading
      results in H-Ras diffusing away from its original sublocalization. Moreover,
      tilting the equilibrium between palmitoylation and depalmitoylation processes can
      substantially alter H-Ras segregation and, subsequently, its biochemical and
      biological functions. Thus, the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation balance not only 
      regulates H-Ras cycling between endomembranes and the plasma membrane but also
      serves as a key orchestrator of H-Ras lateral diffusion between different types
      of plasma membrane and thereby of H-Ras signaling.

TI  - Sam68 Regulates S6K1 Alternative Splicing during Adipogenesis.
PG  - 1926-39
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01488-14 [doi]
AB  - The requirement for alternative splicing during adipogenesis is poorly
      understood. The Sam68 RNA binding protein is a known regulator of alternative
      splicing, and mice deficient for Sam68 exhibit adipogenesis defects due to
      defective mTOR signaling. Sam68 null preadipocytes were monitored for alternative
      splicing imbalances in components of the mTOR signaling pathway. Herein, we
      report that Sam68 regulates isoform expression of the ribosomal S6 kinase gene
      (Rps6kb1). Sam68-deficient adipocytes express Rps6kb1-002 and its encoded p31S6K1
      protein, in contrast to wild-type adipocytes that do not express this isoform.
      Sam68 binds an RNA sequence encoded by Rps6kb1 intron 6 and prevents
      serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1)-mediated alternative splicing of
      Rps6kb1-002, as assessed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and
      minigene assays. Depletion of p31S6K1 with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
      partially restored adipogenesis of Sam68-deficient preadipocytes. The ectopic
      expression of p31S6K1 in wild-type 3T3-L1 cells resulted in adipogenesis
      differentiation defects, showing that p31S6K1 is an inhibitor of adipogenesis.
      Our findings indicate that Sam68 is required to prevent the expression of p31S6K1
      in adipocytes for adipogenesis to occur.

TI  - The Human RNA Polymerase I Transcription Terminator Complex Acts as a Replication
      Fork Barrier That Coordinates the Progress of Replication with rRNA Transcription
      Activity.
PG  - 1871-81
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01521-14 [doi]
AB  - In S phase, the replication and transcription of genomic DNA need to accommodate 
      each other, otherwise their machineries collide, with chromosomal instability as 
      a possible consequence. Here, we characterized the human replication fork barrier
      (RFB) that is present downstream from the 47S pre-rRNA gene (ribosomal DNA
      [rDNA]). We found that the most proximal transcription terminator, Sal box T1,
      acts as a polar RFB, while the other, Sal box T4/T5, arrests replication forks
      bidirectionally. The fork-arresting activity at these sites depends on polymerase
      I (Pol I) transcription termination factor 1 (TTF-1) and a replisome component,
      TIMELESS (TIM). We also found that the RFB activity was linked to rDNA copies
      with hypomethylated CpG and coincided with the time that actively transcribed
      rRNA genes are replicated. Failed fork arrest at RFB sites led to a slowdown of
      fork progression moving in the opposite direction to rRNA transcription. Chemical
      inhibition of transcription counteracted this deceleration of forks, indicating
      that rRNA transcription impedes replication in the absence of RFB activity. Thus,
      our results reveal a role of RFB for coordinating the progression of replication 
      and transcription activity in highly transcribed rRNA genes.

TI  - Alternative Splicing Shapes the Phenotype of a Mutation in BBS8 To Cause
      Nonsyndromic Retinitis Pigmentosa.
PG  - 1860-70
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00040-15 [doi]
AB  - Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetic disorder affecting multiple systems and 
      organs in the body. Several mutations in genes associated with BBS affect only
      photoreceptor cells and cause nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), raising the
      issue of why certain mutations manifest as a systemic disorder whereas other
      changes in the same gene affect only a specific cell type. Here, we show that
      cell-type-specific alternative splicing is responsible for confining the
      phenotype of the A-to-G substitution in the 3' splice site of BBS8 exon 2A
      (IVS1-2A>G mutation) in the BBS8 gene to photoreceptor cells. The IVS1-2A>G
      mutation leads to missplicing of BBS8 exon 2A, producing a frameshift in the BBS8
      reading frame and thus eliminating the protein specifically in photoreceptor
      cells. Cell types other than photoreceptors skip exon 2A from the mature BBS8
      transcript, which renders them immune to the mutation. We also show that the
      splicing of Bbs8 exon 2A in photoreceptors is directed exclusively by redundant
      splicing enhancers located in the adjacent introns. These intronic sequences are 
      sufficient for photoreceptor-cell-specific splicing of heterologous exons,
      including an exon with a randomized sequence.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00990-14 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment has many tumor-promoting effects. In
      particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) produce many cytokines which can 
      support tumor growth by promoting survival of malignant cells, angiogenesis, and 
      metastasis. Enhanced cytokine production by TAMs is tightly coupled with protein 
      synthesis. In turn, translation of proteins depends on tRNAs, short abundant
      transcripts that are made by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Here, we connect these
      facts by showing that stimulation of mouse macrophages with lipopolysaccharides
      (LPS) from the bacterial cell wall causes transcriptional upregulation of tRNA
      genes. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is a key transcription factor mediating
      inflammatory signals, and we report that LPS treatment causes an increased
      association of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 with tRNA genes. In addition, we show
      that p65 can directly associate with the Pol III transcription factor TFIIIB and 
      that overexpression of p65 induces Pol III-dependent transcription. As a
      consequence of these effects, we show that inhibition of Pol III activity in
      macrophages restrains cytokine secretion and suppresses phagocytosis, two key
      functional characteristics of these cells. These findings therefore identify a
      radical new function for Pol III in the regulation of macrophage function which
      may be important for the immune responses associated with both normal and
      malignant cells.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00012-15 [doi]
AB  - Acidification of the extracellular and/or intracellular environment is involved
      in many aspects of cell physiology and pathology. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 
      kinase (eEF2K) is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase that regulates translation
      elongation by phosphorylating and inhibiting eEF2. Here we show that
      extracellular acidosis elicits activation of eEF2K in vivo, leading to enhanced
      phosphorylation of eEF2. We identify five histidine residues in eEF2K that are
      crucial for the activation of eEF2K during acidosis. Three of them (H80, H87, and
      H94) are in its calmodulin-binding site, and their protonation appears to enhance
      the ability of calmodulin to activate eEF2K. The other two histidines (H227 and
      H230) lie in the catalytic domain of eEF2K. We also identify His108 in calmodulin
      as essential for activation of eEF2K. Acidification of cancer cell
      microenvironments is a hallmark of malignant solid tumors. Knocking down eEF2K in
      cancer cells attenuated the decrease in global protein synthesis when cells were 
      cultured at acidic pH. Importantly, activation of eEF2K is linked to cancer cell 
      survival under acidic conditions. Inhibition of eEF2K promotes cancer cell death 
      under acidosis.

TI  - Stomatin-like protein 2 is required for in vivo mitochondrial respiratory chain
      supercomplex formation and optimal cell function.
PG  - 1838-47
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00047-15 [doi]
AB  - Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2) is a mainly mitochondrial protein that is widely 
      expressed and is highly conserved across evolution. We have previously shown that
      SLP-2 binds the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and interacts with prohibitin-1
      and -2 to form specialized membrane microdomains in the mitochondrial inner
      membrane, which are associated with optimal mitochondrial respiration. To
      determine how SLP-2 functions, we performed bioenergetic analysis of primary T
      cells from T cell-selective Slp-2 knockout mice under conditions that forced
      energy production to come almost exclusively from oxidative phosphorylation.
      These cells had a phenotype characterized by increased uncoupled mitochondrial
      respiration and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Since formation of
      mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes (RCS) may correlate with more
      efficient electron transfer during oxidative phosphorylation, we hypothesized
      that the defect in mitochondrial respiration in SLP-2-deficient T cells was due
      to deficient RCS formation. We found that in the absence of SLP-2, T cells had
      decreased levels and activities of complex I-III2 and I-III2-IV(1-3) RCS but no
      defects in assembly of individual respiratory complexes. Impaired RCS formation
      in SLP-2-deficient T cells correlated with significantly delayed T cell
      proliferation in response to activation under conditions of limiting glycolysis. 
      Altogether, our findings identify SLP-2 as a key regulator of the formation of
      RCS in vivo and show that these supercomplexes are required for optimal cell
      function.

TI  - Elongation Factor 2 Kinase Is Regulated by Proline Hydroxylation and Protects
      Cells during Hypoxia.
PG  - 1788-804
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01457-14 [doi]
AB  - Protein synthesis, especially translation elongation, requires large amounts of
      energy, which is often generated by oxidative metabolism. Elongation is
      controlled by phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which
      inhibits its activity and is catalyzed by eEF2 kinase (eEF2K), a
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent alpha-kinase. Hypoxia causes the activation of eEF2K
      and induces eEF2 phosphorylation independently of previously known inputs into
      eEF2K. Here, we show that eEF2K is subject to hydroxylation on proline-98.
      Proline hydroxylation is catalyzed by proline hydroxylases, oxygen-dependent
      enzymes which are inactivated during hypoxia. Pharmacological inhibition of
      proline hydroxylases also stimulates eEF2 phosphorylation. Pro98 lies in a
      universally conserved linker between the calmodulin-binding and catalytic domains
      of eEF2K. Its hydroxylation partially impairs the binding of calmodulin to eEF2K 
      and markedly limits the calmodulin-stimulated activity of eEF2K. Neuronal cells
      depend on oxygen, and eEF2K helps to protect them from hypoxia. eEF2K is the
      first example of a protein directly involved in a major energy-consuming process 
      to be regulated by proline hydroxylation. Since eEF2K is cytoprotective during
      hypoxia and other conditions of nutrient insufficiency, it may be a valuable
      target for therapy of poorly vascularized solid tumors.

TI  - The Human GATA1 Gene Retains a 5' Insulator That Maintains Chromosomal
      Architecture and GATA1 Expression Levels in Splenic Erythroblasts.
PG  - 1825-37
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00011-15 [doi]
AB  - GATA1 is a key transcription factor for erythropoiesis. GATA1 gene expression is 
      strictly regulated at the transcriptional level. While the regulatory mechanisms 
      governing mouse Gata1 (mGata1) gene expression have been studied extensively, how
      expression of the human GATA1 (hGATA1) gene is regulated remains to be
      elucidated. To address this issue, we generated hGATA1 bacterial artificial
      chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse lines harboring a 183-kb hGATA1 locus covering 
      the hGATA1 exons and distal flanking sequences. Transgenic hGATA1 expression
      coincides with endogenous mGata1 expression and fully rescues hematopoietic
      deficiency in mGata1 knockdown mice. The transgene exhibited copy
      number-dependent and integration position-independent expression of hGATA1,
      indicating the presence of chromatin insulator activity within the transgene. We 
      found a novel insulator element at 29 kb 5' to the hGATA1 gene and refer to this 
      element as the 5' CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) site. Substitution mutation of the 
      5' CTCF site in the hGATA1 BAC disrupted the chromatin architecture and led to a 
      reduction of hGATA1 expression in splenic erythroblasts under conditions of
      stress erythropoiesis. Our results demonstrate that expression of the hGATA1 gene
      is regulated through the chromatin architecture organized by 5' CTCF
      site-mediated intrachromosomal interactions in the hGATA1 locus.

TI  - The C2 Domain and Altered ATP-Binding Loop Phosphorylation at Ser(3)(5)(9)
      Mediate the Redox-Dependent Increase in Protein Kinase C-delta Activity.
PG  - 1727-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01436-14 [doi]
AB  - The diverse roles of protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta) in cellular growth,
      survival, and injury have been attributed to stimulus-specific differences in
      PKCdelta signaling responses. PKCdelta exerts membrane-delimited actions in cells
      activated by agonists that stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. PKCdelta is
      released from membranes as a Tyr(313)-phosphorylated enzyme that displays a high 
      level of lipid-independent activity and altered substrate specificity during
      oxidative stress. This study identifies an interaction between PKCdelta's
      Tyr(313)-phosphorylated hinge region and its phosphotyrosine-binding C2 domain
      that controls PKCdelta's enzymology indirectly by decreasing phosphorylation in
      the kinase domain ATP-positioning loop at Ser(359). We show that wild-type (WT)
      PKCdelta displays a strong preference for substrates with serine as the
      phosphoacceptor residue at the active site when it harbors phosphomimetic or
      bulky substitutions at Ser(359.) In contrast, PKCdelta-S359A displays
      lipid-independent activity toward substrates with either a serine or threonine as
      the phosphoacceptor residue. Additional studies in cardiomyocytes show that
      oxidative stress decreases Ser(359) phosphorylation on native PKCdelta and that
      PKCdelta-S359A overexpression increases basal levels of phosphorylation on
      substrates with both phosphoacceptor site serine and threonine residues.
      Collectively, these studies identify a C2 domain-pTyr(313) docking interaction
      that controls ATP-positioning loop phosphorylation as a novel, dynamically
      regulated, and physiologically relevant structural determinant of PKCdelta
      catalytic activity.

TI  - Poly(Q) Expansions in ATXN7 Affect Solubility but Not Activity of the SAGA
      Deubiquitinating Module.
PG  - 1777-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01454-14 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by expansion of a polyglutamine [poly(Q)] tract in ATXN7, a subunit of the
      deubiquitinase (DUB) module (DUBm) in the SAGA complex. The effects of
      ATXN7-poly(Q) on DUB activity are not known. To address this important question, 
      we reconstituted the DUBm in vitro with either wild-type ATXN7 or a pathogenic
      form, ATXN7-92Q NT, with 92 Q residues at the N terminus (NT). We found that both
      forms of ATXN7 greatly enhance DUB activity but that ATXN7-92Q NT is largely
      insoluble unless it is incorporated into the DUBm. Cooverexpression of DUBm
      components in human astrocytes also promoted the solubility of ATXN7-92Q,
      inhibiting its aggregation into nuclear inclusions that sequester DUBm
      components, leading to global increases in ubiquitinated H2B (H2Bub) levels.
      Global H2Bub levels were also increased in the cerebellums of mice in a SCA7
      mouse model. Our findings indicate that although ATXN7 poly(Q) expansions do not 
      change the enzymatic activity of the DUBm, they likely contribute to SCA7 by
      initiating aggregates that sequester the DUBm away from its substrates.

TI  - Vaccinia-Related Kinase 2 Controls the Stability of the Eukaryotic Chaperonin
      TRiC/CCT by Inhibiting the Deubiquitinating Enzyme USP25.
PG  - 1754-62
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01325-14 [doi]
AB  - Molecular chaperones monitor the proper folding of misfolded proteins and
      function as the first line of defense against mutant protein aggregation in
      neurodegenerative diseases. The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC is a potent suppressor
      of mutant protein aggregation and toxicity in early stages of disease
      progression. Elucidation of TRiC functional regulation will enable us to better
      understand the pathological mechanisms of neurodegeneration. We have previously
      shown that vaccinia-related kinase 2 (VRK2) downregulates TRiC protein levels
      through the ubiquitin-proteasome system by recruiting the E3 ligase COP1.
      However, although VRK2 activity was necessary in TRiC downregulation, the
      phosphorylated substrate was not determined. Here, we report that USP25 is a
      novel TRiC interacting protein that is also phosphorylated by VRK2. USP25
      catalyzed deubiquitination of the TRiC protein and stabilized the chaperonin,
      thereby reducing accumulation of misfolded polyglutamine protein aggregates.
      Notably, USP25 deubiquitinating activity was suppressed when VRK2 phosphorylated 
      the Thr(680), Thr(727), and Ser(745) residues. Impaired USP25 deubiquitinating
      activity after VRK2-mediated phosphorylation may be a critical pathway in TRiC
      protein destabilization.

TI  - WNT/beta-Catenin Signaling Regulates Multiple Steps of Myogenesis by Regulating
      Step-Specific Targets.
PG  - 1763-76
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01180-14 [doi]
AB  - Molecules involved in WNT/beta-catenin signaling show specific spatiotemporal
      expression and play vital roles in myogenesis; however, it is still largely
      unknown how WNT/beta-catenin signaling regulates each step of myogenesis. Here,
      we show that WNT/beta-catenin signaling can control diverse biological processes 
      of myogenesis by regulating step-specific molecules. In order to identify the
      temporally specific roles of WNT/beta-catenin signaling molecules in muscle
      development and homeostasis, we used in vitro culture systems for both primary
      mouse myoblasts and C2C12 cells, which can differentiate into myofibers. We found
      that a blockade of WNT/beta-catenin signaling in the proliferating cells
      decreases proliferation activity, but does not induce cell death, through the
      regulation of genes cyclin A2 (Ccna2) and cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25c).
      During muscle differentiation, the inhibition of WNT/beta-catenin signaling
      blocks myoblast fusion through the inhibition of the Fermitin family homolog 2
      (Fermt2) gene. Blocking WNT/beta-catenin signaling in the well-differentiated
      myofibers results in the failure of maintenance of their structure by disruption 
      of cadherin/beta-catenin/actin complex formation, which plays a crucial role in
      connecting a myofiber's cytoskeleton to the surrounding extracellular matrix.
      Thus, our results indicate that WNT/beta-catenin signaling can regulate multiple 
      steps of myogenesis, including cell proliferation, myoblast fusion, and
      homeostasis, by targeting step-specific molecules.

TI  - PATZ1 Is a DNA Damage-Responsive Transcription Factor That Inhibits p53 Function.
PG  - 1741-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01475-14 [doi]
AB  - Insults to cellular health cause p53 protein accumulation, and loss of p53
      function leads to tumorigenesis. Thus, p53 has to be tightly controlled. Here we 
      report that the BTB/POZ domain transcription factor PATZ1 (MAZR), previously
      known for its transcriptional suppressor functions in T lymphocytes, is a crucial
      regulator of p53. The novel role of PATZ1 as an inhibitor of the p53 protein
      marks its gene as a proto-oncogene. PATZ1-deficient cells have reduced
      proliferative capacity, which we assessed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq)
      and real-time cell growth rate analysis. PATZ1 modifies the expression of p53
      target genes associated with cell proliferation gene ontology terms. Moreover,
      PATZ1 regulates several genes involved in cellular adhesion and morphogenesis.
      Significantly, treatment with the DNA damage-inducing drug doxorubicin results in
      the loss of the PATZ1 transcription factor as p53 accumulates. We find that PATZ1
      binds to p53 and inhibits p53-dependent transcription activation. We examine the 
      mechanism of this functional inhibitory interaction and demonstrate that PATZ1
      excludes p53 from DNA binding. This study documents PATZ1 as a novel player in
      the p53 pathway.

TI  - Nuclear Export of Smads by RanBP3L Regulates Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling
      and Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation.
PG  - 1700-11
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00121-15 [doi]
AB  - Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play vital roles in regulating stem cell
      maintenance and differentiation. BMPs can induce osteogenesis and inhibit
      myogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells. Canonical BMP signaling is stringently
      controlled through reversible phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of 
      Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (Smad1/5/8). However, how the nuclear export of Smad1/5/8
      is regulated remains unclear. Here we report that the Ran-binding protein RanBP3L
      acts as a nuclear export factor for Smad1/5/8. RanBP3L directly recognizes
      dephosphorylated Smad1/5/8 and mediates their nuclear export in a Ran-dependent
      manner. Increased expression of RanBP3L blocks BMP-induced osteogenesis of mouse 
      bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and promotes myogenic induction of
      C2C12 mouse myoblasts, whereas depletion of RanBP3L expression enhances
      BMP-dependent stem cell differentiation activity and transcriptional responses.
      In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RanBP3L, as a nuclear exporter for
      BMP-specific Smads, plays a critical role in terminating BMP signaling and
      regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.

PG  - 1712-26
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01332-14 [doi]
AB  - Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) is known to regulate axon growth, but
      whether it also plays a role in synaptogenesis remains unclear. Here, we found
      that GAP43 regulates the aggregation of gephyrin, a pivotal protein for
      clustering postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs), in developing cortical
      neurons. Pharmacological blockade of either protein kinase C (PKC) or neuronal
      activity increased both GAP43-gephyrin association and gephyrin
      misfolding-induced aggregation, suggesting the importance of PKC-dependent
      regulation of GABAergic synapses. Furthermore, we found that PKC
      phosphorylation-resistant GAP43(S41A), but not PKC phosphorylation-mimicking
      GAP43(S41D), interacted with cytosolic gephyrin to trigger gephyrin misfolding
      and its sequestration into aggresomes. In contrast, GAP43(S41D), but not
      GAP43(S41A), inhibited the physiological aggregation/clustering of gephyrin,
      reduced surface GABA(A)Rs under physiological conditions, and attenuated gephyrin
      misfolding under transient oxygen-glucose deprivation (tOGD) that mimics
      pathological neonatal hypoxia. Calcineurin-mediated GAP43 dephosphorylation that 
      accompanied tOGD also led to GAP43-gephyrin association and gephyrin misfolding. 
      Thus, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of GAP43 plays a critical role in regulating 
      postsynaptic gephyrin aggregation in developing GABAergic synapses.

TI  - Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein Isoform II Promotes Transcription Factor
      Recruitment To Activate Interferon Beta and Interferon-Responsive Gene
      Expression.
PG  - 1660-72
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01478-14 [doi]
AB  - To trigger type I interferon (IFN) responses, pattern recognition receptors
      activate signaling cascades that lead to transcription of IFN and IFN-stimulated 
      genes (ISGs). The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been implicated in
      these responses, although its role has not been defined. Here, we show that PML
      isoform II (PML-II) is specifically required for efficient induction of IFN-beta 
      transcription and of numerous ISGs, acting at the point of transcriptional
      complex assembly on target gene promoters. PML-II associated with specific
      transcription factors NF-kappaB and STAT1, as well as the coactivator
      CREB-binding protein (CBP), to facilitate transcriptional complex formation. The 
      absence of PML-II substantially reduced binding of these factors and IFN
      regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to IFN-beta or ISGs promoters and sharply reduced gene
      activation. The unique C-terminal domain of PML-II was essential for its
      activity, while the N-terminal RBCC motif common to all PML isoforms was
      dispensable. We propose a model in which PML-II contributes to the transcription 
      of multiple genes via the association of its C-terminal domain with relevant
      transcription complexes, which promotes the stable assembly of these complexes at
      promoters/enhancers of target genes, and that in this way PML-II plays a
      significant role in the development of type I IFN responses.

TI  - Interaction with OGG1 is required for efficient recruitment of XRCC1 to base
      excision repair and maintenance of genetic stability after exposure to oxidative 
      stress.
PG  - 1648-58
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00134-15 [doi]
AB  - XRCC1 is an essential protein required for the maintenance of genomic stability
      through its implication in DNA repair. The main function of XRCC1 is associated
      with its role in the single-strand break (SSB) and base excision repair (BER)
      pathways that share several enzymatic steps. We show here that the polymorphic
      XRCC1 variant R194W presents a defect in its interaction with the DNA glycosylase
      OGG1 after oxidative stress. While proficient for single-strand break repair
      (SSBR), this variant does not colocalize with OGG1, reflecting a defect in its
      involvement in BER. Consistent with a role of XRCC1 in the coordination of the
      BER pathway, induction of oxidative base damage in XRCC1-deficient cells
      complemented with the R194W variant results in increased genetic instability as
      revealed by the accumulation of micronuclei. These data identify a specific
      molecular role for the XRCC1-OGG1 interaction in BER and provide a model for the 
      effects of the R194W variant identified in molecular cancer epidemiology studies.

TI  - Nucleosome spacing generated by ISWI and CHD1 remodelers is constant regardless
      of nucleosome density.
PG  - 1588-605
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01070-14 [doi]
AB  - Arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes are a hallmark of chromatin, but it
      remains unclear how they are generated. Recent genome-wide studies, in vitro and 
      in vivo, showed constant nucleosome spacing even if the histone concentration was
      experimentally reduced. This counters the long-held assumption that nucleosome
      density determines spacing and calls for factors keeping spacing constant
      regardless of nucleosome density. We call this a clamping activity. Here, we show
      in a purified system that ISWI- and CHD1-type nucleosome remodelers have a
      clamping activity such that they not only generate regularly spaced nucleosome
      arrays but also generate constant spacing regardless of nucleosome density. This 
      points to a functionally attractive nucleosome interaction that could be mediated
      either directly by nucleosome-nucleosome contacts or indirectly through the
      remodelers. Mutant Drosophila melanogaster ISWI without the Hand-Sant-Slide (HSS)
      domain had no detectable spacing activity even though it is known to remodel and 
      slide nucleosomes. This suggests that the role of ISWI remodelers in generating
      constant spacing is not just to mediate nucleosome sliding; they actively
      contribute to the attractive interaction. Additional factors are necessary to set
      physiological spacing in absolute terms.

TI  - Hog1 targets Whi5 and Msa1 transcription factors to downregulate cyclin
      expression upon stress.
PG  - 1606-18
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01279-14 [doi]
AB  - Yeast cells have developed complex mechanisms to cope with extracellular insults.
      An increase in external osmolarity leads to activation of the stress-activated
      protein kinase Hog1, which is the main regulator of adaptive responses, such as
      gene expression and cell cycle progression, that are essential for cellular
      survival. Upon osmostress, the G1-to-S transition is regulated by Hog1 through
      stabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 and the
      downregulation of G1 cyclin expression by an unclear mechanism. Here, we show
      that Hog1 interacts with and phosphorylates components of the core cell cycle
      transcriptional machinery such as Whi5 and the coregulator Msa1. Phosphorylation 
      of these two transcriptional regulators by Hog1 is essential for inhibition of G1
      cyclin expression, for control of cell morphogenesis, and for maximal cell
      survival upon stress. The control of both Whi5 and Msa1 by Hog1 also revealed the
      necessity for proper coordination of budding and DNA replication. Thus, Hog1
      regulates G1 cyclin transcription upon osmostress to ensure coherent passage
      through Start.

TI  - Nfkb1 activation by the E26 transformation-specific transcription factors PU.1
      and Spi-B promotes Toll-like receptor-mediated splenic B cell proliferation.
PG  - 1619-32

AB  - Generation of antibodies against T-independent and T-dependent antigens requires 
      Toll-like receptor (TLR) engagement on B cells for efficient responses. However, 
      the regulation of TLR expression and responses in B cells is not well understood.
      PU.1 and Spi-B (encoded by Sfpi1 and Spib, respectively) are transcription
      factors of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family and are important for B
      cell development and function. It was found that B cells from mice knocked out
      for Spi-B and heterozygous for PU.1 (Sfpi1(+/-) Spib(-/-) [PUB] mice)
      proliferated poorly in response to TLR ligands compared to wild-type (WT) B
      cells. The NF-kappaB family member p50 (encoded by Nfkb1) is required for
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responsiveness in mice. PUB B cells expressed reduced
      Nfkb1 mRNA transcripts and p50 protein. The Nfkb1 promoter was regulated directly
      by PU.1 and Spi-B, as shown by reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      analysis. Occupancy of the Nfkb1 promoter by PU.1 was reduced in PUB B cells
      compared to that in WT B cells. Finally, infection of PUB B cells with a
      retroviral vector encoding p50 substantially restored proliferation in response
      to LPS. We conclude that Nfkb1 transcriptional activation by PU.1 and Spi-B
      promotes TLR-mediated B cell proliferation.

TI  - Lipid-overloaded enlarged adipocytes provoke insulin resistance independent of
      inflammation.
PG  - 1686-99
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01321-14 [doi]
AB  - In obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy and proinflammatory responses are closely
      associated with the development of insulin resistance in adipose tissue. However,
      it is largely unknown whether adipocyte hypertrophy per se might be sufficient to
      provoke insulin resistance in obese adipose tissue. Here, we demonstrate that
      lipid-overloaded hypertrophic adipocytes are insulin resistant independent of
      adipocyte inflammation. Treatment with saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids
      resulted in adipocyte hypertrophy, but proinflammatory responses were observed
      only in adipocytes treated with saturated fatty acids. Regardless of adipocyte
      inflammation, hypertrophic adipocytes with large and unilocular lipid droplets
      exhibited impaired insulin-dependent glucose uptake, associated with defects in
      GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Moreover, Toll-like receptor 4 mutant
      mice (C3H/HeJ) with high-fat-diet-induced obesity were not protected against
      insulin resistance, although they were resistant to adipose tissue inflammation. 
      Together, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that adipocyte hypertrophy alone 
      may be crucial in causing insulin resistance in obesity.

TI  - Brk/Protein tyrosine kinase 6 phosphorylates p27KIP1, regulating the activity of 
      cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4.
PG  - 1506-22
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01206-14 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) are overexpressed in a variety of
      tumors, but their levels are not accurate indicators of oncogenic activity
      because an accessory factor such as p27(Kip1) is required to assemble this
      unstable dimer. Additionally, tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation of p27 (pY88) is
      required to activate cdk4, acting as an "on/off switch." We identified two SH3
      recruitment domains within p27 that modulate pY88, thereby modulating cdk4
      activity. Via an SH3-PXXP interaction screen, we identified Brk (breast
      tumor-related kinase) as a high-affinity p27 kinase. Modulation of Brk in breast 
      cancer cells modulates pY88 and increases resistance to the cdk4 inhibitor PD
      0332991. An alternatively spliced form of Brk (Alt Brk) which contains its SH3
      domain blocks pY88 and acts as an endogenous cdk4 inhibitor, identifying a
      potentially targetable regulatory region within p27. Brk is overexpressed in 60% 
      of breast carcinomas, suggesting that this facilitates cell cycle progression by 
      modulating cdk4 through p27 Y phosphorylation. p27 has been considered a tumor
      suppressor, but our data strengthen the idea that it should also be considered an
      oncoprotein, responsible for cyclin D-cdk4 activity.

TI  - The control operated by the cell cycle machinery on MEF2 stability contributes to
      the downregulation of CDKN1A and entry into S phase.
PG  - 1633-47
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01461-14 [doi]
AB  - MEF2s are pleiotropic transcription factors (TFs) which supervise multiple
      cellular activities. During the cell cycle, MEF2s are activated at the G0/G1
      transition to orchestrate the expression of the immediate early genes in response
      to growth factor stimulation. Here we show that, in human and murine fibroblasts,
      MEF2 activities are downregulated during late G1. MEF2C and MEF2D interact with
      the E3 ligase F-box protein SKP2, which mediates their subsequent degradation
      through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The cyclin-dependent kinase 4
      (CDK4)/cyclin D1 complex phosphorylates MEF2D on serine residues 98 and 110, and 
      phosphorylation of these residues is an important determinant for SKP2 binding.
      Unscheduled MEF2 transcription during the cell cycle reduces cell proliferation, 
      whereas its containment sustains DNA replication. The CDK inhibitor p21/CDKN1A
      gene is a MEF2 target gene required to exert this antiproliferative influence.
      MEF2C and MEF2D bind a region within the first intron of CDKN1A, presenting
      epigenetic markers of open chromatin. Importantly, H3K27 acetylation within this 
      regulative region depends on the presence of MEF2D. We propose that following the
      initial engagement in the G0/G1 transition, MEF2C and MEF2D must be
      polyubiquitylated and degraded during G1 progression to diminish the
      transcription of the CDKN1A gene, thus favoring entry into S phase.

TI  - RasGAP Promotes Autophagy and Thereby Suppresses Platelet-Derived Growth Factor
      Receptor-Mediated Signaling Events, Cellular Responses, and Pathology.
PG  - 1673-85
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01248-14 [doi]
AB  - Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors (PDGFRs) make
      profound contributions to both physiology and pathology. While it is widely
      believed that direct (PDGF-mediated) activation is the primary mode of activating
      PDGFRs, the discovery that they can also be activated indirectly begs the
      question of the relevance of the indirect mode of activating PDGFRs. In the
      context of a blinding eye disease, indirect activation of PDGFRalpha results in
      persistent signaling, which suppresses the level of p53 and thereby promotes
      viability of cells that drive pathogenesis. Under the same conditions, PDGFRbeta 
      fails to undergo indirect activation. In this paper, we report that RasGAP
      (GTPase-activating protein of Ras) prevented indirect activation of PDGFRbeta.
      RasGAP, which associates with PDGFRbeta but not PDGFRalpha, reduced the level of 
      mitochondrion-derived reactive oxygen species, which are required for enduring
      activation of PDGFRs. Furthermore, preventing PDGFRbeta from associating with
      RasGAP allowed it to signal enduringly and drive pathogenesis of a blinding eye
      disease. These results indicate a previously unappreciated role of RasGAP in
      antagonizing indirect activation of PDGFRbeta, define the underlying mechanism,
      and raise the possibility that PDGFRbeta-mediated diseases involve indirect
      activation of PDGFRbeta.

TI  - Shp2 in forebrain neurons regulates synaptic plasticity, locomotion, and memory
      formation in mice.
PG  - 1557-72
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01339-14 [doi]
AB  - Shp2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2) regulates 
      neural cell differentiation. It is also expressed in postmitotic neurons,
      however, and mutations of Shp2 are associated with clinical syndromes
      characterized by mental retardation. Here we show that conditional-knockout (cKO)
      mice lacking Shp2 specifically in postmitotic forebrain neurons manifest abnormal
      behavior, including hyperactivity. Novelty-induced expression of immediate-early 
      genes and activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (Erk) were
      attenuated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Shp2 cKO mice, suggestive of
      reduced neuronal activity. In contrast, ablation of Shp2 enhanced
      high-K(+)-induced Erk activation in both cultured cortical neurons and
      synaptosomes, whereas it inhibited that induced by brain-derived growth factor in
      cultured neurons. Posttetanic potentiation and paired-pulse facilitation were
      attenuated and enhanced, respectively, in hippocampal slices from Shp2 cKO mice. 
      The mutant mice also manifested transient impairment of memory formation in the
      Morris water maze. Our data suggest that Shp2 contributes to regulation of Erk
      activation and synaptic plasticity in postmitotic forebrain neurons and thereby
      controls locomotor activity and memory formation.

TI  - Epithelial Xbp1 is required for cellular proliferation and differentiation during
      mammary gland development.
PG  - 1543-56
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00136-15 [doi]
AB  - Xbp1, a key mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is activated by
      IRE1alpha-mediated splicing, which results in a frameshift to encode a protein
      with transcriptional activity. However, the direct function of Xbp1 in epithelial
      cells during mammary gland development is unknown. Here we report that the loss
      of Xbp1 in the mammary epithelium through targeted deletion leads to poor
      branching morphogenesis, impaired terminal end bud formation, and spontaneous
      stromal fibrosis during the adult virgin period. Additionally, epithelial Xbp1
      deletion induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the epithelium and
      dramatically inhibits epithelial proliferation and differentiation during
      lactation. The synthesis of milk and its major components, alpha/beta-casein and 
      whey acidic protein (WAP), is significantly reduced due to decreased prolactin
      receptor (Prlr) and ErbB4 expression in Xbp1-deficient mammary epithelium.
      Reduction of Prlr and ErbB4 expression and their diminished availability at the
      cell surface lead to reduced phosphorylated Stat5, an essential regulator of cell
      proliferation and differentiation during lactation. As a result, lactating
      mammary glands in these mice produce less milk protein, leading to poor pup
      growth and postnatal death. These findings suggest that the loss of Xbp1 induces 
      a terminal UPR which blocks proliferation and differentiation during mammary
      gland development.

PG  - 1523-32
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01283-14 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor Pit-1 (POU1-F1) plays a dominant role in cell lineage
      expansion and differentiation in the anterior pituitary. Prior studies of the
      mouse Pit-1 (mPit-1) gene revealed that this master regulatory locus is activated
      at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) by an early enhancer (EE), whereas its subsequent
      expression throughout adult life is maintained by a more distal definitive
      enhancer (DE). Here, we demonstrate that the sequential actions of these two
      enhancers are linked to corresponding shifts in their proximities to the Pit-1
      promoter. We further demonstrate that the looping of the definitive enhancer to
      the mPit-1 promoter is critically dependent on a self-sustaining autoregulatory
      mechanism mediated by the Pit-1 protein. These Pit-1-dependent actions are
      accompanied by localized recruitment of CBP and enrichment for H3K27 acetylation 
      within the Pit-1 locus. These data support a model in which the sequential
      actions of two developmentally activated enhancers are linked to a corresponding 
      shift in higher-order chromatin structures. This shift establishes an
      autoregulatory circuit that maintains durable expression of Pit-1 throughout
      adult life.

TI  - Requisite role for Nck adaptors in cardiovascular development,
      endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and directed cell migration.
PG  - 1573-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00072-15 [doi]
AB  - Development of the cardiovascular system is critically dependent on the ability
      of endothelial cells (ECs) to reorganize their intracellular actin architecture
      to facilitate migration, adhesion, and morphogenesis. Nck family cytoskeletal
      adaptors function as key mediators of actin dynamics in numerous cell types,
      though their role in EC biology remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate 
      an essential requirement for Nck within ECs. Mouse embryos lacking endothelial
      Nck1/2 expression develop extensive angiogenic defects that result in lethality
      at about embryonic day 10. Mutant embryos show immature vascular networks, with
      decreased vessel branching, aberrant perivascular cell recruitment, and reduced
      cardiac trabeculation. Strikingly, embryos deficient in endothelial Nck also fail
      to undergo the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EnMT) required for cardiac 
      valve morphogenesis, with loss of Nck disrupting expression of major EnMT
      markers, as well as suppressing mesenchymal outgrowth. Furthermore, we show that 
      Nck-null ECs are unable to migrate downstream of vascular endothelial growth
      factor and angiopoietin-1, and they exhibit profound perturbations in
      cytoskeletal patterning, with disorganized cellular projections, impaired focal
      adhesion turnover, and disrupted actin-based signaling. Our collective findings
      thereby reveal a crucial role for Nck as a master regulator within the
      endothelium to control actin cytoskeleton organization, vascular network
      remodeling, and EnMT during cardiovascular development.

      kinase (CAK) complex, and serine 5 within the polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal
      domain (CTD) as transcription factor TFIIH-bound CAK. However, the physiological 
      importance of integrating these processes is not understood. Besides the Cdk7
      ortholog Mcs6, fission yeast possesses a second CAK, Csk1. The two enzymes have
      been proposed to act redundantly to activate Cdc2. Using an improved
      analogue-sensitive Mcs6-as kinase, we show that Csk1 is not a relevant CAK for
      Cdc2. Further analyses revealed that Csk1 lacks a 20-amino-acid sequence required
      for its budding yeast counterpart, Cak1, to bind Cdc2. Transcriptome profiling of
      the Mcs6-as mutant in the presence or absence of the budding yeast Cak1 kinase,
      in order to uncouple the CTD kinase and CAK activities of Mcs6, revealed an
      unanticipated role of the CAK branch in the transcriptional control of the
      cluster of genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis and cell growth. The analysis 
      of a Cdc2 CAK site mutant confirmed these data. Our data show that the Cdk7
      kinase modulates transcription through its well-described RNA Pol II CTD kinase
      activity and also through the Cdc2-activating kinase activity.

TI  - Casein kinase 1gamma ensures monopolar growth polarity under incomplete DNA
      replication downstream of Cds1 and calcineurin in fission yeast.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01465-14 [doi]
AB  - Cell polarity is essential for various cellular functions during both
      proliferative and developmental stages, and it displays dynamic alterations in
      response to intracellular and extracellular cues. However, the molecular
      mechanisms underlying spatiotemporal control of polarity transition are poorly
      understood. Here, we show that fission yeast Cki3 (a casein kinase 1gamma
      homolog) is a critical regulator to ensure persistent monopolar growth during S
      phase. Unlike the wild type, cki3 mutant cells undergo bipolar growth when S
      phase is blocked, a condition known to delay transition from monopolar to bipolar
      growth (termed NETO [new end takeoff]). Consistent with this role, Cki3 kinase
      activity is substantially increased, and cells lose their viability in the
      absence of Cki3 upon an S-phase block. Cki3 acts downstream of the checkpoint
      kinase Cds1/Chk2 and calcineurin, and the latter physically interacts with Cki3. 
      Autophosphorylation in the C terminus is inhibitory toward Cki3 kinase activity, 
      and calcineurin is responsible for its dephosphorylation. Cki3 localizes to the
      plasma membrane, and this localization requires the palmitoyltransferase complex 
      Erf2-Erf4. Membrane localization is needed not only for proper NETO timing but
      also for Cki3 kinase activity. We propose that Cki3 acts as a critical inhibitor 
      of cell polarity transition under S-phase arrest.

TI  - Local mitochondrial-endolysosomal microfusion cleaves voltage-dependent anion
      channel 1 to promote survival in hypoxia.
PG  - 1491-505
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01402-14 [doi]
AB  - The oxygen-limiting (hypoxic) microenvironment of tumors induces metabolic
      reprogramming and cell survival, but the underlying mechanisms involving
      mitochondria remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1 mediates the hyperfusion of mitochondria by inducing
      Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 and posttranslational
      truncation of the mitochondrial ATP transporter outer membrane voltage-dependent 
      anion channel 1 in hypoxic cells. In addition, we showed that truncation is
      associated with increased resistance to drug-induced apoptosis and is indicative 
      of increased patient chemoresistance. We now show that silencing of the tumor
      suppressor TP53 decreases truncation and increases drug-induced apoptosis. We
      also show that TP53 regulates truncation through induction of the mitochondrial
      protein Mieap. While we found that truncation was independent of mitophagy, we
      observed local microfusion between mitochondria and endolysosomes in hypoxic
      cells in culture and in patients' tumor tissues. Since we found that the
      endolysosomal asparagine endopeptidase was responsible for truncation, we propose
      that it is a readout of mitochondrial-endolysosomal microfusion in hypoxia. These
      novel findings provide the framework for a better understanding of hypoxic cell
      metabolism and cell survival through mitochondrial-endolysosomal microfusion
      regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and TP53.

TI  - ShcA regulates thymocyte proliferation through specific transcription factors and
      a c-Abl-dependent signaling axis.
PG  - 1462-76
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01084-14 [doi]
AB  - Signaling via the pre-T-cell receptor (pre-TCR), along with associated signals
      from Notch and chemokine receptors, regulates the beta-selection checkpoint that 
      operates on CD4(-) CD8(-) doubly negative (DN) thymocytes. Since many
      hematopoietic malignancies arise at the immature developmental stages of
      lymphocytes, understanding the signal integration and how specific signaling
      molecules and distal transcription factors regulate cellular outcomes is of
      importance. Here, a series of molecular and genetic approaches revealed that the 
      ShcA adapter protein critically influences proliferation and differentiation
      during beta-selection. We found that ShcA functions downstream of the pre-TCR and
      p56(Lck) and show that ShcA is important for extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase (ERK)-dependent upregulation of transcription factors early growth factor 
      1 (Egr1) and Egr3 in immature thymocytes and, in turn, of the expression and
      function of the Id3 and E2A helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins. ShcA also
      contributes to pre-TCR-mediated induction of c-Myc and additional cell cycle
      regulators. Moreover, using an unbiased Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) screen, 
      we identified c-Abl as a binding partner of phosphorylated ShcA and demonstrated 
      the relevance of the ShcA-c-Abl interaction in immature thymocytes. Collectively,
      these data identify multiple modes by which ShcA can fine-tune the development of
      early thymocytes, including a previously unappreciated ShcA-c-Abl axis that
      regulates thymocyte proliferation.

TI  - Characterization of BRD4 during mammalian postmeiotic sperm development.
PG  - 1433-48
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01328-14 [doi]
AB  - During spermiogenesis, the postmeiotic phase of mammalian spermatogenesis,
      transcription is progressively repressed as nuclei of haploid spermatids are
      compacted through a dramatic chromatin reorganization involving hyperacetylation 
      and replacement of most histones with protamines. Although BRDT functions in
      transcription and histone removal in spermatids, it is unknown whether other BET 
      family proteins play a role. Immunofluorescence of spermatogenic cells revealed
      BRD4 in a ring around the nuclei of spermatids containing hyperacetylated
      histones. The ring lies directly adjacent to the acroplaxome, the cytoskeletal
      base of the acrosome, previously linked to chromatin reorganization. The BRD4
      ring does not form in acrosomal mutant mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
      followed by sequencing in spermatids revealed enrichment of BRD4 and acetylated
      histones at the promoters of active genes. BRD4 and BRDT show distinct and
      synergistic binding patterns, with a pronounced enrichment of BRD4 at
      spermatogenesis-specific genes. Direct association of BRD4 with acetylated H4
      decreases in late spermatids as acetylated histones are removed from the
      condensing nucleus in a wave following the progressing acrosome. These data
      provide evidence of a prominent transcriptional role for BRD4 and suggest a
      possible removal mechanism for chromatin components from the genome via the
      progressing acrosome as transcription is repressed and chromatin is compacted
      during spermiogenesis.

TI  - YAP regulates the expression of Hoxa1 and Hoxc13 in mouse and human oral and skin
      epithelial tissues.
PG  - 1449-61
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00765-14 [doi]
AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a Hippo signaling transcriptional coactivator
      that plays pivotal roles in stem cell proliferation, organ size control, and
      tumor development. The downstream targets of YAP have been shown to be highly
      context dependent. In this study, we used the embryonic mouse tooth germ as a
      tool to search for the downstream targets of YAP in ectoderm-derived tissues. Yap
      deficiency in the dental epithelium resulted in a small tooth germ with reduced
      epithelial cell proliferation. We compared the gene expression profiles of
      embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) Yap conditional knockout and YAP transgenic mouse
      tooth germs using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and further confirmed the
      differentially expressed genes using real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. We 
      found that YAP regulates the expression of Hoxa1 and Hoxc13 in oral and dental
      epithelial tissues as well as in the epidermis of skin during embryonic and adult
      stages. Sphere formation assay suggested that Hoxa1 and Hoxc13 are functionally
      involved in YAP-regulated epithelial progenitor cell proliferation, and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay implies that YAP may regulate Hoxa1 and Hoxc13
      expression through TEAD transcription factors. These results provide mechanistic 
      insights into abnormal YAP activities in mice and humans.

TI  - Expression of human Hemojuvelin (HJV) is tightly regulated by two upstream open
      reading frames in HJV mRNA that respond to iron overload in hepatic cells.
PG  - 1376-89
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01462-14 [doi]
AB  - The gene encoding human hemojuvelin (HJV) is one of the genes that, when mutated,
      can cause juvenile hemochromatosis, an early-onset inherited disorder associated 
      with iron overload. The 5' untranslated region of the human HJV mRNA has two
      upstream open reading frames (uORFs), with 28 and 19 codons formed by two
      upstream AUGs (uAUGs) sharing the same in-frame stop codon. Here we show that
      these uORFs decrease the translational efficiency of the downstream main ORF in
      HeLa and HepG2 cells. Indeed, ribosomal access to the main AUG is conditioned by 
      the strong uAUG context, which results in the first uORF being translated most
      frequently. The reach of the main ORF is then achieved by ribosomes that resume
      scanning after uORF translation. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of the
      uORF-encoded peptides also reinforce the translational repression of the main
      ORF. Interestingly, when iron levels increase, translational repression is
      relieved specifically in hepatic cells. The upregulation of protein levels occurs
      along with phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha.
      Nevertheless, our results support a model in which the increasing recognition of 
      the main AUG is mediated by a tissue-specific factor that promotes uORF bypass.
      These results support a tight HJV translational regulation involved in iron
      homeostasis.

TI  - Role of the unfolded protein response in regulating the mucin-dependent
      filamentous-growth mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
PG  - 1414-32
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01501-14 [doi]
AB  - Signaling mucins are evolutionarily conserved regulators of signal transduction
      pathways. The signaling mucin Msb2p regulates the Cdc42p-dependent
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that controls filamentous growth 
      in yeast. The cleavage and release of the glycosylated inhibitory domain of Msb2p
      is required for MAPK activation. We show here that proteolytic processing of
      Msb2p was induced by underglycosylation of its extracellular domain. Cleavage of 
      underglycosylated Msb2p required the unfolded protein response (UPR), a quality
      control (QC) pathway that operates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The UPR
      regulator Ire1p, which detects misfolded/underglycosylated proteins in the ER,
      controlled Msb2p cleavage by regulating transcriptional induction of Yps1p, the
      major protease that processes Msb2p. Accordingly, the UPR was required for
      differentiation to the filamentous cell type. Cleavage of Msb2p occurred in
      conditional trafficking mutants that trap secretory cargo in the endomembrane
      system. Processed Msb2p was delivered to the plasma membrane, and its turnover by
      the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p and ESCRT attenuated the filamentous-growth pathway.
      We speculate that the QC pathways broadly regulate signaling glycoproteins and
      their cognate pathways by recognizing altered glycosylation patterns that can
      occur in response to extrinsic cues.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00112-15 [doi]
AB  - Directional cell motility is essential for normal development and physiology,
      although how motile cells spatiotemporally activate signaling events remains
      largely unknown. Here, we have characterized an adhesion and signaling unit
      comprised of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST and the extracellular matrix
      (ECM) adhesion receptor beta8 integrin that plays essential roles in directional 
      cell motility. beta8 integrin and PTP-PEST form protein complexes at the leading 
      edge of migrating cells and balance patterns of Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling by
      controlling the subcellular localization and phosphorylation status of Rho GDP
      dissociation inhibitor 1 (RhoGDI1). Translocation of Src-phosphorylated RhoGDI1
      to the cell's leading edge promotes local activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, whereas
      dephosphorylation of RhoGDI1 by integrin-bound PTP-PEST promotes RhoGDI1 release 
      from the membrane and sequestration of inactive Rac1/Cdc42 in the cytoplasm.
      Collectively, these data reveal a finely tuned regulatory mechanism for
      controlling signaling events at the leading edge of directionally migrating
      cells.

TI  - Distinct structural domains of caveolin-1 independently regulate Ca2+
      release-activated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ microdomain-dependent gene expression.
PG  - 1341-9

AB  - In eukaryotic cells, calcium entry across the cell surface activates nuclear gene
      expression, a process critically important for cell growth and differentiation,
      learning, and memory and immune cell functions. In immune cells, calcium entry
      occurs through store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels,
      comprised of STIM1 and Orai1 proteins. Local calcium entry through CRAC channels 
      activates expression of c-fos- and nuclear factor of activated T cells
      (NFAT)-dependent genes. Although c-fos and NFAT often interact to activate gene
      expression synergistically, they can be activated independently of one another to
      regulate distinct genes. This raises the question of how one transcription factor
      can be activated and not the other when both are stimulated by the same trigger. 
      Here, we show that the lipid raft scaffolding protein caveolin-1 interacts with
      the STIM1-Orai1 complex to increase channel activity. Phosphorylation of tyrosine
      14 on caveolin-1 regulates CRAC channel-evoked c-fos activation without impacting
      the NFAT pathway or Orai1 activity. Our results reveal that structurally distinct
      domains of caveolin-1 selectively regulate the ability of local calcium to
      activate distinct transcription factors. More generally, our findings reveal that
      modular regulation by a scaffolding protein provides a simple, yet effective,
      mechanism to tunnel a local signal down a specific pathway.

TI  - The hippo pathway effector YAP regulates motility, invasion, and
      castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer cells.
PG  - 1350-62
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00102-15 [doi]
AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) is an effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor
      pathway. The functional significance of YAP in prostate cancer has remained
      elusive. In this study, we first show that enhanced expression of YAP is able to 
      transform immortalized prostate epithelial cells and promote migration and
      invasion in both immortalized and cancerous prostate cells. We found that YAP
      mRNA was upregulated in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-C81 and
      LNCaP-C4-2 cells) compared to the level in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells.
      Importantly, ectopic expression of YAP activated androgen receptor signaling and 
      was sufficient to promote LNCaP cells from an androgen-sensitive state to an
      androgen-insensitive state in vitro, and YAP conferred castration resistance in
      vivo. Accordingly, YAP knockdown greatly reduced the rates of migration and
      invasion of LNCaP-C4-2 cells and under androgen deprivation conditions largely
      blocked cell division in LNCaP-C4-2 cells. Mechanistically, we found that
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase-ribosomal s6 kinase signaling was
      downstream of YAP for cell survival, migration, and invasion in
      androgen-insensitive cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed significant
      upregulation and hyperactivation of YAP in castration-resistant prostate tumors
      compared to their levels in hormone-responsive prostate tumors. Together, our
      results identify YAP to be a novel regulator in prostate cancer cell motility,
      invasion, and castration-resistant growth and as a potential therapeutic target
      for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

TI  - Fungal mediator tail subunits contain classical transcriptional activation
      domains.
PG  - 1363-75
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01508-14 [doi]
AB  - Classical activation domains within DNA-bound eukaryotic transcription factors
      make weak interactions with coactivator complexes, such as Mediator, to stimulate
      transcription. How these interactions stimulate transcription, however, is
      unknown. The activation of reporter genes by artificial fusion of Mediator
      subunits to DNA binding domains that bind to their promoters has been cited as
      evidence that the primary role of activators is simply to recruit Mediator. We
      have identified potent classical transcriptional activation domains in the C
      termini of several tail module subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida
      albicans, and Candida dubliniensis Mediator, while their N-terminal domains are
      necessary and sufficient for their incorporation into Mediator but do not possess
      the ability to activate transcription when fused to a DNA binding domain. This
      suggests that Mediator fusion proteins actually are functioning in a manner
      similar to that of a classical DNA-bound activator rather than just recruiting
      Mediator. Our finding that deletion of the activation domains of S. cerevisiae
      Med2 and Med3, as well as C. dubliniensis Tlo1 (a Med2 ortholog), impairs the
      induction of certain genes shows these domains function at native promoters.
      Activation domains within coactivators are likely an important feature of these
      complexes and one that may have been uniquely leveraged by a common fungal
      pathogen.

TI  - HSP105 recruits protein phosphatase 2A to dephosphorylate beta-catenin.
PG  - 1390-400
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01307-14 [doi]
AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway causes accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm
      and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus to initiate the transcription
      of the target genes. Without Wnt stimulation, beta-catenin forms a complex with
      axin (axis inhibitor), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase 1alpha
      (CK1alpha), and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and undergoes
      phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. Phosphatases, such as protein
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A), interestingly, also are components of this degradation
      complex; therefore, a balance must be reached between phosphorylation and
      dephosphorylation. How this balance is regulated is largely unknown. Here we show
      that a heat shock protein, HSP105, is a previously unidentified component of the 
      beta-catenin degradation complex. HSP105 is required for Wnt signaling, since
      depletion of HSP105 compromises beta-catenin accumulation and target gene
      transcription upon Wnt stimulation. Mechanistically, HSP105 depletion disrupts
      the integration of PP2A into the beta-catenin degradation complex, favoring the
      hyperphosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin. HSP105 is overexpressed in 
      many types of tumors, correlating with increased nuclear beta-catenin protein
      levels and Wnt target gene upregulation. Furthermore, overexpression of HSP105 is
      a prognostic biomarker that correlates with poor overall survival in breast
      cancer patients as well as melanoma patients participating in the BRIM2 clinical 
      study.

PG  - 1316-28
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01263-14 [doi]
AB  - Deletion of the LIMK1 gene is associated with Williams syndrome, a unique
      neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe defects in visuospatial
      cognition and long-term memory (LTM). However, whether LIMK1 contributes to these
      deficits remains elusive. Here, we show that LIMK1-knockout (LIMK1(-/-)) mice are
      drastically impaired in LTM but not short-term memory (STM). In addition,
      LIMK1(-/-) mice are selectively defective in late-phase long-term potentiation
      (L-LTP), a form of long-lasting synaptic plasticity specifically required for the
      formation of LTM. Furthermore, we show that LIMK1 interacts and regulates the
      activity of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), an extensively
      studied transcriptional factor critical for LTM. Importantly, both L-LTP and LTM 
      deficits in LIMK1(-/-) mice are rescued by increasing the activity of CREB. These
      results provide strong evidence that LIMK1 deletion is sufficient to lead to an
      LTM deficit and that this deficit is attributable to CREB hypofunction. Our study
      has identified a direct gene-phenotype link in mice and provides a potential
      strategy to restore LTM in patients with Williams syndrome through the
      enhancement of CREB activity in the adult brain.

TI  - MicroRNA 155 control of p53 activity is context dependent and mediated by Aicda
      and Socs1.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01446-14 [doi]
AB  - In biological processes, the balance between positive and negative inputs is
      critical for an effective physiological response and to prevent disease. A case
      in point is the germinal center (GC) reaction, wherein high mutational and
      proliferation rates are accompanied by an obligatory suppression of the DNA
      repair machinery. Understandably, when the GC reaction goes awry, loss of immune 
      cells or lymphoid cancer ensues. Here, we detail the functional interactions that
      make microRNA 155 (miR-155) a key part of this process. Upon antigen exposure,
      miR-155(-/-) mature B cells displayed significantly higher double-strand DNA
      break (DSB) accumulation and p53 activation than their miR-155(+/+) counterparts.
      Using B cell-specific knockdown strategies, we confirmed the role of the miR-155 
      target Aicda (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) in this process and, in
      combination with a gain-of-function model, unveiled a previously unappreciated
      role for Socs1 in directly modulating p53 activity and the DNA damage response in
      B lymphocytes. Thus, miR-155 controls the outcome of the GC reaction by
      modulating its initiation (Aicda) and termination (Socs1/p53 response),
      suggesting a mechanism to explain the quantitative defect in germinal center B
      cells found in mice lacking or overexpressing this miRNA.

TI  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase ARIH1 protects against genotoxic stress by initiating a
      4EHP-mediated mRNA translation arrest.
PG  - 1254-68
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01152-14 [doi]
AB  - DNA damage response signaling is crucial for genome maintenance in all organisms 
      and is corrupted in cancer. In an RNA interference (RNAi) screen for
      (de)ubiquitinases and sumoylases modulating the apoptotic response of embryonic
      stem (ES) cells to DNA damage, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase/ISGylase,
      ariadne homologue 1 (ARIH1). Silencing ARIH1 sensitized ES and cancer cells to
      genotoxic compounds and ionizing radiation, irrespective of their p53 or
      caspase-3 status. Expression of wild-type but not ubiquitinase-defective ARIH1
      constructs prevented sensitization caused by ARIH1 knockdown. ARIH1 protein
      abundance increased after DNA damage through attenuation of proteasomal
      degradation that required ATM signaling. Accumulated ARIH1 associated with 4EHP, 
      and in turn, this competitive inhibitor of the eukaryotic translation initiation 
      factor 4E (eIF4E) underwent increased nondegradative ubiquitination upon DNA
      damage. Genotoxic stress led to an enrichment of ARIH1 in perinuclear,
      ribosome-containing regions and triggered 4EHP association with the mRNA 5' cap
      as well as mRNA translation arrest in an ARIH1-dependent manner. Finally,
      restoration of DNA damage-induced translation arrest in ARIH1-depleted cells by
      means of an eIF2 inhibitor was sufficient to reinstate resistance to genotoxic
      stress. These findings identify ARIH1 as a potent mediator of DNA damage-induced 
      translation arrest that protects stem and cancer cells against genotoxic stress.

      chromatin.
PG  - 1209-22
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01085-14 [doi]
AB  - Chromosomal translocations are a hallmark of hematopoietic malignancies. CG
      motifs within translocation fragile zones (typically 20 to 600 bp in size) are
      prone to chromosomal translocation in lymphomas. Here we demonstrate that the CG 
      motifs in human translocation fragile zones are hypomethylated relative to the
      adjacent DNA. Using a methyltransferase footprinting assay on isolated nuclei (in
      vitro), we find that the chromatin at these fragile zones is accessible. We also 
      examined in vivo accessibility using cellular expression of a prokaryotic
      methylase. Based on this assay, which measures accessibility over a much longer
      time interval than is possible with in vitro methods, these fragile zones were
      found to be more accessible than the adjacent DNA. Because DNA within the fragile
      zones can be methylated by both cellular and exogenous methyltransferases, the
      fragile zones are predominantly in a duplex DNA conformation. These observations 
      permit more-refined models for why these zones are 100- to 1,000-fold more prone 
      to undergo chromosomal translocation than the adjacent regions.

PG  - 1068-80
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01404-14 [doi]
AB  - Cells link environmental fluctuations, such as nutrition, to metabolic
      remodeling. Epigenetic factors are thought to be involved in such cellular
      processes, but the molecular basis remains unclear. Here we report that the
      lysine-specific demethylase 2 (LSD2) suppresses the flux and metabolism of lipids
      to maintain the energy balance in hepatic cells. Using transcriptome and
      chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses, we revealed that LSD2
      represses the genes involved in lipid influx and metabolism through demethylation
      of histone H3K4. Selective recruitment of LSD2 at lipid metabolism gene loci was 
      mediated in part by a stress-responsive transcription factor, c-Jun.
      Intriguingly, LSD2 depletion increased the intracellular levels of many lipid
      metabolites, which was accompanied by an increased susceptibility to toxic cell
      damage in response to fatty acid exposure. Our data demonstrate that LSD2
      maintains metabolic plasticity under fluctuating environment in hepatocytes by
      mediating the cross talk between the epigenome and metabolism.

TI  - Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) and ERRgamma are essential
      coordinators of cardiac metabolism and function.
PG  - 1281-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01156-14 [doi]
AB  - Almost all cellular functions are powered by a continuous energy supply derived
      from cellular metabolism. However, it is little understood how cellular energy
      production is coordinated with diverse energy-consuming cellular functions. Here,
      using the cardiac muscle system, we demonstrate that nuclear receptors
      estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) and ERRgamma are essential
      transcriptional coordinators of cardiac energy production and consumption. On the
      one hand, ERRalpha and ERRgamma together are vital for intact cardiomyocyte
      metabolism by directly controlling expression of genes important for
      mitochondrial functions and dynamics. On the other hand, ERRalpha and ERRgamma
      influence major cardiomyocyte energy consumption functions through direct
      transcriptional regulation of key contraction, calcium homeostasis, and
      conduction genes. Mice lacking both ERRalpha and cardiac ERRgamma develop severe 
      bradycardia, lethal cardiomyopathy, and heart failure featuring metabolic,
      contractile, and conduction dysfunctions. These results illustrate that the ERR
      transcriptional pathway is essential to couple cellular energy metabolism with
      energy consumption processes in order to maintain normal cardiac function.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01118-14 [doi]
AB  - Methylglyoxal is a typical 2-oxoaldehyde derived from glycolysis. We show here
      that methylglyoxal activates the Pkc1-Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
      cascade in a target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2)-dependent manner in the
      budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that TORC2 phosphorylates 
      Pkc1 at Thr(1125) and Ser(1143). Methylglyoxal enhanced the phosphorylation of
      Pkc1 at Ser(1143), which transmitted the signal to the downstream Mpk1 MAP kinase
      cascade. We found that the phosphorylation status of Pkc1(T1125) affected the
      phosphorylation of Pkc1 at Ser(1143), in addition to its protein levels.
      Methylglyoxal activated mammalian TORC2 signaling, which, in turn, phosphorylated
      Akt at Ser(473). Our results suggest that methylglyoxal is a conserved initiator 
      of TORC2 signaling among eukaryotes.

TI  - PCTK1 regulates integrin-dependent spindle orientation via protein kinase A
      regulatory subunit KAP0 and myosin X.
PG  - 1197-208
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01017-14 [doi]
AB  - Integrin-dependent cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is a determinant of
      spindle orientation. However, the signaling pathways that couple integrins to
      spindle orientation remain elusive. Here, we show that PCTAIRE-1 kinase (PCTK1), 
      a member of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) whose function is poorly
      characterized, plays an essential role in this process. PCTK1 regulates spindle
      orientation in a kinase-dependent manner. Phosphoproteomic analysis together with
      an RNA interference screen revealed that PCTK1 regulates spindle orientation
      through phosphorylation of Ser83 on KAP0, a regulatory subunit of protein kinase 
      A (PKA). This phosphorylation is dispensable for KAP0 dimerization and for PKA
      binding but is necessary for its interaction with myosin X, a regulator of
      spindle orientation. KAP0 binds to the FERM domain of myosin X and enhances the
      association of myosin X-FERM with beta1 integrin. This interaction between myosin
      X-FERM and beta1 integrin appeared to be crucial for spindle orientation control.
      We propose that PCTK1-KAP0-myosin X-beta1 integrin is a functional module
      providing a link between ECM and the actin cytoskeleton in the ECM-dependent
      control of spindle orientation.

TI  - Muscle-derived extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 are required for

PG  - 1238-53
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01071-14 [doi]
AB  - The Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway appears to
      be important for the development, maintenance, aging, and pathology of mammalian 
      skeletal muscle. Yet no gene targeting of Erk1/2 in muscle fibers in vivo has
      been reported to date. We combined a germ line Erk1 mutation with Cre-loxP Erk2
      inactivation in skeletal muscle to produce, for the first time, mice lacking
      ERK1/2 selectively in skeletal myofibers. Animals lacking muscle ERK1/2 displayed
      stunted postnatal growth, muscle weakness, and a shorter life span. Their muscles
      examined in this study, sternomastoid and tibialis anterior, displayed fragmented
      neuromuscular synapses and a mixture of modest fiber atrophy and loss but failed 
      to show major changes in fiber type composition or absence of cell surface
      dystrophin. Whereas the lack of only ERK1 had no effects on the phenotypes
      studied, the lack of myofiber ERK2 explained synaptic fragmentation in the
      sternomastoid but not the tibialis anterior and a decrease in the expression of
      the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) epsilon subunit gene mRNA in both muscles. A
      reduction in AChR protein was documented in line with the above mRNA results.
      Evidence of partial denervation was found in the sternomastoid but not the
      tibialis anterior. Thus, myofiber ERK1/2 are differentially required for the
      maintenance of myofibers and neuromuscular synapses in adult mice.

TI  - Rbs1, a new protein implicated in RNA polymerase III biogenesis in yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 1169-81
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01230-14 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) complex assembly and its
      transport to the nucleus. We demonstrate that a missense cold-sensitive mutation,
      rpc128-1007, in the sequence encoding the C-terminal part of the second largest
      Pol III subunit, C128, affects the assembly and stability of the enzyme. The
      cellular levels and nuclear concentration of selected Pol III subunits were
      decreased in rpc128-1007 cells, and the association between Pol III subunits as
      evaluated by coimmunoprecipitation was also reduced. To identify the proteins
      involved in Pol III assembly, we performed a genetic screen for suppressors of
      the rpc128-1007 mutation and selected the Rbs1 gene, whose overexpression
      enhanced de novo tRNA transcription in rpc128-1007 cells, which correlated with
      increased stability, nuclear concentration, and interaction of Pol III subunits. 
      The rpc128-1007 rbs1Delta double mutant shows a synthetic growth defect,
      indicating that rpc128-1007 and rbs1Delta function in parallel ways to negatively
      regulate Pol III assembly. Rbs1 physically interacts with a subset of Pol III
      subunits, AC19, AC40, and ABC27/Rpb5. Additionally, Rbs1 interacts with the Crm1 
      exportin and shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. We postulate that Rbs1
      binds to the Pol III complex or subcomplex and facilitates its translocation to
      the nucleus.

TI  - Nuclear GIT2 is an ATM substrate and promotes DNA repair.
PG  - 1081-96
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01432-14 [doi]
AB  - Insults to nuclear DNA induce multiple response pathways to mitigate the
      deleterious effects of damage and mediate effective DNA repair. G-protein-coupled
      receptor kinase-interacting protein 2 (GIT2) regulates receptor internalization, 
      focal adhesion dynamics, cell migration, and responses to oxidative stress. Here 
      we demonstrate that GIT2 coordinates the levels of proteins in the DNA damage
      response (DDR). Cellular sensitivity to irradiation-induced DNA damage was highly
      associated with GIT2 expression levels. GIT2 is phosphorylated by ATM kinase and 
      forms complexes with multiple DDR-associated factors in response to DNA damage.
      The targeting of GIT2 to DNA double-strand breaks was rapid and, in part,
      dependent upon the presence of H2AX, ATM, and MRE11 but was independent of MDC1
      and RNF8. GIT2 likely promotes DNA repair through multiple mechanisms, including 
      stabilization of BRCA1 in repair complexes; upregulation of repair proteins,
      including HMGN1 and RFC1; and regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity.
      Furthermore, GIT2-knockout mice demonstrated a greater susceptibility to DNA
      damage than their wild-type littermates. These results suggest that GIT2 plays an
      important role in MRE11/ATM/H2AX-mediated DNA damage responses.

TI  - The orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 is a determinant of myofiber size and muscle
      mass in mice.
PG  - 1125-38
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00715-14 [doi]
AB  - We previously showed that the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 (Nr4a1) plays an
      important role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and oxidative metabolism 
      in skeletal muscle. Here, we show using both gain- and loss-of-function models
      that Nur77 is also a regulator of muscle growth in mice. Transgenic expression of
      Nur77 in skeletal muscle in mice led to increases in myofiber size. Conversely,
      mice with global or muscle-specific deficiency in Nur77 exhibited reduced muscle 
      mass and myofiber size. In contrast to Nur77 deficiency, deletion of the highly
      related nuclear receptor NOR1 (Nr4a3) had minimal effect on muscle mass and
      myofiber size. We further show that Nur77 mediates its effects on muscle size by 
      orchestrating transcriptional programs that favor muscle growth, including the
      induction of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), as well as concomitant
      downregulation of growth-inhibitory genes, including myostatin, Fbxo32 (MAFbx),
      and Trim63 (MuRF1). Nur77-mediated increase in IGF1 led to activation of the
      Akt-mTOR-S6K cascade and the inhibition of FoxO3a activity. The dependence of
      Nur77 on IGF1 was recapitulated in primary myoblasts, establishing this as a
      cell-autonomous effect. Collectively, our findings identify Nur77 as a novel
      regulator of myofiber size and a potential transcriptional link between cellular 
      metabolism and muscle growth.

TI  - Role of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase p110beta in skeletal myogenesis.
PG  - 1182-96
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00550-14 [doi]
AB  - Phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) regulates a number of developmental and
      physiologic processes in skeletal muscle; however, the contributions of
      individual PI3K p110 catalytic subunits to these processes are not well-defined. 
      To address this question, we investigated the role of the 110-kDa PI3K catalytic 
      subunit beta (p110beta) in myogenesis and metabolism. In C2C12 cells,
      pharmacological inhibition of p110beta delayed differentiation. We next generated
      mice with conditional deletion of p110beta in skeletal muscle (p110beta muscle
      knockout [p110beta-mKO] mice). While young p110beta-mKO mice possessed a lower
      quadriceps mass and exhibited less strength than control littermates, no
      differences in muscle mass or strength were observed between genotypes in old
      mice. However, old p110beta-mKO mice were less glucose tolerant than old control 
      mice. Overexpression of p110beta accelerated differentiation in C2C12 cells and
      primary human myoblasts through an Akt-dependent mechanism, while expression of
      kinase-inactive p110beta had the opposite effect. p110beta overexpression was
      unable to promote myoblast differentiation under conditions of p110alpha
      inhibition, but expression of p110alpha was able to promote differentiation under
      conditions of p110beta inhibition. These findings reveal a role for p110beta
      during myogenesis and demonstrate that long-term reduction of skeletal muscle
      p110beta impairs whole-body glucose tolerance without affecting skeletal muscle
      size or strength in old mice.

TI  - C11orf83, a mitochondrial cardiolipin-binding protein involved in bc1 complex
      assembly and supercomplex stabilization.
PG  - 1139-56
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01047-14 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian mitochondria may contain up to 1,500 different proteins, and many of
      them have neither been confidently identified nor characterized. In this study,
      we demonstrated that C11orf83, which was lacking experimental characterization,
      is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein facing the intermembrane space. This
      protein is specifically associated with the bc1 complex of the electron transport
      chain and involved in the early stages of its assembly by stabilizing the bc1
      core complex. C11orf83 displays some overlapping functions with Cbp4p, a yeast
      bc1 complex assembly factor. Therefore, we suggest that C11orf83, now called
      UQCC3, is the functional human equivalent of Cbp4p. In addition, C11orf83
      depletion in HeLa cells caused abnormal crista morphology, higher sensitivity to 
      apoptosis, a decreased ATP level due to impaired respiration and subtle, but
      significant, changes in cardiolipin composition. We showed that C11orf83 binds to
      cardiolipin by its alpha-helices 2 and 3 and is involved in the stabilization of 
      bc1 complex-containing supercomplexes, especially the III2/IV supercomplex. We
      also demonstrated that the OMA1 metalloprotease cleaves C11orf83 in response to
      mitochondrial depolarization, suggesting a role in the selection of cells with
      damaged mitochondria for their subsequent elimination by apoptosis, as previously
      described for OPA1.

      modulating phosphodiesterase mRNA splicing and degradation.

AB  - Glucocorticoid production in the adrenal cortex is activated in response to an
      increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling. The nuclear protein p54(nrb)/NONO
      belongs to the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) family and has been
      implicated in several nuclear processes, including transcription, splicing, and
      RNA export. We previously identified p54(nrb)/NONO as a component of a protein
      complex that regulates the transcription of CYP17A1, a gene required for
      glucocorticoid production. Based on the multiple mechanisms by which
      p54(nrb)/NONO has been shown to control gene expression and the ability of the
      protein to be recruited to the CYP17A1 promoter, we sought to further define the 
      molecular mechanism by which p54(nrb)/NONO confers optimal cortisol production.
      We show here that silencing p54(nrb)/NONO expression in H295R human
      adrenocortical cells decreases the ability of the cells to increase intracellular
      cAMP production and subsequent cortisol biosynthesis in response to
      adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation. Interestingly, the expression of 
      multiple phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms, including PDE2A, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, 
      PDE4D, and PDE11A, was induced in p54(nrb)/NONO knockdown cells. Investigation of
      the mechanism by which silencing of p54(nrb)/NONO led to increased expression of 
      select PDE isoforms revealed that p54(nrb)/NONO regulates the splicing of a
      subset of PDE isoforms. Importantly, we also identify a role for p54(nrb)/NONO in
      regulating the stability of PDE transcripts by facilitating the interaction
      between the exoribonuclease XRN2 and select PDE transcripts. In summary, we
      report that p54(nrb)/NONO modulates cAMP-dependent signaling, and ultimately
      cAMP-stimulated glucocorticoid biosynthesis by regulating the splicing and
      degradation of PDE transcripts.

TI  - Nucleoporin 62-like protein activates canonical Wnt signaling through
      facilitating the nuclear import of beta-catenin in zebrafish.
PG  - 1110-24
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01181-14 [doi]
AB  - Nucleoporin p62 (Nup62) localizes in the central channel of nuclear pore
      complexes (NPCs) and regulates nuclear pore permeability and nucleocytoplasmic
      transport. However, the developmental roles of Nup62 in vertebrates remain
      largely unclear. Zebrafish Nup62-like protein (Nup62l) is a homolog of mammalian 
      Nup62. The nup62l gene is maternally expressed, but its transcripts are
      ubiquitously distributed during early embryogenesis and enriched in the head,
      pharynx, and intestine of developing embryos. Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin 
      pathway positively modulates nup62l transcription, while Bmp signaling acts
      downstream of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to negatively regulate nup62l
      expression. Overexpression of nup62l dorsalized embryos and enhanced gastrula
      convergence and extension (CE) movements. In contrast, knockdown of Nup62l led to
      ventralized embryos, an impediment to CE movements, and defects in specification 
      of midline organ progenitors. Mechanistically, Nup62l acts as an activator of
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling through interaction with and facilitation of nuclear
      import of beta-catenin-1/2 in zebrafish. Thus, Nup62l regulates dorsoventral
      patterning, gastrula CE movements, and proper specification of midline organ
      precursors through mediating the nuclear import of beta-catenins in zebrafish.

TI  - USP7 cooperates with SCML2 to regulate the activity of PRC1.
PG  - 1157-68
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01197-14 [doi]
AB  - USP7 is a protein deubiquitinase with an essential role in development. Here, we 
      provide evidence that USP7 regulates the activity of Polycomb repressive complex 
      1 (PRC1) in coordination with SCML2. There are six versions of PRC1 defined by
      the association of one of the PCGF homologues (PCGF1 to PCGF6) with the common
      catalytic subunit RING1B. First, we show that SCML2, a Polycomb group protein
      that associates with PRC1.2 (containing PCGF2/MEL18) and PRC1.4 (containing
      PCGF4/BMI1), modulates the localization of USP7 and bridges USP7 with PRC1.4,
      allowing for the stabilization of BMI1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
      experiments demonstrate that USP7 is found at SCML2 and BMI1 target genes.
      Second, inhibition of USP7 leads to a reduction in the level of ubiquitinated
      histone H2A (H2Aub), the catalytic product of PRC1 and key for its repressive
      activity. USP7 regulates the posttranslational status of RING1B and BMI1, a
      specific component of PRC1.4. Thus, not only does USP7 stabilize PRC1 components,
      its catalytic activity is also necessary to maintain a functional PRC1, thereby
      ensuring appropriate levels of repressive H2Aub.

TI  - Loss of osteoblast Runx3 produces severe congenital osteopenia.
PG  - 1097-109
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01106-14 [doi]
AB  - Congenital osteopenia is a bone demineralization condition that is associated
      with elevated fracture risk in human infants. Here we show that Runx3, like
      Runx2, is expressed in precommitted embryonic osteoblasts and that
      Runx3-deficient mice develop severe congenital osteopenia. Runx3-deficient
      osteoblast-specific (Runx3(fl/fl)/Col1alpha1-cre), but not chondrocyte-specific
      (Runx3(fl/fl)/Col1alpha2-cre), mice are osteopenic. This demonstrates that an
      osteoblastic cell-autonomous function of Runx3 is required for proper
      osteogenesis. Bone histomorphometry revealed that decreased osteoblast numbers
      and reduced mineral deposition capacity in Runx3-deficient mice cause this bone
      formation deficiency. Neonatal bone and cultured primary osteoblast analyses
      revealed a Runx3-deficiency-associated decrease in the number of active
      osteoblasts resulting from diminished proliferation and not from enhanced
      osteoblast apoptosis. These findings are supported by Runx3-null culture
      transcriptome analyses showing significant decreases in the levels of
      osteoblastic markers and increases in the levels of Notch signaling components.
      Thus, while Runx2 is mandatory for the osteoblastic lineage commitment, Runx3 is 
      nonredundantly required for the proliferation of these precommitted cells, to
      generate adequate numbers of active osteoblasts. Human RUNX3 resides on
      chromosome 1p36, a region that is associated with osteoporosis. Therefore, RUNX3 
      might also be involved in human bone mineralization.

TI  - Regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and vascular assembly through
      distinct mTORC2 signaling pathways.
PG  - 1299-313
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00306-14 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates 
      a diverse array of cellular processes, including cell growth, survival,
      metabolism, and cytoskeleton dynamics. mTOR functions in two distinct complexes, 
      mTORC1 and mTORC2, whose activities and substrate specificities are regulated by 
      complex specific cofactors, including Raptor and Rictor, respectively. Little is 
      known regarding the relative contribution of mTORC1 versus mTORC2 in vascular
      endothelial cells. Using mouse models of Raptor or Rictor gene targeting, we
      discovered that Rictor ablation inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF)-induced endothelial cell proliferation and assembly in vitro and
      angiogenesis in vivo, whereas the loss of Raptor had only a modest effect on
      endothelial cells (ECs). Mechanistically, the loss of Rictor reduced the
      phosphorylation of AKT, protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), and NDRG1 without
      affecting the mTORC1 pathway. In contrast, the loss of Raptor increased the
      phosphorylation of AKT despite inhibiting the phosphorylation of S6K1, a direct
      target of mTORC1. Reconstitution of Rictor-null cells with myristoylated AKT
      (Myr-AKT) rescued vascular assembly in Rictor-deficient endothelial cells,
      whereas PKCalpha rescued proliferation defects. Furthermore, tumor
      neovascularization in vivo was significantly decreased upon EC-specific Rictor
      deletion in mice. These data indicate that mTORC2 is a critical signaling node
      required for VEGF-mediated angiogenesis through the regulation of AKT and
      PKCalpha in vascular endothelial cells.

TI  - Otoferlin deficiency in zebrafish results in defects in balance and hearing:
      rescue of the balance and hearing phenotype with full-length and truncated forms 
      of mouse otoferlin.

AB  - Sensory hair cells convert mechanical motion into chemical signals. Otoferlin, a 
      six-C2 domain transmembrane protein linked to deafness in humans, is hypothesized
      to play a role in exocytosis at hair cell ribbon synapses. To date, however,
      otoferlin has been studied almost exclusively in mouse models, and no rescue
      experiments have been reported. Here we describe the phenotype associated with
      morpholino-induced otoferlin knockdown in zebrafish and report the results of
      rescue experiments conducted with full-length and truncated forms of otoferlin.
      We found that expression of otoferlin occurs early in development and is
      restricted to hair cells and the midbrain. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
      localization to both apical and basolateral regions of hair cells. Knockdown of
      otoferlin resulted in hearing and balance defects, as well as locomotion
      deficiencies. Further, otoferlin morphants had uninflated swim bladders. Rescue
      experiments conducted with mouse otoferlin restored hearing, balance, and
      inflation of the swim bladder. Remarkably, truncated forms of otoferlin retaining
      the C-terminal C2F domain also rescued the otoferlin knockdown phenotype, while
      the individual N-terminal C2A domain did not. We conclude that otoferlin plays an
      evolutionarily conserved role in vertebrate hearing and that truncated forms of
      otoferlin can rescue hearing and balance.

TI  - Uncoupling lipid metabolism from inflammation through fatty acid binding
      protein-dependent expression of UCP2.
PG  - 1055-65
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01122-14 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation in obese adipose tissue is linked to endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) stress and systemic insulin resistance. Targeted deletion of the murine
      fatty acid binding protein (FABP4/aP2) uncouples obesity from inflammation
      although the mechanism underlying this finding has remained enigmatic. Here, we
      show that inhibition or deletion of FABP4/aP2 in macrophages results in increased
      intracellular free fatty acids (FFAs) and elevated expression of uncoupling
      protein 2 (UCP2) without concomitant increases in UCP1 or UCP3. Silencing of UCP2
      mRNA in FABP4/aP2-deficient macrophages negated the protective effect of FABP
      loss and increased ER stress in response to palmitate or lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS). Pharmacologic inhibition of FABP4/aP2 with the FABP inhibitor HTS01037
      also upregulated UCP2 and reduced expression of BiP, CHOP, and XBP-1s. Expression
      of native FABP4/aP2 (but not the non-fatty acid binding mutant R126Q) into
      FABP4/aP2 null cells reduced UCP2 expression, suggesting that the FABP-FFA
      equilibrium controls UCP2 expression. FABP4/aP2-deficient macrophages are
      resistant to LPS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and exhibit decreased
      mitochondrial protein carbonylation and UCP2-dependent reduction in intracellular
      reactive oxygen species. These data demonstrate that FABP4/aP2 directly regulates
      intracellular FFA levels and indirectly controls macrophage inflammation and ER
      stress by regulating the expression of UCP2.

TI  - Role of microRNA 30a targeting insulin receptor substrate 2 in colorectal
      tumorigenesis.
PG  - 988-1000
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01242-14 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are dysregulated in many types of malignant diseases,
      including colorectal cancer. miRNA 30a (miR-30a) is a member of the miR-30 family
      and has been implicated in many types of cancers. In this study, we determined
      the expression of miR-30a in human colon cancer tissues and cell lines. miR-30a
      was found to be significantly downregulated in both the tissues and cell lines.
      Furthermore, overexpression of miR-30a inhibited, while silencing of miR-30a
      promoted, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Consistently,
      stable overexpression of miR-30a suppressed the growth of colon cancer cell
      xenografts in vivo. Moreover, bioinformatic algorithms and luciferase reporter
      assays revealed that insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is a direct target of
      miR-30a. Further functional studies suggested that repression of IRS2 by miR-30a 
      partially mediated the tumor suppressor effect of miR-30a. In addition, miR-30a
      inhibited constitutive phosphorylation of Akt by targeting IRS2. Additionally,
      clinicopathological analysis indicated that miR-30a has an inverse correlation
      with the staging in patients with colon cancer. Taken together, our study
      provides the first evidence that miR-30a suppressed colon cancer cell growth
      through inhibition of IRS2. Thus, miR-30a might serve as a promising therapeutic 
      strategy for colon cancer treatment.

TI  - The ubiquitin E3 ligase SCF-FBXO24 recognizes deacetylated nucleoside diphosphate
      kinase A to enhance its degradation.
PG  - 1001-13
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01185-14 [doi]
AB  - The Skp-Cul-F box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase machinery recognizes predominantly
      phosphodegrons or, less commonly, an (I/L)Q molecular signature within substrates
      to facilitate their recruitment in mediating protein ubiquitination and
      degradation. Here, we examined the molecular signals that determine the turnover 
      of the multifunctional enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDPK-A) that
      controls cell proliferation. NDPK-A protein exhibits a half-life of approximately
      6 h in HeLa cells and is targeted for ubiquitylation through actions of the F-box
      protein FBXO24. SCF-FBXO24 polyubiquitinates NDPK-A at K85, and two
      NH(2)-terminal residues, L55 and K56, were identified as important molecular
      sites for FBXO24 interaction. Importantly, K56 acetylation impairs its
      interaction with FBXO24, and replacing K56 with Q56, an acetylation mimic,
      reduces NDPK-A FBXO24 binding capacity. The acetyltransferase GCN5 catalyzes K56 
      acetylation within NDPK-A, thereby stabilizing NDPK-A, whereas GCN5 depletion in 
      cells accelerates NDPK-A degradation. Cellular expression of an NDPK-A
      acetylation mimic or FBXO24 silencing increases NDPK-A life span which, in turn, 
      impairs cell migration and wound healing. We propose that lysine acetylation when
      presented in the appropriate context may be recognized by some F-box proteins as 
      a unique inhibitory molecular signal for their recruitment to restrict substrate 
      degradation.

TI  - Dynamic switching of active promoter and enhancer domains regulates Tet1 and Tet2
      expression during cell state transitions between pluripotency and

AB  - The Tet 5-methylcytosine dioxygenases catalyze DNA demethylation by producing
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine and further oxidized products. Tet1 and Tet2 are highly
      expressed in mouse pluripotent cells and downregulated to different extents in
      somatic cells, but the transcriptional mechanisms are unclear. Here we defined
      the promoter and enhancer domains in Tet1 and Tet2. Within a 15-kb
      "superenhancer" of Tet1, there are two transcription start sites (TSSs) with
      different activation patterns during development. A 6-kb promoter region upstream
      of the distal TSS is highly active in naive pluripotent cells, autonomously
      reports Tet1 expression in a transgenic system, and rapidly undergoes DNA
      methylation and silencing upon differentiation in cultured cells and native
      epiblast. A second TSS downstream, associated with a constitutively weak CpG-rich
      promoter, is activated by a neighboring enhancer in naive embryonic stem cells
      (ESCs) and primed epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Tet2 has a CpG island promoter
      with pluripotency-independent activity and an ESC-specific distal intragenic
      enhancer; the latter is rapidly downregulated in EpiLCs. Our study reveals
      distinct modes of transcriptional regulation at Tet1 and Tet2 during cell state
      transitions of early development. New transgenic reporters using Tet1 and Tet2
      cis-regulatory domains may serve to distinguish nuanced changes in pluripotent
      states and the underlying epigenetic variations.

TI  - The zinc finger protein ZNF658 regulates the transcription of genes involved in
      zinc homeostasis and affects ribosome biogenesis through the zinc transcriptional
      regulatory element.
PG  - 977-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01298-14 [doi]
AB  - We previously identified the ZTRE (zinc transcriptional regulatory element) in
      genes involved in zinc homeostasis and showed that it mediates transcriptional
      repression in response to zinc. We now report that ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE.
      ZNF658 was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
      flight mass spectrometry of a band excised after electrophoretic mobility shift
      assay using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers.
      It has similarity with ZAP1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the
      response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to
      be functional also in ZNF658. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658
      abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5 gene),
      SLC30A10 (ZnT10 gene), and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability
      of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter 
      constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by
      siRNA uncovered a large decrease in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within
      the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal
      proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most
      active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is 
      thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the
      orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability.

TI  - Pluripotency transcription factor Oct4 mediates stepwise nucleosome demethylation
      and depletion.
PG  - 1014-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01105-14 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms whereby the crucial pluripotency transcription factor Oct4
      regulates target gene expression are incompletely understood. Using an assay
      system based on partially differentiated embryonic stem cells, we show that Oct4 
      opposes the accumulation of local H3K9me2 and subsequent Dnmt3a-mediated DNA
      methylation. Upon binding DNA, Oct4 recruits the histone lysine demethylase
      Jmjd1c. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) time course experiments identify a
      stepwise Oct4 mechanism involving Jmjd1c recruitment and H3K9me2 demethylation,
      transient FACT (facilitates chromatin transactions) complex recruitment, and
      nucleosome depletion. Genome-wide and targeted ChIP confirms binding of newly
      synthesized Oct4, together with Jmjd1c and FACT, to the Pou5f1 enhancer and a
      small number of other Oct4 targets, including the Nanog promoter. Histone
      demethylation is required for both FACT recruitment and H3 depletion. Jmjd1c is
      required to induce endogenous Oct4 expression and fully reprogram fibroblasts to 
      pluripotency, indicating that the assay system identifies functional Oct4
      cofactors. These findings indicate that Oct4 sequentially recruits activities
      that catalyze histone demethylation and depletion.

TI  - Regulation of the transcription factor EB-PGC1alpha axis by beclin-1 controls
      mitochondrial quality and cardiomyocyte death under stress.
PG  - 956-76
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01091-14 [doi]
AB  - In cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation 
      and upregulation of the hypoxia-inducible protein BNIP3 result in mitochondrial
      permeabilization, but impairment in autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria
      provokes programmed cardiomyocyte death. BNIP3 expression and ROS generation
      result in upregulation of beclin-1, a protein associated with transcriptional
      suppression of autophagy-lysosome proteins and reduced activation of
      transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome
      machinery. Partial beclin-1 knockdown transcriptionally stimulates lysosome
      biogenesis and autophagy via mTOR inhibition and activation of TFEB, enhancing
      removal of depolarized mitochondria. TFEB activation concomitantly stimulates
      mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC1alpha induction to restore normally polarized
      mitochondria and attenuate BNIP3- and hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced cell death.
      Conversely, overexpression of beclin-1 activates mTOR to inhibit TFEB, resulting 
      in declines in lysosome numbers and suppression of PGC1alpha transcription.
      Importantly, knockdown of endogenous TFEB or PGC1alpha results in a complete or
      partial loss, respectively, of the cytoprotective effects of partial beclin-1
      knockdown, indicating a critical role for both mitochondrial autophagy and
      biogenesis in ensuring cellular viability. These studies uncover a
      transcriptional feedback loop for beclin-1-mediated regulation of TFEB activation
      and implicate a central role for TFEB in coordinating mitochondrial autophagy
      with biogenesis to restore normally polarized mitochondria and prevent
      ischemia-reperfusion-induced cardiomyocyte death.

TI  - Characterization of human cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) and CDK13 complexes 
      in C-terminal domain phosphorylation, gene transcription, and RNA processing.
PG  - 928-38
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01426-14 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and CDK12 have each been demonstrated to
      phosphorylate the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) at serine 2 of the
      heptad repeat, both in vitro and in vivo. CDK9, as part of P-TEFb and the super
      elongation complex (SEC), is by far the best characterized of CDK9, CDK12, and
      CDK13. We employed both in vitro and in vivo assays to further investigate the
      molecular properties of CDK12 and its paralog CDK13. We isolated Flag-tagged
      CDK12 and CDK13 and found that they associate with numerous RNA processing
      factors. Although knockdown of CDK12, CDK13, or their cyclin partner CCNK did not
      affect the bulk CTD phosphorylation levels in HCT116 cells, transcriptome
      sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that CDK12 and CDK13 losses in HCT116
      cells preferentially affect expression of DNA damage response and snoRNA genes,
      respectively. CDK12 and CDK13 depletion also leads to a loss of expression of RNA
      processing factors and to defects in RNA processing. These findings suggest that 
      in addition to implementing CTD phosphorylation, CDK12 and CDK13 may affect RNA
      processing through direct physical interactions with RNA processing factors and
      by regulating their expression.

TI  - Stability of proICA512/IA-2 and its targeting to insulin secretory granules
      require beta4-sheet-mediated dimerization of its ectodomain in the endoplasmic
      reticulum.
PG  - 914-27
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00994-14 [doi]
AB  - The type 1 diabetes autoantigen ICA512/IA-2/RPTPN is a receptor protein tyrosine 
      phosphatase of the insulin secretory granules (SGs) which regulates the size of
      granule stores, possibly via cleavage/signaling of its cytosolic tail. The role
      of its extracellular region remains unknown. Structural studies indicated that
      beta2- or beta4-strands in the mature ectodomain (ME ICA512) form dimers in
      vitro. Here we show that ME ICA512 prompts proICA512 dimerization in the
      endoplasmic reticulum. Perturbation of ME ICA512 beta2-strand N-glycosylation
      upon S508A replacement allows for proICA512 dimerization, O-glycosylation,
      targeting to granules, and conversion, which are instead precluded upon G553D
      replacement in the ME ICA512 beta4-strand. S508A/G553D and N506A/G553D double
      mutants dimerize but remain in the endoplasmic reticulum. Removal of the
      N-terminal fragment (ICA512-NTF) preceding ME ICA512 allows an ICA512-DeltaNTF
      G553D mutant to exit the endoplasmic reticulum, and ICA512-DeltaNTF is
      constitutively delivered to the cell surface. The signal for SG sorting is
      located within the NTF RESP18 homology domain (RESP18-HD), whereas soluble NTF is
      retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Hence, we propose that the ME ICA512
      beta2-strand fosters proICA512 dimerization until NTF prevents N506
      glycosylation. Removal of this constraint allows for proICA512
      beta4-strand-induced dimerization, exit from the endoplasmic reticulum,
      O-glycosylation, and RESP18-HD-mediated targeting to granules.

TI  - 2-Deoxyglucose impairs Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth by stimulating
      Snf1-regulated and alpha-arrestin-mediated trafficking of hexose transporters 1
      and 3.
PG  - 939-55
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01183-14 [doi]
AB  - The glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) inhibits the growth of Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae and human tumor cells, but its modes of action have not been fully
      elucidated. Yeast cells lacking Snf1 (AMP-activated protein kinase) are
      hypersensitive to 2DG. Overexpression of either of two low-affinity,
      high-capacity glucose transporters, Hxt1 and Hxt3, suppresses the 2DG
      hypersensitivity of snf1Delta cells. The addition of 2DG or the loss of Snf1
      reduces HXT1 and HXT3 expression levels and stimulates transporter endocytosis
      and degradation in the vacuole. 2DG-stimulated trafficking of Hxt1 and Hxt3
      requires Rod1/Art4 and Rog3/Art7, two members of the alpha-arrestin trafficking
      adaptor family. Mutations in ROD1 and ROG3 that block binding to the ubiquitin
      ligase Rsp5 eliminate Rod1- and Rog3-mediated trafficking of Hxt1 and Hxt3.
      Genetic analysis suggests that Snf1 negatively regulates both Rod1 and Rog3, but 
      via different mechanisms. Snf1 activated by 2DG phosphorylates Rod1 but fails to 
      phosphorylate other known targets, such as the transcriptional repressor Mig1. We
      propose a novel mechanism for 2DG-induced toxicity whereby 2DG stimulates the
      modification of alpha-arrestins, which promote glucose transporter
      internalization and degradation, causing glucose starvation even when cells are
      in a glucose-rich environment.

TI  - Distinct amino acid compositional requirements for formation and maintenance of
      the [PSI(+)] prion in yeast.
PG  - 899-911
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01020-14 [doi]
AB  - Multiple yeast prions have been identified that result from the structural
      conversion of proteins into a self-propagating amyloid form. Amyloid-based prion 
      activity in yeast requires a series of discrete steps. First, the prion protein
      must form an amyloid nucleus that can recruit and structurally convert additional
      soluble proteins. Subsequently, maintenance of the prion during cell division
      requires fragmentation of these aggregates to create new heritable propagons. For
      the Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion protein Sup35, these different activities are 
      encoded by different regions of the Sup35 prion domain. An N-terminal
      glutamine/asparagine-rich nucleation domain is required for nucleation and fiber 
      growth, while an adjacent oligopeptide repeat domain is largely dispensable for
      prion nucleation and fiber growth but is required for chaperone-dependent prion
      maintenance. Although prion activity of glutamine/asparagine-rich proteins is
      predominantly determined by amino acid composition, the nucleation and
      oligopeptide repeat domains of Sup35 have distinct compositional requirements.
      Here, we quantitatively define these compositional requirements in vivo. We show 
      that aromatic residues strongly promote both prion formation and
      chaperone-dependent prion maintenance. In contrast, nonaromatic hydrophobic
      residues strongly promote prion formation but inhibit prion propagation. These
      results provide insight into why some aggregation-prone proteins are unable to
      propagate as prions.

TI  - Retroviral transcriptional regulation and embryonic stem cells: war and peace.
PG  - 770-7
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01293-14 [doi]
AB  - Retroviruses have evolved complex transcriptional enhancers and promoters that
      allow their replication in a wide range of tissue and cell types. Embryonic stem 
      (ES) cells, however, characteristically suppress transcription of proviruses
      formed after infection by exogenous retroviruses and also of most members of the 
      vast array of endogenous retroviruses in the genome. These cells have unusual
      profiles of transcribed genes and are poised to make rapid changes in those
      profiles upon induction of differentiation. Many of the transcription factors in 
      ES cells control both host and retroviral genes coordinately, such that
      retroviral expression patterns can serve as markers of ES cell pluripotency. This
      overlap is not coincidental; retrovirus-derived regulatory sequences are often
      used to control cellular genes important for pluripotency. These sequences
      specify the temporal control and perhaps "noisy" control of cellular genes that
      direct proper cell gene expression in primitive cells and their differentiating
      progeny. The evidence suggests that the viral elements have been domesticated for
      host needs, reflecting the wide-ranging exploitation of any and all available DNA
      sequences in assembling regulatory networks.

TI  - Poly(ADP-ribosyl) glycohydrolase prevents the accumulation of unusual replication
      structures during unperturbed S phase.

AB  - Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) has been implicated in various aspects of the
      cellular response to DNA damage and genome stability. Although 17 human
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) genes have been identified, a single
      poly(ADP-ribosyl) glycohydrolase (PARG) mediates PAR degradation. Here we
      investigated the role of PARG in the replication of human chromosomes. We show
      that PARG depletion affects cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, leading to
      replication-coupled H2AX phosphorylation. Furthermore, PARG depletion or
      inhibition per se slows down individual replication forks similarly to mild
      chemotherapeutic treatment. Electron microscopic analysis of replication
      intermediates reveals marked accumulation of reversed forks and single-stranded
      DNA (ssDNA) gaps in unperturbed PARG-defective cells. Intriguingly, while we
      found no physical evidence for chromosomal breakage, PARG-defective cells
      displayed both ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ataxia-Rad3-related (ATR) 
      activation, as well as chromatin recruitment of standard
      double-strand-break-repair factors, such as 53BP1 and RAD51. Overall, these data 
      prove PAR degradation to be essential to promote resumption of replication at
      endogenous and exogenous lesions, preventing idle recruitment of repair factors
      to remodeled replication forks. Furthermore, they suggest that fork remodeling
      and restarting are surprisingly frequent in unperturbed cells and provide a
      molecular rationale to explore PARG inhibition in cancer chemotherapy.

TI  - Enhanced cardiac Akt/protein kinase B signaling contributes to pathological
      cardiac hypertrophy in part by impairing mitochondrial function via
      transcriptional repression of mitochondrion-targeted nuclear genes.
PG  - 831-46
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01109-14 [doi]
AB  - Sustained Akt activation induces cardiac hypertrophy (LVH), which may lead to
      heart failure. This study tested the hypothesis that Akt activation contributes
      to mitochondrial dysfunction in pathological LVH. Akt activation induced LVH and 
      progressive repression of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathways.
      Preventing LVH by inhibiting mTOR failed to prevent the decline in mitochondrial 
      function, but glucose utilization was maintained. Akt activation represses
      expression of mitochondrial regulatory, FAO, and oxidative phosphorylation genes 
      in vivo that correlate with the duration of Akt activation in part by reducing
      FOXO-mediated transcriptional activation of mitochondrion-targeted nuclear genes 
      in concert with reduced signaling via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      alpha (PPARalpha)/PGC-1alpha and other transcriptional regulators. In cultured
      myocytes, Akt activation disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics, which could be
      partially reversed by maintaining nuclear FOXO but not by increasing PGC-1alpha. 
      Thus, although short-term Akt activation may be cardioprotective during ischemia 
      by reducing mitochondrial metabolism and increasing glycolysis, long-term Akt
      activation in the adult heart contributes to pathological LVH in part by reducing
      mitochondrial oxidative capacity.

PG  - 866-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01489-14 [doi]
AB  - Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) protects normal cells from transformation by
      Ras, whereas cells lacking p14/p19(Arf) or other tumor suppressors can be
      transformed. The transcription factor C/EBPbeta is required for OIS in primary
      fibroblasts but is downregulated by H-Ras(V12) in immortalized NIH 3T3 cells
      through a mechanism involving p19(Arf) loss. Here, we report that members of the 
      serum-induced early growth response (Egr) protein family are also downregulated
      in 3T3(Ras) cells and directly and redundantly control Cebpb gene transcription. 
      Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3 recognize three sites in the Cebpb promoter and associate
      transiently with this region after serum stimulation, coincident with Cebpb
      induction. Codepletion of all three Egrs prevented Cebpb expression, and serum
      induction of Egrs was significantly blunted in 3T3(Ras) cells. Egr2 and Egr3
      levels were also reduced in Ras(V12)-expressing p19(Arf) null mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts (MEFs), and overall Egr DNA-binding activity was suppressed in
      Arf-deficient but not wild-type (WT) MEFs, leading to Cebpb downregulation.
      Analysis of human cancers revealed a strong correlation between EGR levels and
      CEBPB expression, regardless of whether CEBPB was increased or decreased in
      tumors. Moreover, overexpression of Egrs in tumor cell lines induced CEBPB and
      inhibited proliferation. Thus, our findings identify the Arf-Egr-C/EBPbeta axis
      as an important determinant of cellular responses (senescence or transformation) 
      to oncogenic Ras signaling.

TI  - Role of lamin b1 in chromatin instability.
PG  - 884-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01145-14 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear lamins play important roles in the organization and structure of the
      nucleus; however, the specific mechanisms linking lamin structure to nuclear
      functions are poorly defined. We demonstrate that reducing nuclear lamin B1
      expression by short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing in cancer cell lines to
      approximately 50% of normal levels causes a delay in the cell cycle and
      accumulation of cells in early S phase. The S phase delay appears to be due to
      the stalling and collapse of replication forks. The double-strand DNA breaks
      resulting from replication fork collapse were inefficiently repaired, causing
      persistent DNA damage signaling and the assembly of extensive repair foci on
      chromatin. The expression of multiple factors involved in DNA replication and
      repair by both nonhomologous end joining and homologous repair is misregulated
      when lamin B1 levels are reduced. We further demonstrate that lamin B1 interacts 
      directly with the promoters of some genes associated with DNA damage response and
      repair, including BRCA1 and RAD51. Taken together, the results suggest that the
      maintenance of lamin B1 levels is required for DNA replication and repair through
      regulation of the expression of key factors involved in these essential nuclear
      functions.

TI  - Antagonistic controls of chromatin and mRNA start site selection by Tup family
      corepressors and the CCAAT-binding factor.

AB  - The Tup family corepressors contribute to critical cellular responses, such as
      the stress response and differentiation, presumably by inducing repressive
      chromatin, though the precise repression mechanism remains to be elucidated. The 
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe fission yeast Tup family corepressors Tup11 and Tup12
      (Tup11/12), which are orthologs of Tup1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae budding yeast
      and Groucho in Drosophila, negatively control chromatin and the transcriptional
      activity of some stress-responsive genes. Here, we demonstrate that Tup11/12
      repress transcription of a gluconeogenesis gene, fbp1(+), by three distinct
      mechanisms. First, Tup11/12 inhibit chromatin remodeling in the fbp1(+) promoter 
      region where the Atf1 and Rst2 transcriptional activators bind. Second, they
      repress the formation of an open chromatin configuration at the fbp1(+) TATA box.
      Third, they repress mRNA transcription per se by regulating basic transcription
      factors. These inhibitory actions of Tup11/12 are antagonized by three different 
      types of transcriptional activators: CREB/ATF-type Atf1, C(2)H(2)zinc finger-type
      Rst2, and CBF/NF-Y-type Php5 proteins. We also found that impaired chromatin
      remodeling and fbp1(+) mRNA transcription in php5Delta strains are rescued by the
      double deletions of tup11(+) and tup12(+), although the distribution of the
      transcription start sites becomes broader than that in wild-type cells. These
      data reveal a new mechanism of precise determination of the mRNA start site by
      Tup family corepressors and CBF/NF-Y proteins.

TI  - Progenitor stage-specific activity of a cis-acting double GATA motif for Gata1
      gene expression.
PG  - 805-15
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01011-14 [doi]
AB  - GATA1 is a master regulator of erythropoiesis, expression of which is regulated
      by multiple discrete cis-acting elements. In this study, we examine the activity 
      of a promoter-proximal double GATA (dbGATA) motif, using a Gata1 bacterial
      artificial chromosome (BAC)-transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter
      (G1BAC-GFP) mouse system. Deletion of the dbGATA motif led to significant
      reductions in GFP expression in hematopoietic progenitors, while GFP expression
      was maintained in erythroblasts. Consistently, in mice with a germ line deletion 
      of the dbGATA motif (Gata1(DeltadbGATA) mice), GATA1 expression in progenitors
      was significantly decreased. The suppressed GATA1 expression was associated with 
      a compensatory increase in GATA2 levels in progenitors. When we crossed
      Gata1(DeltadbGATA) mice with Gata2 hypomorphic mutant mice (Gata2(fGN/fGN) mice),
      the Gata1(DeltadbGATA)::Gata2(fGN/fGN) compound mutant mice succumbed to a
      significant decrease in the progenitor population, whereas both groups of single 
      mutant mice maintained progenitors and survived to adulthood, indicating the
      functional redundancy between GATA1 and GATA2 in progenitors. Meanwhile, the
      effects of the dbGATA site deletion on Gata1 expression were subtle in
      erythroblasts, which showed increased GATA1 binding and enhanced accumulation of 
      active histone marks around the 1st-intron GATA motif of the DeltadbGATA locus.
      These results thus reveal a novel role of the dbGATA motif in the maintenance of 
      Gata1 expression in hematopoietic progenitors and a functional compensation
      between the dbGATA site and the 1st-intron GATA motif in erythroblasts.

TI  - DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp4 is required for small-subunit processome formation and
      function.
PG  - 816-30
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01348-14 [doi]
AB  - DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp4 is required for 18S rRNA synthesis: cellular depletion
      of Dbp4 impairs the early cleavage reactions of the pre-rRNA and causes U14 small
      nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) to remain associated with pre-rRNA. Immunoprecipitation
      experiments (IPs) carried out with whole-cell extracts (WCEs) revealed that
      hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Dbp4 is associated with U3 snoRNA but not with U14
      snoRNA. IPs with WCEs also showed association with the U3-specific protein Mpp10,
      which suggests that Dbp4 interacts with the functionally active U3 RNP; this
      particle, called the small-subunit (SSU) processome, can be observed at the 5'
      end of nascent pre-rRNA. Electron microscopy analyses indicated that depletion of
      Dbp4 compromised SSU processome formation and cotranscriptional cleavage of the
      pre-rRNA. Sucrose density gradient analyses revealed that depletion of U3 snoRNA 
      or the Mpp10 protein inhibited the release of U14 snoRNA from pre-rRNA, just as
      was seen with Dbp4-depleted cells, indicating that alteration of SSU processome
      components has significant consequences for U14 snoRNA dynamics. We also found
      that the C-terminal extension flanking the catalytic core of Dbp4 plays an
      important role in the release of U14 snoRNA from pre-rRNA.

TI  - Stabilization of ATF5 by TAK1-Nemo-like kinase critically regulates the
      interleukin-1beta-stimulated C/EBP signaling pathway.
PG  - 778-88
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01228-14 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a key proinflammatory cytokine that initiates
      several signaling cascades, including those involving CCAAT/enhancer binding
      proteins (C/EBPs). The mechanism by which IL-1beta propagates a signal that
      activates C/EBP has remained elusive. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-like kinase associated with many pathways
      and phenotypes that are not yet well understood. Using a luciferase reporter
      screen, we found that IL-1beta-induced C/EBP activation was positively regulated 
      by NLK. Overexpression of NLK activated C/EBP and potentiated IL-1beta-triggered 
      C/EBP activation, whereas knockdown or knockout of NLK had the opposite effect.
      NLK interacted with activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) and inhibited the
      proteasome-dependent degradation of ATF5 in a kinase-independent manner.
      Consistently, NLK deficiency resulted in decreased levels of ATF5. NLK cooperated
      with ATF5 to activate C/EBP, whereas NLK could not activate C/EBP upon knockdown 
      of ATF5. Moreover, TAK1, a downstream effector of IL-1beta that acts upstream of 
      NLK, mimicked the ability of NLK to stabilize ATF5 and activate C/EBP. Thus, our 
      findings reveal the TAK1-NLK pathway as a novel regulator of basal or
      IL-1beta-triggered C/EBP activation though stabilization of ATF5.

TI  - A zebrafish model of myelodysplastic syndrome produced through tet2 genomic
      editing.
PG  - 789-804
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00971-14 [doi]
AB  - The ten-eleven translocation 2 gene (TET2) encodes a member of the TET family of 
      DNA methylcytosine oxidases that converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) to initiate the demethylation of DNA within
      genomic CpG islands. Somatic loss-of-function mutations of TET2 are frequently
      observed in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a clonal malignancy
      characterized by dysplastic changes of developing blood cell progenitors, leading
      to ineffective hematopoiesis. We used genome-editing technology to disrupt the
      zebrafish Tet2 catalytic domain. tet2(m/m) (homozygous for the mutation)
      zebrafish exhibited normal embryonic and larval hematopoiesis but developed
      progressive clonal myelodysplasia as they aged, culminating in myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDS) at 24 months of age, with dysplasia of myeloid progenitor cells
      and anemia with abnormal circulating erythrocytes. The resultant tet2(m/m) mutant
      zebrafish lines show decreased levels of 5hmC in hematopoietic cells of the
      kidney marrow but not in other cell types, most likely reflecting the ability of 
      other Tet family members to provide this enzymatic activity in nonhematopoietic
      tissues but not in hematopoietic cells. tet2(m/m) zebrafish are viable and
      fertile, providing an ideal model to dissect altered pathways in hematopoietic
      cells and, for small-molecule screens in embryos, to identify compounds with
      specific activity against tet2 mutant cells.

TI  - A posttranscriptional mechanism that controls Ptbp1 abundance in the Xenopus
      epidermis.
PG  - 758-68
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01040-14 [doi]
AB  - The output of alternative splicing depends on the cooperative or antagonistic
      activities of several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), like Ptbp1 and Esrp1 in
      Xenopus. Fine-tuning of the RBP abundance is therefore of prime importance to
      achieve tissue- or cell-specific splicing patterns. Here, we addressed the
      mechanisms leading to the high expression of the ptbp1 gene, which encodes Ptbp1,
      in Xenopus epidermis. Two splice isoforms of ptbp1 mRNA differ by the presence of
      an alternative exon 11, and only the isoform including exon 11 can be translated 
      to a full-length protein. In vivo minigene assays revealed that the nonproductive
      isoform was predominantly produced. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that
      Esrp1, which is specific to the epidermis, strongly stimulated the expression of 
      ptbp1 by favoring the productive isoform. Consequently, knocking down esrp1
      phenocopied ptbp1 inactivation. Conversely, Ptbp1 repressed the expression of its
      own gene by favoring the nonproductive isoform. Hence, a complex
      posttranscriptional mechanism controls Ptbp1 abundance in Xenopus epidermis:
      skipping of exon 11 is the default splicing pattern, but Esrp1 stimulates ptbp1
      expression by favoring the inclusion of exon 11 up to a level that is limited by 
      Ptbp1 itself. These results decipher a posttranscriptional mechanism that
      achieves various abundances of the ubiquitous RBP Ptbp1 in different tissues.

TI  - Glycolysis controls plasma membrane glucose sensors to promote glucose signaling 
      in yeasts.
PG  - 747-57
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00515-14 [doi]
AB  - Sensing of extracellular glucose is necessary for cells to adapt to glucose
      variation in their environment. In the respiratory yeast Kluyveromyces lactis,
      extracellular glucose controls the expression of major glucose permease gene RAG1
      through a cascade similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf3/Rgt2/Rgt1 glucose 
      signaling pathway. This regulation depends also on intracellular glucose
      metabolism since we previously showed that glucose induction of the RAG1 gene is 
      abolished in glycolytic mutants. Here we show that glycolysis regulates RAG1
      expression through the K. lactis Rgt1 (KlRgt1) glucose signaling pathway by
      targeting the localization and probably the stability of Rag4, the single
      Snf3/Rgt2-type glucose sensor of K. lactis. Additionally, the control exerted by 
      glycolysis on glucose signaling seems to be conserved in S. cerevisiae. This
      retrocontrol might prevent yeasts from unnecessary glucose transport and
      intracellular glucose accumulation.

TI  - TORC1 inhibition induces lipid droplet replenishment in yeast.
PG  - 737-46
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01314-14 [doi]
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are intracellular structures that regulate neutral lipid
      homeostasis. In mammals, LD synthesis is inhibited by rapamycin, a known
      inhibitor of the mTORC1 pathway. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, LD dynamics are
      modulated by the growth phase; however, the regulatory pathways involved are
      unknown. Therefore, we decided to study the role of the TORC1 pathway on LD
      metabolism in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, rapamycin treatment resulted in a
      fast LD replenishment and growth inhibition. The discovery that osmotic stress (1
      M sorbitol) also induced LD synthesis but not growth inhibition suggested that
      the induction of LDs in yeast is not a secondary response to reduced growth. The 
      induction of LDs by rapamycin was due to increased triacylglycerol but not sterol
      ester synthesis. Induction was dependent on the TOR downstream effectors, the
      PP2A-related phosphatase Sit4p and the regulatory protein Tap42p. The
      TORC1-controlled transcriptional activators Gln3p, Gat1p, Rtg1p, and Rtg3p, but
      not Msn2p and Msn4p, were required for full induction of LDs by rapamycin.
      Furthermore, we show that the deletion of Gln3p and Gat1p transcription factors, 
      which are activated in response to nitrogen availability, led to abnormal LD
      dynamics. These results reveal that the TORC1 pathway is involved in neutral
      lipid homeostasis in yeast.

TI  - Spatiotemporal cascade of transcription factor binding required for promoter
      activation.
PG  - 688-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01285-14 [doi]
AB  - Promoters often contain multiple binding sites for a single factor. The yeast HO 
      gene contains nine highly conserved binding sites for the SCB (Swi4/6-dependent
      cell cycle box) binding factor (SBF) complex (composed of Swi4 and Swi6) in the
      700-bp upstream regulatory sequence 2 (URS2) promoter region. Here, we show that 
      the distal and proximal SBF sites in URS2 function differently. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments show that SBF binds preferentially to the 
      left side of URS2 (URS2-L), despite equivalent binding to the left-half and
      right-half SBF sites in vitro. SBF binding at URS2-L sites depends on prior
      chromatin remodeling events at the upstream URS1 region. These signals from URS1 
      influence chromatin changes at URS2 but only at sites within a defined distance. 
      SBF bound at URS2-L, however, is unable to activate transcription but instead
      facilitates SBF binding to sites in the right half (URS2-R), which are required
      for transcriptional activation. Factor binding at HO, therefore, follows a
      temporal cascade, with SBF bound at URS2-L serving to relay a signal from URS1 to
      the SBF sites in URS2-R that ultimately activate gene expression. Taken together,
      we describe a novel property of a transcription factor that can have two distinct
      roles in gene activation, depending on its location within a promoter.

TI  - Promoter occupancy of STAT1 in interferon responses is regulated by processive
      transcription.
PG  - 716-27
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01097-14 [doi]
AB  - Interferons regulate immunity by inducing DNA binding of the transcription factor
      STAT1 through Y701 phosphorylation. Transcription by STAT1 needs to be restricted
      to minimize the adverse effects of prolonged immune responses. It remains unclear
      how STAT1 inactivation is regulated such that the transcription output is
      adequate. Here we show that efficient STAT1 inactivation in macrophages is
      coupled with processive transcription. Ongoing transcription feeds back to reduce
      the promoter occupancy of STAT1 and, consequently, the transcriptional output.
      Once released from the promoter, STAT1 is ultimately inactivated by Y701
      dephosphorylation. We observe similar regulation for STAT2 and STAT3, suggesting 
      a conserved inactivation mechanism among STATs. These findings reveal that STAT1 
      promoter occupancy in macrophages is regulated such that it decreases only after 
      initiation of the transcription cycle. This feedback control ensures the fidelity
      of cytokine responses and provides options for pharmacological intervention.

TI  - Transcriptional expression of myelin basic protein in oligodendrocytes depends on
      functional syntaxin 4: a potential correlation with autocrine signaling.
PG  - 675-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01389-14 [doi]
AB  - Myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes is essential for saltatory nerve
      conduction. To form myelin membranes, a coordinated synthesis and subsequent
      polarized transport of myelin components are necessary. Here, we show that as
      part of the mechanism to establish membrane polarity, oligodendrocytes exploit a 
      polarized distribution of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor
      attachment protein receptor (SNARE) machinery components syntaxins 3 and 4,
      localizing to the cell body and the myelin membrane, respectively. Our data
      further reveal that the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), a
      myelin-specific protein that is synthesized "on site" after transport of its
      mRNA, depends on the correct functioning of the SNARE machinery, which is not
      required for mRNA granule assembly and transport per se. Thus, downregulation and
      overexpression of syntaxin 4 but not syntaxin 3 in oligodendrocyte progenitor
      cells but not immature oligodendrocytes impeded MBP mRNA transcription, thereby
      preventing MBP protein synthesis. The expression and localization of another
      myelin-specific protein, proteolipid protein (PLP), was unaltered. Strikingly,
      conditioned medium obtained from developing oligodendrocytes was able to rescue
      the block of MBP mRNA transcription in syntaxin 4-downregulated cells. These
      findings indicate that the initiation of the biosynthesis of MBP mRNA relies on a
      syntaxin 4-dependent mechanism, which likely involves activation of an autocrine 
      signaling pathway.

TI  - Novel long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in myogenesis: a miR-31 overlapping lncRNA
      transcript controls myoblast differentiation.
PG  - 728-36
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01394-14 [doi]
AB  - Transcriptome analysis allowed the identification of new long noncoding RNAs
      differentially expressed during murine myoblast differentiation. These
      transcripts were classified on the basis of their expression under proliferating 
      versus differentiated conditions, muscle-restricted activation, and subcellular
      localization. Several species displayed preferential expression in dystrophic
      (mdx) versus wild-type muscles, indicating their possible link with regenerative 
      processes. One of the identified transcripts, lnc-31, even if originating from
      the same nuclear precursor of miR-31, is produced by a pathway mutually
      exclusive. We show that lnc-31 and its human homologue hsa-lnc-31 are expressed
      in proliferating myoblasts, where they counteract differentiation. In line with
      this, both species are more abundant in mdx muscles and in human Duchenne
      muscular dystrophy (DMD) myoblasts, than in their normal counterparts.
      Altogether, these data suggest a crucial role for lnc-31 in controlling the
      differentiation commitment of precursor myoblasts and indicate that its function 
      is maintained in evolution despite the poor sequence conservation with the human 
      counterpart.

TI  - Both high-fidelity replicative and low-fidelity Y-family polymerases are involved
      in DNA rereplication.
PG  - 699-715
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01153-14 [doi]
AB  - DNA rereplication is a major form of aberrant replication that causes genomic
      instabilities, such as gene amplification. However, little is known about which
      DNA polymerases are involved in the process. Here, we report that low-fidelity
      Y-family polymerases (Y-Pols), Pol eta, Pol iota, Pol kappa, and REV1,
      significantly contribute to DNA synthesis during rereplication, while the
      replicative polymerases, Pol delta and Pol epsilon, play an important role in
      rereplication, as expected. When rereplication was induced by depletion of
      geminin, these polymerases were recruited to rereplication sites in human cell
      lines. This finding was supported by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown
      of the polymerases, which suppressed rereplication induced by geminin depletion. 
      Interestingly, epistatic analysis indicated that Y-Pols collaborate in a common
      pathway, independently of replicative polymerases. We also provide evidence for a
      catalytic role for Pol eta and the involvement of Pol eta and Pol kappa in cyclin
      E-induced rereplication. Collectively, our findings indicate that, unlike normal 
      S-phase replication, rereplication induced by geminin depletion and oncogene
      activation requires significant contributions of both Y-Pols and replicative
      polymerases. These findings offer important mechanistic insights into cancer
      genomic instability.

TI  - MyoR modulates cardiac conduction by repressing Gata4.
PG  - 649-61
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00860-14 [doi]
AB  - The cardiac conduction system coordinates electrical activation through a series 
      of interconnected structures, including the atrioventricular node (AVN), the
      central connection point that delays impulse propagation to optimize cardiac
      performance. Although recent studies have uncovered important molecular details
      of AVN formation, relatively little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms
      that regulate AV delay, the primary function of the mature AVN. We identify here 
      MyoR as a novel transcription factor expressed in Cx30.2(+) cells of the AVN. We 
      show that MyoR specifically inhibits a Cx30.2 enhancer required for AVN-specific 
      gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MyoR interacts directly with
      Gata4 to mediate transcriptional repression. Our studies reveal that MyoR
      contains two nonequivalent repression domains. While the MyoR C-terminal
      repression domain inhibits transcription in a context-dependent manner, the
      N-terminal repression domain can function in a heterologous context to convert
      the Hand2 activator into a repressor. In addition, we show that genetic deletion 
      of MyoR in mice increases Cx30.2 expression by 50% and prolongs AV delay by 13%. 
      Taken together, we conclude that MyoR modulates a Gata4-dependent regulatory
      circuit that establishes proper AV delay, and these findings may have wider
      implications for the variability of cardiac rhythm observed in the general
      population.

AB  - Heterochromatin underpins gene repression, genome integrity, and chromosome
      segregation. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, conserved protein
      complexes effect heterochromatin formation via RNA interference-mediated
      recruitment of a histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase to cognate chromatin
      regions. To identify small molecules that inhibit heterochromatin formation, we
      performed an in vivo screen for loss of silencing of a dominant selectable kanMX 
      reporter gene embedded within fission yeast centromeric heterochromatin. Two
      structurally unrelated compounds, HMS-I1 and HMS-I2, alleviated kanMX silencing
      and decreased repressive H3K9 methylation levels at the transgene. The decrease
      in methylation caused by HMS-I1 and HMS-I2 was observed at all loci regulated by 
      histone methylation, including centromeric repeats, telomeric regions, and the
      mating-type locus, consistent with inhibition of the histone deacetylases (HDACs)
      Clr3 and/or Sir2. Chemical-genetic epistasis and expression profiles revealed
      that both compounds affect the activity of the Clr3-containing Snf2/HDAC
      repressor complex (SHREC). In vitro HDAC assays revealed that HMS-I1 and HMS-I2
      inhibit Clr3 HDAC activity. HMS-I1 also alleviated transgene reporter silencing
      by heterochromatin in Arabidopsis and a mouse cell line, suggesting a conserved
      mechanism of action. HMS-I1 and HMS-I2 bear no resemblance to known inhibitors of
      chromatin-based activities and thus represent novel chemical probes for
      heterochromatin formation and function.

TI  - Shugoshins: tension-sensitive pericentromeric adaptors safeguarding chromosome
      segregation.
PG  - 634-48
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01176-14 [doi]
AB  - The shugoshin/Mei-S332 family are proteins that associate with the chromosomal
      region surrounding the centromere (the pericentromere) and that play multiple and
      distinct roles in ensuring the accuracy of chromosome segregation during both
      mitosis and meiosis. The underlying role of shugoshins appears to be to serve as 
      pericentromeric adaptor proteins that recruit several different effectors to this
      region of the chromosome to regulate processes critical for chromosome
      segregation. Crucially, shugoshins undergo changes in their localization in
      response to the tension that is exerted on sister chromosomes by the forces of
      the spindle that will pull them apart. This has led to the idea that shugoshins
      provide a platform for activities required at the pericentromere only when sister
      chromosomes lack tension. Conversely, disassembly of the shugoshin
      pericentromeric platform may provide a signal that sister chromosomes are under
      tension. Here the functions and regulation of these important tension-sensitive
      pericentromeric proteins are discussed.

TI  - Inactivation of tristetraprolin in chronic hypoxia provokes the expression of
      cathepsin B.
PG  - 619-30
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01034-14 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages play important roles in many diseases and are frequently found in
      hypoxic areas. A chronic hypoxic microenvironment alters global cellular protein 
      expression, but molecular details remain poorly understood. Although
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is an established transcription factor allowing
      adaption to acute hypoxia, responses to chronic hypoxia are more complex. Based
      on a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) approach, we
      aimed to identify proteins that are exclusively expressed under chronic but not
      acute hypoxia (1% O2). One of the identified proteins was cathepsin B (CTSB), and
      a knockdown of either HIF-1alpha or -2alpha in primary human macrophages pointed 
      to an HIF-2alpha dependency. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
      experiments confirmed HIF-2 binding to a CTSB enhancer in acute hypoxia, an
      increase of CTSB mRNA was evident only under chronic hypoxia. Along those lines, 
      CTSB mRNA stability increased at 48 h but not at 8 h of hypoxia. However, RNA
      stability at 8 h of hypoxia was enhanced by a knockdown of tristetraprolin (TTP).
      Inactivation of TTP under prolonged hypoxia was facilitated by c-Jun N-terminal
      kinase (JNK), and inhibition of this kinase lowered CTSB mRNA levels and
      stability. We postulate a TTP-dependent mechanism to explain delayed expression
      of CTSB under chronic hypoxia.

TI  - The calcineurin-NFAT axis controls allograft immunity in myeloid-derived
      suppressor cells through reprogramming T cell differentiation.
PG  - 598-609
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01251-14 [doi]
AB  - While cyclosporine (CsA) inhibits calcineurin and is highly effective in
      prolonging rejection for transplantation patients, the immunological mechanisms
      remain unknown. Herein, the role of calcineurin signaling was investigated in a
      mouse allogeneic skin transplantation model. The calcineurin inhibitor CsA
      significantly ameliorated allograft rejection. In CsA-treated allograft recipient
      mice, CD11b(+) Gr1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were functional
      suppressive immune modulators that resulted in fewer gamma interferon
      (IFN-gamma)-producing CD8(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells (T(H)1 T helper cells)
      and more interleukin 4 (IL-4)-producing CD4(+) T cells (T(H2)) and prolonged
      allogeneic skin graft survival. Importantly, the expression of NFATc1 is
      significantly diminished in the CsA-induced MDSCs. Blocking NFAT (nuclear factor 
      of activated T cells) with VIVIT phenocopied the CsA effects in MDSCs and
      increased the suppressive activities and recruitment of CD11b(+) Gr1(+) MDSCs in 
      allograft recipient mice. Mechanistically, CsA treatment enhanced the expression 
      of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and the suppressive activities of MDSCs in
      allograft recipients. Inhibition of IDO nearly completely recovered the increased
      MDSC suppressive activities and the effects on T cell differentiation. The
      results of this study indicate that MDSCs are an essential component in
      controlling allograft survival following CsA or VIVIT treatment, validating the
      calcineurin-NFAT-IDO signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target in
      transplantation.

TI  - CPEB regulation of TAK1 synthesis mediates cytokine production and the
      inflammatory immune response.
PG  - 610-8
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00800-14 [doi]
AB  - The cytoplasmic-element-binding (CPEB) protein is a sequence-specific RNA-binding
      protein that regulates cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation. In mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking CPEB, many mRNAs encoding proteins involved in 
      inflammation are misregulated. Correlated with this aberrant translation in MEFs,
      a macrophage cell line depleted of CPEB and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      to stimulate the inflammatory immune response expresses high levels of
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is due to prolonged nuclear retention of NF-kappaB.
      Two proteins involved in NF-kappaB nuclear localization and IL-6 expression,
      IkappaBalpha and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), are
      present at excessively low and high steady-state levels, respectively, in
      LPS-treated CPEB-depleted macrophages. However, only TAK1 has an altered
      synthesis rate that is CPEB dependent and CPEB/TAK1 double depletion alleviates
      high IL-6 production. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from CPEB knockout (KO)
      mice treated with LPS in vitro also have prolonged NF-kappaB nuclear retention
      and produce high IL-6 levels. LPS-injected CPEB KO mice secrete prodigious
      amounts of IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines and exhibit hypersensitivity 
      to endotoxic shock; these effects are mitigated when the animals are also
      injected with (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol, a potent and specific inhibitor of TAK1. These
      data show that CPEB control of TAK1 mRNA translation mediates the inflammatory
      immune response.

TI  - Nedd8 regulates inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 activation.
PG  - 582-97
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00775-14 [doi]
AB  - Caspase-1 is activated by the inflammasome complex to process cytokines like
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Pro-caspase-1 consists of three domains, CARD, p20,
      and p10. Association of pro-caspase-1 with the inflammasome results in initiation
      of its autocatalytic activity, culminating in self-cleavage that generates
      catalytically active subunits (p10 and p20). In the current study, we show that
      Nedd8 is required for efficient self-cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to generate its
      catalytically active subunits. Nedd8 silencing or treating cells with the
      neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 led to diminished caspase-1 processing and reduced 
      IL-1beta maturation following inflammasome activation. Coimmunoprecipitation and 
      mass spectrometric analysis of 293 cells overexpressing pro-caspase-1 (and CARD) 
      and Nedd8 suggested possible neddylation of caspase-1 CARD. Following
      inflammasome activation in primary macrophages, we observed colocalization of
      endogenous Nedd8 with caspase-1. Similarly, interaction of endogenous Nedd8 with 
      caspase-1 CARD was detected in inflammasome-activated macrophages. Furthermore,
      enhanced autocatalytic activity of pro-caspase-1 was observed following Nedd8
      overexpression in 293 cells, and such activity in inflammasome-activated
      macrophages was drastically diminished upon treatment of cells with MLN4924.
      Thus, our studies demonstrate a role of Nedd8 in regulating caspase-1 activation 
      following inflammasome activation, presumably via augmenting
      autoprocessing/cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its corresponding catalytically
      active subunits.

TI  - Disruption of the ran system by cysteine oxidation of the nucleotide exchange
      factor RCC1.
PG  - 566-81
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01133-14 [doi]
AB  - Transport regulation by the Ran GTPase requires its nuclear localization and GTP 
      loading by the chromatin-associated exchange factor RCC1. These reactions
      generate Ran protein and Ran nucleotide gradients between the nucleus and the
      cytoplasm. Cellular stress disrupts the Ran gradients, but the specific
      mechanisms underlying this disruption have not been elucidated. We used
      biochemical approaches to determine how oxidative stress disrupts the Ran system.
      RCC1 exchange activity was reduced by diamide-induced oxidative stress and
      restored with dithiothreitol. Using mass spectrometry, we found that multiple
      solvent-exposed cysteines in RCC1 are oxidized in cells treated with diamide. The
      cysteines oxidized in RCC1 included Cys93, which is solvent exposed and unique
      because it becomes buried upon contact with Ran. A Cys93Ser substitution
      dramatically reduced exchange activity through an effect on RCC1 binding to
      RanGDP. Diamide treatment reduced the size of the mobile fraction of RCC1-green
      fluorescent protein in cells and inhibited nuclear import in
      digitonin-permeabilized cell assays. The Ran protein gradient was also disrupted 
      by UV-induced stress but without affecting RCC1 exchange activity. Our data
      suggest that stress can disrupt the Ran gradients through RCC1-dependent and
      RCC1-independent mechanisms, possibly dependent on the particular stress
      condition.

TI  - NCoR1 and SMRT play unique roles in thyroid hormone action in vivo.
PG  - 555-65
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01208-14 [doi]
AB  - NCoR1 (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and
      thyroid hormone receptors; NCoR2) are well-recognized coregulators of nuclear
      receptor (NR) action. However, their unique roles in the regulation of thyroid
      hormone (TH) signaling in specific cell types have not been determined. To
      accomplish this we generated mice that lacked function of either NCoR1, SMRT, or 
      both in the liver only and additionally a global SMRT knockout model. Despite
      both corepressors being present in the liver, deletion of SMRT in either
      euthyroid or hypothyroid animals had little effect on TH signaling. In contrast, 
      disruption of NCoR1 action confirmed that NCoR1 is the principal mediator of TH
      sensitivity in vivo. Similarly, global disruption of SMRT, unlike the global
      disruption of NCoR1, did not affect TH levels. While SMRT played little role in
      TH-regulated pathways, when disrupted in combination with NCoR1, it greatly
      accentuated the synthesis and storage of hepatic lipid. Taken together, these
      data demonstrate that corepressor specificity exists in vivo and that NCoR1 is
      the principal regulator of TH action. However, both corepressors collaborate to
      control hepatic lipid content, which likely reflects their cooperative activity
      in regulating the action of multiple NRs including the TH receptor (TR).

TI  - A sequence-specific interaction between the Saccharomyces cerevisiae rRNA gene
      repeats and a locus encoding an RNA polymerase I subunit affects ribosomal DNA
      stability.
PG  - 544-54
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01249-14 [doi]
AB  - The spatial organization of eukaryotic genomes is linked to their functions.
      However, how individual features of the global spatial structure contribute to
      nuclear function remains largely unknown. We previously identified a
      high-frequency interchromosomal interaction within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      genome that occurs between the intergenic spacer of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
      repeats and the intergenic sequence between the locus encoding the second largest
      RNA polymerase I subunit and a lysine tRNA gene [i.e., RPA135-tK(CUU)P]. Here, we
      used quantitative chromosome conformation capture in combination with replacement
      mapping to identify a 75-bp sequence within the RPA135-tK(CUU)P intergenic region
      that is involved in the interaction. We demonstrate that the RPA135-IGS1
      interaction is dependent on the rDNA copy number and the Msn2 protein.
      Surprisingly, we found that the interaction does not govern RPA135 transcription.
      Instead, replacement of a 605-bp region within the RPA135-tK(CUU)P intergenic
      region results in a reduction in the RPA135-IGS1 interaction level and
      fluctuations in rDNA copy number. We conclude that the chromosomal interaction
      that occurs between the RPA135-tK(CUU)P and rDNA IGS1 loci stabilizes rDNA repeat
      number and contributes to the maintenance of nucleolar stability. Our results
      provide evidence that the DNA loci involved in chromosomal interactions are
      composite elements, sections of which function in stabilizing the interaction or 
      mediating a functional outcome.

TI  - MUNC, a long noncoding RNA that facilitates the function of MyoD in skeletal
      myogenesis.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.01079-14 [doi]
AB  - An in silico screen for myogenic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) revealed nine
      lncRNAs that are upregulated more than 10-fold in myotubes versus levels in
      myoblasts. One of these lncRNAs, MyoD upstream noncoding (MUNC, also known as
      DRR(eRNA)), is encoded 5 kb upstream of the transcription start site of MyoD, a
      myogenic transcription factor gene. MUNC is specifically expressed in skeletal
      muscle and exists as in unspliced and spliced isoforms, and its 5' end overlaps
      with the cis-acting distal regulatory region (DRR) of MyoD. Small interfering RNA
      (siRNA) of MUNC reduced myoblast differentiation and specifically reduced the
      association of MyoD to the DRR enhancer and myogenin promoter but not to another 
      MyoD-dependent enhancer. Stable overexpression of MUNC from a heterologous
      promoter increased endogenous MyoD, Myogenin, and Myh3 (myosin heavy chain, [MHC]
      gene) mRNAs but not the cognate proteins, suggesting that MUNC can act in trans
      to promote gene expression but that this activity does not require an induction
      of MyoD protein. MUNC also stimulates the transcription of other genes that are
      not recognized as MyoD-inducible genes. Knockdown of MUNC in vivo impaired murine
      muscle regeneration, implicating MUNC in primary satellite cell differentiation
      in the animal. We also discovered a human MUNC that is induced during
      differentiation of myoblasts and whose knockdown decreases differentiation,
      suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of MUNC lncRNA in myogenesis.
      Although MUNC overlaps with the DRR enhancer, our results suggest that MUNC is
      not a classic cis-acting enhancer RNA (e-RNA) acting exclusively by stimulating
      the neighboring MyoD gene but more like a promyogenic lncRNA that acts directly
      or indirectly on multiple promoters to increase myogenic gene expression.

TI  - Insertion of an imprinted insulator into the IgH locus reveals developmentally
      regulated, transcription-dependent control of V(D)J recombination.
PG  - 529-43
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00235-14 [doi]
AB  - The assembly of antigen receptor loci requires a developmentally regulated and
      lineage-specific recombination between variable (V), diversity (D), and joining
      (J) segments through V(D)J recombination. The process is regulated by
      accessibility control elements, including promoters, insulators, and enhancers.
      The IgH locus undergoes two recombination steps, D-J(H) and then V(H)-DJ(H), but 
      it is unclear how the availability of the DJ(H) substrate could influence the
      subsequent V(H)-DJ(H) recombination step. The Emu enhancer plays a critical role 
      in V(D)J recombination and controls a set of sense and antisense transcripts. We 
      epigenetically perturbed the early events at the IgH locus by inserting the
      imprinting control region (ICR) of the Igf2/H19 locus or a transcriptional
      insulator devoid of the imprinting function upstream of the Emu enhancer. The
      insertions recapitulated the main epigenetic features of their endogenous
      counterparts, including differential DNA methylation and binding of
      CTCF/cohesins. Whereas the D-J(H) recombination step was unaffected, both the
      insulator insertions led to a severe impairment of V(H)-DJ(H) recombination.
      Strikingly, the inhibition of V(H)-DJ(H) recombination correlated consistently
      with a strong reduction of DJ(H) transcription and incomplete demethylation.
      Thus, developmentally regulated transcription following D-J(H) recombination
      emerges as an important mechanism through which the Emu enhancer controls
      V(H)-DJ(H) recombination.

TI  - MicroRNA 648 Targets ET-1 mRNA and is cotranscriptionally regulated with MICAL3
      by PAX5.
PG  - 514-28
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01199-14 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is associated with high mortality in sickle cell
      anemia (SCA). Previously, we showed that elevated levels of placenta growth
      factor (PlGF) in SCA patients correlate with increased levels of the potent
      vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) and PHT. Moreover, PlGF induced the
      expression of ET-1 via hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha. Here, we show a novel
      example of ET-1 posttranscriptional regulation by PlGF via action of microRNA 648
      (miR-648), which is subject to transcriptional coregulation with its host gene,
      MICAL3 (microtubule-associated monooxygenase, calponin, and LIM domain containing
      3gene). PlGF repressed expression of miR-648 in endothelial cells. Luciferase
      reporter assays using wild-type and mutant ET-1 3' untranslated region (UTR)
      constructs, and transfection of miR-648 mimics showed that miR-648 targets the 3'
      UTR of ET-1 mRNA. Since miR-648 is located in a 5'-proximal intron of MICAL3, we 
      examined which of three potential promoters was responsible for its expression.
      The MICAL3 distal promoter (P1) was the predominant promoter used for
      transcription of pre-miR-648, and it was under positive control by PAX5 (paired
      box protein 5) transcription factor, as demonstrated by the loss and gain of
      function of PAX5 activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. These
      studies provide a novel link wherein PlGF-mediated downregulation of PAX5
      attenuates miR-648 expression leading to increased ET-1 levels that are known to 
      induce PHT in SCA.

TI  - Heat stress-induced Cup9-dependent transcriptional regulation of SIR2.
PG  - 437-50
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01046-14 [doi]
AB  - The epigenetic writer Sir2 maintains the heterochromatin state of chromosome in
      three chromosomal regions, namely, the silent mating type loci, telomeres, and
      the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In this study, we demonstrated the mechanism by which
      Sir2 is regulated under heat stress. Our study reveals that a transient heat
      shock causes a drastic reduction in the SIR2 transcript which results in
      sustained failure to initiate silencing for as long as 90 generations. Hsp82
      overexpression, which is the usual outcome of heat shock treatment, leads to a
      similar downregulation of SIR2 transcription. Using a series of genetic
      experiments, we have established that heat shock or Hsp82 overexpression causes
      upregulation of CUP9 that, in turn, represses SIR2 transcription by binding to
      its upstream activator sequence. We have mapped the cis regulatory element of
      SIR2. Our study shows that the deletion of cup9 causes reversal of the Hsp82
      overexpression phenotype and upregulation of SIR2 expression in heat-induced
      Hsp82-overexpressing cells. On the other hand, we found that Cup9 overexpression 
      represses SIR2 transcription and leads to a failure in the establishment of
      heterochromatin. The results of our study highlight the mechanism by which
      environmental factors amend the epigenetic configuration of chromatin.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 increases 3' end processing of growth factor-induced
      c-FOS transcripts.
PG  - 468-78
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01157-14 [doi]
AB  - Transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate RNA polymerase II
      initiation and elongation as well as cotranscriptional mRNA processing. In this
      report, we describe an important role for CDK12 in the epidermal growth factor
      (EGF)-induced c-FOS proto-oncogene expression in mammalian cells. This kinase was
      found in the exon junction complexes (EJC) together with SR proteins and was thus
      recruited to RNA polymerase II. In cells depleted of CDK12 or eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 4A3 (eIF4A3) from the EJC, EGF induced fewer c-FOS 
      transcripts. In these cells, phosphorylation of serines at position 2 in the
      C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, as well as levels of
      cleavage-stimulating factor 64 (Cstf64) and 73-kDa subunit of cleavage and
      polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF73), was reduced at the c-FOS gene. These
      effects impaired 3' end processing of c-FOS transcripts. Mutant CDK12 proteins
      lacking their Arg-Ser-rich (RS) domain or just the RS domain alone acted as
      dominant negative proteins. Thus, CDK12 plays an important role in
      cotranscriptional processing of c-FOS transcripts.

      autophagy-mediated degradation of heterochromatin protein HP1.
PG  - 406-16
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01044-14 [doi]
AB  - Efficient DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is critical for the maintenance of
      genome stability. Unrepaired or misrepaired DSBs cause chromosomal rearrangements
      that can result in severe consequences, such as tumorigenesis. RAD6 is an E2
      ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a pivotal role in repairing UV-induced
      DNA damage. Here, we present evidence that RAD6 is also required for DNA DSB
      repair via homologous recombination (HR) by specifically regulating the
      degradation of heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha). Our study indicates
      that RAD6 physically interacts with HP1alpha and ubiquitinates HP1alpha at
      residue K154, thereby promoting HP1alpha degradation through the autophagy
      pathway and eventually leading to an open chromatin structure that facilitates
      efficient HR DSB repair. Furthermore, bioinformatics studies have indicated that 
      the expression of RAD6 and HP1alpha exhibits an inverse relationship and
      correlates with the survival rate of patients.

TI  - Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 expression impacts myogenic C2C12 cell commitment 
      via the Notch signaling pathway.
PG  - 391-405
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00890-14 [doi]
AB  - The Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle regeneration 
      in mammals by controlling the transition of satellite cells from quiescence to an
      activated state, their proliferation, and their commitment toward myotubes or
      self-renewal. O-fucosylation on Notch receptor epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
      repeats is catalyzed by the protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (Pofut1) and primarily
      controls Notch interaction with its ligands. To approach the role of
      O-fucosylation in myogenesis, we analyzed a murine myoblastic C2C12 cell line
      downregulated for Pofut1 expression by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibition
      during the time course of differentiation. Knockdown of Pofut1 affected the
      signaling pathway activation by a reduction of the amount of cleaved Notch
      intracellular domain and a decrease in downstream Notch target gene expression.
      Depletion in Pax7(+)/MyoD(-) cells and earlier myogenic program entrance were
      observed, leading to an increase in myotube quantity with a small number of
      nuclei, reflecting fusion defects. The rescue of Pofut1 expression in knockdown
      cells restored Notch signaling activation and a normal course in C2C12
      differentiation. Our results establish the critical role of Pofut1 on Notch
      pathway activation during myogenic differentiation.

TI  - Cdc42p-interacting protein Bem4p regulates the filamentous-growth
      mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
PG  - 417-36
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00850-14 [doi]
AB  - The ubiquitous Rho (Ras homology) GTPase Cdc42p can function in different
      settings to regulate cell polarity and cellular signaling. How Cdc42p and other
      proteins are directed to function in a particular context remains unclear. We
      show that the Cdc42p-interacting protein Bem4p regulates the mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that controls filamentous growth in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae. Bem4p controlled the filamentous-growth pathway but not other MAPK
      pathways (mating or high-osmolarity glycerol response [HOG]) that also require
      Cdc42p and other shared components. Bem4p associated with the plasma membrane
      (PM) protein, Sho1p, to regulate MAPK activity and cell polarization under
      nutrient-limiting conditions that favor filamentous growth. Bem4p also interacted
      with the major activator of Cdc42p, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 
      Cdc24p, which we show also regulates the filamentous-growth pathway. Bem4p
      interacted with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Cdc24p, which functions in
      an autoinhibitory capacity, and was required, along with other pathway
      regulators, to maintain Cdc24p at polarized sites during filamentous growth.
      Bem4p also interacted with the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) Ste11p. Thus, Bem4p is
      a new regulator of the filamentous-growth MAPK pathway and binds to general
      proteins, like Cdc42p and Ste11p, to promote a pathway-specific response.

TI  - Human monocyte recognition of adenosine-based cyclic dinucleotides unveils the
      A2a Galphas protein-coupled receptor tonic inhibition of mitochondrially induced 
      cell death.
PG  - 479-95
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01204-14 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic dinucleotides are important messengers for bacteria and protozoa and are
      well-characterized immunity alarmins for infected mammalian cells through
      intracellular binding to STING receptors. We sought to investigate their unknown 
      extracellular effects by adding cyclic dinucleotides to the culture medium of
      freshly isolated human blood cells in vitro. Here we report that
      adenosine-containing cyclic dinucleotides induce the selective apoptosis of
      monocytes through a novel apoptotic pathway. We demonstrate that these compounds 
      are inverse agonist ligands of A2a, a Galphas-coupled adenosine receptor
      selectively expressed by monocytes. Inhibition of monocyte A2a by these ligands
      induces apoptosis through a mechanism independent of that of the STING receptors.
      The blockade of basal (adenosine-free) signaling from A2a inhibits protein kinase
      A (PKA) activity, thereby recruiting cytosolic p53, which opens the mitochondrial
      permeability transition pore and impairs mitochondrial respiration, resulting in 
      apoptosis. A2a antagonists and inverse agonist ligands induce apoptosis of human 
      monocytes, while A2a agonists are antiapoptotic. In vivo, we used a mock
      developing human hematopoietic system through NSG mice transplanted with human
      CD34(+) cells. Treatment with cyclic di-AMP selectively depleted A2a-expressing
      monocytes and their precursors via apoptosis. Thus, monocyte recognition of
      cyclic dinucleotides unravels a novel proapoptotic pathway: the A2a Galphas
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-driven tonic inhibitory signaling of
      mitochondrion-induced cell death.

TI  - A protease-independent function for SPPL3 in NFAT activation.
PG  - 451-67
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01124-14 [doi]
AB  - The signal peptide peptidase (SPP)-related intramembrane aspartyl proteases are a
      homologous group of polytopic membrane proteins, some of which function in innate
      or adaptive immunity by cleaving proteins involved in antigen presentation or
      intracellular signaling. Signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (SPPL3) is a poorly
      characterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized member of this family, with no
      validated cellular substrates. We report here the isolation of SPPL3 in a screen 
      for activators of NFAT, a transcription factor that controls lymphocyte
      development and function. We find that SPPL3 is required downstream of T cell
      receptor engagement for maximal Ca(2+) influx and NFAT activation. Surprisingly, 
      the proteolytic activity of SPPL3 is not required for its role in this pathway.
      SPPL3 enhances the signal-induced association of stromal interaction molecule 1
      (STIM1) and Orai1 and is even required for the full activity of constitutively
      active STIM1 variants that bind Orai1 independently of ER Ca(2+) release. SPPL3
      associates with STIM1 through at least two independent domains, the transmembrane
      region and the CRAC activation domain (CAD), and can promote the association of
      the STIM1 CAD with Orai1. Our results assign a function in lymphocyte signaling
      to SPPL3 and highlight the emerging importance of nonproteolytic functions for
      members of the intramembrane aspartyl protease family.

TI  - DGCR14 induces Il17a gene expression through the RORgamma/BAZ1B/RSKS2 complex.
PG  - 344-55
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00926-14 [doi]
AB  - The Dgcr14/Es2 gene is located in a chromosomal region the loss of which has been
      associated with DiGeorge syndrome, a cause of immunodeficiency, heart defects,
      and skeletal abnormalities. However, the role of DGCR14 protein remains to be
      elucidated. Here, I found that DGCR14 protein acts as a coactivator of RORgammat 
      in TH17 cells. Biochemical purification of the RORgamma coregulator complex
      allowed me to identify the associated DGCR14 protein by matrix-assisted laser
      desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Overexpression of Dgcr14 
      mRNA enhanced RORgammat-mediated transcriptional activity and facilitated TH17
      cell differentiation. Furthermore, knockdown of Dgcr14 reduced Il17a mRNA
      expression. I also found that DGCR14 associated with ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2,
      also called RpS6ka3) and BAZ1B, both of which were recruited to the Il17a
      promoter during TH17 cell differentiation. Knockdown of Baz1b or RpS6ka3 also
      reduced Il17a mRNA expression, and Baz1b knockdown increased transcriptional
      suppressive histone marks (histone H3K9me3) on the Il17a promoter. My findings
      showed the roles of DGCR14, RSK2, and BAZ1B in the transcriptional regulation of 
      Il17a mRNA during TH17 cell differentiation.

TI  - NF-kappaB signaling is required for XBP1 (unspliced and spliced)-mediated effects
      on antiestrogen responsiveness and cell fate decisions in breast cancer.
PG  - 379-90
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00847-14 [doi]
AB  - Antiestrogen therapy induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in estrogen
      receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), which
      exists in the transcriptionally inactive unspliced form [XBP1(U)] and the spliced
      active form [XBP1(S)], is a key UPR component mediating antiestrogen resistance. 
      We now show a direct link between the XBP1 and NF-kappaB survival pathways in
      driving the cell fate decisions in response to antiestrogens in ER(+) breast
      cancer cells, both in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Using novel spliced
      and nonspliceable forms of XBP1, we show that XBP1(U) functions beyond being a
      dominant negative of XBP1(S). Both isoforms regulate NF-kappaB activity via
      ERalpha; XBP1(S) is more potent because it also directly regulates p65/RelA
      expression. These findings provide new insights into the fundamental signaling
      activities of spliced and unspliced XBP1 in breast cancer, establish NF-kappaB to
      be a mediator of these activities, and identify XBP1 and its splicing to be novel
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - Deregulation of Rb-E2F1 axis causes chromosomal instability by engaging the
      transactivation function of Cdc20-anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome.
PG  - 356-69
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00868-14 [doi]
AB  - The E2F family of transcription factors regulates genes involved in various
      aspects of the cell cycle. Beyond the well-documented role in G1/S transition,
      mitotic regulation by E2F has also been reported. Proper mitotic progression is
      monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The SAC ensures bipolar
      separation of chromosomes and thus prevents aneuploidy. There are limited reports
      on the regulation of the SAC by E2F. Our previous work identified the SAC protein
      Cdc20 as a novel transcriptional regulator of the mitotic ubiquitin carrier
      protein UbcH10. However, none of the Cdc20 transcription complex proteins have
      any known DNA binding domain. Here we show that an E2F1-DP1 heterodimer is
      involved in recruitment of the Cdc20 transcription complex to the UBCH10 promoter
      and in transactivation of the gene. We further show that inactivation of Rb can
      facilitate this transactivation process. Moreover, this E2F1-mediated regulation 
      of UbcH10 influences mitotic progression. Deregulation of this pathway results in
      premature anaphase, chromosomal abnormalities, and aneuploidy. We conclude that
      excess E2F1 due to Rb inactivation recruits the complex of Cdc20 and the
      anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (Cdc20-APC/C) to deregulate the expression
      of UBCH10, leading to chromosomal instability in cancer cells.

LID - 10.1128/MCB.00991-14 [doi]
AB  - Mediator is a large, multisubunit complex that is required for essentially all
      mRNA transcription in eukaryotes. In spite of the importance of Mediator, the
      range of its targets and how it is recruited to these is not well understood.
      Previous work showed that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator contributes to
      transcriptional activation by two distinct mechanisms, one depending on the tail 
      module triad and favoring SAGA-regulated genes, and the second occurring
      independently of the tail module and favoring TFIID-regulated genes. Here, we use
      chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to show that dependence on
      tail module subunits for Mediator recruitment and polymerase II (Pol II)
      association occurs preferentially at SAGA-regulated over TFIID-regulated genes on
      a genome-wide scale. We also show that recruitment of tail module subunits to
      active gene promoters continues genome-wide when Mediator integrity is
      compromised in med17 temperature-sensitive (ts) yeast, demonstrating the modular 
      nature of the Mediator complex in vivo. In addition, our data indicate that
      promoters exhibiting strong and stable occupancy by Mediator have a wide range of
      activity and are enriched for targets of the Tup1-Cyc8 repressor complex. We also
      identify a number of strong Mediator occupancy peaks that overlap dubious open
      reading frames (ORFs) and are likely to include previously unrecognized upstream 
      activator sequences.

TI  - A variably occupied CTCF binding site in the ultrabithorax gene in the Drosophila
      bithorax complex.

AB  - Although the majority of genomic binding sites for the insulator protein
      CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) are constitutively occupied, a subset show variable
      occupancy. Such variable sites provide an opportunity to assess context-specific 
      CTCF functions in gene regulation. Here, we have identified a variably occupied
      CTCF site in the Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene. This site is occupied in
      tissues where Ubx is active (third thoracic leg imaginal disc) but is not bound
      in tissues where the Ubx gene is repressed (first thoracic leg imaginal disc).
      Using chromatin conformation capture, we show that this site preferentially
      interacts with the Ubx promoter region in the active state. The site lies close
      to Ubx enhancer elements and is also close to the locations of several gypsy
      transposon insertions that disrupt Ubx expression, leading to the bx mutant
      phenotype. gypsy insertions carry the Su(Hw)-dependent gypsy insulator and were
      found to affect both CTCF binding at the variable site and the chromatin
      topology. This suggests that insertion of the gypsy insulator in this region
      interferes with CTCF function and supports a model for the normal function of the
      variable CTCF site as a chromatin loop facilitator, promoting interaction between
      Ubx enhancers and the Ubx transcription start site.

TI  - The basic leucine zipper stress response regulator Yap5 senses high-iron
      conditions by coordination of [2Fe-2S] clusters.
PG  - 370-8
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01033-14 [doi]
AB  - Iron is an essential, yet at elevated concentrations toxic trace element. To
      date, the mechanisms of iron sensing by eukaryotic iron-responsive transcription 
      factors are poorly understood. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor 
      Yap5, a member of the Yap family of bZIP stress response regulators,
      administrates the adaptive response to high-iron conditions. Despite the central 
      role of the iron-sensing process for cell viability, the molecule perceived by
      Yap5 and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that
      Yap5 senses high-iron conditions by two Fe/S clusters bound to its activator
      domain (Yap5-AD). The more stable iron-regulatory Fe/S cluster at the N-terminal 
      cysteine-rich domain (n-CRD) of Yap5 is detected in vivo and in vitro. The second
      cluster coordinated by the C-terminal CRD can only be shown after chemical
      reconstitution, since it is bound in a labile fashion. Both clusters are of the
      [2Fe-2S] type as characterized by UV/visible (UV/Vis), circular dichroism,
      electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Fe/S cluster
      binding to Yap5-AD induces a conformational change that may activate
      transcription. The cluster-binding motif of the n-CRD domain is highly conserved 
      in HapX-like transcription factors of pathogenic fungi and thus may represent a
      general sensor module common to many eukaryotic stress response regulators.

TI  - Loss of BRMS1 promotes a mesenchymal phenotype through NF-kappaB-dependent
      regulation of Twist1.
PG  - 303-17
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00869-14 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) is downregulated in non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC), and its reduction correlates with disease progression.
      Herein, we investigate the mechanisms through which loss of the BRMS1 gene
      contributes to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using a short hairpin 
      RNA (shRNA) system, we show that loss of BRMS1 promotes basal and transforming
      growth factor beta-induced EMT in NSCLC cells. NSCLC cells expressing BRMS1
      shRNAs (BRMS1 knockdown [BRMS1(KD)]) display mesenchymal characteristics,
      including enhanced cell migration and differential regulation of the EMT markers.
      Mesenchymal phenotypes observed in BRMS1(KD) cells are dependent on RelA/p65, the
      transcriptionally active subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). In
      addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that loss of BRMS1 
      increases Twist1 promoter occupancy of RelA/p65 K310-a key histone modification
      associated with increased transcription. Knockdown of Twist1 results in reversal 
      of BRMS1(KD)-mediated EMT phenotypic changes. Moreover, in our animal model,
      BRMS1(KD)/Twist1(KD) double knockdown cells were less efficient in establishing
      lung tumors than BRMS1(KD) cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that loss
      of BRMS1 promotes malignant phenotypes that are dependent on NF-kappaB-dependent 
      regulation of Twist1. These observations offer fresh insight into the mechanisms 
      through which BRMS1 regulates the development of metastases in NSCLC.

TI  - The major myelin-resident protein PLP is transported to myelin membranes via a
      transcytotic mechanism: involvement of sulfatide.
PG  - 288-302
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00848-14 [doi]
AB  - Myelin membranes are sheet-like extensions of oligodendrocytes that can be
      considered membrane domains distinct from the cell's plasma membrane. Consistent 
      with the polarized nature of oligodendrocytes, we demonstrate that transcytotic
      transport of the major myelin-resident protein proteolipid protein (PLP) is a key
      element in the mechanism of myelin assembly. Upon biosynthesis, PLP traffics to
      myelin membranes via syntaxin 3-mediated docking at the apical-surface-like cell 
      body plasma membrane, which is followed by subsequent internalization and
      transport to the basolateral-surface-like myelin sheet. Pulse-chase experiments, 
      in conjunction with surface biotinylation and organelle fractionation, reveal
      that following biosynthesis, PLP is transported to the cell body surface in
      Triton X-100 (TX-100)-resistant microdomains. At the plasma membrane, PLP
      transiently resides within these microdomains and its lateral dissipation is
      followed by segregation into
      3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)-resistant
      domains, internalization, and subsequent transport toward the myelin membrane.
      Sulfatide triggers PLP's reallocation from TX-100- into CHAPS-resistant membrane 
      domains, while inhibition of sulfatide biosynthesis inhibits transcytotic PLP
      transport. Taking these findings together, we propose a model in which PLP
      transport to the myelin membrane proceeds via a transcytotic mechanism mediated
      by sulfatide and characterized by a conformational alteration and dynamic, i.e., 
      transient, partitioning of PLP into distinct membrane microdomains involved in
      biosynthetic and transcytotic transport.

TI  - The RASSF1A tumor suppressor regulates XPA-mediated DNA repair.
PG  - 277-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00202-14 [doi]
AB  - RASSF1A may be the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor identified in
      human cancer so far. It is a proapoptotic Ras effector and plays an important
      role in the apoptotic DNA damage response (DDR). We now show that in addition to 
      DDR regulation, RASSF1A also plays a key role in the DNA repair process itself.
      We show that RASSF1A forms a DNA damage-regulated complex with the key DNA repair
      protein xeroderma pigmentosum A (XPA). XPA requires RASSF1A to exert full repair 
      activity, and RASSF1A-deficient cells exhibit an impaired ability to repair DNA. 
      Moreover, a cancer-associated RASSF1A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      variant exhibits differential XPA binding and inhibits DNA repair. The
      interaction of XPA with other components of the repair complex, such as
      replication protein A (RPA), is controlled in part by a dynamic
      acetylation/deacetylation cycle. We found that RASSF1A and its SNP variant
      differentially regulate XPA protein acetylation, and the SNP variant
      hyperstabilizes the XPA-RPA70 complex. Thus, we identify two novel functions for 
      RASSF1A in the control of DNA repair and protein acetylation. As RASSF1A
      modulates both apoptotic DDR and DNA repair, it may play an important and
      unanticipated role in coordinating the balance between repair and death after DNA
      damage.

AB  - Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, and their fusion and fission regulate
      cellular signaling, development, and mitochondrial homeostasis, including
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) distribution. Cardiac myocytes have a specialized
      cytoplasmic structure where large mitochondria are aligned into tightly packed
      myofibril bundles; however, recent studies have revealed that mitochondrial
      dynamics also plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of
      cardiomyocytes. Here, we precisely analyzed the role of mitochondrial fission in 
      vivo. The mitochondrial fission GTPase, Drp1, is highly expressed in the
      developing neonatal heart, and muscle-specific Drp1 knockout (Drp1-KO) mice
      showed neonatal lethality due to dilated cardiomyopathy. The Drp1 ablation in
      heart and primary cultured cardiomyocytes resulted in severe mtDNA nucleoid
      clustering and led to mosaic deficiency of mitochondrial respiration. The
      functional and structural alteration of mitochondria also led to immature
      myofibril assembly and defective cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, the dynamics of
      mtDNA nucleoids regulated by mitochondrial fission is required for neonatal
      cardiomyocyte development by promoting homogeneous distribution of active
      mitochondria throughout the cardiomyocytes.

TI  - A novel role for protein kinase Kin2 in regulating HAC1 mRNA translocation,
      splicing, and translation.
PG  - 199-210
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00981-14 [doi]
AB  - A signaling network called the unfolded protein response (UPR) resolves the
      protein-folding defects in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from yeasts to humans. 
      In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the UPR activation involves (i)
      aggregation of the ER-resident kinase/RNase Ire1 to form an Ire1 focus, (ii)
      targeting HAC1 pre-mRNA toward the Ire1 focus that cleaves out an inhibitory
      intron from the mRNA, and (iii) translation of Hac1 protein from the spliced
      mRNA. Targeting HAC1 mRNA to the Ire1 focus requires a cis-acting bipartite
      element (3'BE) located at the 3' untranslated leader. Here, we report that the
      3'BE plays an additional role in promoting translation from the spliced mRNA. We 
      also report that a high dose of either of two paralogue kinases, Kin1 and Kin2,
      overcomes the defective UPR caused by a mutation in the 3'BE. These results
      define a novel role for Kin kinases in the UPR beyond their role in cell polarity
      and exocytosis. Consistently, targeting, splicing, and translation of HAC1 mRNA
      are substantially reduced in the kin1Delta kin2Delta strain. Furthermore, we show
      that Kin2 kinase domain itself is sufficient to activate the UPR, suggesting that
      Kin2 initiates a signaling cascade to ensure an optimum UPR.

TI  - Phosphoinositide 3-kinase beta protects nuclear envelope integrity by controlling
      RCC1 localization and Ran activity.
PG  - 249-63
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01184-14 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear envelope (NE) forms a barrier between the nucleus and the cytosol
      that preserves genomic integrity. The nuclear lamina and nuclear pore complexes
      (NPCs) are NE components that regulate nuclear events through interaction with
      other proteins and DNA. Defects in the nuclear lamina are associated with the
      development of laminopathies. As cells depleted of phosphoinositide 3-kinase beta
      (PI3Kbeta) showed an aberrant nuclear morphology, we studied the contribution of 
      PI3Kbeta to maintenance of NE integrity. pik3cb depletion reduced the nuclear
      membrane tension, triggered formation of areas of lipid bilayer/lamina
      discontinuity, and impaired NPC assembly. We show that one mechanism for PI3Kbeta
      regulation of NE/NPC integrity is its association with RCC1 (regulator of
      chromosome condensation 1), the activator of nuclear Ran GTPase. PI3Kbeta
      controls RCC1 binding to chromatin and, in turn, Ran activation. These findings
      suggest that PI3Kbeta regulates the nuclear envelope through upstream regulation 
      of RCC1 and Ran.

TI  - PRMT4-mediated arginine methylation negatively regulates retinoblastoma tumor
      suppressor protein and promotes E2F-1 dissociation.
PG  - 238-48
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00945-14 [doi]
AB  - The retinoblastoma protein (pRb/p105) tumor suppressor plays a pivotal role in
      cell cycle regulation by blockage of the G1-to-S-phase transition. pRb tumor
      suppressor activity is governed by a variety of posttranslational modifications, 
      most notably phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes. Here we 
      report a novel regulation of pRb through protein arginine methyltransferase 4
      (PRMT4)-mediated arginine methylation, which parallels phosphorylation. PRMT4
      specifically methylates pRb at the pRb C-terminal domain (pRb C(term)) on
      arginine (R) residues R775, R787, and R798 in vitro and R787 in vivo. Arginine
      methylation is important for efficient pRb C(term) phosphorylation, as manifested
      by the reduced phosphorylation of a methylation-impaired mutant, pRb (R3K). A
      methylmimetic form of pRb, pRb (R3F), disrupts the formation of the E2F-1/DP1-pRb
      complex in cells as well as in an isolated system. Finally, studies using a
      Gal4-E2F-1 reporter system show that pRb (R3F) expression reduces the ability of 
      pRb to repress E2F-1 transcriptional activation, while pRb (R3K) expression
      further represses E2F-1 transcriptional activation relative to that for cells
      expressing wild-type pRb. Together, our results suggest that arginine methylation
      negatively regulates the tumor suppressor function of pRb during cell cycle
      control, in part by creating a better substrate for Cdk complex phosphorylation
      and disrupting the interaction of pRb with E2F-1.

TI  - Kinase regulation by hydrophobic spine assembly in cancer.
PG  - 264-76
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00943-14 [doi]
AB  - A new model of kinase regulation based on the assembly of hydrophobic spines has 
      been proposed. Changes in their positions can explain the mechanism of kinase
      activation. Here, we examined mutations in human cancer for clues about the
      regulation of the hydrophobic spines by focusing initially on mutations to Phe.
      We identified a selected number of Phe mutations in a small group of kinases that
      included BRAF, ABL1, and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Testing some of
      these mutations in BRAF, we found that one of the mutations impaired ATP binding 
      and catalytic activity but promoted noncatalytic allosteric functions. Other Phe 
      mutations functioned to promote constitutive catalytic activity. One of these
      mutations revealed a previously underappreciated hydrophobic surface that
      functions to position the dynamic regulatory alphaC-helix. This supports the key 
      role of the C-helix as a signal integration motif for coordinating multiple
      elements of the kinase to create an active conformation. The importance of the
      hydrophobic space around the alphaC-helix was further tested by studying a V600F 
      mutant, which was constitutively active in the absence of the negative charge
      that is associated with the common V600E mutation. Many hydrophobic mutations
      strategically localized along the C-helix can thus drive kinase activation.

TI  - Functional interactions between NURF and Ctcf regulate gene expression.
PG  - 224-37
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00553-14 [doi]
AB  - Gene expression frequently requires chromatin-remodeling complexes, and it is
      assumed that these complexes have common gene targets across cell types. Contrary
      to this belief, we show by genome-wide expression profiling that Bptf, an
      essential and unique subunit of the nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF),
      predominantly regulates the expression of a unique set of genes between diverse
      cell types. Coincident with its functions in gene expression, we observed that
      Bptf is also important for regulating nucleosome occupancy at nucleosome-free
      regions (NFRs), many of which are located at sites occupied by the multivalent
      factors Ctcf and cohesin. NURF function at Ctcf binding sites could be direct,
      because Bptf occupies Ctcf binding sites in vivo and has physical interactions
      with CTCF and the cohesin subunit SA2. Assays of several Ctcf binding sites using
      reporter assays showed that their regulatory activity requires Bptf in two
      different cell types. Focused studies at H2-K1 showed that Bptf regulates the
      ability of Klf4 to bind near an upstream Ctcf site, possibly influencing gene
      expression. In combination, these studies demonstrate that gene expression as
      regulated by NURF occurs partly through physical and functional interactions with
      the ubiquitous and multivalent factors Ctcf and cohesin.

TI  - WNT signaling: an emerging mediator of cancer cell metabolism?
PG  - 2-10
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00992-14 [doi]
AB  - WNT signaling was discovered in tumor models and has been recognized as a
      regulator of cancer development and progression for over 3 decades. Recent work
      has highlighted a critical role for WNT signaling in the metabolic homeostasis of
      mammals, where its misregulation has been heavily implicated in diabetes. While
      the majority of WNT metabolism research has focused on nontransformed tissues,
      the role of WNT in cancer metabolism remains underinvestigated. Cancer is also a 
      metabolic disease where oncogenic signaling pathways regulate energy production
      and macromolecular synthesis to fuel rapidly proliferating tumors. This review
      highlights the emerging evidence for WNT signaling in the reprogramming of cancer
      cell metabolism and examines the role of these signaling pathways as mediators of
      tumor bioenergetics.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of fenofibrate-induced metabolic catastrophe and
      glioblastoma cell death.
PG  - 182-98
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00562-14 [doi]
AB  - Fenofibrate (FF) is a common lipid-lowering drug and a potent agonist of the
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). FF and several
      other agonists of PPARalpha have interesting anticancer properties, and our
      recent studies demonstrate that FF is very effective against tumor cells of
      neuroectodermal origin. In spite of these promising anticancer effects, the
      molecular mechanism(s) of FF-induced tumor cell toxicity remains to be
      elucidated. Here we report a novel PPARalpha-independent mechanism explaining
      FF's cytotoxicity in vitro and in an intracranial mouse model of glioblastoma.
      The mechanism involves accumulation of FF in the mitochondrial fraction, followed
      by immediate impairment of mitochondrial respiration at the level of complex I of
      the electron transport chain. This mitochondrial action sensitizes tested
      glioblastoma cells to the PPARalpha-dependent metabolic switch from glycolysis to
      fatty acid beta-oxidation. As a consequence, prolonged exposure to FF depletes
      intracellular ATP, activates the AMP-activated protein kinase-mammalian target of
      rapamycin-autophagy pathway, and results in extensive tumor cell death.
      Interestingly, autophagy activators attenuate and autophagy inhibitors enhance
      FF-induced glioblastoma cytotoxicity. Our results explain the molecular basis of 
      FF-induced glioblastoma cytotoxicity and reveal a new supplemental therapeutic
      approach in which intracranial infusion of FF could selectively trigger metabolic
      catastrophe in glioblastoma cells.

TI  - Extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling regulates the opposing roles of
      JUN family transcription factors at ETS/AP-1 sites and in cell migration.
PG  - 88-100
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00982-14 [doi]
AB  - JUN transcription factors bind DNA as part of the AP-1 complex, regulate many
      cellular processes, and play a key role in oncogenesis. The three JUN proteins
      (c-JUN, JUNB, and JUND) can have both redundant and unique functions depending on
      the biological phenotype and cell type assayed. Mechanisms that allow this
      dynamic switching between overlapping and distinct functions are unclear. Here we
      demonstrate that JUND has a role in prostate cell migration that is the opposite 
      of c-JUN's and JUNB's. RNA sequencing reveals that opposing regulation by c-JUN
      and JUND defines a subset of AP-1 target genes with cell migration roles.
      cis-regulatory elements for only this subset of targets were enriched for ETS
      factor binding, indicating a specificity mechanism. Interestingly, the function
      of c-JUN and JUND in prostate cell migration switched when we compared cells with
      an inactive versus an active RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
      signaling pathway. We show that this switch is due to phosphorylation and
      activation of JUND by ERK. Thus, the ETS/AP-1 sequence defines a unique gene
      expression program regulated by the relative levels of JUN proteins and RAS/ERK
      signaling. This work provides a rationale for how transcription factors can have 
      distinct roles depending on the signaling status and the biological function in
      question.

TI  - JAK2 tyrosine kinase phosphorylates and is negatively regulated by centrosomal
      protein Ninein.
PG  - 111-31
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01138-14 [doi]
AB  - JAK2 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase critical for cytokine signaling. In this
      study, we have identified a novel centrosome-associated complex containing ninein
      and JAK2. We have found that active JAK2 localizes around the mother centrioles, 
      where it partly colocalizes with ninein, a protein involved in microtubule (MT)
      nucleation and anchoring. We demonstrated that JAK2 is an important regulator of 
      centrosome function. Depletion of JAK2 or use of JAK2-null cells causes defects
      in MT anchoring and increased numbers of cells with mitotic defects; however, MT 
      nucleation is unaffected. We showed that JAK2 directly phosphorylates the N
      terminus of ninein while the C terminus of ninein inhibits JAK2 kinase activity
      in vitro. Overexpressed wild-type (WT) or C-terminal (amino acids 1179 to 1931)
      ninein inhibits JAK2. This ninein-dependent inhibition of JAK2 significantly
      decreases prolactin- and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced tyrosyl
      phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT5. Downregulation of ninein enhances JAK2
      activation. These results indicate that JAK2 is a novel member of
      centrosome-associated complex and that this localization regulates both
      centrosomal function and JAK2 kinase activity, thus controlling
      cytokine-activated molecular pathways.

TI  - Axl phosphorylates Elmo scaffold proteins to promote Rac activation and cell
      invasion.
PG  - 76-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00764-14 [doi]
AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase Axl contributes to cell migration and invasion.
      Expression of Axl correlates with metastatic progression in cancer patients, yet 
      the specific signaling events promoting invasion downstream of Axl are poorly
      defined. Herein, we report Elmo scaffolds to be direct substrates and binding
      partners of Axl. Elmo proteins are established to interact with Dock family
      guanine nucleotide exchange factors to control Rac-mediated cytoskeletal
      dynamics. Proteomics and mutagenesis studies reveal that Axl phosphorylates
      Elmo1/2 on a conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue. Upon Gas6-dependent
      activation of Axl, endogenous Elmo2 becomes phosphorylated on Tyr-713 and enters 
      into a physical complex with Axl in breast cancer cells. Interfering with Elmo2
      expression prevented Gas6-induced Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells.
      Similarly to blocking of Axl, Elmo2 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of
      Dock1 abolishes breast cancer cell invasion. Interestingly, Axl or Elmo2
      knockdown diminishes breast cancer cell proliferation. Rescue of Elmo2 knockdown 
      cells with the wild-type protein but not with Elmo2 harboring Tyr-713-Phe
      mutations restores cell invasion and cell proliferation. These results define a
      new mechanism by which Axl promotes cell proliferation and invasion and
      identifies inhibition of the Elmo-Dock pathway as a potential therapeutic target 
      to stop Axl-induced metastases.

TI  - N-terminal alpha7 deletion of the proteasome 20S core particle substitutes for
      yeast PI31 function.
PG  - 141-52
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00582-14 [doi]
AB  - The proteasome core particle (CP) is a conserved protease complex that is formed 
      by the stacking of two outer alpha-rings and two inner beta-rings. The alpha-ring
      is a heteroheptameric ring of subunits alpha1 to alpha7 and acts as a gate that
      restricts entry of substrate proteins into the catalytic cavity formed by the two
      abutting beta-rings. The 31-kDa proteasome inhibitor (PI31) was originally
      identified as a protein that binds to the CP and inhibits CP activity in vitro,
      but accumulating evidence indicates that PI31 is required for physiological
      proteasome activity. To clarify the in vivo role of PI31, we examined the
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae PI31 ortholog Fub1. Fub1 was essential in a situation
      where the CP assembly chaperone Pba4 was deleted. The lethality of Deltafub1
      Deltapba4 was suppressed by deletion of the N terminus of alpha7 (alpha7DeltaN), 
      which led to the partial activation of the CP. However, deletion of the N
      terminus of alpha3, which activates the CP more efficiently than alpha7DeltaN by 
      gate opening, did not suppress Deltafub1 Deltapba4 lethality. These results
      suggest that the alpha7 N terminus has a role in CP activation different from
      that of the alpha3 N terminus and that the role of Fub1 antagonizes a specific
      function of the alpha7 N terminus.

TI  - Cross talk between histone deacetylase 4 and STAT6 in the transcriptional
      regulation of arginase 1 during mouse dendritic cell differentiation.
PG  - 63-75
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00805-14 [doi]
AB  - l-Arginine and l-arginine-metabolizing enzymes play important roles in the
      biology of some types of myeloid cells, including macrophage and myeloid-derived 
      suppressor cells. In this study, we found evidence that arginase 1 (Arg1) is
      required for the differentiation of mouse dendritic cells (DCs). Expression of
      Arg1 was robustly induced during monocyte-derived DC differentiation. Ectopic
      expression of Arg1 significantly promoted monocytic DC differentiation in a
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor culture system and also
      facilitated the differentiation of CD8alpha(+) conventional DCs in the presence
      of Flt3 ligand. Knockdown of Arg1 reversed these effects. Mechanistic studies
      showed that the induced expression of Arg1 in differentiating DCs was caused by
      enhanced recruitment of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) to the Arg1 promoter
      region, which led to a reduction in the acetylation of both the histone 3 and
      STAT6 proteins and subsequent transcriptional activation of Arg1. Further
      investigation identified a novel STAT6 binding site within the Arg1 promoter that
      mediated its regulation by STAT6 and HDAC4. These observations suggest that the
      cross talk between HDAC4 and STAT6 is an important regulatory mechanism of Arg1
      transcription in DCs. Moreover, overexpression of Arg1 clearly abrogated the
      ability of HDAC inhibitors to suppress DC differentiation. In conclusion, we show
      that Arg1 is a novel regulator of myeloid DC differentiation.

TI  - Substrate trapping proteomics reveals targets of the betaTrCP2/FBXW11 ubiquitin
      ligase.
PG  - 167-81
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00857-14 [doi]
AB  - Defining the full complement of substrates for each ubiquitin ligase remains an
      important challenge. Improvements in mass spectrometry instrumentation and
      computation and in protein biochemistry methods have resulted in several new
      methods for ubiquitin ligase substrate identification. Here we used the parallel 
      adapter capture (PAC) proteomics approach to study betaTrCP2/FBXW11, a substrate 
      adaptor for the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The
      processivity of the ubiquitylation reaction necessitates transient physical
      interactions between FBXW11 and its substrates, thus making biochemical
      purification of FBXW11-bound substrates difficult. Using the PAC-based approach, 
      we inhibited the proteasome to "trap" ubiquitylated substrates on the SCF(FBXW11)
      E3 complex. Comparative mass spectrometry analysis of immunopurified FBXW11
      protein complexes before and after proteasome inhibition revealed 21 known and 23
      putatively novel substrates. In focused studies, we found that SCF(FBXW11) bound,
      polyubiquitylated, and destabilized RAPGEF2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor
      that activates the small GTPase RAP1. High RAPGEF2 protein levels promoted
      cell-cell fusion and, consequently, multinucleation. Surprisingly, this occurred 
      independently of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalytic activity 
      and of the presence of RAP1. Our data establish new functions for RAPGEF2 that
      may contribute to aneuploidy in cancer. More broadly, this report supports the
      continued use of substrate trapping proteomics to comprehensively define targets 
      for E3 ubiquitin ligases. All proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange
      with identifier PXD001062.

TI  - mTOR activation promotes plasma cell differentiation and bypasses XBP-1 for
      immunoglobulin secretion.

AB  - Plasma cells (PCs) are responsible for the secretion of antibodies. The
      development of fully functional PCs relies on the activation of the
      inositol-requiring enzyme 1/X-box binding protein 1 (IRE1/XBP-1) arm of the
      unfolded protein response (UPR). XBP-1-deficient PCs secrete antibodies poorly
      and exhibit distensions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The kinase mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) promotes anabolic activities and is negatively
      regulated by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Deletion of TSC1 renders mTOR 
      hyperactive. To explore the relationship between mTOR and the UPR in PC
      development and function, mice with conditional deletions of XBP-1 and/or TSC1 in
      their B cell lineage were generated. Deletion of TSC1 enhanced Ig synthesis and
      promoted differentiation into PCs independently of XBP-1, as evidenced by
      comparison of TSC1/XBP-1 double-knockout (DKO) PCs to XBP-1 knockout (KO) PCs.
      The typical morphological abnormalities of the ER in XBP-1 KO PCs were alleviated
      in the DKO PCs. Expression profiling identified the glycoprotein Ly6C as an mTOR 
      target. Ly6C expression contributed to the enhanced Ig secretion from DKO PCs.
      Our data reveal a functional overlap between mTOR and the UPR in promoting PC
      development. In addition to the classical mTOR role in promoting protein
      synthesis, the mechanism entails transcription regulation of accessory molecules,
      such as Ly6C.

TI  - MondoA-Mlx transcriptional activity is limited by mTOR-MondoA interaction.
PG  - 101-10
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00636-14 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) integrates multiple signals, including
      nutrient status, growth factor availability, and stress, to regulate cellular and
      organismal growth. How mTOR regulates transcriptional programs in response to
      these diverse stimuli is poorly understood. MondoA and its obligate transcription
      partner Mlx are basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) transcription
      factors that sense and execute a glucose-responsive transcriptional program.
      MondoA-Mlx complexes activate expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein
      (TXNIP), which is a potent inhibitor of cellular glucose uptake and aerobic
      glycolysis. Both mTOR and MondoA are central regulators of glucose metabolism,
      yet whether they interact physically or functionally is unknown. We show that
      inhibition of mTOR induces MondoA-dependent expression of TXNIP, coinciding with 
      reduced glucose uptake. Mechanistically, mTOR binds to MondoA in the cytoplasm
      and prevents MondoA-Mlx complex formation, restricting MondoA's nuclear entry and
      reducing TXNIP expression. Further, we show that mTOR inhibitors and reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) regulate interaction between MondoA and mTOR in an opposing 
      manner. Like mTOR's suppression of the MondoA-TXNIP axis, MondoA can also
      suppress mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity via its direct transcriptional
      regulation of TXNIP. Collectively, these studies reveal a regulatory relationship
      between mTOR and the MondoA-TXNIP axis that we propose contributes to glucose
      homeostasis.

TI  - Structural and functional basis for p38-MK2-activated Rsk signaling in toll-like 
      receptor-stimulated dendritic cells.
PG  - 132-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00773-14 [doi]
AB  - Rsk kinases play important roles in several cellular processes such as
      proliferation, metabolism, and migration. Until recently, Rsk activation was
      thought to be exclusively initiated by Erk1/2, but in dendritic cells (DC) Rsk is
      also activated by p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase via its downstream
      substrates, MK2/3. How and why this noncanonical configuration of the MAP kinase 
      pathway is adopted by these key immune cells are not known. We demonstrate that
      the Erk1/2-activated C-terminal kinase domain of Rsk is dispensable for p38-MK2/3
      activation and show that compared with fibroblasts, a greater fraction of p38 and
      MK2/3 is located in the cytosol of DC prior to stimulation, suggesting a partial 
      explanation for the operation of the noncanonical pathway of Rsk activation in
      these cells. p38/MK2/3-activated Rsk phosphorylated downstream targets and is
      physiologically important because in plasmacytoid DC (pDC) stimulated with
      Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists, Erk1/2 activation is very weak relative to 
      p38. As a result, Rsk activation is entirely p38 dependent. We show that this
      unusual configuration of MAP kinase signaling contributes substantially to
      production of type I interferons, a hallmark of pDC activation.

TI  - LIM-only protein FHL2 is a positive regulator of liver X receptors in smooth
      muscle cells involved in lipid homeostasis.
PG  - 52-62
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00525-14 [doi]
AB  - The LIM-only protein FHL2 is expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and inhibits
      SMC-rich-lesion formation. To further elucidate the role of FHL2 in SMCs, we
      compared the transcriptomes of SMCs derived from wild-type (WT) and FHL2 knockout
      (KO) mice. This revealed that in addition to the previously recognized
      involvement of FHL2 in SMC proliferation, the cholesterol synthesis and liver X
      receptor (LXR) pathways are altered in the absence of FHL2. Using
      coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we found that FHL2 interacts with the two LXR 
      isoforms, LXRalpha and LXRbeta. Furthermore, FHL2 strongly enhances
      transcriptional activity of LXR element (LXRE)-containing reporter constructs.
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments on the ABCG1 promoter revealed
      that FHL2 enhances the association of LXRbeta with DNA. In line with these
      observations, we observed reduced basal transcriptional LXR activity in FHL2-KO
      SMCs compared to WT SMCs. This was also reflected in reduced expression of LXR
      target genes in intact aorta and aortic SMCs of FHL2-KO mice. Functionally, the
      absence of FHL2 resulted in attenuated cholesterol efflux to both ApoA-1 and
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL), in agreement with reduced LXR signaling.
      Collectively, our findings demonstrate that FHL2 is a transcriptional coactivator
      of LXRs and points toward FHL2 being an important determinant of cholesterol
      metabolism in SMCs.

TI  - Hepatic mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 selectively regulates
      glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis.
PG  - 26-40
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00503-14 [doi]
AB  - The liver plays a critical role in glucose metabolism and communicates with
      peripheral tissues to maintain energy homeostasis. Obesity and insulin resistance
      are highly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the
      precise molecular details of NAFLD remain incomplete. The p38 mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) regulate liver
      metabolism. However, the physiological contribution of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1)
      as a nuclear antagonist of both p38 MAPK and JNK in the liver is unknown. Here we
      show that hepatic MKP-1 becomes overexpressed following high-fat feeding.
      Liver-specific deletion of MKP-1 enhances gluconeogenesis and causes hepatic
      insulin resistance in chow-fed mice while selectively conferring protection from 
      hepatosteatosis upon high-fat feeding. Further, hepatic MKP-1 regulates both
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Mice lacking
      hepatic MKP-1 exhibit reduced circulating IL-6 and FGF21 levels that were
      associated with impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidation and
      susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. Hence, hepatic MKP-1 serves as a
      selective regulator of MAPK-dependent signals that contributes to the maintenance
      of glucose homeostasis and peripheral tissue energy balance. These results also
      demonstrate that hepatic MKP-1 overexpression in obesity is causally linked to
      the promotion of hepatosteatosis.

TI  - Immune cell inhibition by SLAMF7 is mediated by a mechanism requiring src
      kinases, CD45, and SHIP-1 that is defective in multiple myeloma cells.
PG  - 41-51
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01107-14 [doi]
AB  - Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7) is a receptor present on
      immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. It is also expressed on
      multiple myeloma (MM) cells. This led to development of an anti-SLAMF7 antibody, 
      elotuzumab, showing efficacy against MM. SLAMF7 mediates activating or inhibitory
      effects in NK cells, depending on whether cells express or do not express the
      adaptor EAT-2. Since MM cells lack EAT-2, we elucidated the inhibitory effectors 
      of SLAMF7 in EAT-2-negative NK cells and tested whether these effectors were
      triggered in MM cells. SLAMF7-mediated inhibition in NK cells lacking EAT-2 was
      mediated by SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1), which was
      recruited via tyrosine 261 of SLAMF7. Coupling of SLAMF7 to SHIP-1 required Src
      kinases, which phosphorylated SLAMF7. Although MM cells lack EAT-2, elotuzumab
      did not induce inhibitory signals in these cells. This was at least partly due to
      a lack of CD45, a phosphatase required for Src kinase activation. A defect in
      SLAMF7 function was also observed in CD45-deficient NK cells. Hence,
      SLAMF7-triggered inhibition is mediated by a mechanism involving Src kinases,
      CD45, and SHIP-1 that is defective in MM cells. This defect might explain why
      elotuzumab eliminates MM cells by an indirect mechanism involving the activation 
      of NK cells.

TI  - ATF1 modulates the heat shock response by regulating the stress-inducible heat
      shock factor 1 transcription complex.
PG  - 11-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00754-14 [doi]
AB  - The heat shock response is an evolutionally conserved adaptive response to high
      temperatures that controls proteostasis capacity and is regulated mainly by an
      ancient heat shock factor (HSF). However, the regulation of target genes by the
      stress-inducible HSF1 transcription complex has not yet been examined in detail
      in mammalian cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that HSF1 interacted
      with members of the ATF1/CREB family involved in metabolic homeostasis and
      recruited them on the HSP70 promoter in response to heat shock. The HSF1
      transcription complex, including the chromatin-remodeling factor BRG1 and lysine 
      acetyltransferases p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), was formed in a manner
      that was dependent on the phosphorylation of ATF1. ATF1-BRG1 promoted the
      establishment of an active chromatin state and HSP70 expression during heat
      shock, whereas ATF1-p300/CBP accelerated the shutdown of HSF1 DNA-binding
      activity during recovery from acute stress, possibly through the acetylation of
      HSF1. Furthermore, ATF1 markedly affected the resistance to heat shock. These
      results revealed the unanticipated complexity of the primitive heat shock
      response mechanism, which is connected to metabolic adaptation.
