TI  - Structural basis for the preference of the Arabidopsis thaliana phosphatase RLPH2
      for tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates.
LID - eaan8804 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan8804 [doi]
AB  - Despite belonging to the phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-specific
      phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family, Arabidopsis thaliana Rhizobiales-like
      phosphatase 2 (RLPH2) strongly prefers substrates bearing phosphorylated tyrosine
      residues. We solved the structures of RLPH2 crystallized in the presence or
      absence of sodium tungstate. These structures revealed the presence of a central 
      domain that forms a binding site for two divalent metal ions that closely
      resembles that of other PPP-family enzymes. Unique structural elements from two
      flanking domains suggest a mechanism for the selective dephosphorylation of
      phosphotyrosine residues. Cocrystallization with the phosphate mimetic tungstate 
      also suggests how positively charged residues that are highly conserved in the
      RLPH2 class form an additional pocket that is specific for a phosphothreonine
      residue located near the phosphotyrosine residue that is bound to the active
      site. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that this auxiliary recognition element
      facilitates the recruitment of dual-phosphorylated substrates containing a pTxpY 
      motif.

TI  - The nociceptin receptor inhibits axonal regeneration and recovery from spinal
      cord injury.
LID - eaao4180 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao4180 [doi]
AB  - Axonal growth after traumatic spinal cord injury is limited by endogenous
      inhibitors, selective blockade of which promotes partial neurological recovery.
      The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit
      improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in Ngr1, which encodes a 
      receptor for myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal regeneration such as Nogo,
      revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of ORL1, which encodes the
      receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin. Endogenous and overexpressed 
      ORL1 coimmunoprecipitated with immature NgR1 protein, and ORL1 enhanced the
      O-linked glycosylation and surface expression of NgR1 in HEK293T and Neuro2A
      cells and primary neurons. ORL1 overexpression inhibited cortical neuron axon
      regeneration independently of NgR1. Furthermore, regeneration was inhibited by an
      ORL1 agonist and enhanced by the ORL1 antagonist J113397 through a ROCK-dependent
      mechanism. Mice treated with J113397 after dorsal hemisection of the mid-thoracic
      spinal cord recovered greater locomotor function and exhibited lumbar raphespinal
      axon sprouting. These effects were further enhanced by combined Ngr1 deletion and
      ORL1 inhibition. Thus, ORL1 limits neural repair directly and indirectly by
      enhancing NgR1 maturation, and ORL1 antagonists enhance recovery from traumatic
      CNS injuries in wild-type and Ngr1 null mice.

TI  - Mutant and wild-type p53 form complexes with p73 upon phosphorylation by the
      kinase JNK.
LID - eaao4170 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao4170 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factors p53 and p73 are critical to the induction of apoptotic 
      cell death, particularly in response to cell stress that activates c-Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK). Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53, which are
      commonly seen in cancers, result in conformational changes that enable p53 to
      interact with and inhibit p73, thereby suppressing apoptosis. In contrast,
      wild-type p53 reportedly does not interact with p73. We found that JNK-mediated
      phosphorylation of Thr(81) in the proline-rich domain (PRD) of p53 enabled
      wild-type p53, as well as mutant p53, to form a complex with p73. Structural
      algorithms predicted that phosphorylation of Thr(81) exposes the DNA-binding
      domain in p53 to enable its binding to p73. The dimerization of wild-type p53
      with p73 facilitated the expression of apoptotic target genes [such as those
      encoding p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bcl-2-associated X
      protein (BAX)] and, subsequently, the induction of apoptosis in response to JNK
      activation by cell stress in various cells. Thus, JNK phosphorylation of mutant
      and wild-type p53 promotes the formation of a p53/p73 complex that determines
      cell fate: apoptosis in the context of wild-type p53 or cell survival in the
      context of the mutant. These findings refine our current understanding of both
      the mechanistic links between p53 and p73 and the functional role for Thr(81)
      phosphorylation.

TI  - A hierarchy of affinities between cytokine receptors and the common gamma chain
      leads to pathway cross-talk.
LID - eaal1253 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal1253 [doi]
AB  - Cytokines belonging to the common gamma chain (gammac) family depend on the
      shared gammac receptor subunit for signaling. We report the existence of a fast, 
      cytokine-induced pathway cross-talk acting at the receptor level, resulting from 
      a limiting amount of gammac on the surface of T cells. We found that this limited
      abundance of gammac reduced interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-21 responses after IL-7
      preexposure but not vice versa. Computational modeling combined with quantitative
      experimental assays indicated that the asymmetric cross-talk resulted from the
      ability of the "private" IL-7 receptor subunits (IL-7Ralpha) to bind to many of
      the gammac molecules even before stimulation with cytokine. Upon exposure of T
      cells to IL-7, the high affinity of the IL-7Ralpha:IL-7 complex for gammac
      further reduced the amount of free gammac in a manner dependent on the
      concentration of IL-7. Measurements of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 
      (BRET) between IL-4Ralpha and gammac were reduced when IL-7Ralpha was
      overexpressed. Furthermore, in a system expressing IL-7Ralpha, IL-4Ralpha, and
      gammac, BRET between IL-4Ralpha and gammac increased after IL-4 binding and
      decreased when cells were preexposed to IL-7, supporting the assumption that
      IL-7Ralpha and the IL-7Ralpha:IL-7 complex limit the accessibility of gammac for 
      other cytokine receptor complexes. We propose that in complex inflammatory
      environments, such asymmetric cross-talk establishes a hierarchy of cytokine
      responsiveness.

LID - eaao7227 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao7227 [doi]
AB  - The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of cytokines regulates
      various biological processes, including cell proliferation, immune responses,
      autophagy, and senescence. Dysregulation of TGF-beta signaling causes various
      diseases, such as cancer and fibrosis. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are core transcription
      factors involved in TGF-beta signaling, and they form heterotrimeric complexes
      with SMAD4 (SMAD2-SMAD2-SMAD4, SMAD3-SMAD3-SMAD4, and SMAD2-SMAD3-SMAD4) in
      response to TGF-beta signaling. These heterotrimeric complexes interact with
      cofactors to control the expression of TGF-beta-dependent genes. SMAD2 and SMAD3 
      may promote or repress target genes depending on whether they form complexes with
      other transcription factors, coactivators, or corepressors; therefore, the
      selection of specific cofactors is critical for the appropriate activity of these
      transcription factors. To reveal the structural basis by which SMAD2 and SMAD3
      select cofactors, we determined the crystal structures of SMAD3 in complex with
      the transcription factor FOXH1 and SMAD2 in complex with the transcriptional
      corepressor SKI. The structures of the complexes show that the MAD homology 2
      (MH2) domains of SMAD2 and SMAD3 have multiple hydrophobic patches on their
      surfaces. The cofactors tether to various subsets of these patches to interact
      with SMAD2 and SMAD3 in a cooperative or competitive manner to control the output
      of TGF-beta signaling.

TI  - Palmitoylation of delta-catenin promotes kinesin-mediated membrane trafficking of
      Nav1.6 in sensory neurons to promote neuropathic pain.
LID - eaar4394 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aar4394 [doi]
AB  - Palmitoylation of delta-catenin is critical to synapse plasticity and memory
      formation. We found that delta-catenin palmitoylation is also instrumental in the
      development of neuropathic pain. The abundances of palmitoylated delta-catenin
      and the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3 were increased in dorsal root ganglion
      (DRG) sensory neurons in rat models of neuropathic pain. Inhibiting palmitoyl
      acyltransferases or decreasing delta-catenin abundance in the DRG by intrathecal 
      injection of 2-bromopalmitate or shRNA, respectively, alleviated oxaliplatin or
      nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain in the rats. The palmitoylation of
      delta-catenin, which was induced by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha,
      facilitated its interaction with the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 and the 
      kinesin motor protein KIF3A, which promoted the trafficking of Nav1.6 to the
      plasma membrane in DRG neurons and contributed to mechanical hypersensitivity and
      allodynia in rats. These findings suggest that a palmitoylation-mediated
      KIF3A/delta-catenin/Nav1.6 complex enhances the transmission of mechanical and
      nociceptive signals; thus, blocking this mechanism may be therapeutic in patients
      with neuropathic pain.

AB  - Cancer cells can remodel surrounding microenvironments to facilitate cell growth,
      invasion, and migration by secreting proteins that educate surrounding stromal
      cells. We report that p85(S6K1), the longest isoform of S6K (ribosomal protein S6
      kinase), but not the shorter isoform p70(S6K1) or p56(S6K2), was secreted from
      cancer cells through its HIV TAT-like, N-terminal six-arginine motif. The
      exogenously produced p85(S6K1) protein entered cultured transformed and
      nontransformed cells to promote or confer malignant behaviors, leading to
      increased cell growth and migration. When injected into mice, the p85(S6K1)
      protein enhanced the growth of xenografted breast cancer cells and lung
      metastasis. Hence, our findings reveal a role for p85(S6K1) as a secreted
      oncogenic kinase and provide a mechanism by which cancer cells remodel their
      microenvironment by transforming the surrounding cells to drive tumorigenesis.

TI  - Pin1 mediates Abeta42-induced dendritic spine loss.
LID - eaap8734 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aap8734 [doi]
AB  - Early-stage Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the loss of dendritic spines 
      in the neocortex of the brain. This phenomenon precedes tau pathology, plaque
      formation, and neurodegeneration and likely contributes to synaptic loss, memory 
      impairment, and behavioral changes in patients. Studies suggest that dendritic
      spine loss is induced by soluble, multimeric amyloid-beta (Abeta42), which,
      through postsynaptic signaling, activates the protein phosphatase calcineurin. We
      investigated how calcineurin caused spine pathology and found that the cis-trans 
      prolyl isomerase Pin1 was a critical downstream target of Abeta42-calcineurin
      signaling. In dendritic spines, Pin1 interacted with and was dephosphorylated by 
      calcineurin, which rapidly suppressed its isomerase activity. Knockout of Pin1 or
      exposure to Abeta42 induced the loss of mature dendritic spines, which was
      prevented by exogenous Pin1. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocked dendritic
      spine loss in Abeta42-treated wild-type cells but had no effect on Pin1-null
      neurons. These data implicate Pin1 in dendritic spine maintenance and synaptic
      loss in early Alzheimer's disease.

      amyloid-beta.
LID - eaao6765 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao6765 [doi]
AB  - Acetylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau promotes its polymerization
      into neurofibrillary tangles that are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). The gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) regulates cell
      signaling through the nitrosylation of proteins. We found that NO production and 
      tau acetylation at Lys(280) occurred in the brain tissue in mice and in cultured 
      mouse cortical neurons in response to exposure to amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), a
      peptide that is also implicated in AD. An increased abundance of NO facilitated
      the S-nitrosylation (SNO) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
      S-nitrosylated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the
      acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the nitrosylation and inactivation of the 
      deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The abundance of GAPDH-SNO was increased in
      postmortem brain samples from AD patients. Preventing the increase in GAPDH-SNO
      abundance in both cultured neurons and mice, either by overexpression of the
      nitrosylation mutant of GAPDH (GAPDH C150S) or by treatment with the GAPDH
      nitrosylation inhibitor CGP3466B (also known as omigapil), abrogated
      Abeta1-42-induced tau acetylation, memory impairment, and locomotor dysfunction
      in mice, suggesting that this drug might be repurposed to treat patients with AD.

TI  - Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2
      induce hydrocephalus in a catalytically dependent manner.
LID - eaao1591 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao1591 [doi]
AB  - Catalytically activating mutations in Ptpn11, which encodes the protein tyrosine 
      phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas inactivating
      mutations in Ptpn11 are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but
      distinct, developmental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; 
      formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease mutations are
      gain-of-function mutations because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an
      open conformation. We found that the catalytic activity of SHP2 was required for 
      the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated mutations on the
      development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a
      Ptpn11 allele encoding the active SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due 
      to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic
      effects of the E76K mutation were suppressed by the additional mutation C459S,
      which abolished the catalytic activity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML
      mice bearing the inactive SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected.
      Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced developmental defects in ependymal 
      cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription
      activator STAT3. Whereas STAT3 activity was reduced in Ptpn11(E76K/+) cells, the 
      activities of the kinases ERK and AKT were enhanced, and neural cell-specific
      Stat3 knockout mice also manifested developmental defects in ependymal cells and 
      cilia. These genetic and biochemical data demonstrate a catalytic-dependent role 
      of SHP2 gain-of-function disease mutants in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.

TI  - TSLP signaling in CD4(+) T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state.
LID - eaam8858 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8858 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenic T helper 2 (TH2) cells, which produce increased amounts of the
      cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including
      asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial
      and innate immune cells, stimulates such pathogenic TH2 cell responses. We found 
      that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4(+) T cells initiated transcriptional changes
      associated with TH2 cell programming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the
      genomic response of T cells to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T cells
      producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4-programmed TH2
      cells had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and
      other proinflammatory cytokines than did TH2 cells stimulated with IL-4 alone.
      TSLP-mediated TH2 cell induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including 
      activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and
      repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4(+) 
      T cells had exacerbated pathogenic TH2 cell responses upon exposure to house dust
      mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor-deficient CD4(+) T cells.
      Transient TSLP signaling stably programmed pathogenic potential in memory TH2
      cells. In human CD4(+) T cells, TSLP and IL-4 promoted the generation of TH2
      cells that produced greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. Compared to healthy
      controls, asthmatic children showed enhancement of such T cell responses in
      peripheral blood. Our data support a sequential cytokine model for pathogenic TH2
      cell differentiation and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic
      targeting of TSLP signaling in human allergic diseases.

TI  - Extension of chemotactic pseudopods by nonadherent human neutrophils does not
      require or cause calcium bursts.
LID - eaal4289 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal4289 [doi]
AB  - Global bursts in free intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) are among the most
      conspicuous signaling events in immune cells. To test the common view that Ca(2+)
      bursts mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the
      activation of G protein-coupled receptors, we combined single-cell manipulation
      with fluorescence imaging and monitored the Ca(2+) concentration in individual
      human neutrophils during complement-mediated chemotaxis. By decoupling purely
      chemotactic pseudopod formation from cell-substrate adhesion, we showed that
      physiological concentrations of anaphylatoxins, such as C5a, induced nonadherent 
      human neutrophils to form chemotactic pseudopods but did not elicit Ca(2+)
      bursts. By contrast, pathological or supraphysiological concentrations of C5a
      often triggered Ca(2+) bursts, but pseudopod protrusion stalled or reversed in
      such cases, effectively halting chemotaxis, similar to sepsis-associated
      neutrophil paralysis. The maximum increase in cell surface area during pseudopod 
      extension in pure chemotaxis was much smaller-by a factor of 8-than the known
      capacity of adherent human neutrophils to expand their surface. Because the
      measured rise in cortical tension was not sufficient to account for this
      difference, we attribute the limited deformability to a reduced ability of the
      cytoskeleton to generate protrusive force in the absence of cell adhesion. Thus, 
      we hypothesize that Ca(2+) bursts in neutrophils control a mechanistic switch
      between two distinct modes of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. A key
      element of this switch appears to be the expedient coordination of
      adhesion-dependent lock or release events of cytoskeletal membrane anchors.

TI  - Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors.
LID - eaao3810 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao3810 [doi]
AB  - The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers,
      particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of PIK3CA
      occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule inhibitors
      targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting
      toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various
      resistance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have been identified, including de novo 
      mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a
      previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results
      in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell
      lines, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor or depletion of PIK3CA expression
      ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin
      ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1
      (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and
      metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2),
      but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP3 production. Resistance to PI3K
      inhibitors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of
      AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These
      findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor 
      resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.

      IL-17-producing T cells and psoriasiform skin inflammation.
LID - eaao1685 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao1685 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis. In a mouse model of
      imiquimod-induced psoriasiform skin inflammation, we found that p38alpha activity
      in Langerhans cells (LCs), a skin-resident subset of DCs, promoted the generation
      of T cells that produce IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine that is implicated in
      autoimmune disease. Deletion of p38alpha in LCs, but not in other skin or
      circulating DC subsets or T cells, decreased T cell-mediated psoriasiform skin
      inflammation in mice. The activity of p38alpha in LCs specifically promoted IL-17
      production from gammadelta and CD4(+) T cells by increasing the abundance of
      IL-23 and IL-6, two cytokines that stimulate IL-17 secretion. Inhibition of p38
      activity through either pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion also
      reduced the severity of established psoriasiform skin inflammation. Together, our
      findings indicate a critical role for p38alpha signaling in LCs in promoting
      inflammatory responses in the skin and suggest that targeting p38alpha signaling 
      in LCs may offer an effective therapeutic approach to treat psoriasis.

TI  - A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and
      its modulation by early-life stress.
LID - eaan6480 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan6480 [doi]
AB  - Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic
      CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to
      stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in
      value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of
      dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is
      associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders.
      We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal
      excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein
      kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb
      neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance
      BK-type K(+) channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric
      acid-containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through
      endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe
      early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated
      with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of
      maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic
      transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity 
      of PKA, without any substantial changes in Crh or Crhr1 expression. Furthermore, 
      maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF
      exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity
      prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic
      excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse
      central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.

      and small molecules in real time. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is one of
      the most important signaling molecules in virtually all cell types and organisms.
      We describe cAMPr, a new single-wavelength cAMP sensor. We developed cAMPr in
      bacteria and embryonic stem cells and validated the sensor in mammalian neurons
      in vitro and in Drosophila circadian pacemaker neurons in intact brains.
      Comparison with other single-wavelength cAMP sensors showed that cAMPr improved
      the quantitative detection of cAMP abundance. In addition, cAMPr is compatible
      with both single-photon and two-photon imaging. This enabled us to use cAMPr
      together with the red fluorescent Ca(2+) sensor RCaMP1h to simultaneously monitor
      Ca(2+) and cAMP in Drosophila brains. Thus, cAMPr is a new and versatile
      genetically encoded cAMP sensor.

TI  - Splenic leukocytes define the resolution of inflammation in heart failure.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao1818 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation promotes healing in myocardial infarction but, if unresolved, leads 
      to heart failure. To define the inflammatory and resolving responses, we
      quantified leukocyte trafficking and specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in
      the infarcted left ventricle and spleen after myocardial infarction, with the
      goal of distinguishing inflammation from its resolution. Our data suggest that
      the spleen not only served as a leukocyte reservoir but also was the site where
      SPMs were actively generated after coronary ligation in mice. Before myocardial
      infarction, SPMs were more abundant in the spleen than in the left ventricle. At 
      day 1 after coronary ligation, the spleen was depleted of leukocytes, a
      phenomenon that was associated with greater numbers of leukocytes in the
      infarcted left ventricle and increased generation of SPMs at the same site,
      particularly resolvins, maresin, lipoxins, and protectin. In addition, the
      infarcted left ventricle showed increased expression of genes encoding
      lipoxygenases and enhanced production of SPMs generated by these enzymes. We
      found that macrophages were necessary for SPM generation. The abundance of SPMs
      in the spleen before myocardial infarction and increased SPM concentrations in
      the infarcted left ventricle within 24 hours after myocardial infarction were
      temporally correlated with the resolution of inflammation. Thus, the acute
      inflammatory response coincided with the active resolving phase in
      post-myocardial infarction and suggests that further investigation into
      macrophage-derived SPMs in heart failure is warranted.

      compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition.
LID - eaal1601 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal1601 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint
      pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new drugs has
      proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature 
      of intracellular signaling networks that complicate the effects of
      pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase signaling pathways
      that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted
      inhibitors. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase signaling
      pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell
      type that promotes RA progression. Kinase inhibitors enhanced signaling of
      "off-target" pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. Inhibitors of
      p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in
      undesirable increases in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), JNK, and MEK
      signaling in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated 
      by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative
      feedback loop in MAPK signaling. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38
      in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli;
      hence, the effects of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs
      cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings
      illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even
      for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38
      inhibitors deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful 
      consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.

      coronary artery remodeling.
LID - eaah5770 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah5770 [doi]
AB  - During coronary vasculature development, endothelial cells enclose the embryonic 
      heart to form the primitive coronary plexus. This structure is remodeled upon
      recruitment of epicardial cells that may undergo epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) to enable migration and that give rise to smooth muscle cells.
      In mice expressing a loss-of-function mutant form of Wdpcp, a gene involved in
      ciliogenesis, the enclosure of the surface of the heart by the subepicardial
      coronary plexus was accelerated because of enhanced chemotactic responses to Shh.
      Coronary arteries, but not coronary veins in Wdpcp mutant mice, showed reduced
      smooth muscle cell coverage. In addition, Wdpcp mutant hearts had reduced
      expression of EMT and mesenchymal markers and had fewer epicardium-derived cells 
      (EPDCs) that showed impaired migration. Epicardium-specific deletion of Wdpcp
      recapitulated the coronary artery defect of the Wdpcp mutant. Thus, Wdpcp
      promotes epithelial EMT and EPDC migration, processes that are required for
      remodeling of the coronary primitive plexus. The Wdpcp mutant mice will be a
      useful tool to dissect the molecular mechanisms that govern the remodeling of the
      primitive plexus during coronary development.

TI  - Convergence of Wnt, growth factor, and heterotrimeric G protein signals on the
      guanine nucleotide exchange factor Daple.
LID - eaao4220 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao4220 [doi]
AB  - Cellular proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis are shaped by multiple
      signaling cascades, and their dysregulation plays an integral role in cancer
      progression. Three cascades that contribute to oncogenic potential are those
      mediated by Wnt proteins and the receptor Frizzled (FZD), growth factor receptor 
      tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and heterotrimeric G proteins and associated GPCRs.
      Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G protein Galphai
      Daple also binds to FZD and the Wnt/FZD mediator Dishevelled (Dvl), and it
      enhances beta-catenin-independent Wnt signaling in response to Wnt5a-FZD7
      signaling. We identified Daple as a substrate of multiple RTKs and non-RTKs and, 
      hence, as a point of convergence for the three cascades. We found that
      phosphorylation near the Dvl-binding motif in Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs
      caused Daple/Dvl complex dissociation and augmented the ability of Daple to bind 
      to and activate Galphai, which potentiated beta-catenin-independent Wnt signals
      and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) similarly to Wnt5a/FZD7
      signaling. Although Daple acts as a tumor suppressor in the healthy colon, the
      concurrent increased abundance of Daple and epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) in colorectal tumors was associated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, the
      Daple-dependent activation of Galphai and the Daple-dependent enhancement of
      beta-catenin-independent Wnt signals are not only stimulated by Wnt5a/FZD7 to
      suppress tumorigenesis but also hijacked by growth factor-activated RTKs to
      enhance tumor progression. These findings identify a cross-talk paradigm among
      growth factor RTKs, heterotrimeric G proteins, and the Wnt/FZD pathway in cancer.

TI  - Integrated in vivo multiomics analysis identifies p21-activated kinase signaling

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal
      tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the pathogenesis
      of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis
      that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and
      phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we
      collected all three types of data from individual samples, we tracked information
      flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules
      that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex
      regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were
      expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during 
      inflammation. We also ascertained the types of data that best described
      particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and
      trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each data set provided a
      distinct viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Combining human
      transcriptomic data with the mouse multiomics data implicated increased
      p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition 
      of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies
      provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and
      identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.

TI  - Coordinating the overall stomatal response of plants: Rapid leaf-to-leaf
      communication during light stress.
LID - eaam9514 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam9514 [doi]
AB  - The plant canopy functions as an aerial array of light-harvesting antennas. To
      achieve maximal yield, each leaf within this array and the array as a whole need 
      to rapidly adjust to naturally occurring fluctuations in light intensity and
      quality. Excessive light stress triggers the closing of pores in leaves called
      stomata to minimize moisture loss. We found that different leaves within the
      canopy of an Arabidopsis thaliana plant, including leaves not directly exposed to
      light, coordinated stomatal closure in response to light stress by sending and
      receiving rapid systemic signals. This response required the plant hormones
      abscisic acid and jasmonic acid and was mediated by a rapid autopropagating wave 
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, this response depended 
      on the function of genes encoding the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase RBOHD and
      various stomatal regulators, such as the anion channel SLAC1, GHR1 (guard cell
      hydrogen peroxide resistant 1), and lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1). Our findings reveal
      that plants function as highly dynamic and coordinated organisms, optimizing the 
      overall response of their canopies to fluctuating light intensities.

TI  - A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane
      salt bridge to activate beta-arrestin-biased signaling.
LID - eaan3714 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan3714 [doi]
AB  - The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that
      signals through Gq/11 and Gi/o to stimulate cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)i) and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to control extracellular
      calcium homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function CASR mutations, which 
      cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant
      hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR signals in 
      a biased manner. Thus, some mutations associated with FHH1 lead to signaling
      predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas mutations associated with ADH1
      preferentially enhance Ca(2+)i responses. We report a previously unidentified
      ADH1-associated R680G CaSR mutation, which led to the identification of a CaSR
      structural motif that mediates biased signaling. Expressing CaSR(R680G) in HEK
      293 cells showed that this mutation increased MAPK signaling without altering
      Ca(2+)i responses. Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred
      independently of Gq/11 and Gi/o and was mediated instead by a noncanonical
      pathway involving beta-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and mutagenesis
      studies showed that the R680G CaSR mutation selectively enhanced beta-arrestin
      signaling by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg(680) and Glu(767), which
      are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2,
      respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate CaSR signaling through beta-arrestin 
      and the importance of the Arg(680)-Glu(767) salt bridge in mediating signaling
      bias.

TI  - The intracellular pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase NT5C3A is a negative epigenetic
      factor in interferon and cytokine signaling.
LID - eaal2434 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal2434 [doi]
AB  - The enzyme pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (NT5C3A), which mediates nucleotide
      catabolism, was previously thought to be restricted to blood cells. We showed
      that expression of the gene encoding NT5C3A was induced by type I interferons
      (IFNs) in multiple cell types and that NT5C3A suppressed cytokine production
      through inhibition of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. NT5C3A
      expression required both an intronic IFN-stimulated response element and the
      IFN-stimulated transcription factor IRF1. Overexpression of NT5C3A, but not of
      its catalytic mutants, suppressed IL-8 production by HEK293 cells. Whereas
      knockdown of NT5C3A enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated IL-8
      production, it reduced the IFN-mediated suppression of Il8 expression.
      Overexpression of NT5C3A increased the abundance of NAD(+) and the activation of 
      the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6, which are NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases.
      NT5C3A-stimulated sirtuin activity resulted in deacetylation of histone H3 and
      the NF-kappaB subunit RelA (also known as p65), both of which were associated
      with the proximal region of the Il8 promoter, thus repressing the transcription
      of Il8 Together, these data identify an anti-inflammatory pathway that depends on
      the catalytic activity of NT5C3A and functions as a negative feedback regulator
      of inflammatory cytokine signaling.

TI  - Abl and Arg mediate cysteine cathepsin secretion to facilitate melanoma invasion 
      and metastasis.
LID - eaao0422 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao0422 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of melanoma is increasing, particularly in young women, and the
      disease remains incurable for many because of its aggressive, metastatic nature
      and its high rate of resistance to conventional, targeted, and immunological
      agents. Cathepsins are proteases that are critical for melanoma progression and
      therapeutic resistance. Intracellular cathepsins cleave or degrade proteins that 
      restrict cancer progression, whereas extracellular cathepsins directly cleave the
      extracellular matrix and activate proinvasive proteases in the tumor
      microenvironment. Cathepsin secretion is markedly increased in cancer cells. We
      investigated the signaling pathways leading to increased cathepsin secretion in
      melanoma cells. We found that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Abl and Arg
      (Abl/Arg) promoted the secretion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L by activating
      transcription factors (namely, Ets1, Sp1, and NF-kappaB/p65) that have key roles 
      in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and therapeutic
      resistance. In some melanoma cell lines, Abl/Arg promoted the Ets1/p65-induced
      secretion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L in a kinase-independent manner, whereas 
      in other melanoma lines, Abl/Arg promoted the kinase-dependent,
      Sp1/Ets1/p65-mediated induction of cathepsin L secretion and the Sp1/p65-mediated
      induction of cathepsin B secretion. As an indication of clinical relevance, the
      abundance of mRNAs encoding Abl/Arg, Sp1, Ets1, and cathepsins was positively
      correlated in primary melanomas, and Abl/Arg-driven invasion in culture and
      metastasis in vivo required cathepsin secretion. These data suggest that drugs
      targeting Abl kinases, many of which are FDA-approved, might inhibit cathepsin
      secretion in some melanomas and potentially other aggressive cancers harboring
      activated Abl kinases.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam9899 [doi]
AB  - Polarity is a fundamental property of most cell types. The Par protein complex is
      a major driving force in generating asymmetrically localized protein networks and
      consists of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Par3, and Par6. Dysfunction of this
      complex causes developmental abnormalities and diseases such as cancer. We
      identified a PDZ domain-binding motif in Par6 that was essential for its
      interaction with Par3 in vitro and for Par3-mediated membrane localization of
      Par6 in cultured cells. In fly embryos, we observed that the PDZ domain-binding
      motif was functionally redundant with the PDZ domain in targeting Par6 to the
      cortex of epithelial cells. Our structural analyses by x-ray crystallography and 
      NMR spectroscopy showed that both the PDZ1 and PDZ3 domains but not the PDZ2
      domain in Par3 engaged in a canonical interaction with the PDZ domain-binding
      motif in Par6. Par3 thus has the potential to recruit two Par6 proteins
      simultaneously, which may facilitate the assembly of polarity protein networks
      through multivalent PDZ domain interactions.

TI  - Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor
      NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A.
LID - eaai9200 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai9200 [doi]
AB  - Educated natural killer (NK) cells have inhibitory receptors specific for self
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and kill cancer cells
      more efficiently than do NK cells that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive
      NK cells). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through education has
      so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of
      educated NK cells at the single-cell level are lacking. We developed a refined
      version of the image mean square displacement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet
      analysis) and used it in combination with single-particle tracking to
      characterize the dynamics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory
      receptor Ly49A on resting educated versus hyporesponsive murine NK cells. Most of
      the NKp46 and Ly49A molecules were restricted to microdomains; however,
      individual NKp46 molecules resided in these domains for shorter periods and
      diffused faster on the surface of educated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK cells.
      In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in educated NK cells
      compared to hyporesponsive NK cells. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or 
      adding cholesterol to the cells prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that 
      the dynamics of receptor movements within the cell membrane are critical for the 
      proper activation of NK cells. The faster and more dynamic movement of NKp46 in
      educated NK cells may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target
      cells.

TI  - The unfolded protein response regulator ATF6 promotes mesodermal differentiation.
LID - eaan5785 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan5785 [doi]
AB  - ATF6 encodes a transcription factor that is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) and activated during the unfolded protein response (UPR) to protect cells
      from ER stress. Deletion of the isoform activating transcription factor 6alpha
      (ATF6alpha) and its paralog ATF6beta results in embryonic lethality and notochord
      dysgenesis in nonhuman vertebrates, and loss-of-function mutations in ATF6alpha
      are associated with malformed neuroretina and congenital vision loss in humans.
      These phenotypes implicate an essential role for ATF6 during vertebrate
      development. We investigated this hypothesis using human stem cells undergoing
      differentiation into multipotent germ layers, nascent tissues, and organs. We
      artificially activated ATF6 in stem cells with a small-molecule ATF6 agonist and,
      conversely, inhibited ATF6 using induced pluripotent stem cells from patients
      with ATF6 mutations. We found that ATF6 suppressed pluripotency, enhanced
      differentiation, and unexpectedly directed mesodermal cell fate. Our findings
      reveal a role for ATF6 during differentiation and identify a new strategy to
      generate mesodermal tissues through the modulation of the ATF6 arm of the UPR.

      Sonic Hedgehog.
LID - eaao5749 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao5749 [doi]
AB  - The morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) patterns tissues during development by
      directing cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner. The SHH signal is
      transmitted across the membrane of target cells by the heptahelical transmembrane
      protein Smoothened (SMO), which activates the GLI family of transcription factors
      through a mechanism that is undefined in vertebrates. Using CRISPR-edited null
      alleles and small-molecule inhibitors, we systematically analyzed the epistatic
      interactions between SMO and three proteins implicated in SMO signaling: the
      heterotrimeric G protein subunit GalphaS, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2
      (GRK2), and the GalphaS-coupled receptor GPR161. Our experiments uncovered a
      signaling mechanism that modifies the sensitivity of target cells to SHH and
      consequently changes the shape of the SHH dose-response curve. In both
      fibroblasts and spinal neural progenitors, the loss of GPR161, previously
      implicated as an inhibitor of basal SHH signaling, increased the sensitivity of
      target cells across the entire spectrum of SHH concentrations. Even in cells
      lacking GPR161, GRK2 was required for SHH signaling, and Galphas, which promotes 
      the activation of protein Kinase A (PKA), antagonized SHH signaling. We propose
      that the sensitivity of target cells to Hedgehog morphogens, and the consequent
      effects on gene expression and differentiation outcomes, can be controlled by
      signals from G protein-coupled receptors that converge on Galphas and PKA.

TI  - The CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex controls Atg7-dependent cell death and heart
      function.
LID - eaan3638 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan3638 [doi]
AB  - Shortening and removal of the polyadenylate [poly(A)] tail of mRNA, a process
      called deadenylation, is a key step in mRNA decay that is mediated through the
      CCR4-NOT (carbon catabolite repression 4-negative on TATA-less) complex. In our
      investigation of the regulation of mRNA deadenylation in the heart, we found that
      this complex was required to prevent cell death. Conditional deletion of the
      CCR4-NOT complex components Cnot1 or Cnot3 resulted in the formation of
      autophagic vacuoles and cardiomyocyte death, leading to lethal heart failure
      accompanied by long QT intervals. Cnot3 bound to and shortened the poly(A) tail
      of the mRNA encoding the key autophagy regulator Atg7. In Cnot3-depleted hearts, 
      Atg7 expression was posttranscriptionally increased. Genetic ablation of Atg7,
      but not Atg5, increased survival and partially restored cardiac function of Cnot1
      or Cnot3 knockout mice. We further showed that in Cnot3-depleted hearts, Atg7
      interacted with p53 and modulated p53 activity to induce the expression of genes 
      encoding cell death-promoting factors in cardiomyocytes, indicating that defects 
      in deadenylation in the heart aberrantly activated Atg7 and p53 to promote cell
      death. Thus, mRNA deadenylation mediated by the CCR4-NOT complex is crucial to
      prevent Atg7-induced cell death and heart failure, suggesting a role for mRNA
      deadenylation in targeting autophagy genes to maintain normal cardiac
      homeostasis.

TI  - Hedgehog reciprocally controls trafficking of Smo and Ptc through the Smurf
      family of E3 ubiquitin ligases.
LID - eaan8660 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan8660 [doi]
AB  - Hedgehog (Hh) induces signaling by promoting the reciprocal trafficking of its
      receptor Patched (Ptc) and the signal transducer Smoothened (Smo), which is
      inhibited by Ptc, at the cell surface. We identified Smurf family E3 ubiquitin
      ligases as essential for Smo ubiquitylation and cell surface clearance and
      demonstrated that Smurf family members mediate the reciprocal trafficking of Ptc 
      and Smo in Drosophila melanogaster G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2
      (Gprk2)-mediated phosphorylation of Smurf promoted Smo ubiquitylation by
      increasing the recruitment of Smurf to Smo, whereas protein kinase A
      (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Smo caused Smurf to dissociate from Smo,
      thereby inhibiting Smo ubiquitylation. Smo and Ptc competed for the same pool of 
      Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases, and Hh promoted Ptc ubiquitylation and
      degradation by disrupting the association of Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases
      with Smo and stimulating their binding to Ptc. Our study identifies the E3
      ubiquitin ligases that target Smo and provides insight into how Hh regulates the 
      reciprocal trafficking of its receptor and signal transducer.

AB  - Cytoskeletal networks are dramatically reorganized upon EGF stimulation to enable
      complex cell behaviors such as cell-cell communication, migration and invasion,

      cellular functions.
LID - eaal2039 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal2039 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescent Ca(2+) indicators have been essential for the analysis of Ca(2+)
      signaling events in various cell types. We showed that chemical Ca(2+)
      indicators, but not a genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator, potently suppressed
      the activity of Na(+)- and K(+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase),
      independently of their Ca(2+) chelating activity. Loading of commonly used Ca(2+)
      indicators, including Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl (AM), Rhod-2 AM, and Fura-2 AM, and of
      the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA AM into cultured mouse or human neurons, astrocytes,
      cardiomyocytes, or kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells suppressed Na,K-ATPase
      activity by 30 to 80%. Ca(2+) indicators also suppressed the agonist-induced
      activation of the Na,K-ATPase, altered metabolic status, and caused a
      dose-dependent loss of cell viability. Loading of Ca(2+) indicators into mice,
      which is carried out for two-photon imaging, markedly altered brain extracellular
      concentrations of K(+) and ATP. These results suggest that a critical review of
      data obtained with chemical Ca(2+) indicators may be necessary.

TI  - KIF22 coordinates CAR and EGFR dynamics to promote cancer cell proliferation.
LID - eaaq1060 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaq1060 [doi]
AB  - The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a transmembrane receptor that
      plays a key role in cell-cell adhesion. CAR is found in normal epithelial cells
      and is increased in abundance in various human tumors, including lung carcinomas.
      We investigated the potential mechanisms by which CAR contributes to cancer cell 
      growth and found that depletion of CAR in human lung cancer cells reduced
      anchorage-independent growth, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent
      proliferation, and tumor growth in vivo. EGF induced the phosphorylation of CAR
      and its subsequent relocalization to cell junctions through the activation of the
      kinase PKCdelta. EGF promoted the binding of CAR to the chromokinesin KIF22.
      KIF22-dependent regulation of microtubule dynamics led to delayed EGFR
      internalization, enhanced EGFR signaling, and coordination of CAR dynamics at
      cell-cell junctions. These data suggest a role for KIF22 in the coordination of
      membrane receptors and provide potential new therapeutic strategies to combat
      lung tumor growth.

TI  - SILAC identifies LAD1 as a filamin-binding regulator of actin dynamics in
      response to EGF and a marker of aggressive breast tumors.
LID - eaan0949 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan0949 [doi]
AB  - Mutations mimicking growth factor-induced proliferation and motility characterize
      aggressive subtypes of mammary tumors. To unravel currently unknown players in
      these processes, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis on untransformed mammary 
      epithelial cells (MCF10A) that were stimulated in culture with epidermal growth
      factor (EGF). We identified ladinin-1 (LAD1), a largely uncharacterized protein
      to date, as a phosphorylation-regulated mediator of the EGF-to-ERK pathway.
      Further experiments revealed that LAD1 mediated the proliferation and migration
      of mammary cells. LAD1 was transcriptionally induced, phosphorylated, and partly 
      colocalized with actin stress fibers in response to EGF. Yeast two-hybrid,
      proximity ligation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that LAD1 bound to 
      actin-cross-linking proteins called filamins. Cosedimentation analyses indicated 
      that LAD1 played a role in actin dynamics, probably in collaboration with the
      scaffold protein 14-3-3sigma (also called SFN). Depletion of LAD1 decreased the
      expression of transcripts associated with cell survival and inhibited the growth 
      of mammary xenografts in an animal model. Furthermore, LAD1 predicts poor patient
      prognosis and is highly expressed in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer
      characterized as integrative clusters 5 and 10, which partly correspond to
      triple-negative and HER2-positive tumors. Thus, these findings reveal a
      cytoskeletal component that is critically involved in cell migration and the
      acquisition of oncogenic attributes in human mammary tumors.

TI  - Intracellular cavity of sensor domain controls allosteric gating of TRPA1
      channel.
LID - eaan8621 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan8621 [doi]
AB  - Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a temperature-sensitive ion
      channel activated by various pungent and irritant compounds that can produce pain
      in humans. Its activation involves an allosteric mechanism whereby electrophilic 
      agonists evoke interactions within cytosolic domains and open the channel pore
      through an integrated nexus formed by intracellular membrane proximal regions
      that are densely packed beneath the lower segment of the S1-S4 sensor domain.
      Studies indicate that this part of the channel may contain residues that form a
      water-accessible cavity that undergoes changes in solvation during channel
      gating. We identified conserved polar residues facing the putative lower crevice 
      of the sensor domain that were crucial determinants of the electrophilic,
      voltage, and calcium sensitivity of the TRPA1 channel. This part of the sensor
      may also comprise a domain capable of binding to membrane phosphoinositides
      through which gating of the channel is regulated in a state-dependent manner.

TI  - Guanabenz inhibits TLR9 signaling through a pathway that is independent of
      eIF2alpha dephosphorylation by the GADD34/PP1c complex.
LID - eaam8104 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8104 [doi]
AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers or amplifies inflammatory signals and 
      cytokine production in immune cells. Upon the resolution of ER stress, the
      inducible phosphatase 1 cofactor GADD34 promotes the dephosphorylation of the
      initiation factor eIF2alpha, thereby enabling protein translation to resume.
      Several aminoguanidine compounds, such as guanabenz, perturb the eIF2alpha
      phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle and protect different cell or tissue
      types from protein misfolding and degeneration. We investigated how
      pharmacological interference with the eIF2alpha pathway could be beneficial to
      treat autoinflammatory diseases dependent on proinflammatory cytokines and type I
      interferons (IFNs), the production of which is regulated by GADD34 in dendritic
      cells (DCs). In mouse and human DCs and B cells, guanabenz prevented the
      activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides or
      DNA-immunoglobulin complexes in endosomes. In vivo, guanabenz protected mice from
      CpG oligonucleotide-dependent cytokine shock and decreased autoimmune symptom
      severity in a chemically induced model of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, 
      we found that guanabenz exerted its inhibitory effect independently of GADD34
      activity on eIF2alpha and instead decreased the abundance of CH25H, a cholesterol
      hydroxylase linked to antiviral immunity. Our results therefore suggest that
      guanabenz and similar compounds could be used to treat type I IFN-dependent
      pathologies and that CH25H could be a therapeutic target to control these
      diseases.

TI  - Biased signaling by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor-specific antibodies
      determines thyrocyte survival in autoimmunity.
LID - eaah4120 [pii]

AB  - The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR). Autoimmune
      hyperthyroidism, commonly known as Graves' disease (GD), is caused by stimulating
      autoantibodies to the TSHR. We previously described TSHR-specific antibodies
      (TSHR-Abs) in GD that recognize linear epitopes in the cleavage region of the
      TSHR ectodomain (C-TSHR-Abs) and induce thyroid cell apoptosis instead of
      stimulating the TSHR. We found that C-TSHR-Abs entered the cell through
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis but did not trigger endosomal maturation and failed
      to undergo normal vesicular sorting and trafficking. We found that stimulating
      TSHR-Abs (S-TSHR-Abs) activated Galphas and, to a lesser extent, Galphaq but that
      C-TSHR-Abs failed to activate any of the G proteins normally activated in
      response to TSH. Furthermore, specific inhibition of G proteins in the presence
      of S-TSHR-mAbs or TSH resulted in a similar failure of endosomal maturation as
      that caused by C-TSHR-mAbs. Hence, whereas S-TSHR-mAbs and TSH contributed to
      normal vesicular trafficking of TSHR through the activation of major G proteins, 
      the C-TSHR-Abs resulted in GRK2- and beta-arrestin-1-dependent biased signaling, 
      which is interpreted as a danger signal by the cell. Our observations suggest
      that the binding of antibodies to different TSHR epitopes may decrease cell
      survival. Antibody-induced cell injury and the response to cell death amplify the
      loss of self-tolerance, which most likely helps to perpetuate GPCR-mediated
      autoimmunity.

AB  - Altered neuronal network formation and function involving dysregulated excitatory
      and inhibitory circuits are associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We examined
      functional maturation of the excitatory transmission system in FXS by
      investigating the response of FXS patient-derived neural progenitor cells to the 
      glutamate analog (AMPA). Neural progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem
      cell (iPSC) lines generated from boys with FXS had augmented intracellular Ca(2+)
      responses to AMPA and kainate that were mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA
      receptors (CP-AMPARs) lacking the GluA2 subunit. Together with the enhanced
      differentiation of glutamate-responsive cells, the proportion of CP-AMPAR and
      N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-coexpressing cells was increased in human
      FXS progenitors. Differentiation of cells lacking GluA2 was also increased and
      paralleled the increased inward rectification in neural progenitors derived from 
      Fmr1-knockout mice (the FXS mouse model). Human FXS progenitors had increased the
      expression of the precursor and mature forms of miR-181a, a microRNA that
      represses translation of the transcript encoding GluA2. Blocking GluA2-lacking,
      CP-AMPARs reduced the neurite length of human iPSC-derived control progenitors
      and further reduced the shortened length of neurites in human FXS progenitors,
      supporting the contribution of CP-AMPARs to the regulation of progenitor
      differentiation. Furthermore, we observed reduced expression of Gria2 (the
      GluA2-encoding gene) in the frontal lobe of FXS mice, consistent with functional 
      changes of AMPARs in FXS. Increased Ca(2+) influx through CP-AMPARs may increase 
      the vulnerability and affect the differentiation and migration of distinct cell
      populations, which may interfere with normal circuit formation in FXS.

      hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
LID - eaan6831 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan6831 [doi]
AB  - The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein
      (BMP) family of cytokines critically regulates vascular morphogenesis and
      homeostasis. Impairment of TGF-beta or BMP signaling leads to heritable vascular 
      disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Drosha, a key
      enzyme for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, also regulates the TGF-beta and BMP
      pathway through interaction with Smads and their joint control of gene expression
      through miRNAs. We report that mice lacking Drosha in the vascular endothelium
      developed a vascular phenotype resembling HHT that included dilated and
      disorganized vasculature, arteriovenous fistulae, and hemorrhages. Exome
      sequencing of HHT patients who lacked known pathogenic mutations revealed an
      overrepresentation of rare nonsynonymous variants of DROSHA Two of these DROSHA
      variants (P100L and R279L) did not interact with Smads and were partially
      catalytically active. In zebrafish, expression of these mutants or
      morpholino-directed knockdown of Drosha resulted in angiogenesis defects and
      abnormal vascular permeability. Together, our studies point to an essential role 
      of Drosha in vascular development and the maintenance of vascular integrity, and 
      reveal a previously unappreciated link between Drosha dysfunction and HHT.

TI  - Learning-dependent chromatin remodeling highlights noncoding regulatory regions
      linked to autism.
LID - eaan6500 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan6500 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is
      associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather are in
      regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of regulatory
      regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels between the
      cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long
      been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic mechanisms in both
      processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse
      hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we
      call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of
      data from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes
      in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions-most of which were
      promoters. Learning-regulated promoters were active during forebrain development 
      in mice and were enriched in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent
      promoters. These promoters were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex
      relationship with gene expression and alternative splicing during memory
      consolidation and retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known 
      ASD risk genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters
      (SHANK3 promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our 
      data support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic
      level and demonstrate that behaviorally induced epigenetic changes in mice can
      highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain disorders in patients.

      deprivation-induced cell death independently of inhibiting glycolysis.
LID - eaam7893 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam7893 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells increase glucose metabolism to support aerobic glycolysis. However, 
      only some cancer cells are acutely sensitive to glucose withdrawal, and the
      underlying mechanism of this selective sensitivity is unclear. We showed that
      glucose deprivation initiates a cell death pathway in cancer cells that is
      dependent on the kinase RIPK1. Glucose withdrawal triggered rapid plasma membrane
      depolarization and an influx of extracellular calcium into the cell through the
      L-type calcium channel Cav1.3 (CACNA1D), followed by activation of the kinase
      CAMK1. CAMK1 and the demethylase PPME1 were required for the subsequent
      demethylation and inactivation of the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase PP2A
      (PP2Ac) and the phosphorylation of RIPK1. Plasma membrane depolarization, PP2Ac
      demethylation, and cell death were prevented by glucose and, unexpectedly, by its
      nonmetabolizable analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor. These
      findings reveal a previously unknown function of glucose as a signaling molecule 
      that protects cells from death induced by plasma membrane depolarization,
      independently of its role in glycolysis. Components of this cancer cell death
      pathway represent potential therapeutic targets against cancer.

TI  - ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable
      pathways.
LID - eaan5598 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan5598 [doi]
AB  - The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also 
      responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, 
      a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar
      dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the 
      activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by oxidative stress using
      separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by
      the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of
      cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA
      damage. In contrast, loss of oxidative activation of ATM had minimal effects on
      DNA damage-related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint
      responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial
      function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of
      activation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These 
      results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation
      and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells
      and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.

TI  - beta-Arrestin-biased beta-adrenergic signaling promotes extinction learning of
      cocaine reward memory.
LID - eaam5402 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam5402 [doi]
AB  - Extinction learning of cocaine-associated contextual cues can help prevent
      cocaine addicts from relapsing. Pharmacological manipulation of beta-adrenergic
      receptor (beta-AR) during extinction learning is being developed as a potential
      strategy to treat drug addiction. We demonstrated that the extinction learning of
      cocaine-associated memory was mediated by beta-arrestin2-biased but not
      heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-dependent
      beta-adrenergic signaling. We found that administration of the nonbiased beta-AR 
      antagonist propranolol, but not the G protein-biased beta-AR antagonist
      carvedilol, blocked extinction learning of cocaine-conditioned place preference
      and the associated ERK activation in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex.
      Overexpression of beta-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex promoted
      extinction learning, which was blocked by propranolol. Knockout of beta-arrestin2
      in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, specifically in excitatory neurons,
      impaired extinction learning of cocaine-conditioned place preference, which was
      not rescued by carvedilol. beta-Arrestin2 signaling in infralimbic excitatory
      neurons was also required for the extinction learning in the cocaine
      self-administration model. Our results suggest that beta-arrestin-biased
      beta-adrenergic signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex regulates
      extinction learning of cocaine-associated memories and could be therapeutically
      targeted to treat addiction.

TI  - The depalmitoylase APT1 directs the asymmetric partitioning of Notch and Wnt
      signaling during cell division.
LID - eaam8705 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8705 [doi]
AB  - Asymmetric cell division results in two distinctly fated daughter cells. A
      molecular hallmark of asymmetric division is the unequal partitioning of cell
      fate determinants. We have previously established that growth factor signaling
      promotes protein depalmitoylation to foster polarized protein localization,
      which, in turn, drives migration and metastasis. We report protein palmitoylation
      as a key mechanism for the asymmetric partitioning of the cell fate determinants 
      Numb and beta-catenin through the activity of the depalmitoylating enzyme APT1.
      Using point mutations, we showed that specific palmitoylated residues on Numb
      were required for its asymmetric localization. By live-cell imaging, we showed
      that reciprocal interactions between APT1 and the Rho family GTPase CDC42
      promoted the asymmetric localization of Numb and beta-catenin to the plasma
      membrane. This, in turn, restricted Notch- or Wnt-responsive transcriptional
      activity to one daughter cell. Moreover, we showed that altering APT1 abundance
      changed the transcriptional signatures of MDA-MB-231 triple receptor-negative
      breast cancer cells, similar to changes in Notch and beta-catenin-mediated Wnt
      signaling. We also showed that loss of APT1 depleted a specific subpopulation of 
      tumorigenic cells in colony formation assays. Together, our findings suggest that
      APT1-mediated depalmitoylation is a major mechanism of asymmetric cell division
      that maintains Notch- and Wnt-associated protein dynamics, gene expression, and
      cellular functions.

TI  - Structural principles of tumor necrosis factor superfamily signaling.
LID - eaao4910 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao4910 [doi]
AB  - The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand and receptor superfamilies play an
      important role in cell proliferation, survival, and death. Stimulating or
      inhibiting TNF superfamily signaling pathways is expected to have therapeutic
      benefit for patients with various diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and
      infectious diseases. We review our current understanding of the structure and
      geometry of TNF superfamily ligands, receptors, and their interactions. A
      trimeric ligand and three receptors, each binding at the interface of two ligand 
      monomers, form the basic unit of signaling. Clustering of multiple receptor
      subunits is necessary for efficient signaling. Current reports suggest that the
      receptors are prearranged on the cell surface in a "nonsignaling," resting state 
      in a large hexagonal structure of antiparallel dimers. Receptor activation
      requires ligand binding, and cross-linking antibodies can stabilize the
      receptors, thereby maintaining the active, signaling state. On the other hand, an
      antagonist antibody that locks receptor arrangement in antiparallel dimers
      effectively blocks signaling. This model may aid the design of more effective TNF
      signaling-targeted therapies.

TI  - Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a
      mouse model of colon cancer.
LID - eaan0790 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan0790 [doi]
AB  - Through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF
      preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Those Treg cells that have a high
      abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated
      whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of Treg cells and
      consequently enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We found that,
      relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9
      ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of 
      CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth 
      of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon tumor cells. This resulted in markedly
      fewer TNFR2(+) Treg cells and more interferon-gamma-positive (IFN-gamma(+))
      CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor and improved long-term
      tumor-free survival in the mouse cohort. Tumor-free mice were resistant to
      rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast cancer) cells. Treatment
      with the combination of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also
      resulted in enhanced inhibition of tumor growth in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model of
      breast cancer. Thus, the combination of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an
      immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for
      various cancers.

TI  - The endoplasmic reticulum-residing chaperone BiP is short-lived and metabolized
      through N-terminal arginylation.
LID - eaan0630 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan0630 [doi]
AB  - BiP and other endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins are thought to be
      metabolically stable and to function primarily in the ER lumen. We sought to
      assess how the abundance of these proteins dynamically fluctuates in response to 
      various stresses and how their subpopulations are relocated to non-ER
      compartments such as the cytosol. We showed that the molecular chaperone BiP
      (also known as GRP78) was short-lived under basal conditions and ER stress. The
      turnover of BiP was in part driven by its amino-terminal arginylation
      (Nt-arginylation) by the arginyltransferase ATE1, which generated an autophagic
      N-degron of the N-end rule pathway. ER stress elicited the formation of R-BiP, an
      effect that was increased when the proteasome was also inhibited. Nt-arginylation
      correlated with the cytosolic relocalization of BiP under the types of stress
      tested. The cytosolic relocalization of BiP did not require the functionality of 
      the unfolded protein response or the Sec61- or Derlin1-containing translocon. A
      key inhibitor of the turnover and Nt-arginylation of BiP was HERP
      (homocysteine-responsive ER protein), a 43-kDa ER membrane-integrated protein
      that is an essential component of ER-associated protein degradation.
      Pharmacological inhibition of the ER-Golgi secretory pathway also suppressed
      R-BiP formation. Finally, we showed that cytosolic R-BiP induced by ER stress and
      proteasomal inhibition was routed to autophagic vacuoles and possibly additional 
      metabolic fates. These results suggest that Nt-arginylation is a
      posttranslational modification that modulates the function, localization, and
      metabolic fate of ER-resident proteins.

      IL-2R-dependent risk for diabetes in NOD mice.
LID - eaam9563 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam9563 [doi]
AB  - The cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is critical for the functions of regulatory T
      cells (Tregs). The contribution of polymorphisms in the gene encoding the IL-2
      receptor alpha subunit (IL2RA), which are associated with type 1 diabetes, is
      difficult to determine because autoimmunity depends on variations in multiple
      genes, where the contribution of any one gene product is small. We investigated
      the mechanisms whereby a modest reduction in IL-2R signaling selectively in T
      lymphocytes influenced the development of diabetes in the NOD mouse model. The
      sensitivity of IL-2R signaling was reduced by about two- to threefold in Tregs
      from mice that coexpressed wild-type IL-2Rbeta and a mutant subunit
      (IL-2Rbeta(Y3)) with reduced signaling (designated NOD-Y3). Male and female
      NOD-Y3 mice exhibited accelerated diabetes onset due to intrinsic effects on
      multiple activities in Tregs Bone marrow chimera and adoptive transfer
      experiments demonstrated that IL-2Rbeta(Y3) Tregs resulted in impaired
      homeostasis of lymphoid-residing central Tregs and inefficient development of
      highly activated effector Tregs and that they were less suppressive. Pancreatic
      IL-2Rbeta(Y3) Tregs showed impaired development into IL-10-secreting effector
      Tregs The pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreases of NOD-Y3 mice had increased
      numbers of antigen-experienced CD4(+) effector T cells, which was largely due to 
      impaired Tregs, because adoptively transferred pancreatic autoantigen-specific
      CD4(+) Foxp3(-) T cells from NOD-Y3 mice did not accelerate diabetes in NOD.SCID 
      recipients. Our study indicates that the primary defect associated with chronic, 
      mildly reduced IL-2R signaling is due to impaired Tregs that cannot effectively
      produce and maintain highly functional tissue-seeking effector Treg subsets.

TI  - Oncogenic PI3K promotes methionine dependency in breast cancer cells through the 
      cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT.
LID - eaao6604 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao6604 [doi]
AB  - The precursor homocysteine is metabolized either through the methionine cycle to 
      produce methionine or through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize
      cysteine. Alternatively, cysteine can be obtained through uptake of its oxidized 
      form, cystine. Many cancer cells exhibit methionine dependency such that their
      proliferation is impaired in growth media in which methionine is replaced by
      homocysteine. We showed that oncogenic PIK3CA and decreased expression of
      SLC7A11, a gene that encodes a cystine transporter also known as xCT, correlated 
      with increased methionine dependency in breast cancer cells. Oncogenic PIK3CA was
      sufficient to confer methionine dependency to mammary epithelial cells, partly by
      decreasing cystine uptake through the transcriptional and posttranslational
      inhibition of xCT. Manipulation of xCT activity altered the proliferation of
      breast cancer cells in methionine-deficient, homocysteine-containing media,
      suggesting that it functionally contributed to methionine dependency. We propose 
      that concurrent with decreased cystine uptake through xCT, PIK3CA mutant cells
      use homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine.
      Consequently, less homocysteine is available to produce methionine, contributing 
      to methionine dependency. These results indicate that oncogenic PIK3CA alters
      methionine and cysteine utilization, partly by inhibiting xCT to contribute to
      the methionine dependency phenotype in breast cancer cells.

TI  - mGluR5 antagonism increases autophagy and prevents disease progression in the
      zQ175 mouse model of Huntington's disease.
LID - eaan6387 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan6387 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion
      in the huntingtin protein (also called Htt) that induces neuronal cell death with
      age. We found that the treatment of 12-month-old symptomatic heterozygous and
      homozygous zQ175 huntingtin knockin mice for 12 weeks with CTEP, a negative
      allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), reduced the
      size and number of huntingtin aggregates, attenuated caspase-3 activity, and
      reduced both neuronal apoptosis and neuronal loss in brain tissue. Both motor and
      cognitive impairments were improved in CTEP-treated zQ175 mice. The reduction in 
      huntingtin protein aggregate burden by CTEP correlated with the activation of an 
      autophagy pathway mediated by the kinase GSK3beta, the transcription factor
      ZBTB16, and the autophagy factor ATG14. Inhibition of mGluR5 with CTEP also
      reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of the autophagosome biogenesis-related
      kinase ULK1, increased the phosphorylation of the autophagy factor ATG13, and
      increased the abundance of the autophagy-related protein Beclin1 in homozygous
      zQ175 mice. The findings suggest that mGluR5 antagonism may activate autophagy
      through convergent mechanisms to promote the clearance of mutant huntingtin
      aggregates and might be therapeutic in HD patients.

TI  - IL-2Rbeta abundance differentially tunes IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4(+) and
      CD8(+) T cells.
LID - eaan4931 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan4931 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulates both activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells to
      proliferate. IL-2 signals through an identical receptor complex and promotes the 
      same dose-dependent phosphorylation of the canonical transcription factor STAT5
      in both cell types. Despite this, CD8(+) T cells enter the S phase earlier and
      proliferate to a greater extent than do CD4(+) T cells in response to IL-2. We
      identified distinct IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. In
      IL-2-stimulated CD8(+) T cells, STAT5 phosphorylation increased rapidly and was
      sustained for 6 hours. In contrast, CD4(+) T cells had a biphasic response, with 
      maxima at 15 min and 2 to 4 hours after stimulation. Both cell types required
      vesicular trafficking, but only CD4(+) T cells required new protein synthesis to 
      maintain high phosphorylation of STAT5. Two subunits of the IL-2 receptor,
      IL-2Rbeta and IL-2Rgamma, were twice as abundant in CD8(+) T cells than in CD4(+)
      T cells. Reduction of IL-2Rbeta abundance by 50% was sufficient to convert CD8(+)
      T cells to a CD4(+) T cell-like signaling pattern and delay S phase entry. These 
      results suggest that the larger pool of IL-2Rbeta chains in CD8(+) T cells is
      required to sustain IL-2 signaling and contributes to the quantitatively greater 
      proliferative response to IL-2 relative to that of CD4(+) T cells. This cell
      type-specific difference in IL-2Rbeta abundance appears to tune responses,
      potentially preventing extensive, autoimmune proliferation of CD4(+) T cells,
      while still enabling sufficient proliferation of CD8(+) T cells to control viral 
      infections.

TI  - RhoB controls the Rab11-mediated recycling and surface reappearance of LFA-1 in
      migrating T lymphocytes.
LID - eaai8629 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8629 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of cell adhesion and motility is complex and requires the
      intracellular trafficking of integrins to and from sites of cell adhesion,
      especially in fast-moving cells such as leukocytes. The Rab family of guanosine
      triphosphatases (GTPases) is essential for vesicle transport, and vesicles
      mediate intracellular integrin trafficking. We showed that RhoB regulates the
      vesicular transport of the integrin LFA-1 along the microtubule network in
      migrating T lymphocytes. Impairment in RhoB function resulted in the accumulation
      of both LFA-1 and the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 at the rear of migrating T
      lymphocytes and decreased the association between these molecules. T lymphocytes 
      lacking functional RhoB exhibited impaired recycling and subsequently decreased
      surface amounts of LFA-1, leading to reduced T cell adhesion and migration
      mediated by the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion
      molecule-1). We propose that vesicle-associated RhoB is a regulator of the
      Rab11-mediated recycling of LFA-1 to the cell surface, an event that is necessary
      for T lymphocyte motility.

      CD32-p38 MAPK-Twist axis.
LID - eaan6282 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan6282 [doi]
AB  - Bone destruction is a hallmark of myeloma and affects 80% of patients. Myeloma
      cells promote bone destruction by activating osteoclasts. In investigating the
      underlying mechanism, we found that C-reactive protein (CRP), a protein secreted 
      in increased amounts by hepatocytes in response to myeloma-derived cytokines,
      activated myeloma cells to promote osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in
      vivo. In mice bearing human bone grafts and injected with multiple myeloma cells,
      CRP bound to surface CD32 (also known as FcgammaRII) on myeloma cells, which
      activated a pathway mediated by the kinase p38 MAPK and the transcription factor 
      Twist that enhanced the cells' secretion of osteolytic cytokines. Furthermore,
      analysis of clinical samples from newly diagnosed myeloma patients revealed a
      positive correlation between the amount of serum CRP and the number of osteolytic
      bone lesions. These findings establish a mechanism by which myeloma cells are
      activated to promote bone destruction and suggest that CRP may be targeted to
      prevent or treat myeloma-associated bone disease in patients.

      in human monocytes.
LID - eaan2392 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan2392 [doi]
AB  - Adults older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory
      influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this
      susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor
      retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I
      interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the
      elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in
      the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in
      monocytes from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that monocytes
      from older adults exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3
      (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3) because of its increased
      proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling
      pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that monocytes from older
      adults also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory 
      transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary
      RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in monocytes,
      because knocking down IRF8 in monocytes from younger adults was sufficient to
      replicate the IFN defects observed in monocytes from older adults, whereas
      restoring IRF8 expression in older adult monocytes was sufficient to restore
      RIG-I-induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and
      secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes,
      thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.

      transcriptional networks.
LID - eaan8355 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan8355 [doi]
AB  - Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates tumor cell-intrinsic behaviors that promote 
      tumor growth and metastasis. We previously showed that FAK also induces the
      expression of inflammatory genes that inhibit antitumor immunity in the
      microenvironment. We identified a crucial, previously unknown role for the
      dual-function cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) in FAK-dependent immune evasion. In
      murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, specifically nuclear FAK enhanced the
      expression of the genes encoding IL-33, the chemokine CCL5, and the soluble,
      secreted form of the IL-33 receptor, called soluble ST2 (sST2). The abundance of 
      IL-33 and CCL5 was increased in FAK-positive SCC cells but not in normal
      keratinocytes. IL-33 associated with FAK in the nucleus, and the FAK-IL-33
      complex interacted with a network of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional
      regulators, including TAF9, WDR82, and BRD4, which promote the activity of
      nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and its induction of genes encoding chemokines,
      including CCL5. We did not detect secretion of IL-33 from FAK-positive SCC cells;
      thus, we propose that the increased production and secretion of sST2 likely
      sequesters IL-33 secreted by other cell types within the tumor environment, thus 
      blocking its stimulatory effects on infiltrating host immune cells. Depleting
      FAK, IL-33, or sST2 from SCC cells before implantation induced tumor regression
      in syngeneic mice, except when CD8(+) T cells were co-depleted. Our data provide 
      mechanistic insight into how FAK controls the tumor immune environment, namely,
      through a transcriptional regulatory network mediated by nuclear IL-33. Targeting
      this axis may boost antitumor immunity in patients.

AB  - Malignant tumors reprogram cellular metabolism to support cancer cell
      proliferation and survival. Although most cancers depend on a high rate of
      aerobic glycolysis, many cancer cells also display addiction to glutamine.
      Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine
      metabolism in tumor cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2
      activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ),
      likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells
      and mouse models of HER2-positive breast cancer. Overexpression of EphA2 induced 
      the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ
      target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished
      EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing YAP or TAZ substantially 
      reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of
      SLC1A5 and GLS, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote glutamine
      uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both SLC1A5 and GLS contain
      TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In
      patient breast cancer tissues, EphA2 expression positively correlated with that
      of YAP and TAZ, as well as that of GLS and SLC1A5 Although high expression of
      EphA2 predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also 
      rendered HER2-positive breast cancer cells more sensitive to glutaminase
      inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated 
      glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive breast cancer and
      identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.

TI  - HemITAM: A single tyrosine motif that packs a punch.
LID - eaan3676 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan3676 [doi]
AB  - Innate immune cells sense danger through a plethora of germline-encoded receptors
      that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or cellular
      molecules that are exposed only by stressed, infected, malignant, or dead cells. 
      Many of these danger-sensing receptors belong to the C-type lectin-like
      superfamily (CLSF) and therefore are called C-type lectin-like receptors (CTLRs).
      Certain activating CTLRs, namely, CLEC-2, Dectin-1, DNGR-1, NKp80, and NKp65,
      which are encoded by genes that are clustered together in a subregion of the
      mammalian natural killer gene complex (NKC), use a single copy tyrosine signaling
      module termed the hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (hemITAM). 
      These hemITAM-bearing CTLRs are present on myeloid cells and innate lymphocytes
      and stimulate various functions, such as phagocytosis, cytokine production, and
      cytotoxicity. Proximal signaling mechanisms involve the tyrosine phosphorylation 
      of the hemITAM and the subsequent activation of the kinase Syk. Signaling and Syk
      recruitment by the hemITAM appear to be tuned by variable amino acids within or
      near the hemITAM, which give rise to differences in downstream signaling events
      and diverging functional outcomes among hemITAM-bearing receptors.

TI  - Subtle modifications to oxytocin produce ligands that retain potency and improved
      selectivity across species.
LID - eaan3398 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan3398 [doi]
AB  - Oxytocin and vasopressin mediate various physiological functions that are
      important for osmoregulation, reproduction, cardiovascular function, social
      behavior, memory, and learning through four G protein-coupled receptors that are 
      also implicated in high-profile disorders. Targeting these receptors is
      challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining ligands that retain
      selectivity across rodents and humans for translational studies. We identified a 
      selective and more stable oxytocin receptor (OTR) agonist by subtly modifying the
      pharmacophore framework of human oxytocin and vasopressin. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH
      displayed similar potency to oxytocin but improved selectivity for OTR, an effect
      that was retained in mice. Centrally infused [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH potently
      reversed social fear in mice, confirming that this action was mediated by OTR and
      not by V1a or V1b vasopressin receptors. In addition, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH
      produced a more regular contraction pattern than did oxytocin in a preclinical
      labor induction and augmentation model using myometrial strips from cesarean
      sections. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH had no activity in human cardiomyocytes, indicating
      a potentially improved safety profile and therapeutic window compared to those of
      clinically used oxytocin. In conclusion, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH is a novel probe for
      validating OTR as a therapeutic target in various biological systems and is a
      promising new lead for therapeutic development. Our medicinal chemistry approach 
      may also be applicable to other peptidergic signaling systems with similar
      selectivity issues.

AB  - Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the 
      initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several inhibitors targeting the 
      RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or polyagent therapies for
      patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK inhibitor
      trametinib, which is included as a rational polytherapy strategy for treating
      EML4-ALK-positive, EGFR-activated, or KRAS-mutant lung cancers and neuroblastomas
      that also contain activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In addition, in
      neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate
      of mutations in ALK, NRAS, and NF1, leading to increased activation of RAS-MAPK
      signaling. Co-targeting ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attractive option,
      because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted
      neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to 
      MEK-ERK pathway inhibition by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated
      neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with
      trametinib showed increased activation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the
      kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian target
      of rapamycin complex 2-associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival
      and proliferation that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice,
      trametinib inhibited the growth of EML4-ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer
      and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our
      results advise against the seemingly rational option of using MEK inhibitors to
      treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.

      coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis.
LID - eaan2787 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan2787 [doi]
AB  - Blood coagulation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing
      bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis).
      Coagulation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and
      leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling
      approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) generated
      by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for
      normal hemostasis and promoted coagulation factor activities in a Ca(2+)- and
      phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent manner. In wild-type mice,
      hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced coagulation and
      restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking
      p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets generated 22 eoxPL species, all
      of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic
      disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly
      increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL
      immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of
      the serum protein beta2GP1 (beta2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to
      the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network
      analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects 
      identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation,
      with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX-derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased 
      in APS. In summary, circulating blood cells generate networks of eoxPL molecules,
      including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood coagulation
      and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with
      APS.

      calcium-dependent transcription.
LID - eaao0358 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao0358 [doi]
AB  - The channel Orai1 requires Ca(2+) store depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum
      and an interaction with the Ca(2+) sensor STIM1 to mediate Ca(2+) signaling.
      Alterations in Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) influx have been linked to several
      pathological conditions including immunodeficiency, tubular myopathy, and cancer.
      We screened large-scale cancer genomics data sets for dysfunctional Orai1
      mutants. Five of the identified Orai1 mutations resulted in constitutively active
      gating and transcriptional activation. Our analysis showed that certain Orai1
      mutations were clustered in the transmembrane 2 helix surrounding the pore, which
      is a trigger site for Orai1 channel gating. Analysis of the constitutively open
      Orai1 mutant channels revealed two fundamental gates that enabled Ca(2+) influx: 
      Arginine side chains were displaced so they no longer blocked the pore, and a
      chain of water molecules formed in the hydrophobic pore region. Together, these
      results enabled us to identify a cluster of Orai1 mutations that trigger Ca(2+)
      permeation associated with gene transcription and provide a gating mechanism for 
      Orai1.

TI  - Arabidopsis ATXR2 deposits H3K36me3 at the promoters of LBD genes to facilitate
      cellular dedifferentiation.

AB  - Cellular dedifferentiation, the transition of differentiated somatic cells to
      pluripotent stem cells, ensures developmental plasticity and contributes to wound
      healing in plants. Wounding induces cells to form a mass of unorganized
      pluripotent cells called callus at the wound site. Explanted cells can also form 
      callus tissues in vitro. Reversible cellular differentiation-dedifferentiation
      processes in higher eukaryotes are controlled mainly by chromatin modifications. 
      We demonstrate that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2), a histone lysine
      methyltransferase that promotes the accumulation of histone H3 proteins that are 
      trimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K36me3) during callus formation, promotes early
      stages of cellular dedifferentiation through activation of LATERAL ORGAN
      BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) genes. The LBD genes of Arabidopsis thaliana are
      activated during cellular dedifferentiation to enhance the formation of callus.
      Leaf explants from Arabidopsis atxr2 mutants exhibited a reduced ability to form 
      callus and a substantial reduction in LBD gene expression. ATXR2 bound to the
      promoters of LBD genes and was required for the deposition of H3K36me3 at these
      promoters. ATXR2 was recruited to LBD promoters by the transcription factors
      AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19. Leaf explants from arf7-1arf19-2 double
      mutants were defective in callus formation and showed reduced H3K36me3
      accumulation at LBD promoters. Genetic analysis provided further support that
      ARF7 and ARF19 were required for the ability of ATXR2 to promote the expression
      of LBD genes. These observations indicate that the ATXR2-ARF-LBD axis is key for 
      the epigenetic regulation of callus formation in Arabidopsis.

TI  - ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of
      pannexin 1 channels and P2X7 receptors.
LID - eaah7107 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah7107 [doi]
AB  - Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or 
      necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger
      signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic 
      cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs
      through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms
      linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC
      motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the
      activation of P2X7 receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1)
      channels. Upon stimulation of the P2X7 receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast
      DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted
      in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase
      their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X7
      receptor-mediated Ca(2+) response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 channel-
      and P2X7 receptor-dependent signaling was further required to stimulate the
      reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 channels were
      required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for
      DC maturation. These data suggest that P2X7 receptors and Panx1 channels are
      crucial players in the regulation of DC migration to endogenous danger signals.

TI  - AKAP95-mediated nuclear anchoring of PKA mediates cortisol-induced PTGS2
      expression in human amnion fibroblasts.
LID - eaac6160 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac6160 [doi]
AB  - Phosphorylation of the transcription factors cyclic adenosine monophosphate
      response element-binding protein (CREB) and signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) by protein kinase A (PKA) is required for the
      cortisol-induced production of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2
      (PGE2) in human amnion fibroblasts, which critically mediates human parturition
      (labor). We found that PKA was confined in the nucleus by A-kinase-anchoring
      protein 95 (AKAP95) in amnion fibroblasts and that this localization was key to
      the cortisol-induced expression of PTGS2, the gene encoding COX-2. Cortisol
      increased the abundance of nuclear PKA by stimulating the expression of the gene 
      encoding AKAP95. Knockdown of AKAP95 not only reduced the amounts of nuclear PKA 
      and phosphorylated CREB but also attenuated the induction of PTGS2 expression in 
      primary human amnion fibroblasts treated with cortisol, whereas the
      phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to cortisol was not affected. The abundances
      of AKAP95, phosphorylated CREB, and COX-2 were markedly increased in human amnion
      tissue after labor compared to those in amnion tissues from cesarean sections
      without labor. These results highlight an essential role for PKA that is anchored
      in the nucleus by AKAP95 in the phosphorylation of CREB and the consequent
      induction of COX-2 expression by cortisol in amnion fibroblasts, which may be
      important in human parturition.

TI  - Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease
      sclerostin abundance in osteocytes.
LID - eaan5748 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan5748 [doi]
AB  - The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by
      mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a
      secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent
      mechanotransduction pathway that linked fluid shear stress to reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) and calcium (Ca(2+)) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin 
      abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by
      detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized
      alpha-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the
      mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. We showed
      that fluid shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2
      (NOX2)-generated ROS that target the Ca(2+) channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca(2+)
      influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected
      cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured
      osteocytes to fluid shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited
      Ca(2+) signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of
      sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially
      druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone
      quality.

TI  - Nuclear hyaluronidase 2 drives alternative splicing of CD44 pre-mRNA to determine
      profibrotic or antifibrotic cell phenotype.
LID - eaao1822 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao1822 [doi]
AB  - The cell surface protein CD44 is involved in diverse physiological processes, and
      its aberrant function is linked to various pathologies such as cancer, immune
      dysregulation, and fibrosis. The diversity of CD44 biological activity is partly 
      conferred by the generation of distinct CD44 isoforms through alternative
      splicing. We identified an unexpected function for the ubiquitous
      hyaluronan-degrading enzyme, hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2), as a regulator of CD44
      splicing. Standard CD44 is associated with fibrotic disease, and its production
      is promoted through serine-arginine-rich (SR) protein-mediated exon exclusion.
      HYAL2 nuclear translocation was stimulated by bone morphogenetic protein 7, which
      inhibits the myofibroblast phenotype. Nuclear HYAL2 displaced SR proteins from
      the spliceosome, thus enabling HYAL2, spliceosome components (U1 and U2 small
      nuclear ribonucleoproteins), and CD44 pre-mRNA to form a complex. This prevented 
      double-exon splicing and facilitated the inclusion of CD44 exons 11 and 12, which
      promoted the accumulation of the antifibrotic CD44 isoform CD44v7/8 at the cell
      surface. These data demonstrate previously undescribed mechanisms regulating CD44
      alternative splicing events that are relevant to the regulation of cellular
      phenotypes in progressive fibrosis.

TI  - MAFB enhances oncogenic Notch signaling in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
LID - eaam6846 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam6846 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in the gene encoding the cell-cell contact signaling protein
      Notch1 are common in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs).
      However, expressing Notch1 mutant alleles in mice fails to efficiently induce the
      development of leukemia. We performed a gain-of-function screen to identify
      proteins that enhanced signaling by leukemia-associated Notch1 mutants. The
      transcription factors MAFB and ETS2 emerged as candidates that individually
      enhanced Notch1 signaling, and when coexpressed, they synergistically increased
      signaling to an extent similar to that induced by core components of the Notch
      transcriptional complex. In mouse models of T-ALL, MAFB enhanced leukemogenesis
      by the naturally occurring Notch1 mutants, decreased disease latency, and
      increased disease penetrance. Decreasing MAFB abundance in mouse and human T-ALL 
      cells reduced the expression of Notch1 target genes, including MYC and HES1, and 
      sustained MAFB knockdown impaired T-ALL growth in a competitive setting. MAFB
      bound to ETS2 and interacted with the acetyltransferases PCAF and P300,
      highlighting its importance in recruiting coactivators that enhance Notch1
      signaling. Together, these data identify a mechanism for enhancing the oncogenic 
      potential of weak Notch1 mutants in leukemia models, and they reveal the
      MAFB-ETS2 transcriptional axis as a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.

TI  - The genetics of PKMzeta and memory maintenance.
LID - eaao2327 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao2327 [doi]
AB  - Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that maintain long-term memory is a
      fundamental goal of neuroscience. Accumulating evidence suggests that persistent 
      signaling by the atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoform protein kinase Mzeta
      (PKMzeta) might maintain synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
      memory. However, the role of PKMzeta has been challenged by genetic data from
      PKMzeta-knockout mice showing intact LTP and long-term memory. Moreover, the
      PKMzeta inhibitor peptide zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) reverses LTP and erases
      memory in both wild-type and knockout mice. Data from four papers using
      additional isoform-specific genetic approaches have helped to reconcile these
      conflicting findings. First, a PKMzeta-antisense approach showed that LTP and
      long-term memory in PKMzeta-knockout mice are mediated through a compensatory
      mechanism that depends on another ZIP-sensitive atypical isoform, PKCiota/lambda.
      Second, short hairpin RNAs decreasing the amounts of individual atypical isoforms
      without inducing compensation disrupted memory in different temporal phases.
      PKCiota/lambda knockdown disrupted short-term memory, whereas PKMzeta knockdown
      specifically erased long-term memory. Third, conditional PKCiota/lambda knockout 
      induced compensation by rapidly activating PKMzeta to preserve short-term memory.
      Fourth, a dominant-negative approach in the model system Aplysia revealed that
      multiple PKCs form PKMs to sustain different types of long-term synaptic
      facilitation, with atypical PKM maintaining synaptic plasticity similar to LTP.
      Thus, under physiological conditions, PKMzeta is the principal PKC isoform that
      maintains LTP and long-term memory. PKCiota/lambda can compensate for PKMzeta,
      and because other isoforms could also maintain synaptic facilitation, there may
      be a hierarchy of compensatory mechanisms maintaining memory if PKMzeta
      malfunctions.

TI  - Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1- and SUMO-2/3-mediated
      protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology.
LID - eaaj2005 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaj2005 [doi]
AB  - Because protein-protein interactions underpin most biological processes,
      developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the
      development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the
      posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO-1,
      SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated
      proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that
      facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer
      system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins
      that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein interactions mediated by SIMs both in
      vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO
      conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific
      analysis of SUMO-mediated protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, through
      structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms 
      that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1-mediated
      interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will
      these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but
      the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could
      also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target
      other protein-protein interactions.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan0868 [doi]
AB  - Some 30 years after its discovery, phage display remains one of the most widely
      used methods of in vitro selection. Initially developed to revolutionize the
      generation of therapeutic antibodies, phage display is now the first choice for
      screening artificial binding proteins. Artificial binding proteins can be used as
      reagents to study protein-protein interactions, target posttranslational
      modifications, and distinguish between homologous proteins. They can also be used
      as research and affinity reagents, for diagnostic purposes, and as therapeutics. 
      However, the ability to identify isoform-specific reagents remains highly
      challenging. We describe an adapted phage display protocol using an artificial
      binding protein (Affimer) for the selection of isoform-selective binding
      proteins.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate synapse formation and
      activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X
      syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and 
      characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene
      expression studies in Drosophila suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan
      sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to
      restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly
      model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of
      Dlp. We used the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to
      test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found
      that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted
      Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that
      of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at
      the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic 
      activity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this
      functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent
      increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing 
      the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced,
      HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that
      this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal
      therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS
      patients.

TI  - Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic
      function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome.
LID - eaan0852 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan0852 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
      disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide
      expansion in the gene FMR1 on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of
      FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to
      underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly
      increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing
      factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused
      disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model
      mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with
      abnormal dendritic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a
      constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex
      of Fmr1-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and
      increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a
      small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a
      causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued
      synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V
      pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings
      suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic 
      defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously
      unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine
      morphology and spine density associated with FXS.

      and actin dynamics in fragile X syndrome model mice.
LID - eaan0665 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan0665 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
      disability and autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by silencing of the FMR1
      gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding 
      protein that represses the translation of its target mRNAs. One mechanism by
      which FMRP represses translation is through its association with cytoplasmic
      FMRP-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which subsequently sequesters and inhibits
      eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). CYFIP1 shuttles between the FMRP-eIF4E
      complex and the Rac1-Wave regulatory complex, thereby connecting translational
      regulation to actin dynamics and dendritic spine morphology, which are
      dysregulated in FXS model mice that lack FMRP. Treating FXS mice with 4EGI-1,
      which blocks interactions between eIF4E and eIF4G, a critical interaction partner
      for translational initiation, reversed defects in hippocampus-dependent memory
      and spine morphology. We also found that 4EGI-1 normalized the phenotypes of
      enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated long-term depression
      (LTD), enhanced Rac1-p21-activated kinase (PAK)-cofilin signaling, altered actin 
      dynamics, and dysregulated CYFIP1/eIF4E and CYFIP1/Rac1 interactions in FXS mice.
      Our findings are consistent with the idea that an imbalance in protein synthesis 
      and actin dynamics contributes to pathophysiology in FXS mice, and suggest that
      targeting eIF4E may be a strategy for treating FXS.

AB  - The PAR-1-MARK pathway controls cell polarity through the phosphorylation of
      microtubule-associated proteins. Rho-Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2
      (ARHGEF2), which activates Ras homolog family member A (RHOA), is anchored to the
      microtubule network and sequestered in an inhibited state through binding to
      dynein light chain Tctex-1 type 1 (DYNLT1). We showed in mammalian cells that
      liver kinase B1 (LKB1) activated the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3
      (MARK3), which in turn phosphorylated ARHGEF2 at Ser(151) This modification
      disrupted the interaction between ARHGEF2 and DYNLT1 by generating a 14-3-3
      binding site in ARHGEF2, thus causing ARHGEF2 to dissociate from microtubules.
      Phosphorylation of ARHGEF2 by MARK3 stimulated RHOA activation and the formation 
      of stress fibers and focal adhesions, and was required for organized cellular
      architecture in three-dimensional culture. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
      dephosphorylated Ser(151) in ARHGEF2 to restore the inhibited state. Thus, we
      have identified a regulatory switch controlled by MARK3 that couples microtubules
      to the actin cytoskeleton to establish epithelial cell polarity through ARHGEF2.

TI  - Quantitative single-molecule imaging of TLR4 reveals ligand-specific receptor
      dimerization.
LID - eaan1308 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan1308 [doi]
AB  - In humans, invading pathogens are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Upon 
      recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the cell wall of
      Gram-negative bacteria, TLR4 dimerizes and can stimulate two different signaling 
      pathways, the proinflammatory, MyD88-dependent pathway and the antiviral,
      MyD88-independent pathway. The balance between these two pathways is
      ligand-dependent, and ligand composition determines whether the invading pathogen
      activates or evades the host immune response. We investigated the dimerization
      behavior of TLR4 in intact cells in response to different LPS chemotypes through 
      quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy. Quantitative superresolved 
      data showed that TLR4 was monomeric in the absence of its co-receptors MD2 and
      CD14 in transfected HEK 293 cells. When TLR4 was present together with MD2 and
      CD14 but in the absence of LPS, 52% of the receptors were monomeric and 48% were 
      dimeric. LPS from Escherichia coli or Salmonella minnesota caused the formation
      of dimeric TLR4 complexes, whereas the antagonistic LPS chemotype from
      Rhodobacter sphaeroides maintained TLR4 in monomeric form at the cell surface.
      Furthermore, we showed that LPS-dependent dimerization was required for the
      activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Together, these data demonstrate
      ligand-dependent dimerization of TLR4 in the cellular environment, which could
      pave the way for a molecular understanding of biased signaling downstream of the 
      receptor.

TI  - Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells.
LID - eaan1011 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan1011 [doi]
AB  - The retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological
      processes. To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic 
      cells, we adapted an upstream activation sequence-green fluorescent protein
      (UAS-GFP) reporter mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed
      reporter activity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. Reporter
      activity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced
      granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced anemia, suggesting the
      presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells.
      Mouse plasma activated Gal4-UAS reporter cells in vitro, and plasma from mice
      treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of reporter activation that 
      we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only
      mildly reduced RXRA reporter activity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid
      restriction diet reduced reporter activity, implicating fatty acids as plasma
      RXRA ligands. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we 
      identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand that was
      greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together,
      these data suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically
      increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.

TI  - TGF-beta receptor I/II trafficking and signaling at primary cilia are inhibited
      by ceramide to attenuate cell migration and tumor metastasis.
LID - eaam7464 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam7464 [doi]
AB  - Signaling by the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptors I and II
      (TbetaRI/II) and the primary cilia-localized sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway promote
      cell migration and, consequently, tumor metastasis. In contrast, the sphingolipid
      ceramide inhibits cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. We investigated
      whether ceramide metabolism inhibited TbetaRI/II trafficking to primary cilia to 
      attenuate cross-talk between TbetaRI/II and the Shh pathway. We found that
      ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4)-generated ceramide stabilized the association between
      TbetaRI and the inhibitory factor Smad7, which limited the trafficking of
      TbetaRI/II to primary cilia. Expression of a mutant TbetaRI that signals but does
      not interact with Smad7 prevented the CerS4-mediated inhibition of migration in
      various cancer cells. Genetic deletion or knockdown of CerS4 prevented the
      formation of the Smad7-TbetaRI inhibitory complex and increased the association
      between TbetaRI and the transporter Arl6 through a previously unknown
      cilia-targeting signal (Ala(31)Thr(32)Ala(33)Leu(34)Gln(35)) in TbetaRI. Mutating
      the cilia-targeting signal abolished the trafficking of TbetaRI to the primary
      cilia. Localization of TbetaRI to primary cilia activated a key mediator of Shh
      signaling, Smoothened (Smo), which stimulated cellular migration and invasion.
      TbetaRI-Smo cross-talk at the cilia in CerS4-deficient 4T1 mammary cancer cells
      induced liver metastasis from orthotopic allografts in both wild-type and
      CerS4-deficient mice, which was prevented by overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown
      of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88). Overall, these data reveal a
      ceramide-dependent mechanism that suppresses cell migration and invasion by
      restricting TbetaRI/II-Shh signaling selectively at the plasma membrane of the
      primary cilium.

      T cells.
LID - eaah6163 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah6163 [doi]
AB  - A lack of regulatory T cell function is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of 
      autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement 
      regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (TH1)
      effector cells into interleukin-10 (IL-10)-secreting type 1 regulatory T cells
      (Tr1 cells), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the
      ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple
      O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that
      stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex was associated with a
      reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on
      O-glycosylation. CD3-stimulated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced
      CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46
      was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-,
      threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation
      sites. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune synapse switched T cells from producing 
      the inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to producing IL-10.
      Furthermore, CD4(+) T cells isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a
      CD3-stimulated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of
      cell surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying
      the regulatory function of CD46 on T cells. Our findings may explain why this
      pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS
      pathogenesis that could help to design future immunotherapies.

TI  - The scaffolding protein Cnk binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase Alk to promote 
      visceral founder cell specification in Drosophila.

AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase (Alk) and its ligand jelly belly (Jeb) are required to specify
      muscle founder cells in the visceral mesoderm. We identified a critical role for 
      the scaffolding protein Cnk (connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras) in
      this signaling pathway. Embryos that ectopically expressed the minimal Alk
      interaction region in the carboxyl terminus of Cnk or lacked maternal and zygotic
      cnk did not generate visceral founder cells or a functional gut musculature,
      phenotypes that resemble those of jeb and Alk mutants. Deletion of the entire
      Alk-interacting region in the cnk locus affected the Alk signaling pathway in the
      visceral mesoderm and not other RTK signaling pathways in other tissues. In
      addition, the Cnk-interacting protein Aveugle (Ave) was critical for Alk
      signaling in the developing visceral mesoderm. Alk signaling stimulates the
      MAPK/ERK pathway, but the scaffolding protein Ksr, which facilitates activation
      of this pathway, was not required to promote visceral founder cell specification.
      Thus, Cnk and Ave represent critical molecules downstream of Alk, and their loss 
      genocopies the lack of visceral founder cell specification of Alk and jeb
      mutants, indicating their essential roles in Alk signaling.

LID - eaan4893 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan4893 [doi]
AB  - Learning, a process by which animals modify their behavior as a result of
      experience, enables organisms to synthesize information from their surroundings
      to acquire resources and avoid danger. We showed that a previous encounter with
      only the odor of pathogenic bacteria prepared Caenorhabditis elegans to survive
      exposure to the pathogen by increasing the heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1)-dependent 
      expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones. Experience-mediated
      enhancement of chaperone gene expression required serotonin, which primed HSF-1
      to enhance the expression of molecular chaperone genes by promoting its
      localization to RNA polymerase II-enriched nuclear loci, even before
      transcription occurred. However, HSF-1-dependent chaperone gene expression was
      stimulated only if and when animals encountered the pathogen. Thus, learning
      equips C. elegans to better survive environmental dangers by preemptively and
      specifically initiating transcriptional mechanisms throughout the whole organism 
      that prepare the animal to respond rapidly to proteotoxic agents. These studies
      provide one plausible basis for the protective role of environmental enrichment
      in disease.

TI  - Resveratrol stimulates the metabolic reprogramming of human CD4(+) T cells to
      enhance effector function.
LID - eaal3024 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal3024 [doi]
AB  - The polyphenol resveratrol activates the deacetylase Sirt1, resulting in various 
      antioxidant, chemoprotectant, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and
      anti-inflammatory properties. We found that at high concentrations of
      resveratrol, human CD4(+) T cells showed defective antigen receptor signaling and
      arrest at the G1 stage of the cell cycle, whereas at low concentrations, cells
      were readily activated and exhibited enhanced Sirt1 deacetylase activity.
      Nevertheless, low-dose resveratrol rapidly stimulated genotoxic stress in the T
      cells, which resulted in engagement of a DNA damage response pathway that
      depended on the kinase ATR [ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and
      Rad3-related], but not ATM, and subsequently in premitotic cell cycle arrest. The
      concomitant activation of p53 was coupled to the expression of gene products that
      regulate cell metabolism, leading to a metabolic reprogramming that was
      characterized by decreased glycolysis, increased glutamine consumption, and a
      shift to oxidative phosphorylation. These alterations in the bioenergetic
      homeostasis of CD4(+) T cells resulted in enhanced effector function, with both
      naive and memory CD4(+) T cells secreting increased amounts of the inflammatory
      cytokine interferon-gamma. Thus, our data highlight the wide range of metabolic
      adaptations that CD4(+) T lymphocytes undergo in response to genomic stress.

      senescence through CD47 and Nox1.
LID - eaaj1784 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaj1784 [doi]
AB  - Senescent cells withdraw from the cell cycle and do not proliferate. The
      prevalence of senescent compared to normally functioning parenchymal cells
      increases with age, impairing tissue and organ homeostasis. A contentious
      principle governing this process has been the redox theory of aging. We linked
      matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and its receptor CD47 to the
      activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), but not of the other closely related Nox
      isoforms, and associated oxidative stress, and to senescence in human cells and
      aged tissue. In human endothelial cells, TSP1 promoted senescence and attenuated 
      cell cycle progression and proliferation. At the molecular level, TSP1 increased 
      Nox1-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the
      increased abundance of the transcription factor p53. p53 mediated a DNA damage
      response that led to senescence through Rb and p21(cip), both of which inhibit
      cell cycle progression. Nox1 inhibition blocked the ability of TSP1 to increase
      p53 nuclear localization and p21(cip) abundance and its ability to promote
      senescence. Mice lacking TSP1 showed decreases in ROS production, p21(cip)
      expression, p53 activity, and aging-induced senescence. Conversely, lung tissue
      from aging humans displayed increases in the abundance of vascular TSP1, Nox1,
      p53, and p21(cip) Finally, genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of Nox1
      in human endothelial cells attenuated TSP1-mediated ROS generation, restored cell
      cycle progression, and protected against senescence. Together, our results
      provide insights into the functional interplay between TSP1 and Nox1 in the
      regulation of endothelial senescence and suggest potential targets for
      controlling the aging process at the molecular level.

      histone acetyltransferase p300 by activating the STAT5 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR
      signaling pathways and promoting the acetylation of histones at the Il9 promoter.
      As a result, the transcriptional regulator Foxo1 was dephosphorylated and
      translocated to the nucleus, bound to the Il9 promoter, and induced the
      production of IL-9 protein. In contrast, Foxp1, which bound to the Il9 promoter
      in naive CD4(+) T cells and inhibited Il9 expression, was outcompeted for binding
      to the Il9 promoter by Foxo1 and translocated to the cytoplasm. Furthermore,
      forced expression of Foxo1 or a deficiency in Foxp1 in CD4(+) T cells markedly
      increased the production of IL-9, whereas a deficiency in Foxo1 inhibited the
      ability of IL-7 to enhance the differentiation and antitumor activity of TH9
      cells. Thus, we identified the roles of Foxo1 as a positive regulator and Foxp1
      as a negative regulator of TH9 cell differentiation and antitumor activity, which
      may provide potential targets for cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Dual enhancement of T and NK cell function by pulsatile inhibition of SHIP1
      improves antitumor immunity and survival.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam5353 [doi]
AB  - The success of immunotherapy in some cancer patients has revealed the profound
      capacity for cytotoxic lymphocytes to eradicate malignancies. Various
      immunotherapies work by blocking key checkpoint proteins that suppress immune
      cell activity. The phosphatase SHIP1 (SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate
      5-phosphatase) limits signaling from receptors that activate natural killer (NK) 
      cells and T cells. However, unexpectedly, genetic ablation studies have shown
      that the effector functions of SHIP1-deficient NK and T cells are compromised in 
      vivo. Because chronic activation of immune cells renders them less responsive to 
      activating signals (a host mechanism to avoid autoimmunity), we hypothesized that
      the failure of SHIP1 inhibition to induce antitumor immunity in those studies was
      caused by the permanence of genetic ablation. Accordingly, we found that
      reversible and pulsatile inhibition of SHIP1 with 3-alpha-aminocholestane (3AC;
      "SHIPi") increased the antitumor response of NK and CD8(+) T cells in vitro and
      in vivo. Transient SHIP1 inhibition in mouse models of lymphoma and colon cancer 
      improved the median and long-term tumor-free survival rates. Adoptive transfer
      assays showed evidence of immunological memory to the tumor in hematolymphoid
      cells from SHIPi-treated, long-term surviving mice. The findings suggest that a
      pulsatile regimen of SHIP1 inhibition might be an effective immunotherapy in some
      cancer patients.

TI  - Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal
      fever-associated birth defects.
LID - eaal4055 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal4055 [doi]
AB  - Birth defects of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic
      cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the
      first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these defects. Neural
      crest cells are precursor populations essential to the development of both
      at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential
      (TRP) ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during
      critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected
      against the development of hyperthermia-induced defects in chick embryos.
      Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated
      hyperthermia-induced birth defects in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test
      whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient 
      to induce these defects, we engineered iron-binding modifications to TRPV1 and
      TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activation of these channels in
      specific cellular locations and at specific developmental times in chick embryos 
      with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulation of radio
      frequency-controlled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated
      fever-associated defects in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a
      previously undescribed mechanism for congenital defects, whereby hyperthermia
      activates ion channels that negatively affect fetal development.

TI  - Inhibition of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1 causes G2-M cell cycle arrest
      and enhanced vincristine sensitivity in Ewing's sarcoma.
LID - eaam8429 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8429 [doi]
AB  - Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a rare and highly malignant cancer that grows in the
      bones or surrounding tissues mostly affecting adolescents and young adults. A
      chimeric fusion between the RNA binding protein EWS and the ETS family
      transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1), which is generated from a chromosomal
      translocation, is implicated in driving most ES cases by modulation of
      transcription and alternative splicing. The small-molecule YK-4-279 inhibits
      EWS-FLI1 function and induces apoptosis in ES cells. We aimed to identify both
      the underlying mechanism of the drug and potential combination therapies that
      might enhance its antitumor activity. We tested 69 anticancer drugs in
      combination with YK-4-279 and found that vinca alkaloids exhibited synergy with
      YK-4-279 in five ES cell lines. The combination of YK-4-279 and vincristine
      reduced tumor burden and increased survival in mice bearing ES xenografts. We
      determined that independent drug-induced events converged to cause this
      synergistic therapeutic effect. YK-4-279 rapidly induced G2-M arrest, increased
      the abundance of cyclin B1, and decreased EWS-FLI1-mediated generation of
      microtubule-associated proteins, which rendered cells more susceptible to
      microtubule depolymerization by vincristine. YK-4-279 reduced the expression of
      the EWS-FLI1 target gene encoding the ubiquitin ligase UBE2C, which, in part,
      contributed to the increase in cyclin B1. YK-4-279 also increased the abundance
      of proapoptotic isoforms of MCL1 and BCL2, presumably through inhibition of
      alternative splicing by EWS-FLI1, thus promoting cell death in response to
      vincristine. Thus, a combination of vincristine and YK-4-279 might be
      therapeutically effective in ES patients.

TI  - Genome-wide functional analysis reveals central signaling regulators of lymphatic
      endothelial cell migration and remodeling.

AB  - Lymphatic vessels constitute a specialized vasculature that is involved in
      development, cancer, obesity, and immune regulation. The migration of lymphatic
      endothelial cells (LECs) is critical for vessel growth (lymphangiogenesis) and
      vessel remodeling, processes that modify the lymphatic network in response to
      developmental or pathological demands. Using the publicly accessible results of
      our genome-wide siRNA screen, we characterized the migratome of primary human
      LECs and identified individual genes and signaling pathways that regulate LEC
      migration. We compared our data set with mRNA differential expression data from
      endothelial and stromal cells derived from two in vivo models of lymphatic vessel
      remodeling, viral infection and contact hypersensitivity-induced inflammation,
      which identified genes selectively involved in regulating LEC migration and
      remodeling. We also characterized the top candidates in the LEC migratome in
      primary blood vascular endothelial cells to identify genes with functions common 
      to lymphatic and blood vascular endothelium. On the basis of these analyses, we
      showed that LGALS1, which encodes the glycan-binding protein Galectin-1, promoted
      lymphatic vascular growth in vitro and in vivo and contributed to maintenance of 
      the lymphatic endothelial phenotype. Our results provide insight into the
      signaling networks that control lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling and
      potentially identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers in disease specific to
      lymphatic or blood vessels.

TI  - Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance
      and alleviates pregnancy loss.
LID - eaah4323 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4323 [doi]
AB  - Pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and
      defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these
      events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T cell
      immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK)
      cells had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on
      peripheral NK (pNK) cells was transiently increased in abundance during the first
      trimester of pregnancy, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)-signal transducer 
      and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3(+) pNK
      cells displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a 
      transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK cells
      was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the
      kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM)
      patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells was reduced and the immunosuppressive
      activity of Tim-3(+) pNK cells was impaired. Compared to Tim-3(+) pNK cells from 
      donors with normal pregnancies, RM patient Tim-3(+) pNK cells exhibited changes
      in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting
      accessible chromatin reader proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3(+) pNK cells, but not
      Tim-3(-) pNK cells, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK cell-deficient
      mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3-Gal-9
      signaling-mediated immunoregulation by pNK cells in maternal-fetal immune
      tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells is a potential biomarker 
      for RM diagnosis.

      RAS antibodies.
LID - eaao3332 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aao3332 [doi]
AB  - There is intense interest in developing therapeutic strategies for RAS proteins, 
      the most frequently mutated oncoprotein family in cancer. Development of
      effective anti-RAS therapies will be aided by the greater appreciation of RAS
      isoform-specific differences in signaling events that support neoplastic cell
      growth. However, critical issues that require resolution to facilitate the
      success of these efforts remain. In particular, the use of well-validated
      anti-RAS antibodies is essential for accurate interpretation of experimental
      data. We evaluated 22 commercially available anti-RAS antibodies with a set of
      distinct reagents and cell lines for their specificity and selectivity in
      recognizing the intended RAS isoforms and mutants. Reliability varied
      substantially. For example, we found that some pan- or isoform-selective anti-RAS
      antibodies did not adequately recognize their intended target or showed greater
      selectivity for another; some were valid for detecting G12D and G12V mutant RAS
      proteins in Western blotting, but none were valid for immunofluorescence or
      immunohistochemical analyses; and some antibodies recognized nonspecific bands in
      lysates from "Rasless" cells expressing the oncoprotein BRAF(V600E) Using our
      validated antibodies, we identified RAS isoform-specific siRNAs and shRNAs. Our
      results may help to ensure the accurate interpretation of future RAS studies.

TI  - Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by
      promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT.
LID - eaal1482 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal1482 [doi]
AB  - The accurate assembly of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (linker
      of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and
      mast cells. During signalosome assembly, members of the growth factor
      receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins bind
      cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr)
      residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-mediated dimerization
      of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads
      dimerization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the 
      pTyr binding pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential binding of
      paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain-intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which
      we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between
      dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the
      dimerization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T
      cells and mast cells. The dimerization-dependent, cooperative binding of Gads to 
      LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation
      at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation 
      of complete signalosomes.

TI  - The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR promotes lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion
      by stabilizing FAK.
LID - eaah3941 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah3941 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale, genome-wide studies report that RNA binding proteins are altered in 
      cancers, but it is unclear how these proteins control tumor progression. We found
      that the RNA-editing protein ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded 
      RNA) acted as a facilitator of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression through its
      ability to stabilize transcripts encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In samples
      from 802 stage I LUAD patients, increased abundance of ADAR at both the mRNA and 
      protein level correlated with tumor recurrence. Knocking down ADAR in LUAD cells 
      suppressed their mesenchymal properties, migration, and invasion in culture.
      Analysis of gene expression patterns in LUAD cells identified ADAR-associated
      enrichment of a subset of genes involved in cell migration pathways; among these,
      FAK is the most notable gene whose expression was increased in the presence of
      ADAR. Molecular analyses revealed that ADAR posttranscriptionally increased FAK
      protein abundance by binding to the FAK transcript and editing a specific
      intronic site that resulted in the increased stabilization of FAK mRNA.
      Pharmacological inhibition of FAK blocked ADAR-induced invasiveness of LUAD
      cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for LUAD that has a high
      abundance of ADAR.

TI  - TALK-1 channels control beta cell endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) homeostasis.
LID - eaan2883 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan2883 [doi]
AB  - Ca(2+) handling by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves critical roles in
      controlling pancreatic beta cell function and becomes perturbed during the
      pathogenesis of diabetes. ER Ca(2+) homeostasis is determined by ion movements
      across the ER membrane, including K(+) flux through K(+) channels. We
      demonstrated that K(+) flux through ER-localized TALK-1 channels facilitated
      Ca(2+) release from the ER in mouse and human beta cells. We found that beta
      cells from mice lacking TALK-1 exhibited reduced basal cytosolic Ca(2+) and
      increased ER Ca(2+) concentrations, suggesting reduced ER Ca(2+) leak. These
      changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis were presumably due to TALK-1-mediated ER K(+)
      flux, because we recorded K(+) currents mediated by functional TALK-1 channels on
      the nuclear membrane, which is continuous with the ER. Moreover, overexpression
      of K(+)-impermeable TALK-1 channels in HEK293 cells did not reduce ER Ca(2+)
      stores. Reduced ER Ca(2+) content in beta cells is associated with ER stress and 
      islet dysfunction in diabetes, and islets from TALK-1-deficient mice fed a
      high-fat diet showed reduced signs of ER stress, suggesting that TALK-1 activity 
      exacerbated ER stress. Our data establish TALK-1 channels as key regulators of
      beta cell ER Ca(2+) and suggest that TALK-1 may be a therapeutic target to reduce
      ER Ca(2+) handling defects in beta cells during the pathogenesis of diabetes.

TI  - Microtubule structures underlying the sarcoplasmic reticulum support peripheral
      coupling sites to regulate smooth muscle contractility.
LID - eaan2694 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan2694 [doi]
AB  - Junctional membrane complexes facilitate excitation-contraction coupling in
      skeletal and cardiac muscle cells by forming subcellular invaginations that
      maintain close (</=20 nm) proximity of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the
      sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels in the plasma 
      membrane. In fully differentiated smooth muscle cells, junctional membrane
      complexes occur as distributed sites of peripheral coupling. We investigated the 
      role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining peripheral coupling and associated Ca(2+)
      signaling networks within native smooth muscle cells of mouse and rat cerebral
      arteries. Using live-cell confocal and superresolution microscopy, we found that 
      the tight interactions between the SR and the plasma membrane in these cells
      relied on arching microtubule structures present at the periphery of smooth
      muscle cells and were independent of the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of peripheral
      coupling associated with microtubule depolymerization altered the spatiotemporal 
      properties of localized Ca(2+) sparks generated by the release of Ca(2+) through 
      type 2 RyRs (RyR2s) on the SR and decreased the number of sites of colocalization
      between RyR2s and large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels. The
      reduced BK channel activity associated with the loss of SR-plasma membrane
      interactions was accompanied by increased pressure-induced constriction of
      cerebral resistance arteries. We conclude that microtubule structures maintain
      peripheral coupling in contractile smooth muscle cells, which is crucial for the 
      regulation of contractility and cerebral vascular tone.

TI  - Regulation of autophagy, NF-kappaB signaling, and cell viability by miR-124 in
      KRAS mutant mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells.
LID - eaam6291 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam6291 [doi]
AB  - KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be classified into epithelial 
      or mesenchymal subtypes. Despite having the same "driver" mutation, mesenchymal
      NSCLCs are less responsive than are epithelial NSCLCs to inhibition of the RAS
      pathway. Identifying alternative networks that promote survival specifically in
      mesenchymal NSCLC may lead to more effective treatments for this subtype. Through
      their numerous targets in cellular signaling pathways, noncoding microRNAs
      (miRNAs) often function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In particular, some
      miRNAs regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We derived an
      EMT-related miRNA signature by profiling the abundance of miRNAs in a panel of
      epithelial (KE) or mesenchymal (KM) KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines. This signature 
      revealed a number of suppressed miRNAs in KM cell lines, including members of the
      miR-200 family, which can suppress tumor progression by inhibiting EMT.
      Reconstituting KM cells with one of these miRNAs, miR-124, disrupted autophagy
      and decreased cell survival by reducing the abundance of p62, which is both an
      adaptor for selective autophagy and a regulator of the transcription factor
      nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Suppression of p62 by miR-124 correlated with 
      reduced abundance of the autophagy activator beclin 1 (BECN1), the ubiquitin
      ligase TRAF6, and the NF-kappaB subunit RELA/p65. The abundance of miR-124
      inversely correlated with the expression of BECN1 and TRAF6 in patient NSCLC
      samples. These findings reveal how the loss of miR-124 promotes cell survival
      networks in the aggressive mesenchymal subtype of KRAS mutant NSCLC, which might 
      lead to improved subtype-selective therapeutic strategies for patients.

TI  - A natural ligand for the orphan receptor GPR15 modulates lymphocyte recruitment
      to epithelia.
LID - eaal0180 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal0180 [doi]
AB  - GPR15 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is found in
      lymphocytes. It functions as a co-receptor of simian immunodeficiency virus and
      HIV-2 and plays a role in the trafficking of T cells to the lamina propria in the
      colon and to the skin. We describe the purification from porcine colonic tissue
      extracts of an agonistic ligand for GPR15 and its functional characterization. In
      humans, this ligand, which we named GPR15L, is encoded by the gene C10ORF99 and
      has some features similar to the CC family of chemokines. GPR15L was found in
      some human and mouse epithelia exposed to the environment, such as the colon and 
      skin. In humans, GPR15L was also abundant in the cervix. In skin, GPR15L was
      readily detected after immunologic challenge and in human disease, for example,
      in psoriatic lesions. Allotransplantation of skin from Gpr15l-deficient mice onto
      wild-type mice resulted in substantial graft protection, suggesting nonredundant 
      roles for GPR15 and GPR15L in the generation of effector T cell responses.
      Together, these data identify a receptor-ligand pair that is required for immune 
      homeostasis at epithelia and whose modulation may represent an alternative
      approach to treating conditions affecting the skin such as psoriasis.

TI  - Bacterial d-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste
      receptors in solitary chemosensory cells.
LID - eaam7703 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam7703 [doi]
AB  - In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in 
      solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense
      responses. Whereas activation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates
      surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, activation of the
      sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This
      mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release
      based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that d-amino
      acids, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in taste receptor 
      cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the 
      T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the
      same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures.
      Respiratory isolates of Staphylococcus species, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      produced at least two d-amino acids that activate the sweet taste receptor. In
      addition to inhibiting P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, d-amino acids derived
      from Staphylococcus inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in
      sinonasal cells by activating T1R2/3. d-Amino acid-mediated activation of T1R2/3 
      also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with Staphylococcus aureus
      in the presence of the bitter receptor-activating compound denatonium benzoate.
      These data establish a potential mechanism for interkingdom signaling in the
      airway mediated by bacterial d-amino acids and the mammalian sweet taste receptor
      in airway chemosensory cells.

AB  - Membrane repair is a symphony of signaling, conducted principally by the steep
      influx of Ca(2+) through an injured membrane. In this issue of Science Signaling,
      Horn et al reveal unique interplay between Ca(2+) influx and mitochondrially

TI  - Mitochondrial redox signaling enables repair of injured skeletal muscle cells.
LID - eaaj1978 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaj1978 [doi]
AB  - Strain and physical trauma to mechanically active cells, such as skeletal muscle 
      myofibers, injures their plasma membranes, and mitochondrial function is required
      for their repair. We found that mitochondrial function was also needed for plasma
      membrane repair in myoblasts as well as nonmuscle cells, which depended on
      mitochondrial uptake of calcium through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter
      (MCU). Calcium uptake transiently increased the mitochondrial production of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), which locally activated the guanosine
      triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, triggering F-actin accumulation at the site of
      injury and facilitating membrane repair. Blocking mitochondrial calcium uptake or
      ROS production prevented injury-triggered RhoA activation, actin polymerization, 
      and plasma membrane repair. This repair mechanism was shared between myoblasts,
      nonmuscle cells, and mature skeletal myofibers. Quenching mitochondrial ROS in
      myofibers during eccentric exercise ex vivo caused increased damage to myofibers,
      resulting in a greater loss of muscle force. These results suggest a
      physiological role for mitochondria in plasma membrane repair in injured cells, a
      role that highlights a beneficial effect of ROS.

TI  - Cancer-associated arginine-to-histidine mutations confer a gain in pH sensing to 
      mutant proteins.
LID - eaam9931 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam9931 [doi]
AB  - The intracellular pH (pHi) of most cancers is constitutively higher than that of 
      normal cells and enhances proliferation and cell survival. We found that
      increased pHi enabled the tumorigenic behaviors caused by somatic
      arginine-to-histidine mutations, which are frequent in cancer and confer pH
      sensing not seen with wild-type proteins. Experimentally raising the pHi
      increased the activity of R776H mutant epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR-R776H), thereby increasing proliferation and causing transformation in
      fibroblasts. An Arg-to-Gly mutation did not confer these effects. Molecular
      dynamics simulations of EGFR suggested that decreased protonation of His(776) at 
      high pH causes conformational changes in the alphaC helix that may stabilize the 
      active form of the kinase. An Arg-to-His, but not Arg-to-Lys, mutation in the
      transcription factor p53 (p53-R273H) decreased its transcriptional activity and
      attenuated the DNA damage response in fibroblasts and breast cancer cells with
      high pHi. Lowering pHi attenuated the tumorigenic effects of both EGFR-R776H and 
      p53-R273H. Our data suggest that some somatic mutations may confer a fitness
      advantage to the higher pHi of cancer cells.

TI  - Blockade of surface-bound TGF-beta on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of
      effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment.
LID - eaak9702 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aak9702 [doi]
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing 
      of tumor cells by antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. To better understand the
      mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel
      cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in
      vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated tumor cells 
      resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells.
      Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from Treg-depleted mice
      were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed
      that blocking transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) also prevented
      immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular
      proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not
      inhibit tumor cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon
      microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically
      interacted with tumor-resident Tregs in mice. Tregs isolated from B16 tumors
      alone were sufficient to suppress CD8(+) T cell-mediated killing, which depended 
      on surface-bound TGF-beta on the Tregs Immunosuppression of CD8(+) T cells
      correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B
      and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor
      programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact
      between Tregs and antitumor T cells in the tumor microenvironment inhibits
      antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-beta-dependent manner and highlight potential ways
      to inhibit intratumoral Tregs therapeutically.

TI  - Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the
      Salmonella-specific protein UgtL.
LID - eaan6284 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan6284 [doi]
AB  - Acidic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular
      pathogen Salmonella enterica to activate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ
      responds to a mildly acidic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, the
      virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a
      subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to activate
      PhoP in mildly acidic pH. However, we found that the Salmonella-specific protein 
      UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by Salmonella before the divergence of S.
      enterica and Salmonella bongori, was also necessary for PhoQ to activate PhoP
      under mildly acidic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to activate PhoP in response
      to low Mg(2+) or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of 
      phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby
      increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of ugtL attenuated
      Salmonella virulence and further reduced PhoP activation in a strain bearing a
      form of PhoQ that is not responsive to acidic pH. These data suggest that when
      Salmonella experiences mildly acidic pH, PhoP activation requires PhoQ to detect 
      pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of 
      a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory
      system.

TI  - Protein kinase N3 promotes bone resorption by osteoclasts in response to
      Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling.
LID - eaan0023 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan0023 [doi]
AB  - Cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts to form actin rings is necessary for
      these cells to attach to bone and resorb bone matrices. We delineated the pathway
      through which Wnt5a signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan
      receptor 2 (Ror2) promoted the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Wnt5a
      binding to Ror2 stimulated Rho, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal
      reorganization. Subsequently, the Rho effector kinase Pkn3 bound to and enhanced 
      the activity of c-Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is critical for actin
      ring formation. Mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in Ror2
      (Ror2(DeltaOcl/DeltaOcl)) had increased bone mass. Osteoclasts derived from these
      mice exhibited impaired bone resorption and actin ring formation, defects that
      were rescued by overexpression of constitutively active RhoA. These osteoclasts
      also exhibited reduced interaction between c-Src and Pkn3 and reduced c-Src
      kinase activity. Similar to Ror2(DeltaOcl/DeltaOcl) mice, mice with a global
      deficiency of Pkn3 (Pkn3(-/-)) had increased bone mass. The proline-rich region
      and kinase domain of Pkn3 were required to restore the bone-resorbing activity of
      osteoclasts derived from Pkn3(-/-) mice. Thus, Pkn3 promotes bone resorption
      downstream of Wnt5a-Ror2-Rho signaling, and this pathway may be a therapeutic
      target for bone diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and
      periodontal disease.

TI  - The adaptor molecule RIAM integrates signaling events critical for
      integrin-mediated control of immune function and cancer progression.

AB  - Lymphocyte activation requires adhesion to antigen-presenting cells. This is a
      critical event linking innate and adaptive immunity. Lymphocyte adhesion is
      accomplished through LFA-1, which must be activated by a process referred to as
      inside-out integrin signaling. Among the few signaling molecules that have been
      implicated in inside-out integrin activation in hematopoietic cells are the small
      guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rap1 and its downstream effector
      Rap1-interacting molecule (RIAM), a multidomain protein that defined the
      Mig10-RIAM-lamellipodin (MRL) class of adaptor molecules. Through its various
      domains, RIAM is a critical node of signal integration for activation of T cells,
      recruits monomeric and polymerized actin to drive actin remodeling and
      cytoskeletal reorganization, and promotes inside-out integrin signaling in T
      cells. As a regulator of inside-out integrin activation, RIAM affects multiple
      functions of innate and adaptive immunity. The effects of RIAM on cytoskeletal
      reorganization and integrin activation have implications in cell migration and
      trafficking of cancer cells. We provide an overview of the structure and
      interactions of RIAM, and we discuss the implications of RIAM functions in innate
      and adaptive immunity and cancer.

TI  - A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially
      mediate pain and itch.
LID - eaal5241 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal5241 [doi]
AB  - Chronic pain and itch are common hypersensitivity syndromes that are affected by 
      endogenous mediators. We applied a systems-based, translational approach to
      predict, discover, and characterize mediators of pain and itch that are regulated
      by diet and inflammation. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor abundance and
      biosynthetic gene expression predicted that inflamed skin would be abundant in
      four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic
      acid derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 
      13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives. All of these mediators
      were confirmed to be abundant in rat and human skin by mass spectrometry.
      However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates sensitized rat dorsal root 
      ganglion neurons to release more calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is
      involved in pain transmission, in response to low pH (which mimics an
      inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates ion channels involved in
      nociception). The two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates share a
      3-hydroxy-Z-pentenyl-E-epoxide moiety, thus suggesting that this substructure
      could mediate nociceptor sensitization. In rats, intradermal hind paw injection
      of 11-hydroxy-12,13-trans-epoxy-(9Z)-octadecenoate elicited C-fiber-mediated
      sensitivity to thermal pain. In a randomized trial testing adjunctive strategies 
      to manage refractory chronic headaches, reducing the dietary intake of linoleic
      acid was associated with decreases in plasma
      11-hydroxy-12,13-trans-epoxy-(9Z)-octadecenoate, which correlated with clinical
      pain reduction. Human psoriatic skin had 30-fold higher
      9-keto-12,13-trans-epoxy-(10E)-octadecenoate compared to control skin, and
      intradermal injection of this compound induced itch-related scratching behavior
      in mice. Collectively, these findings define a family of endogenous mediators
      with potential roles in pain and itch.

LID - eaal4165 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal4165 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of
      dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (mDA neurons) causes progressive loss of
      motor control and function. Using embryonic and mDA neurons, midbrain tissue from
      mice, and differentiated human neural stem cells, we investigated the mechanisms 
      controlling the survival of mDA neurons. We found that the extracellular matrix
      protein laminin-511 (LM511) promoted the survival and differentiation of mDA
      neurons. LM511 bound to integrin alpha3beta1 and activated the transcriptional
      cofactor YAP. LM511-YAP signaling enhanced cell survival by inducing the
      expression of the microRNA miR-130a, which suppressed the synthesis of the cell
      death-associated protein PTEN. In addition, LM511-YAP signaling increased the
      expression of transcription factors critical for mDA identity, such as LMX1A and 
      PITX3, and prevented the loss of mDA neurons in response to oxidative stress, a
      finding that warrants further investigation to assess therapeutic potential for
      PD patients. We propose that by enhancing LM511-YAP signaling, it may be possible
      to prevent mDA neuron degeneration in PD or enhance the survival of mDA neurons
      in cell replacement therapies.

      small-molecule TrkB agonists.
LID - eaal1670 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal1670 [doi]
AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related
      kinase B (TrkB), have emerged as key regulators of brain plasticity and represent
      disease-modifying targets for several brain disorders, including Alzheimer's
      disease and major depressive disorder. Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties
      of BDNF, the interest in small-molecule TrkB agonists and modulators is high.
      Several compounds have been reported to act as TrkB agonists, and their
      increasing use in various nervous system disorder models creates the perception
      that these are reliable probes. To examine key pharmacological parameters of
      these compounds in detail, we have developed and optimized a series of
      complementary quantitative assays that measure TrkB receptor activation,
      TrkB-dependent downstream signaling, and gene expression in different cellular
      contexts. Although BDNF and other neurotrophic factors elicited robust and
      dose-dependent receptor activation and downstream signaling, we were unable to
      reproduce these activities using the reported small-molecule TrkB agonists. Our
      findings indicate that experimental results obtained with these compounds must be
      carefully interpreted and highlight the challenge of developing reliable
      pharmacological activators of this key molecular target.

      promote EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam6826 [doi]
AB  - Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the androgen receptor (AR) is a
      standard therapeutic regimen for treating prostate cancer. However, most tumors
      progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after ADT. We
      identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen-binding protein transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGFbeta)-induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate 
      cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of
      the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of TGFBI ADT, AR
      antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and
      enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of TGFBI
      suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate
      tumor growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the
      survival of tumor-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected
      before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear
      abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest
      that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis and can be
      caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.

      inhibit interleukin-1 family signaling.
LID - eaan3589 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan3589 [doi]
AB  - Pathogens deploy immune evasion strategies to successfully establish infections
      within their hosts. Naturally, the host responds by acquiring mechanisms to
      counter these strategies. There is increasing evidence that the three
      interleukin-36 (IL-36) cytokines, IL-36alpha, IL-36beta and IL-36gamma, play
      important roles in host immunity. With a focus on the skin as a target for
      microbial and viral invasion, the current knowledge of IL-36 functions is
      reviewed. Furthermore, the hypothesis that the IL-36s have evolved to counteract 
      virulence factors is presented using viruses as an example. The IL-36s are
      related to IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18, and IL-33. Numerous viruses affecting the 
      skin have developed immune evasion strategies that neutralize IL-1alpha,
      IL-1beta, or IL-18 signaling or combinations of these pathways. Through small
      differences in activation mechanisms and receptor utilization, it is possible
      that IL-36 signaling may proceed unhindered in the presence of these viral
      inhibitors. Thus, one physiological function of the IL-36s may be to counteract
      microbial immune evasion.

AB  - Endothelial dysfunction, a hallmark of vascular disease, is restored by plasma
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL). However, a generalized increase in HDL abundance 
      is not beneficial, suggesting that specific HDL species mediate protective
      effects. Apolipoprotein M-containing HDL (ApoM(+)HDL), which carries the
      bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), promotes endothelial function by
      activating G protein-coupled S1P receptors. Moreover, HDL-bound S1P is limiting
      in several inflammatory, metabolic, and vascular diseases. We report the
      development of a soluble carrier for S1P, ApoM-Fc, which activated S1P receptors 
      in a sustained manner and promoted endothelial function. In contrast, ApoM-Fc did
      not modulate circulating lymphocyte numbers, suggesting that it specifically
      activated endothelial S1P receptors. ApoM-Fc administration reduced blood
      pressure in hypertensive mice, attenuated myocardial damage after
      ischemia/reperfusion injury, and reduced brain infarct volume in the middle
      cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke. Our proof-of-concept study suggests
      that selective and sustained targeting of endothelial S1P receptors by ApoM-Fc
      could be a viable therapeutic strategy in vascular diseases.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8065 [doi]
AB  - Cancer forms specialized microenvironmental niches that promote local invasion
      and colonization. Engrafted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) locally invade and 
      colonize naive stroma in mice while enabling unambiguous molecular discrimination
      of human proteins in the tumor from mouse proteins in the microenvironment. To
      characterize how patient breast tumors form a niche and educate naive stroma,
      subcutaneous breast cancer PDXs were globally profiled by species-specific
      quantitative proteomics. Regulation of PDX stromal proteins by breast tumors was 
      extensive, with 35% of the stromal proteome altered by tumors consistently across
      different animals and passages. Differentially regulated proteins in the stroma
      clustered into six signatures, which included both known and previously
      unappreciated contributors to tumor invasion and colonization. Stromal proteomes 
      were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of proteins altered by each tumor 
      were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of tumor and stromal proteins, a
      comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known
      hallmarks of cancer contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining
      the microenvironmental niche of the tumor. Education of the stroma by the tumor
      is therefore an intrinsic property of breast tumors that is highly
      individualized, yet proceeds by consistent, nonrandom, and defined
      tumor-promoting molecular alterations.

TI  - TRIF-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling suppresses Scd1 transcription in
      hepatocytes and prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis.
LID - eaal3336 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal3336 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a spectrum of diseases that
      ranges in severity from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis, the latter of which
      is a major predisposing factor for liver cirrhosis and cancer. Toll-like receptor
      (TLR) signaling, which is critical for innate immunity, is generally believed to 
      aggravate disease progression by inducing inflammation. Unexpectedly, we found
      that deficiency in TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF),
      a cytosolic adaptor that transduces some TLR signals, worsened hepatic steatosis 
      induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and that such exacerbation was independent of
      myeloid cells. The aggravated steatosis in Trif(-/-) mice was due to the
      increased hepatocyte transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
      desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis. Activation of the 
      TRIF pathway by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] suppressed the
      increase in SCD1 abundance induced by palmitic acid or an HFD and subsequently
      prevented lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Interferon regulatory factor 3
      (IRF3), a transcriptional regulator downstream of TRIF, acted as a
      transcriptional suppressor by directly binding to the Scd1 promoter. These
      results suggest an unconventional metabolic function for TLR/TRIF signaling that 
      should be taken into consideration when seeking to pharmacologically inhibit this
      pathway.

TI  - The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor
      protein CrkII in the immunological synapse.
LID - eaal2880 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal2880 [doi]
AB  - The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine
      nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1
      stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction
      with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical
      for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the
      APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is characterized by the specific
      organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular
      activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total
      internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported
      lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the
      immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active
      (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In
      contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation 
      of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on
      the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the
      p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1-mediated
      adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the
      adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling
      pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1
      activation in the immunological synapse.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal4161 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic stress increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
      leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction. We hypothesized that
      ROS-sensitive TRPM2 channels mediated diabetic stress-induced mitochondrial
      fragmentation. We found that chemical inhibitors, RNAi silencing, and genetic
      knockout of TRPM2 channels abolished the ability of high glucose to cause
      mitochondrial fission in endothelial cells, a cell type that is particularly
      vulnerable to diabetic stress. Similar to high glucose, increasing ROS in
      endothelial cells by applying H2O2 induced mitochondrial fission. Ca(2+) that
      entered through TRPM2 induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization, which led to
      the release of lysosomal Zn(2+) and a subsequent increase in mitochondrial Zn(2+)
      Zn(2+) promoted the recruitment of the fission factor Drp-1 to mitochondria to
      trigger their fission. This signaling pathway may operate in aging-associated
      illnesses in which excessive mitochondrial fragmentation plays a central role.

TI  - A cluster of immunoresolvents links coagulation to innate host defense in human
      blood.
LID - eaan1471 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan1471 [doi]
AB  - Blood coagulation is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding upon 
      blood vessel injury. We investigated the relationship between coagulation and the
      resolution of inflammation and infection by lipid mediators (LMs) through
      metabololipidomics-based profiling of human whole blood (WB) during coagulation. 
      We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and
      proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators 
      (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that
      consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B4, and maresin 1, each of
      which was present at bioactive concentrations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine
      from the coagulating blood markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and
      further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase
      inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes
      and prostanoids, did not block the production of clot-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass 
      cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human blood
      targeted leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB
      signaling in neutrophils and CD14(+) monocytes. Treatment of human WB with the
      components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of
      Escherichia coli by leukocytes. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM
      circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted
      host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic
      profiles for precision and personalized medicine.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai7905 [doi]
AB  - Chronic glucocorticoid exposure is associated with the development of insulin
      resistance. We showed that glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance was
      attenuated upon ablation of Angptl4, a glucocorticoid target gene encoding the
      secreted protein angiopoietin-like 4, which mediates glucocorticoid-induced
      lipolysis in white adipose tissue. Through metabolomic profiling, we revealed
      that glucocorticoid treatment increased hepatic ceramide concentrations by
      inducing enzymes in the ceramide synthetic pathway in an Angptl4-dependent
      manner. Angptl4 was also required for glucocorticoids to stimulate the activities
      of the downstream effectors of ceramide, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and
      protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). We further showed that knockdown of PP2A or
      inhibition of PKCzeta or ceramide synthesis prevented glucocorticoid-induced
      glucose intolerance in wild-type mice. Moreover, the inhibition of PKCzeta or
      ceramide synthesis did not further improve glucose tolerance in Angptl4(-/-)
      mice, suggesting that these molecules were major downstream effectors of Angptl4.
      Overall, our study demonstrates the key role of Angptl4 in
      glucocorticoid-augmented hepatic ceramide production that induces whole-body
      insulin resistance.

TI  - Enhancing natriuretic peptide signaling in adipose tissue, but not in muscle,
      protects against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.
LID - eaam6870 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam6870 [doi]
AB  - In addition to controlling blood pressure, cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) can
      stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes and promote the "browning" of white adipose
      tissue. NPs may also increase the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. To
      unravel the contribution of NP-stimulated metabolism in adipose tissue compared
      to that in muscle in vivo, we generated mice with tissue-specific deletion of the
      NP clearance receptor, NPRC, in adipose tissue (Nprc(AKO) ) or in skeletal muscle
      (Nprc(MKO) ). We showed that, similar to Nprc null mice, Nprc(AKO) mice, but not 
      Nprc(MKO) mice, were resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Nprc(AKO)
      mice exhibited increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, and
      increased glucose uptake into brown fat. These mice were also protected from
      diet-induced hepatic steatosis and visceral fat inflammation. These findings
      support the conclusion that NPRC in adipose tissue is a critical regulator of
      energy metabolism and suggest that inhibiting this receptor may be an important
      avenue to explore for combating metabolic disease.

TI  - Phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein by mutant LRRK2 promotes AICD
      activity and neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease.
LID - eaam6790 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam6790 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in LRRK2, which encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are the most
      common genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), a
      degenerative disease of the central nervous system that causes impaired motor
      function and, in advanced stages, dementia. Dementia is a common symptom of
      another neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, and research suggests
      that there may be pathophysiological and genetic links between the two diseases. 
      Aggregates of beta amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid
      precursor protein (APP)] are seen in both diseases and in PD patients carrying
      G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain tissue, and PD model
      mice, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and phosphorylated APP at Thr(668)
      within its intracellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr(668)
      promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with increased nuclear
      abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in
      cultures and brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes involved
      in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Overexpression of AICD, but not a
      phosphodeficient mutant (AICD(T668A)), increased the loss of dopaminergic neurons
      in older mice expressing LRRK2(G2019S) Moreover, the amount of
      Thr(668)-phosphorylated APP was substantially greater in postmortem brain tissue 
      and dopaminergic neurons (generated by reprogramming skin cells) from
      LRRK2(G2019S) patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors
      reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr(668) in the patient-derived
      dopaminergic neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2(G2019S) mice. Thus, APP is a
      substrate of LRRK2, and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and
      neurotoxicity in PD.

TI  - STING is an essential mediator of the Ku70-mediated production of IFN-lambda1 in 
      response to exogenous DNA.
LID - eaah5054 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah5054 [doi]
AB  - We previously identified Ku70, a subunit of a DNA repair protein complex, as a
      cytosolic DNA sensor that induces the production of interferon-lambda1
      (IFN-lambda1) by human primary cells and cell lines. IFN-lambda1 is a type III
      IFN and has similar antiviral activity to that of the type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and 
      IFN-beta). We observed that human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, which are
      deficient in the innate immune adaptor protein STING (stimulator of IFN genes),
      did not produce IFN-lambda1 in response to DNA unless they were reconstituted
      with STING. Conversely, parental HEK 293 cells produced IFN-lambda1 after they
      were exposed to exogenous DNA; however, when STING was knocked out in the HEK 293
      cells through the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeats)/Cas9 genome editing system, they lost this response. Through confocal
      microscopy, we demonstrated that endogenous Ku70 was located in the nucleus and
      then translocated to the cytoplasm upon DNA exposure to form a complex with
      STING. Additionally, the DNA binding domain of Ku70 was essential for formation
      of the Ku70-STING complex. Knocking down STING in primary human macrophages
      inhibited their ability to produce IFN-lambda1 in response to transfection with
      DNA or infection with the DNA virus HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus-2). Together,
      these data suggest that STING mediates the Ku70-mediated IFN-lambda1 innate
      immune response to exogenous DNA or DNA virus infection.

TI  - PI3Kgamma activity in leukocytes promotes adipose tissue inflammation and
      early-onset insulin resistance during obesity.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf2969 [doi]
AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) plays a major role in leukocyte
      recruitment during acute inflammation and has been proposed to inhibit classical 
      macrophage activation by driving immunosuppressive gene expression. PI3Kgamma
      plays an important role in diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In
      seeking to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we showed that
      PI3Kgamma action in high-fat diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance
      depended largely on its role in the control of adiposity, which was due to
      PI3Kgamma activity in a nonhematopoietic cell type. However, PI3Kgamma activity
      in leukocytes was required for efficient neutrophil recruitment to adipose
      tissue. Neutrophil recruitment was correlated with proinflammatory gene
      expression in macrophages in adipose tissue, which triggered insulin resistance
      early during the development of obesity. Our data challenge the concept that
      PI3Kgamma is a general suppressor of classical macrophage activation and indicate
      that PI3Kgamma controls macrophage gene expression by non-cell-autonomous
      mechanisms, the outcome of which is context-dependent.

TI  - Activation of CaMKIV by soluble amyloid-beta1-42 impedes trafficking of axonal
      vesicles and impairs activity-dependent synaptogenesis.
LID - eaam8661 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8661 [doi]
AB  - The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-beta (sAbeta1-42) impairs synaptic
      function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We
      investigated how sAbeta1-42 led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot-based,
      single particle-tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking
      along axons. We found that sAbeta1-42 prevented new synapse formation induced by 
      chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons,
      nanomolar amounts of sAbeta1-42 impaired Ca(2+) clearance from presynaptic
      terminals and increased the basal Ca(2+) concentration. This caused an increase
      in the phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) 
      and its substrate synapsin, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along axons
      between synapses. Neurons derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar
      defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which
      activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Abeta1-42, or by expression a
      phosphodeficient synapsin mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects 
      in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAbeta1-42 Our results suggest
      that by disrupting SV reallocation between synapses, sAbeta1-42 prevents neurons 
      from forming new synapses or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring
      synapses. Targeting this mechanism might prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD
      patients.

TI  - The transcription factor C/EBPbeta in the dorsal root ganglion contributes to
      peripheral nerve trauma-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity.
LID - eaam5345 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam5345 [doi]
AB  - Changes in gene transcription in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after nerve
      trauma contribute to the genesis of neuropathic pain. We report that peripheral
      nerve trauma caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI) increased the abundance 
      of the transcription factor C/EBPbeta (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta) in
      the DRG. Blocking this increase mitigated the development and maintenance of
      CCI-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold pain hypersensitivities without
      affecting basal responses to acute pain and locomotor activity. Conversely,
      mimicking this increase produced hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, or cold
      pain. In the ipsilateral DRG, C/EBPbeta promoted a decrease in the abundance of
      the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2 and mu opioid receptor (MOR) at
      the mRNA and protein levels, which would be predicted to increase excitability in
      the ipsilateral DRG neurons and reduce the efficacy of morphine analgesia. These 
      effects required C/EPBbeta-mediated transcriptional activation of Ehmt2
      (euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2), which encodes G9a, an
      epigenetic silencer of the genes encoding Kv1.2 and MOR. Blocking the increase in
      C/EBPbeta in the DRG improved morphine analgesia after CCI. These results suggest
      that C/EBPbeta is an endogenous initiator of neuropathic pain and could be a
      potential target for the prevention and treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development 
      at bulk and single-cell levels.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the 
      circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To 
      explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular
      development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene
      expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating 
      ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the
      brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and
      analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during
      embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the
      formation of the blood-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial
      translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional
      cofactor beta-catenin (Ctnnb1). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes
      during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes
      encoding brain endothelium-specific transcription factors (Foxf2, Foxl2, Foxq1,
      Lef1, Ppard, Zfp551, and Zic3) that are associated with maturation of the
      blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway.
      Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial
      heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of Foxf2,
      Foxq1, Ppard, or Zic3 transcripts correlated with the increased expression of
      genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of
      Foxf2 and Zic3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production
      of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may
      help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain barrier models.

LID - eaan8791 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan8791 [doi]
AB  - Since its discovery more than 25 years ago, the kinase AKT has become a central
      figure in cell signaling. We highlight some of the landmark findings in those 25 
      years that contributed to our understanding of the regulation and function of AKT
      in directing cellular processes and behavior. Future progress toward fully
      understanding the roles of AKT in cell, tissue, and organismal biology will
      depend on technological innovations and the combination of in-depth reductionist 
      analyses with systems-based strategies.

TI  - TGF-beta promotes PI3K-AKT signaling and prostate cancer cell migration through
      the TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation of p85alpha.
LID - eaal4186 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal4186 [doi]
AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a pluripotent cytokine that
      regulates cell fate and plasticity in normal tissues and tumors. The
      multifunctional cellular responses evoked by TGF-beta are mediated by the
      canonical SMAD pathway and by noncanonical pathways, including mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase
      (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. We found that TGF-beta activated PI3K in a
      manner dependent on the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor
      receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 polyubiquitylated the PI3K regulatory
      subunit p85alpha and promoted the formation of a complex between the TGF-beta
      type I receptor (TbetaRI) and p85alpha, which led to the activation of PI3K and
      AKT. Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitylation of p85alpha on Lys(513) and Lys(519) in
      the iSH2 (inter-Src homology 2) domain was required for TGF-beta-induced
      activation of PI3K-AKT signaling and cell motility in prostate cancer cells and
      activated macrophages. Unlike the activation of SMAD pathways, the TRAF6-mediated
      activation of PI3K and AKT was not dependent on the kinase activity of TbetaRI.
      In situ proximity ligation assays revealed that polyubiquitylation of p85alpha
      was evident in aggressive prostate cancer tissues. Thus, our data reveal a
      molecular mechanism by which TGF-beta activates the PI3K-AKT pathway to drive
      cell migration.

TI  - Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) entry into smooth muscle during contraction promotes
      endothelium-mediated feedback vasodilation in arterioles.
LID - eaal3806 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal3806 [doi]
AB  - Vascular smooth muscle contraction is suppressed by feedback dilation mediated by
      the endothelium. In skeletal muscle arterioles, this feedback can be activated by
      Ca(2+) signals passing from smooth muscle through gap junctions to endothelial
      cells, which protrude through holes in the internal elastic lamina to make
      contact with vascular smooth muscle cells. Although hypothetically either Ca(2+) 
      or inositol trisphosphate (IP3) may provide the intercellular signal, it is
      generally thought that IP3 diffusion is responsible. We provide evidence that
      Ca(2+) entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs) in vascular
      smooth muscle can pass to the endothelium through positions aligned with holes in
      the internal elastic lamina in amounts sufficient to activate endothelial cell
      Ca(2+) signaling. In endothelial cells in which IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) were
      blocked, VDCC-driven Ca(2+) events were transient and localized to the
      endothelium that protrudes through the internal elastic lamina to contact
      vascular smooth muscle cells. In endothelial cells in which IP3Rs were not
      blocked, VDCC-driven Ca(2+) events in endothelial cells were amplified to form
      propagating waves. These waves activated voltage-insensitive,
      intermediate-conductance, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (IKCa) channels, thereby
      providing feedback that effectively suppressed vasoconstriction and enabled
      cycles of constriction and dilation called vasomotion. Thus, agonists that
      stimulate vascular smooth muscle depolarization provide Ca(2+) to endothelial
      cells to activate a feedback circuit that protects tissue blood flow.

TI  - Differential abundance of CK1alpha provides selectivity for pharmacological
      CK1alpha activators to target WNT-dependent tumors.
LID - eaak9916 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aak9916 [doi]
AB  - Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including
      nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT
      inhibitor is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small
      number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial
      toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which
      activates casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha), is a potent inhibitor of WNT
      signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this
      first-in-class WNT inhibitor in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule
      CK1alpha activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than
      pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice.
      SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft,
      for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity 
      compared to other classes of WNT inhibitors. Consistent with this observation, we
      showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1alpha, was decreased in
      WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down
      CK1alpha increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct 
      CK1alpha abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological
      CK1alpha activators to target WNT-driven tumors.

TI  - In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the
      NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and
      transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between signaling 
      by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize
      with activating receptor signaling to induce NK cell activation. We investigated 
      the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56(bright))
      and mature (CD56(dim)) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry
      experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the
      abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45.
      Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances,
      which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass
      cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein
      abundances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the 
      pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the 
      multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the
      increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in
      IL-2-treated CD56(bright) NK cells but not in IL-2-treated CD56(dim) NK cells.
      This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the
      NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used 
      to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other activated 
      immune cells.

TI  - The glycosylation pathway is required for the secretion of Slit and for the
      maintenance of the Slit receptor Robo on axons.
LID - eaam5841 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam5841 [doi]
AB  - Slit proteins act as repulsive axon guidance cues by activating receptors of the 
      Roundabout (Robo) family. During early neurogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,
      Slit prevents the growth cones of longitudinal tract neurons from inappropriately
      crossing the midline, thus restricting these cells to trajectories parallel to
      the midline. Slit is expressed in midline glial cells, and Robo is present in
      longitudinal axon tracts and growth cones. We showed that the enzyme Mummy (Mmy) 
      controlled Slit-Robo signaling through mechanisms that affected both the ligand
      and the receptor. Mmy was required for the glycosylation of Slit, which was
      essential for Slit secretion. Mmy was also required for maintaining the abundance
      and spatial distribution of Robo through an indirect mechanism that was
      independent of Slit secretion. Moreover, secretion of Slit was required to
      maintain the fasciculation and position of longitudinal axon tracts, thus
      maintaining the hardwiring of the nervous system. Thus, Mmy is required for Slit 
      secretion and for maintaining Robo abundance and distribution in the developing
      nervous system in Drosophila.

TI  - Genetic evidence that beta-arrestins are dispensable for the initiation of
      beta2-adrenergic receptor signaling to ERK.
LID - eaal3395 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal3395 [doi]
AB  - The beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) has provided a paradigm to elucidate how 
      G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control intracellular signaling, including
      the discovery that beta-arrestins, which bind to ligand-activated GPCRs, are
      central for GPCR function. We used genome editing, conditional gene deletion, and
      small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to determine the roles of beta-arrestin 1
      (beta-arr1) and beta-arr2 in beta2AR internalization, trafficking, and signaling 
      to ERK. We found that only beta-arr2 was essential for beta2AR internalization.
      Unexpectedly, beta-arr1 and beta-arr2 and receptor internalization were
      dispensable for ERK activation. Instead, beta2AR signaled through Galphas and
      Gbetagamma subunits through a pathway that involved the tyrosine kinase SRC, the 
      adaptor protein SHC, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS, the small GTPase

AB  - Neuropeptides released from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential
      roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying
      nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are released from intracellular 
      vesicles through two modes: a partial release mode called "kiss-and-run" (KAR)
      and a full release mode called "full fusion-like" (FFL). Using total internal
      reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the release of pH-sensitive 
      green fluorescent protein-tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual
      dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca(2+)
      influx through either voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs) or ligand-gated
      transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. We found that Ca(2+)
      influx through VGCCs stimulated FFL and a greater single release of
      neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca(2+) influx through TRPV1 channels stimulated KAR
      and a pulsed but prolonged release of neuropeptides that was partially mediated
      by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca(2+) gradient
      to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC
      preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca(2+)
      gradient, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL.
      Thus, KAR and FFL release modes are differentially regulated by the two principal
      types of Ca(2+)-permeable channels in DRG neurons.

TI  - Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein
      modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation.
LID - eaak9660 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aak9660 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein
      (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a pivotal 
      role in the control of histone modification and the expression of
      cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and lung
      injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for
      site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The
      ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of CBP reduced the extent of
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in
      mouse lung epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we
      demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase
      14) stabilized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the stability of
      CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14.
      Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and attenuated LPS-stimulated
      histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the
      molecular mechanisms through which CBP stability is regulated by FBXL19 and
      USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression
      of cytokine-encoding genes.

TI  - The lncRNA H19 mediates breast cancer cell plasticity during EMT and MET
      plasticity by differentially sponging miR-200b/c and let-7b.

AB  - Metastasis is a multistep process by which tumor cells disseminate from their
      primary site and form secondary tumors at a distant site. The pathophysiological 
      course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which
      enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a
      transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
      (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using 
      a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer, we investigated the
      molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary tumor
      and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity
      during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary tumor, 
      the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that
      the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting
      as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability
      enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets Git2 and Cyth3,
      respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine
      5'-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase
      (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating tumor
      cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its
      axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, 
      and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a
      biomarker for metastatic cells within breast tumors and perhaps as a therapeutic 
      target to prevent metastasis.

TI  - The lost language of the RNA World.
LID - eaam8812 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8812 [doi]
AB  - The possibility of an RNA World is based on the notion that life on Earth passed 
      through a primitive phase without proteins, a time when all genomes and enzymes
      were composed of ribonucleic acids. Numerous apparent vestiges of this ancient
      RNA World remain today, including many nucleotide-derived coenzymes,
      self-processing ribozymes, metabolite-binding riboswitches, and even ribosomes.
      Many of the most common signaling molecules and second messengers used by modern 
      organisms are also formed from RNA nucleotides or their precursors. For example, 
      nucleotide derivatives such as cAMP, ppGpp, and ZTP, as well as the cyclic
      dinucleotides c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP, are intimately involved in signaling diverse
      physiological or metabolic changes in bacteria and other organisms. We describe
      the potential diversity of this "lost language" of the RNA World and speculate on
      whether additional components of this ancient communication machinery might
      remain hidden though still very much relevant to modern cells.

TI  - Ligand-activated Notch undergoes DTX4-mediated ubiquitylation and bilateral
      endocytosis before ADAM10 processing.
LID - eaag2989 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag2989 [doi]
AB  - The Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by cell-cell contact, is a major 
      regulator of cell fate decisions. Mammalian Notch1 is present at the cell surface
      as a heterodimer of the Notch extracellular domain associated with the
      transmembrane and intracellular domains. After ligand binding, Notch undergoes
      proteolysis, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that regulates gene 
      expression. We monitored the early steps of activation with biochemical analysis,
      immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of Notch1-expressing cells. We
      found that, upon ligand binding, Notch1 at the cell surface was ubiquitylated by 
      the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4. This ubiquitylation event led to the
      internalization of the Notch1 extracellular domain by the ligand-expressing cell 
      and the internalization of the membrane-anchored fragment of Notch1 and DTX4 by
      the Notch1-expressing cell, which we referred to as bilateral endocytosis. ADAM10
      generates a cleavage product of Notch that is necessary for the formation of the 
      NICD, which has been thought to occur at the cell surface. However, we found that
      blocking dynamin-mediated endocytosis of Notch1 and DTX4 reduced the
      colocalization of Notch1 with ADAM10 and the formation of the ADAM10-generated
      cleavage product of Notch1, suggesting that ADAM10 functions in an intracellular 
      compartment to process Notch. Thus, this study suggests that a specific pool of
      ADAM10 acts on Notch in an endocytic compartment, rather than at the cell
      surface.

LID - eaan8004 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan8004 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features a conversation with Indu Ambudkar, senior author of a
      Research Resource that appears in the 6 June 2017 issue of Science Signaling,
      about how activation of the cation channel TRPM2 is involved in radiation-induced
      dry mouth. Patients who receive radiation therapy for head and neck cancers often
      develop dry mouth as a side effect, and this condition is frequently permanent.
      Radiation does not kill cells in the salivary gland, yet it causes the acinar
      cells of the gland to reduce the amount of saliva they secrete. Liu et al found
      that radiation-induced activation of the cation channel TRPM2 triggered cleavage 
      of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensor STIM1, thus inhibiting store-operated 
      Ca(2+) entry and interfering with saliva production. These findings identify
      proteins that could potentially be targeted to prevent dry mouth in patients
      undergoing radiation therapy.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - IRE1alpha promotes viral infection by conferring resistance to apoptosis.
LID - eaai7814 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai7814 [doi]
AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an ancient cellular pathway that detects
      and alleviates protein-folding stresses. The UPR components X-box binding protein
      1 (XBP1) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) promote type I
      interferon (IFN) responses. We found that Xbp1-deficient mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts and macrophages had impaired antiviral resistance. However, this was 
      not because of a defect in type I IFN responses but rather an inability of
      Xbp1-deficient cells to undergo viral-induced apoptosis. The ability to undergo
      apoptosis limited infection in wild-type cells. Xbp1-deficient cells were
      generally resistant to the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through an indirect
      mechanism involving activation of the nuclease IRE1alpha. We observed an
      IRE1alpha-dependent reduction in the abundance of the proapoptotic microRNA
      miR-125a and a corresponding increase in the amounts of the members of the
      antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family. The activation of IRE1alpha by the hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) protein NS4B in XBP1-proficient cells also conferred apoptosis resistance
      and promoted viral replication. Furthermore, we found evidence of IRE1alpha
      activation and decreased miR-125a abundance in liver biopsies from patients
      infected with HCV compared to those in the livers of healthy controls. Our
      results reveal a prosurvival role for IRE1alpha in virally infected cells and
      suggest a possible target for IFN-independent antiviral therapy.

TI  - Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and
      drug resistance in cancer cells.
LID - eaah7177 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah7177 [doi]
AB  - Increased protein translation in cells and various factors in the tumor
      microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates
      the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors
      released from cancer cells mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone
      marrow-derived myeloid cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that facilitates
      protumorigenic characteristics in culture and tumor growth in vivo. We
      investigated whether this intercellular signaling, which we have termed
      transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between cancer cells and what its
      functional consequences were within the tumor. We found that TERS signaling
      induced a UPR in recipient human prostate cancer cells that included the cell
      surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in
      recipient cancer cells and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common 
      chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule
      inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR
      kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of cell survival 
      was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the
      abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the
      transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When
      implanted in mice, TERS-primed cancer cells gave rise to faster growing tumors
      than did vehicle-primed cancer cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that
      TERS is a mechanism of intercellular communication through which tumor cells can 
      adapt to stressful environments.

TI  - Radiation inhibits salivary gland function by promoting STIM1 cleavage by
      caspase-3 and loss of SOCE through a TRPM2-dependent pathway.
LID - eaal4064 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal4064 [doi]
AB  - Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is critical for salivary gland fluid
      secretion. We report that radiation treatment caused persistent salivary gland
      dysfunction by activating a TRPM2-dependent mitochondrial pathway, leading to
      caspase-3-mediated cleavage of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and loss of
      SOCE. After irradiation, acinar cells from the submandibular glands of TRPM2(+/+)
      , but not those from TRPM2(-/-) mice, displayed an increase in the concentrations
      of mitochondrial Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen species, a decrease in mitochondrial 
      membrane potential, and activation of caspase-3, which was associated with a
      sustained decrease in STIM1 abundance and attenuation of SOCE. In a salivary
      gland cell line, silencing the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter or caspase-3 or
      treatment with inhibitors of TRPM2 or caspase-3 prevented irradiation-induced
      loss of STIM1 and SOCE. Expression of exogenous STIM1 in the salivary glands of
      irradiated mice increased SOCE and fluid secretion. We suggest that targeting the
      mechanisms underlying the loss of STIM1 would be a potentially useful approach
      for preserving salivary gland function after radiation therapy.

TI  - A disease-linked ULBP6 polymorphism inhibits NKG2D-mediated target cell killing
      by enhancing the stability of NKG2D ligand binding.
LID - eaai8904 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8904 [doi]
AB  - NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) is an activating receptor found on the
      surface of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, which regulates
      innate and adaptive immunity through recognition of the stress-induced ligands
      ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) to ULBP6 and MICA/B. Similar to class I human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA), these NKG2D ligands have a major histocompatibility
      complex-like fold and exhibit pronounced polymorphism, which influences human
      disease susceptibility. However, whereas class I HLA polymorphisms occur
      predominantly in the alpha1alpha2 groove and affect antigen binding, the effects 
      of most NKG2D ligand polymorphisms are unclear. We studied the molecular and
      functional consequences of the two major alleles of ULBP6, the most polymorphic
      ULBP gene, which are associated with autoimmunity and relapse after stem cell
      transplantation. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallography studies revealed
      that the arginine-to-leucine polymorphism within ULBP0602 affected the
      NKG2D-ULBP6 interaction by generating an energetic hotspot. This resulted in an
      NKG2D-ULBP0602 affinity of 15.5 nM, which is 10- to 1000-fold greater than the
      affinities of other ULBP-NKG2D interactions and limited NKG2D-mediated
      activation. In addition, soluble ULBP0602 exhibited high-affinity competitive
      binding for NKG2D and partially suppressed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells 
      by other NKG2D ligands. These effects resulted in a decrease in a range of
      NKG2D-mediated effector functions. Our results reveal that ULBP polymorphisms
      affect the strength of human lymphocyte responses to cellular stress signals and 
      may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - T-plastin is essential for basement membrane assembly and epidermal
      morphogenesis.
LID - eaal3154 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal3154 [doi]
AB  - The establishment of epithelial architecture is a complex process involving
      cross-talk between cells and the basement membrane. Basement membrane assembly
      requires integrin activity but the role of the associated actomyosin cytoskeleton
      is poorly understood. Here, we identify the actin-bundling protein T-plastin
      (Pls3) as a regulator of basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis. 
      In utero depletion of Pls3 transcripts in mouse embryos caused basement membrane 
      and polarity defects in the epidermis but had little effect on cell adhesion and 
      differentiation. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that the apicobasal
      polarity defects were secondary to the disruption of the basement membrane.
      However, the basement membrane itself was profoundly sensitive to subtle
      perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton. We further show that Pls3 localized to
      the cell cortex, where it was essential for the localization and activation of
      myosin II. Inhibition of myosin II motor activity disrupted basement membrane
      organization. Our results provide insights into the regulation of cortical
      actomyosin and its importance for basement membrane assembly and skin
      morphogenesis.

TI  - A cryo-EM-based model of phosphorylation- and FKBP12.6-mediated allosterism of
      the cardiac ryanodine receptor.
LID - eaai8842 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8842 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) are calcium channels that play a vital role in
      triggering cardiac muscle contraction by releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic 
      reticulum into the cytoplasm. Several cardiomyopathies are associated with the
      abnormal functioning of RyR2. We determined the three-dimensional structure of
      rabbit RyR2 in complex with the regulatory protein FKBP12.6 in the closed state
      at 11.8 A resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and built an atomic model of 
      RyR2. The heterogeneity in the data set revealed two RyR2 conformations that we
      proposed to be related to the extent of phosphorylation of the P2 domain. Because
      the more flexible conformation may correspond to RyR2 with a phosphorylated P2
      domain, we suggest that phosphorylation may set RyR2 in a conformation that needs
      less energy to transition to the open state. Comparison of RyR2 from cardiac
      muscle and RyR1 from skeletal muscle showed substantial structural differences
      between the two, especially in the helical domain 2 (HD2) structure forming the
      Clamp domain, which participates in quaternary interactions with the
      dihydropyridine receptor and neighboring RyRs in RyR1 but not in RyR2. Rigidity
      of the HD2 domain of RyR2 was enhanced by binding of FKBP12.6, a ligand that
      stabilizes RyR2 in the closed state. These results help to decipher the molecular
      basis of the different mechanisms of activation and oligomerization of the RyR
      isoforms and could be extended to RyR complexes in other tissues.

TI  - Key determinants of selective binding and activation by the monocyte
      chemoattractant proteins at the chemokine receptor CCR2.
LID - eaai8529 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8529 [doi]
AB  - Chemokines and their receptors collectively orchestrate the trafficking of
      leukocytes in normal immune function and inflammatory diseases. Different
      chemokines can induce distinct responses at the same receptor. In comparison to
      monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; also known as CCL2), the chemokines
      MCP-2 (CCL8) and MCP-3 (CCL7) are partial agonists of their shared receptor CCR2,
      a key regulator of the trafficking of monocytes and macrophages that contribute
      to the pathology of atherosclerosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Through
      experiments with chimeras of MCP-1 and MCP-3, we identified the chemokine
      amino-terminal region as being the primary determinant of both the binding and
      signaling selectivity of these two chemokines at CCR2. Analysis of CCR2 mutants
      showed that the chemokine amino terminus interacts with the major subpocket in
      the transmembrane helical bundle of CCR2, which is distinct from the interactions
      of some other chemokines with the minor subpockets of their receptors. These
      results suggest the major subpocket as a target for the development of
      small-molecule inhibitors of CCR2.

TI  - Androgen receptor inhibitor-induced "BRCAness" and PARP inhibition are
      synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer.
LID - eaam7479 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam7479 [doi]
AB  - Cancers with loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are deficient in the
      DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these
      cancers exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. 
      This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as "BRCAness"
      and is most commonly associated with some breast cancer types. Pharmaceutical
      induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP inhibitors to other tumor
      types. For example, BRCA mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer
      patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed 
      increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including BRCA1, RAD54L,
      and RMI2 Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC
      patients, the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide suppressed the expression 
      of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A
      "lead-in" treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP
      inhibitor olaparib, promoted DNA damage-induced cell death and inhibited clonal
      proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and suppressed the growth of
      prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP inhibitor
      combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that
      pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP
      inhibitors.

TI  - Nrf2 inactivation enhances placental angiogenesis in a preeclampsia mouse model
      and improves maternal and fetal outcomes.
LID - eaam5711 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam5711 [doi]
AB  - Placental activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in
      the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to
      affect placental angiogenesis, which is critical for preventing preeclampsia
      pathology. We examined the role of ROS in preeclampsia by genetically modifying
      the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, a cellular antioxidant defense system, in a mouse model
      of RAS-induced preeclampsia. Nrf2 deficiency would be expected to impair cellular
      antioxidant responses; however, Nrf2 deficiency in preeclamptic mice improved
      maternal and fetal survival, ameliorated intra-uterine growth retardation, and
      augmented oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, the placentas of Nrf2-deficient mice
      had increased endothelial cell proliferation with dense vascular networks. In
      contrast, the placentas of preeclamptic mice with overactive Nrf2 showed
      repressed angiogenesis, which was associated with decreased expression of genes
      encoding angiogenic chemokines and cytokines. Our findings support the notion
      that ROS-mediated signaling is essential for maintaining placental angiogenesis
      in preeclampsia and may provide mechanistic insight into the negative results of 
      clinical trials for antioxidants in preeclampsia.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 16 May 2017: Vibrio rewires host cells.
LID - eaan5621 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan5621 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features a conversation with Kim Orth and Nicole De Nisco, authors
      of a Research Resource that appears in the 16 May 2017 issue of Science
      Signaling, about how the marine bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus rewires host
      cell signaling networks. V. parahaemolyticus thrives in warm brackish waters and 
      infects both shellfish and finfish. This bacterium causes gastroenteritis when
      humans consume contaminated seafood that is raw or undercooked. V.
      parahaemolyticus delivers virulence factors into host cells through two different
      type 3 secretion systems (T3SSes). Whereas T3SS2 mediates gastroenteritis, T3SS1 
      is required for the bacterium to survive in its natural environment and delivers 
      virulence factors that target conserved cellular processes. De Nisco et al
      examined transcriptional changes in human cells infected with a strain of V.
      parahaemolyticus that lacked T3SS2 but had an intact T3SS1. They found that the
      virulence factors delivered through T3SS1 initially induced transcriptional
      changes that promoted cell survival, then later repressed prosurvival signaling
      to induce cell death.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - The cytotoxic type 3 secretion system 1 of Vibrio rewires host gene expression to
      subvert cell death and activate cell survival pathways.
LID - eaal4501 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal4501 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial effectors potently manipulate host signaling pathways. The marine
      bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. para) delivers effectors into host cells
      through two type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs). T3SS1 is vital for V. para survival
      in the environment, whereas T3SS2 causes acute gastroenteritis in human hosts.
      Although the natural host is undefined, T3SS1 effectors attack highly conserved
      cellular processes and pathways to orchestrate nonapoptotic cell death. To
      understand how the concerted action of T3SS1 effectors globally affects host cell
      signaling, we compared gene expression changes over time in primary fibroblasts
      infected with V. para that have a functional T3SS1 (T3SS1(+)) to those in cells
      infected with V. para lacking T3SS1 (T3SS1(-)). Overall, the host transcriptional
      response to both T3SS1(+) and T3SS1(-)V. para was rapid, robust, and temporally
      dynamic. T3SS1 rewired host gene expression by specifically altering the
      expression of 398 genes. Although T3SS1 effectors targeted host cells at the
      posttranslational level to cause cytotoxicity, V. para T3SS1 also precipitated a 
      host transcriptional response that initially activated cell survival and
      repressed cell death networks. The increased expression of several key
      prosurvival transcripts mediated by T3SS1 depended on a host signaling pathway
      that is silenced posttranslationally later in infection. Together, our analysis
      reveals a complex interplay between the roles of T3SS1 as both a transcriptional 
      and posttranslational manipulator of host cell signaling.

      surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah5417 [doi]
AB  - Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries
      that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to vasoconstriction. Membrane
      depolarization also activates large-conductance calcium (Ca(2+))-activated
      potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca(2+) channel activity that promotes
      vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat
      arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface
      abundance of auxiliary BK beta1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKalpha
      channels. Membrane depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels,
      leading to Ca(2+) influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2.
      ROCK1/2-mediated activation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of beta1 subunits to 
      the plasma membrane by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional
      beta1 subunits associated with BKalpha channels already at the plasma membrane,
      leading to an increase in apparent Ca(2+) sensitivity and activation of the
      channels in pressurized arterial myocytes and vasodilation. Thus, membrane
      depolarization activates BK channels through stimulation of ROCK- and
      Rab11A-dependent trafficking of beta1 subunits to the surface of arterial
      myocytes.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 9 May 2017: Trafficking of BK channel subunits in
      arterial myocytes.
LID - eaan4849 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aan4849 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features a conversation with Jonathan Jaggar, senior author of a
      Research Article that appears in the 9 May 2017 issue of Science Signaling, about
      trafficking of big potassium (BK) channel subunits in arterial myocytes.
      Depolarization of the arterial myocyte membrane causes a rise in intracellular
      calcium that stimulates the cell to contract, which leads to vasoconstriction.
      Membrane depolarization also activates BK channels, which allow potassium to flow
      out of the cell, thus repolarizing the membrane and promoting vasodilation. Leo
      et al found that a critical aspect of this negative feedback mechanism was the
      trafficking of the regulatory beta1 BK channel subunit to the plasma membrane.
      Membrane depolarization caused the beta1 subunit to translocate to the plasma
      membrane, where it associated with the pore-forming alpha subunit to increase the
      calcium sensitivity of the channel. These findings identify trafficking of
      regulatory subunits as a mode of regulation for multisubunit ion channels.Listen 
      to Podcast.

AB  - Activation of B cells by the binding of antigens to the B cell receptor (BCR)
      requires the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCbeta. Because PKCs must
      translocate to the plasma membrane to become activated, we investigated the
      mechanisms regulating their spatial distribution in mouse and human B cells.
      Through live-cell imaging, we showed that BCR-stimulated production of the second
      messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) resulted in the translocation of PKCbeta from the 
      cytosol to plasma membrane regions containing the tetraspanin protein CD53. CD53 
      was specifically enriched at sites of BCR signaling, suggesting that
      BCR-dependent PKC signaling was initiated at these tetraspanin microdomains.
      Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy studies confirmed the molecular
      recruitment of PKC to CD53-containing microdomains, which required the amino
      terminus of CD53. Furthermore, we showed that Cd53-deficient B cells were
      defective in the phosphorylation of PKC substrates. Consistent with this finding,
      PKC recruitment to the plasma membrane was impaired in both mouse and human
      CD53-deficient B cells compared to that in their wild-type counterparts. These
      data suggest that CD53 promotes BCR-dependent PKC signaling by recruiting PKC to 
      the plasma membrane so that it can phosphorylate its substrates and that
      tetraspanin-containing microdomains can act as signaling hotspots in the plasma
      membrane.

TI  - The amyloid-beta oligomer Abeta*56 induces specific alterations in neuronal
      signaling that lead to tau phosphorylation and aggregation.

AB  - Oligomeric forms of amyloid-forming proteins are believed to be the principal
      initiating bioactive species in many neurodegenerative disorders, including
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are implicated in
      AD-associated phosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated
      protein tau. To investigate the specific molecular pathways activated by
      different assemblies, we isolated various forms of Abeta from Tg2576 mice, which 
      are a model for AD. We found that Abeta*56, a 56-kDa oligomer that is detected
      before patients develop overt signs of AD, induced specific changes in neuronal
      signaling. In primary cortical neurons, Abeta*56 interacted with
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), increased NMDAR-dependent Ca(2+) influx,
      and consequently increased intracellular calcium concentrations and the
      activation of Ca(2+)-dependent calmodulin kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha). In
      cultured neurons and in the brains of Tg2576 mice, activated CaMKIIalpha was
      associated with increased site-specific phosphorylation and missorting of tau,
      both of which are associated with AD pathology. In contrast, exposure of cultured
      primary cortical neurons to other oligomeric Abeta forms (dimers and trimers) did
      not trigger these effects. Our results indicate that distinct Abeta assemblies
      activate neuronal signaling pathways in a selective manner and that dissecting
      the molecular events caused by each oligomer may inform more effective
      therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Hyperactive locomotion in a Drosophila model is a functional readout for the
      synaptic abnormalities underlying fragile X syndrome.
LID - eaai8133 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8133 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual
      disability and autism and affects ~1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. The
      discovery of effective treatments for FXS has been hampered by the lack of
      effective animal models and phenotypic readouts for drug screening. FXS ensues
      from the epigenetic silencing or loss-of-function mutation of the fragile X
      mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which encodes an RNA binding protein that
      associates with and represses the translation of target mRNAs. We previously
      found that the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) downstream of augmented
      synthesis of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 2 receptor (BMPR2) promotes
      aberrant synaptic development in mouse and Drosophila models of FXS and that
      these molecular and cellular markers were correlated in patients with FXS. We
      report that larval locomotion is augmented in a Drosophila FXS model. Genetic or 
      pharmacological intervention on the BMPR2-LIMK pathway ameliorated the synaptic
      abnormality and locomotion phenotypes of FXS larvae, as well as hyperactivity in 
      an FXS mouse model. Our study demonstrates that (i) the BMPR2-LIMK pathway is a
      promising therapeutic target for FXS and (ii) the locomotion phenotype of FXS
      larvae is a quantitative functional readout for the neuromorphological phenotype 
      associated with FXS and is amenable to the screening novel FXS therapeutics.

TI  - BMP8A sustains spermatogenesis by activating both SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD2/3 in
      spermatogonia.
LID - eaal1910 [pii]

AB  - Mutation in either of the genes encoding bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 8A or
      8B (Bmp8a or Bmp8b) causes postnatal depletion of spermatogonia in mice. We found
      that Bmp8a, but not Bmp8b, was expressed predominantly in the neonatal mouse
      spermatogonia. Although most BMPs induce activation of SMADs 1, 5, and 8
      (SMAD1/5/8), but not SMADs 2 and 3 (SMAD2/3), we found that BMP8A induced
      signaling through both sets of transcription factors. In undifferentiated mouse
      spermatogonia, BMP8A activated SMAD1/5/8 through receptor complexes formed by
      ALK3 and either ACVR2A or BMPR2 and activated SMAD2/3 through receptor complexes 
      formed by ALK5 and ACVR2A, ACVR2B, or TGFBR2. Signaling through SMAD2/3 promoted 
      the proliferation of germ cells, whereas that through SMAD1/5/8 directed the
      subsequent differentiation of spermatogonia. BMP8A promoted spermatogenesis in
      cultured mouse testis explants, and the resulting spermatids were functionally
      competent for fertilization. These results suggest that the dual role of BMP8A in
      promoting proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia may be exploited
      clinically to treat male infertility.

AB  - Notch transcription complexes (NTCs) drive target gene expression by binding to
      two distinct types of genomic response elements, NTC monomer-binding sites and
      sequence-paired sites (SPSs) that bind NTC dimers. SPSs are conserved and have
      been linked to the Notch responsiveness of a few genes. To assess the overall
      contribution of SPSs to Notch-dependent gene regulation, we determined the DNA
      sequence requirements for NTC dimerization using a fluorescence resonance energy 
      transfer (FRET) assay and applied insights from these in vitro studies to
      Notch-"addicted" T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. We found that
      SPSs contributed to the regulation of about a third of direct Notch target genes.
      Although originally described in promoters, SPSs are present mainly in long-range
      enhancers, including an enhancer containing a newly described SPS that regulates 
      HES5 expression. Our work provides a general method for identifying SPSs in
      genome-wide data sets and highlights the widespread role of NTC dimerization in
      Notch-transformed leukemia cells.

TI  - p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by
      efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM.
LID - eaah6671 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah6671 [doi]
AB  - Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics 
      are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most 
      studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell
      lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely
      unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein
      p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.
      We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type 
      p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break-inducing DNA
      damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated 
      in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic
      neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other
      cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single
      broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53
      signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical
      modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that
      cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the
      kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of 
      p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between 
      cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model
      system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling 
      pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.

TI  - Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and
      tissues in Transcriptomine.
LID - eaah6275 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah6275 [doi]
AB  - We previously developed a web tool, Transcriptomine, to explore expression
      profiling data sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear 
      receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface
      design, and data visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized
      biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains
      about 45 million data points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a
      reference library of nearly 550 data sets retrieved from public archives and
      systematically curated. To make the underlying data points more accessible to
      bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene
      manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines
      into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into
      Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation
      of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Data points from
      animal and cell model experiments and from clinical data sets elucidate the roles
      of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various
      normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, data sets targeting
      non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk
      between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with
      specific examples how data points that exist in isolation in individual data sets
      validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single
      interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely
      develop research hypotheses, validate experimental data, or model relationships
      between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.

TI  - Unphosphorylated ISGF3 drives constitutive expression of interferon-stimulated
      genes to protect against viral infections.
LID - eaah4248 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4248 [doi]
AB  - Interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) are antiviral effectors that are induced
      by IFNs through the formation of a tripartite transcription factor ISGF3, which
      is composed of IRF9 and phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT2. However, we
      found that IFN-independent ISG expression was detectable in immortalized cell
      lines, primary intestinal and liver organoids, and liver tissues. The
      constitutive expression of ISGs was mediated by the unphosphorylated ISGF3
      (U-ISGF3) complex, consisting of IRF9 together with unphosphorylated STAT1 and
      STAT2. Under homeostatic conditions, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 were found in the
      nucleus. Analysis of a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set revealed
      that STAT1 specifically bound to the promoters of ISGs even in the absence of
      IFNs. Knockdown of STAT1, STAT2, or IRF9 by RNA interference led to the decreased
      expression of various ISGs in Huh7.5 human liver cells, which was confirmed in
      mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from STAT1(-/-), STAT2(-/-), or IRF9(-/-)
      mice. Furthermore, decreased ISG expression was accompanied by increased
      replication of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus. Conversely, simultaneous 
      overexpression of all ISGF3 components, but not any single factor, induced the
      expression of ISGs and inhibited viral replication; however, no phosphorylated
      STAT1 and STAT2 were detected. A phosphorylation-deficient STAT1 mutant was
      comparable to the wild-type protein in mediating the IFN-independent expression
      of ISGs and antiviral activity, suggesting that ISGF3 works in a
      phosphorylation-independent manner. These data suggest that the U-ISGF3 complex
      is both necessary and sufficient for constitutive ISG expression and antiviral
      immunity under homeostatic conditions.

TI  - The FOXM1 inhibitor RCM-1 suppresses goblet cell metaplasia and prevents IL-13
      and STAT6 signaling in allergen-exposed mice.
LID - eaai8583 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8583 [doi]
AB  - Goblet cell metaplasia and excessive mucus secretion associated with asthma,
      cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contribute to
      morbidity and mortality worldwide. We performed a high-throughput screen to
      identify small molecules targeting a transcriptional network critical for the
      differentiation of goblet cells in response to allergens. We identified RCM-1, a 
      nontoxic small molecule that inhibited goblet cell metaplasia and excessive mucus
      production in mice after exposure to allergens. RCM-1 blocked the nuclear
      localization and increased the proteasomal degradation of Forkhead box M1
      (FOXM1), a transcription factor critical for the differentiation of goblet cells 
      from airway progenitor cells. RCM-1 reduced airway resistance, increased lung
      compliance, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production in mice exposed to 
      the house dust mite and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which triggers goblet cell
      metaplasia. In cultured airway epithelial cells and in mice, RCM-1 reduced IL-13 
      and STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) signaling and
      prevented the expression of the STAT6 target genes Spdef and Foxa3, which are key
      transcriptional regulators of goblet cell differentiation. These results suggest 
      that RCM-1 is an inhibitor of goblet cell metaplasia and IL-13 signaling,
      providing a new therapeutic candidate to treat patients with asthma and other
      chronic airway diseases.

TI  - The kinase TPL2 activates ERK and p38 signaling to promote neutrophilic
      inflammation.
LID - eaah4273 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4273 [doi]
AB  - Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2; also known as MAP3K8) is a mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAP3K) that phosphorylates the MAPK kinases 
      MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2), which, in turn, activate the MAPKs extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 (ERK1/2) in macrophages stimulated
      through the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or the
      tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). We describe a conserved and critical role 
      for TPL2 in mediating the effector functions of neutrophils through the
      activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling and
      functional studies of neutrophils and monocytes revealed a MEK1/2-independent
      branch point downstream of TPL2 in neutrophils. Biochemical analyses identified
      the MAPK kinases MEK3 and MEK6 and the MAPKs p38alpha and p38delta as downstream 
      effectors of TPL2 in these cells. Genetic ablation of the catalytic activity of
      TPL2 or therapeutic intervention with a TPL2-specific inhibitor reduced the
      production of inflammatory mediators by neutrophils in response to stimulation
      with the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro, as well as in rodent
      models of inflammatory disease. Together, these data suggest that TPL2 is a drug 
      target that activates not only MEK1/2-dependent but also MEK3/6-dependent
      signaling to promote inflammatory responses.

TI  - Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger
      cyclic di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis.
LID - eaal3011 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal3011 [doi]
AB  - The second messenger cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential in
      the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis and in related pathogenic
      bacteria. It controls the activity of the conserved ydaO riboswitch and of
      several proteins involved in potassium (K(+)) uptake. We found that the YdaO
      protein was conserved among several different bacteria and provide evidence that 
      YdaO functions as a K(+) transporter. Thus, we renamed the gene and protein KimA 
      (K(+) importer A). Reporter activity assays indicated that expression beyond the 
      c-di-AMP-responsive riboswitch of the kimA upstream regulatory region occurred
      only in bacteria grown in medium containing low K(+) concentrations. Furthermore,
      mass spectrometry analysis indicated that c-di-AMP accumulated in bacteria grown 
      in the presence of high K(+) concentrations but not in low concentrations. A
      bacterial strain lacking all genes encoding c-di-AMP-synthesizing enzymes was
      viable when grown in medium containing low K(+) concentrations, but not at higher
      K(+) concentrations unless it acquired suppressor mutations in the gene encoding 
      the cation exporter NhaK. Thus, our results indicated that the control of
      potassium homeostasis is an essential function of c-di-AMP.

TI  - The transcription factor MAFK induces EMT and malignant progression of
      triple-negative breast cancer cells through its target GPNMB.
LID - eaak9397 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aak9397 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to 
      treat. For example, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway is
      implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis, but its opposing role in tumor
      suppression in healthy tissues and early-stage lesions makes it a challenging
      target. Therefore, additional molecular characterization of TNBC may lead to
      improved patient prognosis by informing the development and optimum use of
      targeted therapies. We found that musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) oncogene 
      family protein K (MAFK), a member of the small MAF family of transcription
      factors that are induced by the TGF-beta pathway, was abundant in human TNBC and 
      aggressive mouse mammary tumor cell lines. MAFK promoted tumorigenic growth and
      metastasis by 4T1 cells when implanted subcutaneously in mice. Overexpression of 
      MAFK in mouse breast epithelial NMuMG cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) phenotypes and promoted tumor formation and invasion in mice.
      MAFK induced the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein
      nmb (GPNMB). Similar to MAFK, GPNMB overexpression in NMuMG cells induced EMT,
      tumor formation, and invasion, in mice, whereas knockdown of MAFK in tumor cells 
      before implantation suppressed tumor growth and progression. MAFK and GPNMB
      expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. These findings
      suggest that MAFK and its target gene GPNMB play important roles in the malignant
      progression of TNBC cells, offering potentially new therapeutic targets for TNBC 
      patients.

TI  - YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte's response to damage.
LID - eaaf8165 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf8165 [doi]
AB  - Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration barrier.
      They are subjected to physiological filtration pressure and considerable
      mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney diseases.
      When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alterations of
      these cells, the filtration barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to 
      leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved
      proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the
      transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a rat
      model of glomerular disease before the development of proteinuria. Although the
      activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by mechanical stress in most
      cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse
      podocyte cell lines grown on stiff substrates. Culturing these cells on soft
      matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP 
      up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent
      mechanism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured
      podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix-related proteins that
      can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse models of
      diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target CTGF was highly expressed in renal
      biopsies from glomerular disease patients. Although overexpression of human YAP
      in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction
      between YAP and its partner TEAD in rats ameliorated glomerular disease and
      reduced damage-induced mechanosignaling in the glomeruli. Thus, perturbation of
      YAP-dependent mechanosignaling is a potential therapeutic target for treating
      some glomerular diseases.

TI  - Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases.
LID - eaag1796 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag1796 [doi]
AB  - Protein phosphatases are the essential opposite to protein kinases; together,
      these enzymes regulate all protein phosphorylation and most cellular processes.
      To better understand the global roles of protein phosphorylation, we cataloged
      the human protein phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human protein 
      phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 protein phosphatase pseudogenes or
      retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and
      diversity of phosphatases by building protein phosphatomes for eight other
      eukaryotes, from the protist Dictyostelium to the sea urchin. We classified
      protein phosphatases from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 protein folds, 
      21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies
      were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in
      evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes 
      in accessory domains. Protein phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to 
      those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence
      analysis predicts that 26 human protein phosphatase domains are catalytically
      disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This
      genomic and evolutionary perspective on protein phosphatases provides a framework
      for global analysis of protein phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.

TI  - Astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles regulate the peripheral leukocyte response 
      to inflammatory brain lesions.
LID - eaai7696 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai7696 [doi]
AB  - Brain injury induces a peripheral acute cytokine response that directs the
      transmigration of leukocytes into the brain. Because this brain-to-peripheral
      immune communication affects patient recovery, understanding its regulation is
      important. Using a mouse model of inflammatory brain injury, we set out to find a
      soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
      shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1beta 
      (IL-1beta) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the
      transmigration of leukocytes through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine 
      response. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein and microRNA cargo of EVs
      identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) as a
      primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that
      astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain by
      inhibiting PPARalpha, resulting in the increase of nuclear factor kappaB
      (NF-kappaB) activity that triggered the production of cytokines in liver. These
      findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating communication
      between the brain and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a
      molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory brain damage.

TI  - The lysine deacetylase Sirtuin 1 modulates the localization and function of the
      Notch1 receptor in regulatory T cells.
LID - eaah4679 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4679 [doi]
AB  - The ability to tune cellular functions in response to nutrient availability has
      important consequences for immune homeostasis. The activity of the receptor Notch
      in regulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress the functions of effector T cells,
      is indispensable for Treg cell survival under conditions of diminished nutrient
      supply. Anti-apoptotic signaling induced by the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC)
      originates from the cytoplasm and is spatially decoupled from the nuclear,
      largely transcriptional functions of NIC. We showed that Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which
      is an NAD(+) (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent lysine deacetylase
      that inhibits NIC-dependent gene transcription, stabilized NIC proximal to the
      plasma membrane to promote the survival and function of activated Treg cells.
      Sirt1 was required for NIC-dependent protection from apoptosis in cell lines but 
      not for the activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. In addition, a variant
      NIC protein in which four lysines were mutated to arginines (NIC4KR) retained
      anti-apoptotic activity, but was not regulated by Sirt1, and reconstituted the
      functions of nonnuclear NIC in Notch1-deficient Treg cells. Loss of Sirt1
      compromised Treg cell survival, resulting in antigen-induced T cell proliferation
      and inflammation in two mouse models. Thus, the Sirt1-Notch interaction may
      constitute an important checkpoint that tunes noncanonical Notch1 signaling.

TI  - The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association,
      downstream signaling, and cancer progression.
LID - eaaf3236 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf3236 [doi]
AB  - Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in
      normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)
      transmembrane receptors called integrins. K(+) flux through the human
      ether-a-go-go-related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in
      excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in
      tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1
      interacted with the beta1 integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer
      cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the
      presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel
      subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the beta1 integrin-hERG1
      interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with beta1
      integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was
      necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr(397) in focal
      adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice,
      proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with
      impaired K(+) flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when
      the hERG1/beta1 integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the
      interaction of beta1 integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulated
      distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1
      and affected different aspects of tumor progression.

TI  - Sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling through its receptor S1P5 promotes chromosome
      segregation and mitotic progression.
LID - eaah4007 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4007 [doi]
AB  - Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) promotes cell proliferation and survival, and its
      abundance is often increased in tumors. SphK1 produces the signaling lipid
      sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which activates signaling cascades downstream five
      G protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-5) to modulate vascular and immune system
      function and promote proliferation. We identified a new function of the SphK1-S1P
      pathway specifically in the control of mitosis. SphK1 depletion in HeLa cells
      caused prometaphase arrest, whereas its overexpression or activation accelerated 
      mitosis. Increasing the abundance of S1P promoted mitotic progression, overrode
      the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), and led to chromosome segregation defects.
      S1P was secreted through the transporter SPNS2 and stimulated mitosis by binding 
      to and activating S1P5 on the extracellular side, which then activated the
      intracellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. Knockdown of S1P5
      prevented the S1P-induced spindle defect phenotype. RNA interference assays
      revealed that the mitotic kinase Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) was an important
      effector of S1P-S1P5 signaling-induced mitosis in HeLa cells. Our findings
      identify an extracellular signal and the downstream pathway that promotes mitotic
      progression and may indicate potential therapeutic targets to inhibit the
      proliferation of cancer cells.

TI  - Stress-induced dynamic regulation of mitochondrial STAT3 and its association with
      cyclophilin D reduce mitochondrial ROS production.
LID - eaag2588 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag2588 [doi]
AB  - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is associated with
      various physiological and pathological functions, mainly as a transcription
      factor that translocates to the nucleus upon tyrosine phosphorylation induced by 
      cytokine stimulation. In addition, a small pool of STAT3 resides in the
      mitochondria, where it serves as a sensor for various metabolic stressors
      including reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrially localized STAT3 largely 
      exerts its effects through direct or indirect regulation of the activity of the
      electron transport chain (ETC). It has been assumed that the amounts of STAT3 in 
      the mitochondria are static. We showed that various stimuli, including oxidative 
      stress and cytokines, triggered a signaling cascade that resulted in a rapid loss
      of mitochondrially localized STAT3. Recovery of the mitochondrial pool of STAT3
      over time depended on phosphorylation of Ser(727) in STAT3 and new protein
      synthesis. Under these conditions, mitochondrially localized STAT3 also became
      competent to bind to cyclophilin D (CypD). Binding of STAT3 to CypD was mediated 
      by the amino terminus of STAT3, which was also important for reducing
      mitochondrial ROS production after oxidative stress. These results outline a role
      for mitochondrially localized STAT3 in sensing and responding to external
      stimuli.

TI  - Caveolin-1-mediated internalization of the vitamin C transporter SVCT2 in
      microglia triggers an inflammatory phenotype.
LID - eaal2005 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal2005 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin C is essential for the development and function of the central nervous
      system (CNS). The plasma membrane sodium-vitamin C cotransporter 2 (SVCT2) is the
      primary mediator of vitamin C uptake in neurons. SVCT2 specifically transports
      ascorbate, the reduced form of vitamin C, which acts as a reducing agent. We
      demonstrated that ascorbate uptake through SVCT2 was critical for the homeostasis
      of microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the CNS that are essential for proper
      functioning of the nervous tissue. We found that depletion of SVCT2 from the
      plasma membrane triggered a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia and resulted
      in microglia activation. Src-mediated phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on Tyr(14) in
      microglia induced the internalization of SVCT2. Ascorbate treatment, SVCT2
      overexpression, or blocking SVCT2 internalization prevented the activation of
      microglia. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of the ascorbate
      transport system for microglial homeostasis and hints that dysregulation of
      ascorbate transport might play a role in neurological disorders.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah5756 [doi]
AB  - Chemokines orchestrate cell migration for development, immune surveillance, and
      disease by binding to cell surface heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding
      protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The array of interactions between 
      the nearly 50 chemokines and their 20 GPCR targets generates an extensive
      signaling network to which promiscuity and biased agonism add further complexity.
      The receptor CXCR4 recognizes both monomeric and dimeric forms of the chemokine
      CXCL12, which is a distinct example of ligand bias in the chemokine family. We
      demonstrated that a constitutively monomeric CXCL12 variant reproduced the G
      protein-dependent and beta-arrestin-dependent responses that are associated with 
      normal CXCR4 signaling and lead to cell migration. In addition, monomeric CXCL12 
      made specific contacts with CXCR4 that are not present in the structure of the
      receptor in complex with a dimeric form of CXCL12, a biased agonist that
      stimulates only G protein-dependent signaling. We produced an experimentally
      validated model of an agonist-bound chemokine receptor that merged a nuclear
      magnetic resonance-based structure of monomeric CXCL12 bound to the amino
      terminus of CXCR4 with a crystal structure of the transmembrane domains of CXCR4.
      The large CXCL12:CXCR4 protein-protein interface revealed by this structure
      identified previously uncharacterized functional interactions that fall outside
      of the classical "two-site model" for chemokine-receptor recognition. Our model
      suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for how interactions on the extracellular face 
      of the receptor may stimulate the conformational changes required for chemokine
      receptor-mediated signal transduction.

      GLUT4 trafficking.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah5085 [doi]
AB  - Insulin stimulates glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose
      transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The exocyst complex tethers
      GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process that requires the
      binding of the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein) RalA
      to the exocyst complex. We report that upon activation of RalA, the protein
      kinase TBK1 phosphorylated the exocyst subunit Exo84. Knockdown of TBK1 blocked
      insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation; knockout of TBK1 in
      adipocytes blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake; and ectopic overexpression 
      of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 
      3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of Exo84 by TBK1 reduced its affinity for 
      RalA and enabled its release from the exocyst. Overexpression of a
      kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 blocked the dissociation of the TBK1/RalA/exocyst 
      complex, and treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of TBK1
      reduced the rate of complex dissociation. Introduction of
      phosphorylation-mimicking or nonphosphorylatable mutant forms of Exo84 blocked
      insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Thus, these data indicate that TBK1
      controls GLUT4 vesicle engagement and disengagement from the exocyst, suggesting 
      that exocyst components not only constitute a tethering complex for the GLUT4
      vesicle but also act as "gatekeepers" controlling vesicle fusion at the plasma
      membrane.

TI  - Neuropathic pain promotes adaptive changes in gene expression in brain networks
      involved in stress and depression.
LID - eaaj1549 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaj1549 [doi]
AB  - Neuropathic pain is a complex chronic condition characterized by various sensory,
      cognitive, and affective symptoms. A large percentage of patients with
      neuropathic pain are also afflicted with depression and anxiety disorders, a
      pattern that is also seen in animal models. Furthermore, clinical and preclinical
      studies indicate that chronic pain corresponds with adaptations in several brain 
      networks involved in mood, motivation, and reward. Chronic stress is also a major
      risk factor for depression. We investigated whether chronic pain and stress
      affect similar molecular mechanisms and whether chronic pain can affect gene
      expression patterns that are involved in depression. Using two mouse models of
      neuropathic pain and depression [spared nerve injury (SNI) and chronic
      unpredictable stress (CUS)], we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and
      pathway analysis to monitor changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens
      (NAc), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). In
      addition to finding unique transcriptome profiles across these regions, we
      identified a substantial number of signaling pathway-associated genes with
      similar changes in expression in both SNI and CUS mice. Many of these genes have 
      been implicated in depression, anxiety, and chronic pain in patients. Our study
      provides a resource of the changes in gene expression induced by long-term
      neuropathic pain in three distinct brain regions and reveals molecular
      connections between pain and chronic stress.

TI  - Degrons in cancer.
LID - eaak9982 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aak9982 [doi]
AB  - Degrons are the elements that are used by E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins
      for degradation. Most degrons are short linear motifs embedded within the
      sequences of modular proteins. As regulatory sites for protein abundance, they
      are important for many different cellular processes, such as progression through 
      the cell cycle and monitoring cellular hypoxia. Degrons enable the elimination of
      proteins that are no longer required, preventing their possible dysfunction.
      Although the human genome encodes ~600 E3 ubiquitin ligases, only a fraction of
      these enzymes have well-defined target degrons. Thus, for most cellular proteins,
      the destruction mechanisms are poorly understood. This is important for many
      diseases, especially for cancer, a disease that involves the enhanced expression 
      of oncogenes and the persistence of encoded oncoproteins coupled with reduced
      abundance of tumor suppressors. Loss-of-function mutations occur in the degrons
      of several oncoproteins, such as the transcription factors MYC and NRF2, and in
      various mitogenic receptors, such as NOTCH1 and several receptor tyrosine
      kinases. Mutations eliminating the function of the beta-catenin degron are found 
      in many cancers and are considered one of the most abundant mutations driving
      carcinogenesis. In this Review, we describe the current knowledge of degrons in
      cancer and suggest that increased research on the "dark degrome" (unknown
      degron-E3 relationships) would enhance progress in cancer research.

TI  - Multiepitope tissue analysis reveals SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation as a key
      step in the transformation of melanocytes.

AB  - The evolution of cancer is characterized by the appearance of specific mutations,
      but these mutations are translated into proteins that must cooperate to induce
      malignant transformation. Using a systemic approach with the multiepitope ligand 
      cartography (MELC) technology, we analyzed protein expression profiles (PEPs) in 
      nevi and BRAF(V600E)-positive superficial spreading melanomas (SSMs) from patient
      tissues to identify key transformation events. The PEPs in nevi and SSMs differed
      predominantly in the abundance of specific antigens, but the PEPs of nevi- and
      melanoma-associated keratinocytes gradually changed during the transformation
      process. A stepwise change in PEP with similar properties occurred in
      keratinocytes cocultured with melanoma cells. Analysis of the individual steps
      indicated that activation of the metalloproteinase ADAM10 by signal peptide
      peptidase-like 3 (SPPL3) triggered by mutant BRAF(V600E) was a critical
      transformation event. SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation involved the translocation
      of SPPL3 and ADAM10 into Rab4- or Rab27-positive endosomal compartments. This
      endosomal translocation, and hence ADAM10 activation, was inhibited by the
      presence of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Our findings suggest that systematic
      tissue antigen analysis could complement whole-genome approaches to provide more 
      insight into cancer development.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets in pediatric brain tumors.
LID - eaaf7593 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf7593 [doi]
AB  - Brain tumors are among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in children.
      Although surgery, aggressive radiation, and chemotherapy have improved outcomes, 
      many patients still die of their disease. Moreover, those who survive often
      suffer devastating long-term side effects from the therapies. A greater
      understanding of the molecular underpinnings of these diseases will drive the
      development of new therapeutic approaches. Advances in genomics and epigenomics
      have provided unprecedented insight into the molecular diversity of these
      diseases and, in several cases, have revealed key genes and signaling pathways
      that drive tumor growth. These not only serve as potential therapeutic targets
      but also have facilitated the creation of animal models that faithfully
      recapitulate the human disease for preclinical studies. In this Review, we
      discuss recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of the three most
      common malignant pediatric brain tumors-medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and
      high-grade glioma-and the implications for development of safer and more
      effective therapies.

TI  - PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to 
      promote the progression of prostate cancer.
LID - eaag3326 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag3326 [doi]
AB  - Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate 
      epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and
      correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA
      functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice
      bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with
      transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and
      progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive
      tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with
      fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of
      PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half
      the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less
      activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more
      activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling.
      Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting
      signaling between the beta1 integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway,
      enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in
      PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published
      databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of 
      transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA abundance
      in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our
      findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to
      progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa
      progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/beta1 integrin axis
      may occur in other tumors.

      therapeutic perspectives.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal2323 [doi]
AB  - Cellular stress induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins at the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central feature of secretory cells and is
      observed in many tissues in various diseases, including cancer, diabetes,
      obesity, and neurodegenerative disorders. Cellular adaptation to ER stress is
      achieved by the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an integrated 
      signal transduction pathway that transmits information about the protein folding 
      status at the ER to the cytosol and nucleus to restore proteostasis. In the past 
      decade, ER stress has emerged as a major pathway in remodeling gene expression
      programs that either prevent transformation or provide selective advantage in
      cancer cells. Controlled by the formation of a dynamic scaffold onto which many
      regulatory components assemble, UPR signaling is a highly regulated process that 
      leads to an integrated reprogramming of the cell. In this Review, we provide an
      overview of the regulatory mechanisms underlying UPR signaling and how this
      pathway modulates cancer progression, particularly the aggressiveness and
      chemotherapeutic resistance exhibited by glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer. We
      also discuss the emerging cross-talk between the UPR and related metabolic
      processes to ensure maintenance of proteostasis, and we highlight possible
      therapeutic opportunities for targeting the pathway with small molecules.

AB  - This Podcast features a conversation with Science Signaling's Chief Scientific
      Editor Michael Yaffe about opportunities for signaling researchers to contribute 
      to the Cancer Moonshot, a federally funded initiative to accelerate cancer
      research. Administered by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the goal of the
      program is to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer.
      Signaling pathways are not only critical for the initiation and progression of
      cancer; they are also critical targets for treatment. In addition to developing
      new therapies, there are many other opportunities for signaling researchers to
      advance the goals of the Cancer Moonshot, such as improving methods of diagnosis 
      and prevention.Listen to Podcast.

AB  - The proteins that regulate cell proliferation, metastatic potential, survival in 
      circulation, and immune evasion represent most of the targets for therapeutic
      intervention in cancer. Furthermore, genomic profiling of just the cancer cells
      leaves critical information about the tumor microenvironment in the dark. The
      articles highlighted in this Focus Issue describe efforts to translate genomic
      data into knowledge of aberrant signaling that can be therapeutically targeted
      and strategies to explore not only the changes that occur in the protein
      landscape of the tumors but also in the protein profiles of the tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - RAF1/BRAF dimerization integrates the signal from RAS to ERK and ROKalpha.
LID - eaai8482 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8482 [doi]
AB  - Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) 
      RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical
      upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      module containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
      kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
      family. Either direct or scaffold protein-mediated interactions among the
      components of the ERK module (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate
      signal transmission. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of
      tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its interaction with the
      kinase ROKalpha, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal
      rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical
      modeling to show that the interaction of RAF1 with ROKalpha is coordinated with
      the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of
      RAF1 that interacted with and inhibited ROKalpha was generated during the
      interaction of RAF1 with the ERK module. This mechanism adds plasticity to the
      ERK pathway, enabling signal diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF.
      Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKalpha and
      cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to
      precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell
      shape, adhesion, or motility.

TI  - Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling.
LID - eaah3737 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah3737 [doi]
AB  - The factors that govern T cell activation control the initiation and progression 
      of adaptive immune responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the
      surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which
      results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two
      cells and the activation of the T cells. Activated T cells proliferate and
      differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B
      cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs
      differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells.
      Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that
      naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of
      effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller immune synapses
      with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it 
      undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with
      APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity
      of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small
      guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and
      LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell
      responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for
      modulating adaptive immunity.

      adrenocortical carcinoma cell invasion.

AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy with a dismal
      prognosis. Genomic studies have enabled progress in our understanding of the
      molecular bases of ACC, but factors that influence its prognosis are lacking.
      Amplification of the gene encoding the transcription factor steroidogenic
      factor-1 (SF-1; also known as NR5A1) is one of the genetic alterations common in 
      ACC. We identified a transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving increased
      abundance of VAV2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for small GTPases that
      control the cytoskeleton, driven by increased expression of the gene encoding
      SF-1 in ACC. Manipulating SF-1 and VAV2 abundance in cultured ACC cells revealed 
      that VAV2 was a critical factor for SF-1-induced cytoskeletal remodeling and
      invasion in culture (Matrigel) and in vivo (chicken chorioallantoic membrane)
      models. Analysis of ACC patient cohorts indicated that greater VAV2 abundance
      robustly correlated with poor prognosis in ACC patients. Because VAV2 is a
      druggable target, our findings suggest that blocking VAV2 may be a new
      therapeutic approach to inhibit metastatic progression in ACC patients.

      yeast.
LID - eaag2435 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag2435 [doi]
AB  - The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reacts to increased external
      osmolarity by modifying many cellular processes. Adaptive signaling relies
      primarily on the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is closely related
      to the mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in core
      architecture. To identify target proteins of the MAPK Hog1, we designed a mass
      spectrometry-based high-throughput experiment to measure the impact of Hog1
      activation or inhibition on the Scerevisiae phosphoproteome. In addition, we
      analyzed how deletion of RCK2, which encodes a known effector protein kinase
      target of Hog1, modulated osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation. Our results not
      only provide an overview of the diversity of cellular functions that are directly
      and indirectly affected by the activity of the HOG pathway but also enabled an
      assessment of the Hog1-independent events that occur under osmotic stress
      conditions. We extended the number of putative Hog1 direct targets by analyzing
      the modulation of motifs consisting of serine or threonine followed by a proline 
      (S/T-P motif) and subsequently validated these with an in vivo interaction assay.
      Rck2 appears to act as a central hub for many Hog1-mediated secondary
      phosphorylation events. This study clarifies many of the direct and indirect
      effects of HOG signaling and its stress-adaptive functions.

LID - eaam9536 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam9536 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Saumya Das, senior author of a Research
      Article that appears in the 28 February 2017 issue of Science Signaling, about a 
      protein that inhibits pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Temporary
      increases in cardiac workload, such as those caused by exercise or pregnancy,
      induce physiological cardiac hypertrophy, a beneficial type of heart enlargement 
      that is adaptive. However, a sustained increase in workload due to metabolic
      stress or uncontrolled high blood pressure induces pathological cardiac
      hypertrophy, which can contribute to heart failure. Simonson et al found that
      expression of DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4-like (DDiT4L) increased during
      pathological hypertrophy, but not during physiological hypertrophy, in mice.
      DDiT4L promoted stress-induced autophagy in cardiomyocytes by inhibiting
      signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and
      stimulating signaling through mTORC2. These findings suggest that targeting
      autophagy, which is important for cellular homeostasis but can be detrimental in 
      excess, may be useful for treating some cardiovascular diseases.Listen to
      Podcast.

TI  - Mitochondrial homeostasis in adipose tissue remodeling.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai9248 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated by a balance between mitochondrial
      biogenesis and degradation. Emerging evidence suggests that mitophagy, a
      selective form of autophagy that degrades mitochondria, plays a key role in the
      physiology and pathophysiology of mitochondria-enriched cells, such as brown and 
      beige adipocytes. This review discusses findings regarding the roles of autophagy
      and mitophagy in cellular development, maintenance, and functions of metabolic
      organs, including adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas. A better understanding of 
      the molecular links between mitophagy and energy metabolism will help to identify
      promising targets for the treatment of obesity and obesity-associated disorders.

TI  - DDiT4L promotes autophagy and inhibits pathological cardiac hypertrophy in
      response to stress.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf5967 [doi]
AB  - Physiological cardiac hypertrophy, in response to stimuli such as exercise, is
      considered adaptive and beneficial. In contrast, pathological cardiac hypertrophy
      that arises in response to pathological stimuli such as unrestrained high blood
      pressure and oxidative or metabolic stress is maladaptive and may precede heart
      failure. We found that the transcript encoding DNA damage-inducible transcript
      4-like (DDiT4L) was expressed in murine models of pathological cardiac
      hypertrophy but not in those of physiological cardiac hypertrophy. In
      cardiomyocytes, DDiT4L localized to early endosomes and promoted stress-induced
      autophagy through a process involving mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
      (mTORC1). Exposing cardiomyocytes to various types of pathological stress
      increased the abundance of DDiT4L, which inhibited mTORC1 but activated mTORC2
      signaling. Mice with conditional cardiac-specific overexpression of DDiT4L had
      mild systolic dysfunction, increased baseline autophagy, reduced mTORC1 activity,
      and increased mTORC2 activity, all of which were reversed by suppression of
      transgene expression. Genetic suppression of autophagy also reversed cardiac
      dysfunction in these mice. Our data showed that DDiT4L may be an important
      transducer of pathological stress to autophagy through mTOR signaling in the
      heart and that DDiT4L could be therapeutically targeted in cardiovascular
      diseases in which autophagy and mTOR signaling play a major role.

TI  - Retrograde signaling from autophagy modulates stress responses.
LID - eaag2791 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag2791 [doi]
AB  - Macroautophagy is a process in which cytoplasmic components, including whole
      organelles, are degraded within lysosomes. Basally, this process is essential for
      homeostasis and is constitutively functional in most cells, but it can also be
      implemented as part of stress responses. We discuss findings showing that
      autophagy proteins can modulate and amplify the activities of transcription
      factors involved in stress responses, such as those in the p53, FOXO, MiT/TFE,
      Nrf2, and NFkappaB/Rel families. Thus, transcription factors not only amplify
      stress responses and autophagy but are also subject to retrograde regulation by
      autophagy-related proteins. Physical interactions with autophagy-related
      proteins, competition for activating intermediates, and "signalphagy," which is
      the role autophagy plays in the degradation of specific signaling proteins,
      together provide powerful tools for implementing negative feedback or positive
      feed-forward loops on the transcription factors that regulate autophagy. We
      present examples illustrating how this network interacts to regulate metabolic
      and physiologic responses.

TI  - Target acquired: Selective autophagy in cardiometabolic disease.
LID - eaag2298 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag2298 [doi]
AB  - The accumulation of damaged or excess proteins and organelles is a defining
      feature of metabolic disease in nearly every tissue. Thus, a central challenge in
      maintaining metabolic homeostasis is the identification, sequestration, and
      degradation of these cellular components, including protein aggregates,
      mitochondria, peroxisomes, inflammasomes, and lipid droplets. A primary route
      through which this challenge is met is selective autophagy, the targeting of
      specific cellular cargo for autophagic compartmentalization and lysosomal
      degradation. In addition to its roles in degradation, selective autophagy is
      emerging as an integral component of inflammatory and metabolic signaling
      cascades. In this Review, we focus on emerging evidence and key questions about
      the role of selective autophagy in the cell biology and pathophysiology of
      metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and
      steatohepatitis. Essential players in these processes are the selective autophagy
      receptors, defined broadly as adapter proteins that both recognize cargo and
      target it to the autophagosome. Additional domains within these receptors may
      allow integration of information about autophagic flux with critical regulators
      of cellular metabolism and inflammation. Details regarding the precise receptors 
      involved, such as p62 and NBR1, and their predominant interacting partners are
      just beginning to be defined. Overall, we anticipate that the continued study of 
      selective autophagy will prove to be informative in understanding the
      pathogenesis of metabolic diseases and to provide previously unrecognized
      therapeutic targets.

AB  - This week's articles identify a requirement for lipid transport between the
      endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane in insulin release, a mechanism in
      which contact with a host cell reprograms bacterial gene expression, a signal
      from a soybean pathogen that impairs soybean's defense response, and a mechanism 
      by which hair follicles may be leveraged to reduce scar formation.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 21 February 2017: Pentraxin-3 in basal-like breast 
      cancer.
LID - eaam8855 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam8855 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Antoine Karnoub, senior author of a
      Research Article that appears in the 21 February 2017 issue of Science Signaling,
      about how pentraxin-3 (PTX3) links increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
      signaling to stem cell properties in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). BLBC is an 
      aggressive type of breast cancer in which the tumor cells exhibit increased PI3K 
      signaling and have stem cell-like properties. Thomas et al found that aberrant
      PI3K signaling in BLBCs stimulated the expression of PTX3, which encodes a
      protein that functions in innate immunity. PTX3 promoted stem cell-like traits in
      mammary epithelial cells and stimulated the growth of breast cancer cells.
      Conversely, decreasing the abundance of PTX3 in breast cancer cells reduced both 
      the growth of these cells and their expression of stem cell markers. The
      abundance of PTX3 transcripts in breast tumors negatively correlated with patient
      survival, suggesting that PTX3 may be a useful biomarker for stratifying BLBC
      patients and that targeting PTX3 may suppress tumor growth in some BLBC
      patients.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - The flavonoid cyanidin blocks binding of the cytokine interleukin-17A to the
      IL-17RA subunit to alleviate inflammation in vivo.
LID - eaaf8823 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf8823 [doi]
AB  - Cyanidin, a key flavonoid that is present in red berries and other fruits,
      attenuates the development of several diseases, including asthma, diabetes,
      atherosclerosis, and cancer, through its anti-inflammatory effects. We
      investigated the molecular basis of cyanidin action. Through a structure-based
      search for small molecules that inhibit signaling by the proinflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-17A (IL-17A), we found that cyanidin specifically recognizes an
      IL-17A binding site in the IL-17A receptor subunit (IL-17RA) and inhibits the
      IL-17A/IL-17RA interaction. Experiments with mice demonstrated that cyanidin
      inhibited IL-17A-induced skin hyperplasia, attenuated inflammation induced by
      IL-17-producing T helper 17 (TH17) cells (but not that induced by TH1 or TH2
      cells), and alleviated airway hyperreactivity in models of steroid-resistant and 
      severe asthma. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized molecular
      mechanism of action of cyanidin, which may inform its further development into an
      effective small-molecule drug for the treatment of IL-17A-dependent inflammatory 
      diseases and cancer.

TI  - Transcriptional activation of lipogenesis by insulin requires phosphorylation of 
      MED17 by CK2.
LID - eaai8596 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8596 [doi]
AB  - De novo lipogenesis is precisely regulated by nutritional and hormonal
      conditions. The genes encoding various enzymes involved in this process, such as 
      fatty acid synthase (FASN), are transcriptionally activated in response to
      insulin. We showed that USF1, a key transcription factor for FASN activation,
      directly interacted with the Mediator subunit MED17 at the FASN promoter. This
      interaction recruited Mediator, which can bring POL II and other general
      transcription machinery to the complex. Moreover, we showed that MED17 was
      phosphorylated at Ser(53) by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the livers of fed mice or
      insulin-stimulated hepatocytes, but not in the livers of fasted mice or untreated
      hepatocytes. Furthermore, activation of the FASN promoter in response to insulin 
      required this CK2-mediated phosphorylation event, which occurred only in the
      absence of p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation at Thr(570) Overexpression of a
      nonphosphorylatable S53A MED17 mutant or knockdown of MED17, as well as CK2
      knockdown or inhibition, impaired hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis and
      decreased triglyceride content in mice. These results demonstrate that
      CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser(53) in MED17 is required for the
      transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes in response to insulin.

TI  - Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase
      activity with analgesic properties.
LID - eaah5381 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah5381 [doi]
AB  - Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are
      stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout
      mice suggest that inhibitors of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid
      dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in
      substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a
      selective AC1 inhibitor with a chromone core structure that may represent a new
      analgesic agent. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited
      Ca(2+)-stimulated adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human
      embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we
      confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound
      ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and
      Galphas-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed inhibitory activity in
      multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. 
      ST034307 enhanced mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated inhibition of AC1 in
      short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR;
      however, the compound blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic
      MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model
      of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective
      small-molecule inhibitor of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 inhibitors may be 
      useful for managing pain.

TI  - Pentraxin-3 is a PI3K signaling target that promotes stem cell-like traits in
      basal-like breast cancers.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4674 [doi]
AB  - Basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) exhibit hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway because of the frequent mutational activation
      of the PIK3CA catalytic subunit and the genetic loss of its negative regulators
      PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and INPP4B (inositol
      polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II). However, PI3K inhibitors have had limited
      clinical efficacy in BLBC management because of compensatory amplification of
      PI3K downstream signaling loops. Therefore, identification of critical PI3K
      mediators is paramount to the development of effective BLBC therapeutics. Using
      transcriptomic analysis of activated PIK3CA-expressing BLBC cells, we identified 
      the gene encoding the humoral pattern recognition molecule pentraxin-3 (PTX3) as 
      a critical target of oncogenic PI3K signaling. We found that PTX3 abundance is
      stimulated, in part, through AKT- and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent
      pathways and that presence of PTX3 is necessary for PI3K-induced stem cell-like
      traits. We further showed that PTX3 expression is greater in tumor samples from
      patients with BLBC and that it is prognostic of poor patient survival. Our
      results thus reveal PTX3 as a newly identified PI3K-regulated biomarker and a
      potential therapeutic target in BLBC.

TI  - The host microRNA miR-301a blocks the IRF1-mediated neuronal innate immune
      response to Japanese encephalitis virus infection.
PG  - eaaf5185
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf5185 [doi]
AB  - Effective recognition of viral components and the subsequent stimulation of the
      production of type I interferons (IFNs) is crucial for the induction of host
      antiviral immunity. The failure of the host to efficiently produce type I IFNs in
      response to infection by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is linked with an 
      increased probability for the disease to become lethal. JEV is a neurotropic
      virus of the Flaviviridae family that causes encephalitis in humans. JEV
      infection is regulated by several host factors, including microRNAs, which are
      conserved noncoding RNAs that participate in various physiological and
      pathological processes. We showed that the JEV-induced expression of miR-301a led
      to inhibition of the production of type I IFN by reducing the abundances of the
      transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the signaling protein
      suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5). Mechanistically, induction of
      miR-301a expression during JEV infection required the transcription factor
      nuclear factor kappaB. In mouse neurons, neutralization of miR-301a restored the 
      host innate immune response by enabling IFN-beta production, thereby restricting 
      viral propagation. Inhibition of miR-301a in mouse brain rescued the production
      of IRF1 and SOCS5, increased the generation of IFN-beta, and reduced the extent
      of JEV replication, thus improving mouse survival. Thus, our study suggests that 
      the JEV-induced expression of miR-301a assists viral pathogenesis by suppressing 
      IFN production, which might be targeted by antiviral therapies.

TI  - Acetylation-dependent regulation of MDM2 E3 ligase activity dictates its
      oncogenic function.
LID - eaai8026 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai8026 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal activation of the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2
      (MDM2) is frequently observed in human cancers. By ubiquitinating the tumor
      suppressor p53 protein, which leads to its proteasome-mediated destruction, MDM2 
      limits the tumor-suppressing activity of p53. On the other hand, by
      ubiquitinating itself, MDM2 targets itself for destruction and promotes the p53
      tumor suppressor pathway, a process that can be antagonized by the deubiquitinase
      herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP). We investigated the
      regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity and found that acetyltransferase
      p300-mediated acetylation and stabilization of MDM2 are molecular switches that
      block self-ubiquitination, thereby shifting its E3 ligase activity toward p53. In
      vitro and in cancer cell lines, p300-mediated acetylation of MDM2 on Lys(182) and
      Lys(185) enabled HAUSP to bind, presumably deubiquitinate, and stabilize MDM2.
      This acetylation within the nuclear localization signal domain decreased its
      interaction with the acidic domain, subsequently increased the interaction
      between the acidic domain and RING domain in MDM2, enabled the binding of HAUSP
      to the acidic domain in MDM2, and shifted MDM2 activity from autoubiquitination
      to p53 ubiquitination. However, upon genotoxic stress through exposure to
      etoposide, the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylated MDM2 at Lys(182) and
      Lys(185), thereby promoting self-ubiquitination and less ubiquitination and
      subsequent degradation of p53, thus increasing p53-dependent apoptosis.
      Therefore, this study indicates that dynamic acetylation is a molecular switch in
      the regulation of MDM2 substrate specificity, revealing further insight into the 
      posttranslational regulation of the MDM2/p53 cell survival axis.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for thermogenesis that is not
      associated with shivering through the process of converting chemical energy into 
      heat through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the mitochondria. Thus, expanding or 
      activating BAT could be a potential tool against obesity. To analyze the effect
      of kinase signaling on brown adipocyte formation, a process that describes the
      acquisition of the ability to dissipate energy as heat, we performed
      lentiviral-mediated short hairpin knockdown or used pharmacological inhibitors in
      a high-content and high-throughput in vitro image-based screen. We identified 190
      kinases that either stimulated or inhibited brown adipocyte proliferation,
      differentiation, or formation. Among these kinases, we found that 5'
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) promoted the formation of brown adipocytes
      abundant inUCP1. Together, our results provide insight into the kinases,
      particularly AMPK, that regulate brown adipocyte formation.

TI  - Prostaglandin E2-EP2-NF-kappaB signaling in macrophages as a potential
      therapeutic target for intracranial aneurysms.
LID - eaah6037 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah6037 [doi]
AB  - Intracranial aneurysms are common but are generally untreated, and their rupture 
      can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because of the poor prognosis associated
      with subarachnoid hemorrhage, preventing the progression of intracranial
      aneurysms is critically important. Intracranial aneurysms are caused by chronic
      inflammation of the arterial wall due to macrophage infiltration triggered by
      monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage activation mediated by the
      transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and inflammatory
      signaling involving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin E receptor subtype 
      2 (EP2). We correlated EP2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with macrophage
      infiltration in human intracranial aneurysm lesions. Monitoring the
      spatiotemporal pattern of NF-kappaB activation during intracranial aneurysm
      development in mice showed that NF-kappaB was first activated in macrophages in
      the adventitia and in endothelial cells and, subsequently, in the entire arterial
      wall. Mice with a macrophage-specific deletion of Ptger2 (which encodes EP2) or
      macrophage-specific expression of an IkappaBalpha mutant that restricts NF-kappaB
      activation had fewer intracranial aneurysms with reduced macrophage infiltration 
      and NF-kappaB activation. In cultured cells, EP2 signaling cooperated with tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) to activate NF-kappaB and synergistically
      induce the expression of proinflammatory genes, including Ptgs2 (encoding COX-2).
      EP2 signaling also stabilized Ccl2 (encoding MCP-1) by activating the
      RNA-stabilizing protein HuR. Rats administered an EP2 antagonist had reduced
      macrophage infiltration and intracranial aneurysm formation and progression. This
      signaling pathway in macrophages thus facilitates intracranial aneurysm
      development by amplifying inflammation in intracranial arteries. These results
      indicate that EP2 antagonists may therefore be a therapeutic alternative to
      surgery.

      development of most organs, including teeth. Bcl9 and Bcl9l are tissue-specific
      transcriptional cofactors that cooperate with beta-catenin. In the nucleus, Bcl9 
      and Bcl9l simultaneously bind beta-catenin and the transcriptional activator
      Pygo2 to promote the transcription of a subset of Wnt target genes. We showed
      that Bcl9 and Bcl9l function in the cytoplasm during tooth enamel formation in a 
      manner that is independent of Wnt-stimulated beta-catenin-dependent
      transcription. Bcl9, Bcl9l, and Pygo2 localized mainly to the cytoplasm of the
      epithelial-derived ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel production. In
      ameloblasts, Bcl9 interacted with proteins involved in enamel formation and
      proteins involved in exocytosis and vesicular trafficking. Conditional deletion
      of both Bcl9 and Bcl9l or both Pygo1 and Pygo2 in mice produced teeth with
      defective enamel that was bright white and deficient in iron, which is
      reminiscent of human tooth enamel pathologies. Overall, our data revealed that
      these proteins, originally defined through their function as beta-catenin
      transcriptional cofactors, function in odontogenesis through a previously
      uncharacterized cytoplasmic mechanism, revealing that they have roles beyond that
      of transcriptional cofactors.

TI  - AMPK promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and function by phosphorylating the
      epigenetic factors DNMT1, RBBP7, and HAT1.
LID - eaaf7478 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf7478 [doi]
AB  - Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a master
      regulator of cellular energy homeostasis by directly phosphorylating metabolic
      enzymes and nutrient transporters and by indirectly promoting the transactivation
      of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We explored
      the mechanism of AMPK-mediated induction of gene expression. We identified AMPK
      consensus phosphorylation sequences in three proteins involved in nucleosome
      remodeling: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), retinoblastoma binding protein 7
      (RBBP7), and histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1). DNMT1 mediates DNA methylation
      that limits transcription factor access to promoters and is inhibited by RBBP7.
      Acetylation of histones by HAT1 creates a more relaxed chromatin-DNA structure
      that favors transcription. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation resulted in the
      activation of HAT1 and inhibition of DNMT1. For DNMT1, this inhibition was both a
      direct effect of phosphorylation and the result of increased interaction with
      RBBP7. In human umbilical vein cells, pharmacological AMPK activation or
      pulsatile shear stress triggered nucleosome remodeling and decreased cytosine
      methylation, leading to increased expression of nuclear genes encoding factors
      involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, such as peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha),
      transcription factor A (Tfam), and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3).
      Similar effects were seen in the aortas of mice given pharmacological AMPK
      activators, and these effects required AMPK2alpha. These results enhance our
      understanding of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial gene expression through nucleosome
      remodeling.

TI  - TFEB inhibits endothelial cell inflammation and reduces atherosclerosis.
LID - eaah4214 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4214 [doi]
AB  - Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosome
      biogenesis. We investigated the function of TFEB in vascular biology and
      pathophysiology and demonstrated that TFEB in endothelial cells inhibited
      inflammation and reduced atherosclerosis development. Laminar shear stress, which
      protects against atherosclerosis, increased TFEB abundance in cultured primary
      human endothelial cells. Furthermore, TFEB overexpression in these cells was
      anti-inflammatory, whereas TFEB knockdown aggravated inflammation. The
      anti-inflammatory effect of TFEB was, at least, partially due to reduced
      oxidative stress because TFEB overexpression in endothelial cells decreased the
      concentrations of reactive oxygen species and increased the expression of the
      antioxidant genes HO1 (which encodes heme oxygenase 1) and SOD2 (which encodes
      superoxide dismutase 2). In addition, transgenic mice with endothelial
      cell-specific expression of TFEB exhibited reduced leukocyte recruitment to
      endothelial cells and decreased atherosclerosis development. Our study suggests
      that TFEB is a protective transcription factor against endothelial cell
      inflammation and a potential target for treating atherosclerosis and associated
      cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Endothelial cells serve as a barrier between blood and tissues. Maintenance of
      the endothelial cell barrier depends on the integrity of intercellular junctions,
      which is regulated by a polarity complex that includes the zeta isoform of
      atypical protein kinase C (PKCzeta) and partitioning defective 3 (PAR3). We
      revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDZ domain-containing ring finger 3
      (PDZRN3) regulated endothelial intercellular junction integrity. Endothelial
      cell-specific overexpression of Pdzrn3 led to early embryonic lethality with
      severe hemorrhaging and altered organization of endothelial intercellular
      junctions. Conversely, endothelial-specific loss of Pdzrn3 prevented vascular
      leakage in a mouse model of transient ischemic stroke, an effect that was
      mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of PKCzeta. PDZRN3 regulated Wnt signaling
      and associated with a complex containing PAR3, PKCzeta, and the multi-PDZ domain 
      protein MUPP1 (Discs Lost-multi-PDZ domain protein 1) and targeted MUPP1 for
      proteasomal degradation in transfected cells. Transient ischemic stroke increased
      the ubiquitination of MUPP1, and deficiency of MUPP1 in endothelial cells was
      associated with decreased localization of PKCzeta and PAR3 at intercellular
      junctions. In endothelial cells, Pdzrn3 overexpression increased permeability
      through a PKCzeta-dependent pathway. In contrast, Pdzrn3 depletion enhanced
      PKCzeta accumulation at cell-cell contacts and reinforced the cortical actin
      cytoskeleton under stress conditions. These findings reveal how PDZRN3 regulates 
      vascular permeability through a PKCzeta-containing complex.

TI  - Phosphorylation of Ser1928 mediates the enhanced activity of the L-type Ca2+
      channel Cav1.2 by the beta2-adrenergic receptor in neurons.

AB  - The L-type Ca(2+) channel Cav1.2 controls multiple functions throughout the body 
      including heart rate and neuronal excitability. It is a key mediator of
      fight-or-flight stress responses triggered by a signaling pathway involving
      beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and
      protein kinase A (PKA). PKA readily phosphorylates Ser(1928) in Cav1.2 in vitro
      and in vivo, including in rodents and humans. However, S1928A knock-in (KI) mice 
      have normal PKA-mediated L-type channel regulation in the heart, indicating that 
      Ser(1928) is not required for regulation of cardiac Cav1.2 by PKA in this tissue.
      We report that augmentation of L-type currents by PKA in neurons was absent in
      S1928A KI mice. Furthermore, S1928A KI mice failed to induce long-term
      potentiation in response to prolonged theta-tetanus (PTT-LTP), a form of synaptic
      plasticity that requires Cav1.2 and enhancement of its activity by the
      beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR)-cAMP-PKA cascade. Thus, there is an
      unexpected dichotomy in the control of Cav1.2 by PKA in cardiomyocytes and
      hippocampal neurons.

TI  - Ser1928 phosphorylation by PKA stimulates the L-type Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 and
      vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia and diabetes.
LID - eaaf9647 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf9647 [doi]
AB  - Hypercontractility of arterial myocytes and enhanced vascular tone during
      diabetes are, in part, attributed to the effects of increased glucose
      (hyperglycemia) on L-type CaV1.2 channels. In murine arterial myocytes,
      kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in CaV1.2 activity in response
      to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the CaV1.2
      channel pore-forming subunit (alpha1C) within nanometer proximity of protein
      kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This
      arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150
      (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in CaV1.2 channel activity were
      associated with PKA activity, leading to alpha1C phosphorylation at Ser(1928)
      Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)-fed mice and nondiabetic patients,
      arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and from diabetic patients had
      increased Ser(1928) phosphorylation and CaV1.2 activity. Arterial myocytes and
      arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind
      PKA did not exhibit increased Ser(1928) phosphorylation and CaV1.2 current
      density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional 
      role for Ser(1928) phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin
      mice expressing a CaV1.2 with Ser(1928) mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked
      glucose-mediated increases in CaV1.2 activity and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, 
      the HFD-induced increases in CaV1.2 current density and myogenic tone were
      prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for
      alpha1C phosphorylation at Ser(1928) in stimulating CaV1.2 channel activity and
      vasoconstriction by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to increased glucose and in
      diabetes.

TI  - ERK signaling pathway regulates sleep duration through activity-induced gene
      expression during wakefulness.
LID - eaai9219 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aai9219 [doi]
AB  - Wakefulness is accompanied by experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and an
      increase in activity-regulated gene transcription. Wake-induced genes are
      certainly markers of neuronal activity and may also directly regulate the
      duration of and need for sleep. We stimulated murine cortical cultures with the
      neuromodulatory signals that are known to control wakefulness in the brain and
      found that norepinephrine alone or a mixture of these neuromodulators induced
      activity-regulated gene transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of the various 
      signaling pathways involved in the regulation of gene expression indicated that
      the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is the principal one
      mediating the effects of waking neuromodulators on gene expression. In mice, ERK 
      phosphorylation in the cortex increased and decreased with wakefulness and sleep.
      Whole-body or cortical neuron-specific deletion of Erk1 or Erk2 significantly
      increased the duration of wakefulness in mice, and pharmacological inhibition of 
      ERK phosphorylation decreased sleep duration and increased the duration of
      wakefulness bouts. Thus, this signaling pathway, which is highly conserved from
      Drosophila to mammals, is a key pathway that links waking experience-induced
      neuronal gene expression to sleep duration and quality.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 24 January 2017: Tissue-specific regulation of
      L-type calcium channels.
LID - eaam6582 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam6582 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Johannes Hell and Manuel Navedo, senior
      authors of two Research Articles that appear in the 24 January 2017 issue of
      Science Signaling, about tissue-specific regulation of the L-type calcium channel
      CaV1.2. This channel is present in many tissues, including the heart,
      vasculature, and brain, and allows calcium to flow into cells when it is
      activated. Signaling through the beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) stimulates
      CaV1.2 activity in heart cells and neurons to accelerate heart rate and increase 
      neuronal excitability, respectively. Using mouse models, Qian et al found that
      betaAR-mediated enhancement of CaV1.2 activity in the brain required
      phosphorylation of Ser(1928), whereas betaAR-mediated enhancement of CaV1.2
      activity in the heart did not require phosphorylation of this residue. In a
      related study, Nystoriak et al demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser(1928) in 
      arterial myocytes was required for vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia
      and in diabetic mice. These findings demonstrate tissue-specific differences in
      CaV1.2 regulation and suggest that it may be possible to design therapies to
      target this channel in specific tissues.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian
      cancer cells and tumor-associated Tregs.
LID - eaaf8608 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf8608 [doi]
AB  - Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly
      target tumors through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. Tumor necrosis
      factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its
      restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive Tregs and oncogenic presence on 
      human tumors. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic 
      antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists
      inhibited Treg proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, 
      and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the 
      presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed
      Tregs isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed Tregs
      from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity
      for the tumor microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian 
      cancer cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized
      antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to
      activate the nuclear factor kappaB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our
      data suggest that, by targeting tumor cells and immunosuppressive
      tumor-associated Tregs, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective
      treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.

TI  - De novo phosphorylation and conformational opening of the tyrosine kinase Lck act
      in concert to initiate T cell receptor signaling.
LID - eaaf4736 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf4736 [doi]
AB  - The enzymatic activity of the Src family tyrosine kinase p56(Lck) (Lck) is
      tightly controlled by differential phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues,
      Tyr(394) and Tyr(505) Phosphorylation of Tyr(394) and the conformational opening 
      of Lck are believed to activate the kinase, whereas Tyr(505) phosphorylation is
      thought to generate a closed, inactive conformation of Lck. We investigated
      whether the conformation of Lck and its phosphorylation state act in concert to
      regulate the initiation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. With a sensitive
      biosensor, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to investigate
      the conformations of wild-type Lck and its phosphorylation-deficient mutants
      Y394F and Y505F and the double mutant Y394F/Y505F in unstimulated T cells and
      after TCR stimulation. With this approach, we separated the conformational
      changes of Lck from the phosphorylation state of its regulatory tyrosines. We
      showed that the conformational opening of Lck alone was insufficient to initiate 
      signaling events in T cells. Rather, Lck additionally required phosphorylation of
      Tyr(394) to induce T cell activation. Consistent with the FLIM measurements, an
      optimized immunofluorescence microscopy protocol revealed that the TCR-stimulated
      phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr(394) occurred preferentially at the plasma membrane
      of Jurkat cells and primary human T cells. Our study supports the hypothesis that
      T cell activation through the TCR complex is accompanied by the de novo
      activation of Lck and that phosphorylation of Tyr(394) plays a role in Lck
      function that goes beyond inducing an open conformation of the kinase.

TI  - Targeting TNFR2, an immune checkpoint stimulator and oncoprotein, is a promising 
      treatment for cancer.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aal2328 [doi]
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is expressed both by some cancer cells
      and by tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells
      (Tregs). TNFR2 stimulates the activation and proliferation of Tregs, a major
      checkpoint of antitumor immune responses, and promotes cancer cell survival and
      tumor growth. In this issue of Science Signaling, Torrey et al found that
      dominant antagonistic antibodies against human TNFR2 may be a potential therapy
      for ovarian cancer patients by simultaneously suppressing Treg activity and
      inducing the death of the cancer cells.

TI  - The neuropilin 2 isoform NRP2b uniquely supports TGFbeta-mediated progression in 
      lung cancer.
LID - eaag0528 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag0528 [doi]
AB  - Neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2) are co-receptors for heparin-binding growth factors
      and class 3 semaphorins. Different isoforms of NRP1 and NRP2 are produced by
      alternative splicing. We found that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
      lines, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signaling preferentially
      increased the abundance of NRP2b. NRP2b and NRP2a differ only in their
      carboxyl-terminal regions. Although the presence of NRP2b inhibited cultured cell
      proliferation and primary tumor growth, NRP2b enhanced cellular migration,
      invasion into Matrigel, and tumorsphere formation in cultured cells in response
      to TGFbeta signaling and promoted metastasis in xenograft mouse models. These
      effects of overexpressed NRP2b contrast with the effects of overexpressed NRP2a. 
      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced phosphorylation of the kinase AKT was
      specifically promoted by NRP2b, whereas inhibiting the HGF receptor MET
      attenuated NRP2b-dependent cell migration. Unlike NRP2a, NRP2b did not bind the
      PDZ domain scaffolding protein GAIP carboxyl terminus-interacting protein (GIPC1)
      and only weakly recruited phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), potentially
      explaining the difference between NRP2b-mediated and NRP2a-mediated effects.
      Analysis of NSCLC patient tumors showed that NRP2b abundance correlated with that
      of the immune cell checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1 as well as with
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes in the tumors, acquired
      resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, disease
      progression, and poor survival in patients. NRP2b knockdown attenuated the
      acquisition of resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in cultured NSCLC
      cells. Thus, in NSCLC, NRP2b contributed to the oncogenic response to TGFbeta and
      correlated with tumor progression in patients.

TI  - Reduced abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP contributes to decreased
      expression of the INK4/ARF locus in non-small cell lung cancer.
LID - eaaf8223 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf8223 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor p16(INK4a), one protein encoded by the INK4/ARF locus, is
      frequently absent in multiple cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Whereas increased methylation of the encoding gene (CDKN2A) accounts for
      its loss in a third of patients, no molecular explanation exists for the
      remainder. We unraveled an alternative mechanism for the silencing of the
      INK4/ARF locus involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional cofactor
      E6AP (also known as UBE3A). We found that the expression of three tumor
      suppressor genes encoded in the INK4/ARF locus (p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and
      p19(ARF)) was decreased in E6AP(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts. E6AP induced the
      expression of the INK4/ARF locus at the transcriptional level by inhibiting CDC6 
      transcription, a gene encoding a key repressor of the locus. Luciferase assays
      revealed that E6AP inhibited CDC6 expression by reducing its E2F1-dependent
      transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that E6AP reduced
      the amount of E2F1 at the CDC6 promoter. In a subset of NSCLC samples, an
      E6AP-low/CDC6-high/p16(INK4a)-low protein abundance profile correlated with low
      methylation of the gene encoding p16(INK4a) (CDKN2A) and poor patient prognosis. 
      These findings define a previously unrecognized tumor-suppressive role for E6AP
      in NSCLC, reveal an alternative silencing mechanism of the INK4/ARF locus, and
      reveal E6AP as a potential prognostic marker in NSCLC.

TI  - Autocrine Wnt regulates the survival and genomic stability of embryonic stem
      cells.
LID - eaah6829 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah6829 [doi]
AB  - Wnt signaling plays an important role in the self-renewal and differentiation of 
      stem cells. The secretion of Wnt ligands requires Evi (also known as Wls).
      Genetically ablating Evi provides an experimental approach to studying the
      consequence of depleting all redundant Wnt proteins, and overexpressing Evi
      enables a nonspecific means of increasing Wnt signaling. We generated
      Evi-deficient and Evi-overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to analyze
      the role of autocrine Wnt production in self-renewal and differentiation.
      Self-renewal was reduced in Evi-deficient ESCs and increased in
      Evi-overexpressing ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, which
      supports the self-renewal of ESCs. The differentiation of ESCs into
      cardiomyocytes was enhanced when Evi was overexpressed and teratoma formation and
      growth of Evi-deficient ESCs in vivo were impaired, indicating that autocrine Wnt
      ligands were necessary for ESC differentiation and survival. ESCs lacking
      autocrine Wnt signaling had mitotic defects and showed genomic instability.
      Together, our study demonstrates that autocrine Wnt secretion is important for
      the survival, chromosomal stability, differentiation, and tumorigenic potential
      of ESCs.

TI  - Synergistic regulation of serotonin and opioid signaling contributes to pain
      insensitivity in Nav1.7 knockout mice.
LID - eaah4874 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4874 [doi]
AB  - Genetic loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 (Nav1.7(-/-)) results in 
      lifelong insensitivity to pain in mice and humans. One underlying cause is an
      increase in the production of endogenous opioids in sensory neurons. We analyzed 
      whether Nav1.7 deficiency altered nociceptive heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as initiated
      by GPCRs that respond to serotonin (pronociceptive) or opioids (antinociceptive),
      in sensory neurons. We found that the nociceptive neurons of Nav1.7 knockout
      (Nav1.7(-/-)) mice, but not those of Nav1.8 knockout (Nav1.8(-/-)) mice,
      exhibited decreased pronociceptive serotonergic signaling through the 5-HT4
      receptors, which are Galphas-coupled GPCRs that stimulate the production of
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as
      well as reduced abundance of the RIIbeta regulatory subunit of PKA.
      Simultaneously, the efficacy of antinociceptive opioid signaling mediated by the 
      Galphai-coupled mu opioid receptors was increased. Consequently, opioids
      inhibited more efficiently tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium currents, which are
      important for pain-initiating neuronal activity in nociceptive neurons. Thus,
      Nav1.7 controls the efficacy and balance of GPCR-mediated pro- and
      antinociceptive intracellular signaling, such that without Nav1.7, the balance is
      shifted toward antinociception, resulting in lifelong endogenous analgesia.

TI  - Signaling by two-component system noncognate partners promotes intrinsic
      tolerance to polymyxin B in uropathogenic Escherichia coli.
LID - eaag1775 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag1775 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria use two-component systems (TCSs) to react appropriately to environmental
      stimuli. Typical TCSs comprise a sensor histidine kinase that acts as a receptor 
      coupled to a partner response regulator that coordinates changes in bacterial
      behavior, often through its activity as a transcriptional regulator. TCS
      interactions are typically confined to cognate pairs of histidine kinases and
      response regulators. We describe two distinct TCSs in uropathogenic Escherichia
      coli (UPEC) that interact to mediate a response to ferric iron. The PmrAB and
      QseBC TCSs were both required for proper transcriptional response to ferric iron.
      Ferric iron induced the histidine kinase PmrB to phosphotransfer to both its
      cognate response regulator PmrA and the noncognate response regulator QseB,
      leading to transcriptional responses coordinated by both regulators. Pretreatment
      of the UPEC strain UTI89 with ferric iron led to increased resistance to
      polymyxin B that required both PmrA and QseB. Similarly, pretreatment of several 
      UPEC isolates with ferric iron increased tolerance to polymyxin B. This study
      defines physiologically relevant cross talk between TCSs in a bacterial pathogen 
      and provides a potential mechanism for antibiotic resistance of some strains of
      UPEC.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4117 [doi]
AB  - The SCF(beta-TRCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays pivotal roles in normal
      cellular physiology and in pathophysiological conditions. Identification of
      beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TRCP) substrates is therefore
      critical to understand SCF(beta-TRCP) biology and function. We used a
      beta-TRCP-phosphodegron motif-specific antibody in a beta-TRCP substrate screen
      coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and identified multiple beta-TRCP
      substrates. One of these substrates was Lipin1, an enzyme and suppressor of the
      family of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription
      factors, which activate genes encoding lipogenic factors. We showed that
      SCF(beta-TRCP) specifically interacted with and promoted the polyubiquitination
      of Lipin1 in a manner that required phosphorylation of Lipin1 by mechanistic
      target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) and casein kinase I (CKI). beta-TRCP depletion in 
      HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted in increased Lipin1 protein
      abundance, suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression, and attenuation of
      triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, beta-TRCP1 knockout mice showed increased
      Lipin1 protein abundance and were protected from hepatic steatosis induced by a
      high-fat diet. Together, these data reveal a critical physiological function of
      beta-TRCP in regulating hepatic lipid metabolic homeostasis in part through
      modulating Lipin1 stability.

TI  - The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates nuclear translocation of the epidermal 
      growth factor receptor.
LID - eaag1064 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag1064 [doi]
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target in patients
      with various cancers. Unfortunately, resistance to EGFR-targeted therapeutics is 
      common. Previous studies identified two mechanisms of resistance to the EGFR
      monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Nuclear translocation of EGFR bypasses the
      inhibitory effects of cetuximab, and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates
      cetuximab resistance by maintaining EGFR activation and downstream signaling.
      Thus, we hypothesized that AXL mediated the nuclear translocation of EGFR in the 
      setting of cetuximab resistance. Cetuximab-resistant clones of non-small cell
      lung cancer in culture and patient-derived xenografts in mice had increased
      abundance of AXL and nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Cellular fractionation analysis,
      super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that genetic loss
      of AXL reduced the accumulation of nEGFR. SRC family kinases (SFKs) and HER
      family ligands promote the nuclear translocation of EGFR. We found that AXL
      knockdown reduced the expression of the genes encoding the SFK family members YES
      and LYN and the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). AXL knockdown also decreased the
      interaction between EGFR and the related receptor HER3 and accumulation of HER3
      in the nucleus. Overexpression of LYN and NRG1 in cells depleted of AXL resulted 
      in accumulation of nEGFR, rescuing the deficit induced by lack of AXL.
      Collectively, these data uncover a previously unrecognized role for AXL in
      regulating the nuclear translocation of EGFR and suggest that AXL-mediated SFK
      and NRG1 expression promote this process.

TI  - The tyrosine kinase Src promotes phosphorylation of the kinase TBK1 to facilitate
      type I interferon production after viral infection.
LID - eaae0435 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aae0435 [doi]
AB  - Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are activated in response to viral
      infection to stimulate the production of type I interferons (IFNs). However,
      central to the responses of all of these receptors is their activation of the
      kinase TBK1, which stimulates transcription by IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We
      investigated the mechanism by which the kinase activity of TBK1 is stimulated in 
      response to viral infection. We found that the tyrosine kinase Src promoted the
      phosphorylation of TBK1 on Tyr(179) upon viral infection of RAW264.7 macrophages.
      Mutation of Tyr(179) to alanine resulted in impaired autophosphorylation of TBK1 
      at Ser(172), which is required for TBK1 activation. The TBK1 Y179A mutant failed 
      to rescue type I IFN production by virally infected RAW264.7 macrophages
      deficient in TBK1. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with AZD0530 and clustered
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9-mediated knockout of Src
      demonstrated that Src was critical for activating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway and
      stimulating type I IFN production. However, Src did not directly bind to
      recombinant TBK1 in vitro but instead bound to the proline-X-X-proline motifs
      within key PRR adaptor proteins, such as TRIF, MAVS, and STING, which formed
      complexes with TBK1 after PRR engagement. Together, our data suggest that Src is 
      the major tyrosine kinase that primes TBK1 for autophosphorylation and
      activation, thus providing mechanistic insights into the regulation of TBK1
      activity by various PRRs as part of the innate antiviral response.

TI  - Diacylglycerol kinase zeta limits the polarized recruitment of
      diacylglycerol-enriched organelles to the immune synapse in T cells.
PG  - ra127
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf7714 [doi]
AB  - The antigen-induced formation of an immune synapse (IS) between T cells and
      antigen-presenting cells results in the rapid generation of the lipid second
      messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) in T cells. Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKzeta)
      converts DAG into phosphatidic acid (PA). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from
      mice deficient in DGKzeta have enhanced antiviral and antitumor activities,
      indicating that the amount of DAG controls the effectiveness of the T cell
      response. We characterized the second C1 domain of protein kinase Ctheta
      (PKCtheta), a DAG-binding protein that is specifically recruited to the IS, as a 
      biological sensor to observe the generation of a DAG gradient during IS
      formation. In experiments with transgenic mouse CTLs expressing the OT-I T cell
      receptor (TCR), we showed that both strong and weak interactions between antigen 
      and the TCR led to the rapid generation of DAG, whereas only strong interactions 
      induced the movement of DAG-enriched organelles toward the IS. In
      DGKzeta-deficient CTLs, antigen stimulation led to the enhanced accumulation of
      DAG-containing organelles at the IS; however, impaired activation of the PA
      effector PKCzeta resulted in lack of reorientation of the microtubule-organizing 
      center toward the IS, a process needed for effective T cell activation. Together,
      these data suggest that the activation of DGKzeta downstream of antigen
      recognition provides a mechanism that ensures the activation of PA-dependent
      signaling as a direct result of the strength of TCR-dependent DAG mobilization.

TI  - Trans-inhibition of activation and proliferation signals by Fc receptors in mast 
      cells and basophils.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag1401 [doi]
AB  - Allergic and autoimmune inflammation are associated with the activation of mast
      cells and basophils by antibodies against allergens or auto-antigens,
      respectively. Both cell types express several receptors for the Fc portion of
      antibodies, the engagement of which by antigen-antibody complexes controls their 
      responses. When aggregated on the plasma membrane, high-affinity immunoglobulin E
      (IgE) receptors (FcepsilonRI) and low-affinity IgG receptors (FcgammaRIIIA in
      mice, FcgammaRIIA in humans) induce these cells to release and secrete
      proinflammatory mediators, chemokines, and cytokines that account for clinical
      symptoms. When coaggregated with activating receptors on the same cells, other
      low-affinity IgG receptors (FcgammaRIIB in both species) inhibit mast cell and
      basophil activation. We found that FcgammaRIIB inhibited not only signals
      triggered by activating receptors with which they were coengaged
      (cis-inhibition), but also signals triggered by receptors engaged independently
      (trans-inhibition). Trans-inhibition acted upon the FcepsilonRI-dependent
      activation of mouse mast cells, mouse basophils, and human basophils, and upon
      growth factor receptor (Kit)-dependent normal mouse mast cell proliferation, as
      well as the constitutive in vitro proliferation and the in vivo growth of
      oncogene (v-Abl)-transformed mastocytoma cells. Trans-inhibition was induced by
      receptors, whether inhibitory (FcgammaRIIB) or activating (FcepsilonRI), which
      recruited the lipid phosphatase SHIP1. By hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P3, SHIP1 induced 
      a global unresponsiveness that affected biological responses triggered by
      receptors that use phosphoinositide 3-kinase to signal. These data suggest that
      trans-inhibition controls numerous physiological and pathological processes, and 
      that it may be used as a therapeutic tool in inflammation, especially but not
      exclusively, in allergy and autoimmunity.

TI  - The histone deubiquitinase OTLD1 targets euchromatin to regulate plant growth.
PG  - ra125
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6767 [doi]
AB  - Histone monoubiquitination is associated with active chromatin and plays an
      important role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in plants.
      Deubiquitinating enzymes remove the ubiquitin group from histones and thereby
      contribute to gene repression. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 50
      deubiquitinases, yet only 2 of them-UBP26 and OTLD1, members of the USP/UBP
      (ubiquitin-specific protease and ubiquitin-binding protein) and OTU (ovarian
      tumor protease) deubiquitinase families-are known to target histones.
      Furthermore, UBP26 is the only plant histone deubiquitinase for which the
      functional role has been characterized in detail. We used gain- and
      loss-of-function alleles of OTLD1 to examine its role in the plant life cycle and
      showed that OTLD1 stimulates plant growth, increases cell size, and induces
      transcriptional repression of five major regulators of plant organ growth and
      development: GA20OX, WUS, OSR2, ARL, and ABI5 OTLD1 associated with chromatin at 
      each of these target genes and promoted the removal of euchromatic histone
      acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation marks. Thus, these data indicate
      that OTLD1 promotes the concerted epigenetic regulation of a set of genes that
      collectively limit plant growth.

TI  - Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow.
PG  - ra124
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah5882 [doi]
AB  - Mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow determines neutrophil blood
      counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil mobilization from the
      bone marrow depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor 
      CXCR4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both
      pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of
      this signaling event in neutrophil retention and egression ambiguous. On the
      assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we
      generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to
      neutrophil egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone
      marrow, where the retention signal predominated, egression time strictly depended
      on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation).
      This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15.
      Neutrophils in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous
      retention in the bone marrow. Our model thus demonstrates that mobilization in
      the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends 
      on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptation. Furthermore, our
      findings might help to find new modes of intervention to treat conditions
      characterized by excessively low or high circulating neutrophils.

PG  - c24
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aam5503 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Marc Daeron, author of a Research Article
      that appears in the 20 December 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about a
      mechanism by which an Fc receptor can inhibit signaling by other receptors
      without aggregating with those other receptors. Engagement of Fc receptors on
      basophils and mast cells can either activate these cells, which promotes
      autoimmune and allergic inflammation, or prevent these cells from being
      activated. Whether these cells are activated depends upon which Fc receptors are 
      present in clusters, because some Fc receptors can inhibit signaling by other Fc 
      receptors that are present in the same signalosome, a phenomenon known as
      cis-inhibition. Malbec et al. identified a mechanism whereby inhibitory Fc
      receptors limit signaling by activating Fc receptors without being present in the
      same signalosome. This mechanism of trans-inhibition also allowed inhibitory Fc
      receptors to limit signaling by growth factor receptors in mast cells and
      oncogene-induced proliferation in mastocytoma cells.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Mitotic phosphotyrosine network analysis reveals that tyrosine phosphorylation
      regulates Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1).
PG  - rs14
AB  - Tyrosine phosphorylation is closely associated with cell proliferation. During
      the cell cycle, serine and threonine phosphorylation plays the leading role, and 
      such phosphorylation events are most dynamic during the mitotic phase of the cell
      cycle. However, mitotic phosphotyrosine is not well characterized. Although a few
      functionally-relevant mitotic phosphotyrosine sites have been characterized,
      evidence suggests that this modification may be more prevalent than previously
      appreciated. Here, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation in mitotic human cells
      including those on spindle-associated proteins.? Database mining confirmed ~2000 
      mitotic phosphotyrosine sites, and network analysis revealed a number of
      subnetworks that were enriched in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including
      components of the kinetochore or spindle and SRC family kinases. We identified
      Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a major signaling hub in the spindle subnetwork, as
      phosphorylated at the conserved Tyr(217) in the kinase domain. Substitution of
      Tyr(217) with a phosphomimetic residue eliminated PLK1 activity in vitro and in
      cells. Further analysis showed that Tyr(217) phosphorylation reduced the
      phosphorylation of Thr(210) in the activation loop, a phosphorylation event
      necessary for PLK1 activity. Our data indicate that mitotic tyrosine
      phosphorylation regulated a key serine/threonine kinase hub in mitotic cells and 
      suggested that spatially separating tyrosine phosphorylation events can reveal
      previously unrecognized regulatory events and complexes associated with specific 
      structures of the cell cycle.

TI  - Essential roles of AMPA receptor GluA1 phosphorylation and presynaptic HCN
      channels in fast-acting antidepressant responses of ketamine.
PG  - ra123
AB  - Although the molecular mechanism is not clear, the clinically tested drug
      ketamine has rapid antidepressant action that does not require the multiple weeks
      of treatment needed for other antidepressant drugs to have an effect. We showed
      that ketamine potentiated Schaffer collateral-CA1 cell excitatory synaptic
      transmission in hippocampal slice preparations from rodents and enhanced the
      phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on Ser(845) of the AMPA-type glutamate
      receptor in the hippocampal area CA1. These effects persisted when
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were pharmacologically blocked. Ketamine
      reduced behavioral despair in wild-type mice but had no effect in GluA1 S845A
      knock-in mutant mice. Presynaptic (CA3 pyramidal cell), but not postsynaptic (CA1
      pyramidal cell), deletion of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors
      eliminated the ketamine-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission
      in hippocampal slices and the antidepressant actions of ketamine in mice. The
      synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine were completely occluded by
      inhibition or deletion of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
      channel 1 (HCN1). Our results implicate presynaptic NMDA receptor inhibition
      followed by reduced activity of presynaptic HCN1 channels, which would result in 
      an increase in glutamate release and postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity, as
      a mechanism of ketamine action. These data provide a mechanism for changes in
      synaptic activity that could explain the fast-acting antidepressant effects of
      this drug.

TI  - Chemoattractant concentration-dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in
      migrating neutrophils.
PG  - ra122
AB  - The directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide
      N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against
      invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing
      concentrations of fMLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from
      exhibiting directional migration at low fMLP concentrations to exhibiting
      circuitous migration at high fMLP concentrations. The extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this fMLP
      concentration-dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and
      regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration 
      in response to different fMLP concentrations over time. We found that ERK
      exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to fMLP concentration.
      Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM fMLP, and ERK
      inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional
      migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM fMLP and that
      ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest
      that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to fMLP, ERK displays gradated
      activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote
      neutrophil migration.

TI  - Increased activity of TNAP compensates for reduced adenosine production and
      promotes ectopic calcification in the genetic disease ACDC.
PG  - ra121
AB  - ACDC (arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73) is an autosomal recessive
      disease resulting from loss-of-function mutations in NT5E, which encodes CD73, a 
      5'-ectonucleotidase that converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate to
      adenosine. ACDC patients display progressive calcification of lower extremity
      arteries, causing limb ischemia. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), 
      which converts pyrophosphate (PPi) to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and extracellular
      purine metabolism play important roles in other inherited forms of vascular
      calcification. Compared to cells from healthy subjects, induced pluripotent stem 
      cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) from ACDC patients displayed
      accelerated calcification and increased TNAP activity when cultured under
      conditions that promote osteogenesis. TNAP activity generated adenosine in iMSCs 
      derived from ACDC patients but not in iMSCs from control subjects, which have
      CD73. In response to osteogenic stimulation, ACDC patient-derived iMSCs had
      decreased amounts of the TNAP substrate PPi, an inhibitor of extracellular matrix
      calcification, and exhibited increased activation of AKT, mechanistic target of
      rapamycin (mTOR), and the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), a pathway 
      that promotes calcification. In vivo, teratomas derived from ACDC patient cells
      showed extensive calcification and increased TNAP activity. Treating mice bearing
      these teratomas with an A2b adenosine receptor agonist, the mTOR inhibitor
      rapamycin, or the bisphosphonate etidronate reduced calcification. These results 
      show that an increase of TNAP activity in ACDC contributes to ectopic
      calcification by disrupting the extracellular balance of PPi and Pi and identify 
      potential therapeutic targets for ACDC.

      The noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway is required for the differentiation of immune 
      cells; however, cross-talk between both pathways can occur. Concomitantly
      activated noncanonical signaling generates p52 from the p100 precursor. The
      synthesis of p100 is induced by canonical signaling, leading to the formation of 
      the late-acting RelA:p52 heterodimer. This cross-talk prolongs inflammatory RelA 
      activity in epithelial cells to ensure pathogen clearance. We found that the
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-activated canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathway is
      insulated from lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR)-induced noncanonical signaling
      in mouse macrophage cell lines. Combined computational and biochemical studies
      indicated that the extent of NF-kappaB-responsive expression of Nfkbia, which
      encodes IkappaBalpha, inversely correlated with cross-talk. The Nfkbia promoter
      showed enhanced responsiveness to NF-kappaB activation in macrophages compared to
      that in fibroblasts. We found that this hyperresponsive promoter engaged the
      RelA:p52 dimer generated during costimulation of macrophages through TLR4 and
      LTbetaR to trigger synthesis of IkappaBalpha at late time points, which prevented
      the late-acting RelA cross-talk response. Together, these data suggest that,
      despite the presence of identical signaling networks in cells of diverse
      lineages, emergent cross-talk between signaling pathways is subject to cell
      type-specific regulation. We propose that the insulation of canonical and
      noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways limits the deleterious effects of
      macrophage-mediated inflammation.

TI  - Widespread control of calcium signaling by a family of SERCA-inhibiting
      micropeptides.
PG  - ra119
AB  - Micropeptides function as master regulators of calcium-dependent signaling in
      muscle. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA), the membrane pump that
      promotes muscle relaxation by taking up Ca(2+) into the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
      is directly inhibited by three muscle-specific micropeptides: myoregulin (MLN),
      phospholamban (PLN), and sarcolipin (SLN). The widespread and essential function 
      of SERCA across diverse cell types has raised questions as to how SERCA is
      regulated in cells that lack MLN, PLN, and SLN. We identified two transmembrane
      micropeptides, endoregulin (ELN) and another-regulin (ALN), that share key amino 
      acids with their muscle-specific counterparts and function as direct inhibitors
      of SERCA pump activity. The distribution of transcripts encoding ELN and ALN
      mirrored that of SERCA isoform-encoding transcripts in nonmuscle cell types. Our 
      findings identify additional members of the SERCA-inhibitory micropeptide family,
      revealing a conserved mechanism for the control of intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics 
      in both muscle and nonmuscle cell types.

TI  - A TGFbeta-miR-182-BRCA1 axis controls the mammary differentiation hierarchy.
PG  - ra118
AB  - Maintenance of mammary functional capacity during cycles of proliferation and
      regression depends on appropriate cell fate decisions of mammary progenitor cells
      to populate an epithelium consisting of secretory luminal cells and contractile
      myoepithelial cells. It is well established that transforming growth factor-beta 
      (TGFbeta) restricts mammary epithelial cell proliferation and that sensitivity to
      TGFbeta is decreased in breast cancer. We show that TGFbeta also exerts control
      of mammary progenitor self-renewal and lineage commitment decisions by stringent 
      regulation of breast cancer associated 1 (BRCA1), which controls stem cell
      self-renewal and lineage commitment. Either genetic depletion of Tgfb1 or
      transient blockade of TGFbeta increased self-renewal of mammary progenitor cells 
      in mice, cultured primary mammary epithelial cells, and also skewed lineage
      commitment toward the myoepithelial fate. TGFbeta stabilized the abundance of
      BRCA1 by reducing the abundance of microRNA-182 (miR-182). Ectopic expression of 
      BRCA1 or antagonism of miR-182 in cultured TGFbeta-deficient mammary epithelial
      cells restored luminal lineage commitment. These findings reveal that TGFbeta
      modulation of BRCA1 directs mammary epithelial cell fate and, because stem or
      progenitor cells are thought to be the cell of origin for aggressive breast
      cancer subtypes, suggest that TGFbeta dysregulation during tumorigenesis may
      promote distinct breast cancer subtypes.

TI  - Biased agonists of the kappa opioid receptor suppress pain and itch without
      causing sedation or dysphoria.
PG  - ra117
AB  - Agonists targeting the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) have been promising
      therapeutic candidates because of their efficacy for treating intractable itch
      and relieving pain. Unlike typical opioid narcotics, KOR agonists do not produce 
      euphoria or lead to respiratory suppression or overdose. However, they do produce
      dysphoria and sedation, side effects that have precluded their clinical
      development as therapeutics. KOR signaling can be fine-tuned to preferentially
      activate certain pathways over others, such that agonists can bias signaling so
      that the receptor signals through G proteins rather than other effectors such as 
      betaarrestin2. We evaluated a newly developed G protein signaling-biased KOR
      agonist in preclinical models of pain, pruritis, sedation, dopamine regulation,
      and dysphoria. We found that triazole 1.1 retained the antinociceptive and
      antipruritic efficacies of a conventional KOR agonist, yet it did not induce
      sedation or reductions in dopamine release in mice, nor did it produce dysphoria 
      as determined by intracranial self-stimulation in rats. These data demonstrated
      that biased agonists may be used to segregate physiological responses downstream 
      of the receptor. Moreover, the findings suggest that biased KOR agonists may
      present a means to treat pain and intractable itch without the side effects of
      dysphoria and sedation and with reduced abuse potential.

TI  - Dynamic pre-BCR homodimers fine-tune autonomous survival signals in B cell
      precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - ra116
AB  - The pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) is an immature form of the BCR critical for
      early B lymphocyte development. It is composed of the membrane-bound
      immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain, surrogate light chain components, and the
      signaling subunits Igalpha and Igbeta. We developed monovalent quantum dot
      (QD)-labeled probes specific for Igbeta to study the behavior of pre-BCRs engaged
      in autonomous, ligand-independent signaling in live B cells. Single-particle
      tracking revealed that QD-labeled pre-BCRs engaged in transient, but frequent,
      homotypic interactions. Receptor motion was correlated at short separation
      distances, consistent with the formation of dimers and higher-order oligomers.
      Repeated encounters between diffusing pre-BCRs appeared to reflect transient
      co-confinement in plasma membrane domains. In human B cell precursor acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells, we showed that frequent, short-lived,
      homotypic pre-BCR interactions stimulated survival signals, including expression 
      of BCL6, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. These survival signals were
      blocked by inhibitory monovalent antigen-binding antibody fragments (Fabs)
      specific for the surrogate light chain components of the pre-BCR or by inhibitors
      of the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. For comparison, we evaluated pre-BCR
      aggregation mediated by dimeric galectin-1, which has binding sites for
      carbohydrate and for the surrogate light chain lambda5 component. Galectin-1
      binding resulted in the formation of large, highly immobile pre-BCR aggregates,
      which was partially relieved by the addition of lactose to prevent the
      cross-linking of galectin-BCR complexes to other glycosylated membrane
      components. Analysis of the pre-BCR and its signaling partners suggested that
      they could be potential targets for combination therapy in BCP-ALL.

TI  - Reactive oxygen species induce virus-independent MAVS oligomerization in systemic
      lupus erythematosus.
PG  - ra115
AB  - The increased expression of genes induced by type I interferon (IFN) is
      characteristic of viral infections and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We
      showed that mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which normally
      forms a complex with retinoic acid gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases during viral
      infection, was activated by oxidative stress independently of RIG-I helicases. We
      found that chemically generated oxidative stress stimulated the formation of MAVS
      oligomers, which led to mitochondrial hyperpolarization and decreased adenosine
      triphosphate production and spare respiratory capacity, responses that were not
      observed in similarly treated cells lacking MAVS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of
      SLE patients also showed spontaneous MAVS oligomerization that correlated with
      the increased secretion of type I IFN and mitochondrial oxidative stress.
      Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the
      mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ prevented MAVS oligomerization and type I
      IFN production. ROS-dependent MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production were
      reduced in cells expressing the MAVS-C79F variant, which occurs in 30% of
      sub-Saharan Africans and is linked with reduced type I IFN secretion and milder
      disease in SLE patients. Patients expressing the MAVS-C79F variant also had
      reduced amounts of oligomerized MAVS in their plasma compared to healthy
      controls. Together, our findings suggest that oxidative stress-induced MAVS
      oligomerization in SLE patients may contribute to the type I IFN signature that
      is characteristic of this syndrome.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 29 November 2016: Pre-B cell receptor signaling in 
      leukemia.
PG  - c23
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Bridget Wilson, author of a Research
      Article that appears in the 29 November 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about
      pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (BCP-ALL). Signaling through the pre-BCR, an immature form of the BCR,
      promotes the survival of B cell progenitors and has been implicated in the
      pathology of BCP-ALL. Erasmus et al found that pre-BCRs formed transient
      homomeric complexes that correlated with pro-survival signaling. Preventing
      homotypic interactions between pre-BCRs sensitized B cells to chemotherapeutic
      agents, suggesting that interfering with such interactions may improve the
      efficacy of existing chemotherapies for BCP-ALL.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Integrating network reconstruction with mechanistic modeling to predict cancer
      therapies.
PG  - ra114
AB  - Signal transduction networks are often rewired in cancer cells. Identifying these
      alterations will enable more effective cancer treatment. We developed a
      computational framework that can identify, reconstruct, and mechanistically model
      these rewired networks from noisy and incomplete perturbation response data and
      then predict potential targets for intervention. As a proof of principle, we
      analyzed a perturbation data set targeting epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) pathways in a panel of
      colorectal cancer cells. Our computational approach predicted cell line-specific 
      network rewiring. In particular, feedback inhibition of insulin receptor
      substrate 1 (IRS1) by the kinase p70S6K was predicted to confer resistance to
      EGFR inhibition, suggesting that disrupting this feedback may restore sensitivity
      to EGFR inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. We experimentally validated this
      prediction with colorectal cancer cell lines in culture and in a zebrafish (Danio
      rerio) xenograft model.

TI  - A computationally identified compound antagonizes excess FGF-23 signaling in
      renal tubules and a mouse model of hypophosphatemia.
PG  - ra113
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) interacts with a binary receptor complex
      composed of alpha-Klotho (alpha-KL) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) to regulate
      phosphate and vitamin D metabolism in the kidney. Excess FGF-23 production, which
      causes hypophosphatemia, is genetically inherited or occurs with chronic kidney
      disease. Among other symptoms, hypophosphatemia causes vitamin D deficiency and
      the bone-softening disorder rickets. Current therapeutics that target the
      receptor complex have limited utility clinically. Using a computationally driven,
      structure-based, ensemble docking and virtual high-throughput screening approach,
      we identified four novel compounds predicted to selectively inhibit
      FGF-23-induced activation of the FGFR/alpha-KL complex. Additional modeling and
      functional analysis found that Zinc13407541 bound to FGF-23 and disrupted its
      interaction with the FGFR1/alpha-KL complex; experiments in a heterologous cell
      expression system showed that Zinc13407541 selectivity inhibited
      alpha-KL-dependent FGF-23 signaling. Zinc13407541 also inhibited FGF-23 signaling
      in isolated renal tubules ex vivo and partially reversed the hypophosphatemic
      effects of excess FGF-23 in a mouse model. These chemical probes provide a
      platform to develop lead compounds to treat disorders caused by excess FGF-23.

TI  - Selective control of up-regulated and down-regulated genes by temporal patterns
      and doses of insulin.
PG  - ra112
AB  - Secretion of insulin transiently increases after eating, resulting in a high
      circulating concentration. Fasting limits insulin secretion, resulting in a low
      concentration of insulin in the circulation. We analyzed transcriptional
      responses to different temporal patterns and doses of insulin in the hepatoma FAO
      cells and identified 13 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated insulin-responsive
      genes (IRGs). The up-regulated IRGs responded more rapidly than did the
      down-regulated IRGs to transient stepwise or pulsatile increases in insulin
      concentration, whereas the down-regulated IRGs were repressed at lower
      concentrations of insulin than those required to stimulate the up-regulated IRGs.
      Mathematical modeling of the insulin response as two stages-(i) insulin signaling
      to transcription and (ii)transcription and mRNA stability-indicated that the
      first stage was the more rapid stage for the down-regulated IRGs, whereas the
      second stage of transcription was the more rapid stage for the up-regulated IRGs.
      A subset of the IRGs that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the FAO cells
      was similarly regulated in the livers of rats injected with a single dose of
      insulin. Thus, not only can cells respond to insulin but they can also interpret 
      the intensity and pattern of signal to produce distinct transcriptional
      responses. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating obesity
      and type 2 diabetes associated with aberrant insulin production or tissue
      responsiveness.

TI  - RasGRP1 promotes amphetamine-induced motor behavior through a Rhes interaction
      network ("Rhesactome") in the striatum.
PG  - ra111
AB  - The striatum of the brain coordinates motor function. Dopamine-related drugs may 
      be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington's 
      disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side
      effects. In addition to stimulating the release of norepinephrine, amphetamines, 
      which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD), trigger dopamine release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase
      Ras homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits dopaminergic signaling in
      the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa-induced dyskinesia, and has a role
      in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
      RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice.
      RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum.
      Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (Rhes(+/-)) mice had an enhanced locomotor
      response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of
      RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from Rhes-heterozygous mice
      with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of Rasgrp1, we identified a
      diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the "Rhesactome," and determined that
      RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which
      included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive 
      disorder), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat-containing 7; a protein associated with
      bipolar disorder and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large homolog 2; a protein associated
      with chronic pain). Thus, this Rhes network provides insight into striatal
      effects of amphetamine and may aid the development of strategies to treat various
      neurological and psychological disorders associated with the striatal
      dysfunction.

TI  - A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic.
PG  - ra110
AB  - Development of protein kinase inhibitors is a focus of many drug discovery
      programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly
      used adenosine triphosphate-competitive inhibitors and the weak inhibition of the
      more selective substrate-competitive inhibitors. Glycogen synthase kinase-3
      (GSK-3) is a promising drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders,
      including Alzheimer's disease (AD), but most GSK-3 inhibitors have not reached
      the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 inhibitor, L807mts, that acts through
      a substrate-to-inhibitor conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic
      site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective 
      GSK-3 inhibitor with reasonable pharmacological and safety properties when tested
      in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of beta-amyloid loads, 
      reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social
      skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 inhibition may be 
      therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders
      associated with dysregulated GSK-3.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 15 November 2016: A new type of kinase inhibitor.
PG  - c22
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Hagit Eldar-Finkelman, author of a
      Research Article that appears in the 15 November 2016 issue of Science Signaling,
      about a newly developed inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). GSK-3
      participates in several signaling networks and has been implicated in various
      pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive impairments, and
      cancer. Licht-Murava et al developed L807mts, a substrate-competitive peptide
      inhibitor that blocks GSK-3 activity through an unusual mechanism. L807mts not
      only bound to the substrate recognition domain of GSK-3, it was also
      phosphorylated by the kinase. This phosphorylated form of L807mts remained
      associated with GSK-3 and inhibited GSK-3 activity. L807mts treatment reduced
      cellular, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's
      disease. L807mts is an advance in kinase inhibitor development because it is both
      highly specific and very potent.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
      links energy sensing to anti-inflammatory signaling.
PG  - ra109
AB  - Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a pivotal regulator
      of metabolism at cellular and organismal levels. AMPK also suppresses
      inflammation. We found that pharmacological activation of AMPK rapidly inhibited 
      the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
      pathway in various cells. In vitro kinase assays revealed that AMPK directly
      phosphorylated two residues (Ser(515) and Ser(518)) within the Src homology 2
      domain of JAK1. Activation of AMPK enhanced the interaction between JAK1 and
      14-3-3 proteins in cultured vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, an effect
      that required the presence of Ser(515) and Ser(518) and was abolished in cells
      lacking AMPK catalytic subunits. Mutation of Ser(515) and Ser(518) abolished
      AMPK-mediated inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling stimulated by either the
      sIL-6Ralpha/IL-6 complex or the expression of a constitutively active
      V658F-mutant JAK1 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Clinically used AMPK activators
      metformin and salicylate enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of endogenous
      JAK1 and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in primary vascular endothelial cells.
      Therefore, our findings reveal a mechanism by which JAK1 function and
      inflammatory signaling may be suppressed in response to metabolic stress and
      provide a mechanistic rationale for the investigation of AMPK activators in a
      range of diseases associated with enhanced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.

TI  - Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular
      range of action.
PG  - ra108
AB  - The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of
      diffusion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts
      indicated that the Ca(2+)-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate
      (IP3) diffuses with a coefficient (~280 mum(2) s(-1)) similar to that in water,
      corresponding to a range of action of ~25 mum. Consequently, IP3 is generally
      considered a "global" cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring
      local IP3-evoked Ca(2+) puffs to monitor IP3 diffusing from spot photorelease in 
      neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a
      diffusion coefficient (</=10 mum(2) s(-1)) about 30-fold slower than that
      previously reported. We propose that diffusion of IP3 in mammalian cells is
      hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were
      diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP3 (<5 mum) is thus
      smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP3 should
      better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.

TI  - IP3, still on the move but now in the slow lane.
PG  - fs17
AB  - In this issue of Science Signaling, Dickinson et al show that the intracellular
      messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which triggers the release of
      calcium (Ca(2+)) from the endoplasmic reticulum, is a slowly diffusing local
      signal, rather than a rapidly diffusing global one. These findings have
      implications for the understanding of the mechanisms of Ca(2+) wave propagation, 
      especially long-range, cell-to-cell propagating Ca(2+) waves.

TI  - Heparan sulfate differentially controls CXCL12alpha- and CXCL12gamma-mediated
      cell migration through differential presentation to their receptor CXCR4.
PG  - ra107
AB  - Chemokines stimulate signals in cells by binding to G protein (heterotrimeric
      guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors. These chemoattractant
      cytokines also interact with heparan sulfate (HS), which provides positional
      information within tissues in the form of haptotactic gradients along which cells
      can migrate directionally. To investigate the mechanism by which HS modulates
      chemokine functions, we used the CXC chemokine CXCL12, which exists in different 
      isoforms that all signal through CXCR4 but have distinct HS-binding domains. In
      experiments with both cell-associated and solubilized CXCR4, we found that
      although CXCL12gamma bound to CXCR4 with a higher affinity than did CXCL12alpha, 
      CXCL12gamma displayed reduced signaling and chemotactic activities. These
      properties were caused by the specific carboxyl-terminal region of CXCL12gamma,
      which, by interacting with CXCR4 sulfotyrosines, mediated high-affinity, but
      nonproductive, binding to CXCR4. HS prevented CXCL12gamma from interacting with
      the CXCR4 sulfotyrosines, thereby functionally presenting the chemokine to its
      receptor such that its activity was similar to that of CXCL12alpha. HS had no
      effects on the binding of CXCL12alpha to CXCR4 or its biological activity,
      suggesting that this polysaccharide controls CXCL12 in an isoform-specific
      manner. These data suggest that the HS-dependent regulation of chemokine
      functions extends beyond the simple process of immobilization and directly
      modulates receptor ligation and activation.

TI  - Stem-piped light activates phytochrome B to trigger light responses in
      Arabidopsis thaliana roots.
PG  - ra106
AB  - The roles of photoreceptors and their associated signaling mechanisms have been
      extensively studied in plant photomorphogenesis with a major focus on the
      photoresponses of the shoot system. Accumulating evidence indicates that light
      also influences root growth and development through the light-induced release of 
      signaling molecules that travel from the shoot to the root. We explored whether
      aboveground light directly influences the root system of Arabidopsis thaliana
      Light was efficiently conducted through the stems to the roots, where
      photoactivated phytochrome B (phyB) triggered expression of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5
      (HY5) and accumulation of HY5 protein, a transcription factor that promotes root 
      growth in response to light. Stimulation of HY5 in response to illumination of
      only the shoot was reduced when root tissues carried a loss-of-function mutation 
      in PHYB, and HY5 mutant roots exhibited alterations in root growth and
      gravitropism in response to shoot illumination. These findings demonstrate that
      the underground roots directly sense stem-piped light to monitor the aboveground 
      light environment during plant environmental adaptation.

TI  - Obligatory role for GPER in cardiovascular aging and disease.
PG  - ra105
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag0240 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological activation of the heptahelical G protein-coupled estrogen
      receptor (GPER) by selective ligands counteracts multiple aspects of
      cardiovascular disease. We thus expected that genetic deletion or pharmacological
      inhibition of GPER would further aggravate such disease states, particularly with
      age. To the contrary, we found that genetic ablation of Gper in mice prevented
      cardiovascular pathologies associated with aging by reducing superoxide (O2(-))
      formation by NADPH oxidase (Nox) specifically through reducing the expression of 
      the Nox isoform Nox1 Blocking GPER activity pharmacologically with G36, a
      synthetic, small-molecule, GPER-selective blocker (GRB), decreased Nox1 abundance
      and O2(-) production to basal amounts in cells exposed to angiotensin II and in
      mice chronically infused with angiotensin II, reducing arterial hypertension.
      Thus, this study revealed a role for GPER activity in regulating Nox1 abundance
      and associated O2(-)-mediated structural and functional damage that contributes
      to disease pathology. Our results indicated that GRBs represent a new class of
      drugs that can reduce Nox abundance and activity and could be used for the
      treatment of chronic disease processes involving excessive O2(-) formation,
      including arterial hypertension and heart failure.

TI  - Combinatorial interaction network of transcriptomic and phenotypic responses to
      nitrogen and hormones in the Arabidopsis thaliana root.
PG  - rs13
AB  - Plants form the basis of the food webs that sustain animal life. Exogenous
      factors, such as nutrients and sunlight, and endogenous factors, such as
      hormones, cooperate to control both the growth and the development of plants. We 
      assessed how Arabidopsis thaliana integrated nutrient and hormone signaling
      pathways to control root growth and development by investigating the effects of
      combinatorial treatment with the nutrients nitrate and ammonium; the hormones
      auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid; and all binary combinations of these
      factors. We monitored and integrated short-term genome-wide changes in gene
      expression over hours and long-term effects on root development and architecture 
      over several days. Our analysis revealed trends in nutrient and hormonal signal
      crosstalk and feedback, including responses that exhibited logic gate behavior,
      which means that they were triggered only when specific combinations of signals
      were present. From the data, we developed a multivariate network model comprising
      the signaling molecules, the early gene expression modulation, and the subsequent
      changes in root phenotypes. This multivariate network model pinpoints several
      genes that play key roles in the control of root development and may help
      understand how eukaryotes manage multifactorial signaling inputs.

TI  - Loss of epithelial Gq and G11 signaling inhibits TGFbeta production but promotes 
      IL-33-mediated macrophage polarization and emphysema.
PG  - ra104
AB  - Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) signaling links
      hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors with four G protein signaling pathways.
      Two of these, one mediated by Gq and G11 (Gq/11) and the other by G12 and G13
      (G12/13), are implicated in the force-dependent activation of transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGFbeta) in lung epithelial cells. Reduced TGFbeta activation in
      alveolar cells leads to emphysema, whereas enhanced TGFbeta activation promotes
      acute lung injury and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, precise control
      of alveolar TGFbeta activation is essential for alveolar homeostasis. We
      investigated the involvement of the Gq/11 and G12/13 pathways in epithelial cells
      in generating active TGFbeta and regulating alveolar inflammation. Mice deficient
      in both Galphaq and Galpha11 developed inflammation that was primarily caused by 
      alternatively activated (M2-polarized) macrophages, enhanced matrix
      metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) production, and age-related alveolar airspace
      enlargement consistent with emphysema. Mice with impaired Gq/11 signaling had
      reduced stretch-mediated generation of TGFbeta by epithelial cells and enhanced
      macrophage MMP12 synthesis but were protected from the effects of
      ventilator-induced lung injury. Furthermore, synthesis of the cytokine
      interleukin-33 (IL-33) was increased in these alveolar epithelial cells,
      resulting in the M2-type polarization of alveolar macrophages independently of
      the effect on TGFbeta. Our results suggest that alveolar Gq/11 signaling
      maintains alveolar homeostasis and likely independently increases TGFbeta
      activation in response to the mechanical stress of the epithelium and decreases
      epithelial IL-33 synthesis. Together, these findings suggest that disruption of
      Gq/11 signaling promotes inflammatory emphysema but protects against mechanically
      induced lung injury.

TI  - A glucocorticoid- and diet-responsive pathway toggles adipocyte precursor cell
      activity in vivo.
PG  - ra103
AB  - Obesity is driven by excess caloric intake, which leads to the expansion of
      adipose tissue by hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Adipose tissue hyperplasia results
      from the differentiation of adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) that reside in
      adipose depots. Investigation into this process has elucidated a network of
      mostly transcription factors that drive APCs through the differentiation process.
      Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, our study revealed a signaling pathway
      that inhibited the initiation of the adipocyte differentiation program. Mouse
      adipocytes secreted the extracellular protease ADAMTS1, which triggered the
      production of the cytokine pleiotrophin (PTN) through the Wnt/beta-catenin
      pathway, and promoted proliferation rather than differentiation of APCs.
      Glucocorticoid exposure in vitro or in vivo reduced ADAMTS1 abundance in
      adipocytes. In addition, mice fed a high-fat diet showed decreased Adamts1
      expression in the visceral perigonadal adipose depot, which expanded by
      adipogenesis in response to the diet, and increased Adamts1 expression in the
      subcutaneous inguinal adipose depot, which did not induce adipogenesis. Similar
      to what occurred in mouse subcutaneous adipose tissue, diet-induced weight gain
      increased the expression of ADAMTS1, PTN, and certain Wnt target genes in the
      subcutaneous adipose depot of human volunteers, suggesting the relevance of this 
      pathway to physiological adipose tissue homeostasis and the pathogenesis of
      obesity. Thus, this pathway functions as a toggle on APCs, regulating a decision 
      between differentiation and proliferation and coordinating the response of
      adipose tissue to systemic cues.

TI  - Coupling an EML4-ALK-centric interactome with RNA interference identifies
      sensitizers to ALK inhibitors.
PG  - rs12
AB  - Patients with lung cancers harboring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene
      fusions benefit from treatment with ALK inhibitors, but acquired resistance
      inevitably arises. A better understanding of proximal ALK signaling mechanisms
      may identify sensitizers to ALK inhibitors that disrupt the balance between
      prosurvival and proapoptotic effector signals. Using affinity purification
      coupled with mass spectrometry in an ALK fusion lung cancer cell line (H3122), we
      generated an ALK signaling network and investigated signaling activity using
      tyrosine phosphoproteomics. We identified a network of 464 proteins composed of
      subnetworks with differential response to ALK inhibitors. A small hairpin RNA
      screen targeting 407 proteins in this network revealed 64 and 9 proteins that
      when knocked down sensitized cells to crizotinib and alectinib, respectively.
      Among these, knocking down fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2)
      or coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1A (CC2D1A), both scaffolding
      proteins, sensitized multiple ALK fusion cell lines to the ALK inhibitors
      crizotinib and alectinib. Collectively, our data set provides a resource that
      enhances our understanding of signaling and drug resistance networks consequent
      to ALK fusions and identifies potential targets to improve the efficacy of ALK
      inhibitors in patients.

TI  - A cyclic di-GMP-binding adaptor protein interacts with a chemotaxis
      methyltransferase to control flagellar motor switching.
PG  - ra102
AB  - The bacterial messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) binds to
      various effectors, the most common of which are single-domain PilZ proteins.
      These c-di-GMP effectors control various cellular functions and multicellular
      behaviors at the transcriptional or posttranslational level. We found that MapZ
      (methyltransferase-associated PilZ; formerly known as PA4608), a single-domain
      PilZ protein from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, directly
      interacted with the methyltransferase CheR1 and that this interaction was
      enhanced by c-di-GMP. In vitro assays indicated that, in the presence of
      c-di-GMP, MapZ inhibited CheR1 from methylating the chemoreceptor PctA, which
      would be expected to increase its affinity for chemoattractants and promote
      chemotaxis. MapZ localized to the poles of P. aeruginosa cells, where the
      flagellar motor and other chemotactic proteins, including PctA and CheR1, are
      also located. P. aeruginosa cells exhibit a random walk behavior by frequently
      switching the direction of flagellar rotation in a uniform solution. We showed
      that binding of c-di-GMP to MapZ decreased the frequency of flagellar motor
      switching and that MapZ was essential for generating the heterogeneous motility
      typical of P. aeruginosa cell populations and for efficient surface attachment
      during biofilm formation. Collectively, the studies revealed that c-di-GMP
      affects flagellar motor output by regulating the methylation of chemoreceptors
      through a single-domain PilZ adaptor protein.

TI  - Leveraging unique structural characteristics of WNK kinases to achieve
      therapeutic inhibition.
PG  - e3
AB  - The with-no-lysine (K) WNK kinases are master regulators of the
      Na(+)-(K(+))-Cl(-) cotransporters, including the renal-specific NCC and NKCC2
      cotransporters. The discovery of WNK463, an orally bioavailable pan-WNK kinase
      inhibitor that exploits unique structural properties of the WNK catalytic domain 
      to achieve high affinity and kinase selectivity, illustrates a strategy of
      leveraging distinct kinase features to develop specific inhibitors and validates 
      the genetic predictions of the in vivo pharmacology of WNK inhibition.

      regulation of flagellar motility.
PG  - fs16
AB  - Cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous second messenger in
      bacteria. In this issue of Science Signaling, Xu et al show that c-di-GMP
      regulates chemotaxis by binding to the PilZ domain protein MapZ to alter the
      methyltransferase activity of its protein partner CheR, fleshing out the c-di-GMP
      signaling network of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  - Impaired coordination between signaling pathways is revealed in human colorectal 
      cancer using single-cell mass cytometry of archival tissue blocks.
PG  - rs11
AB  - Cellular heterogeneity poses a substantial challenge to understanding
      tissue-level phenotypes and confounds conventional bulk analyses. To analyze
      signaling at the single-cell level in human tissues, we applied mass cytometry
      using cytometry time of flight to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) normal
      and diseased intestinal specimens. This technique, called FFPE-DISSECT
      (disaggregation for intracellular signaling in single epithelial cells from
      tissue), is a single-cell approach to characterizing signaling states in embedded
      tissue samples. We applied FFPE-DISSECT coupled to mass cytometry and found
      differential signaling by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in intestinal enterocytes, 
      goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells, implicating the downstream RAS-RAF-MEK
      pathway in determining goblet cell identity. Application of this technique and
      computational analyses to human colon specimens confirmed the reduced
      differentiation in colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to normal colon and revealed 
      increased intratissue and intertissue heterogeneity in CRC with quantitative
      changes in the regulation of signaling pathways. Specifically, coregulation of
      the kinases p38 and ERK, the translation regulator 4EBP1, and the transcription
      factor CREB in proliferating normal colon cells was lost in CRC. Our data suggest
      that this single-cell approach, applied in conjunction with genomic annotation,
      enables the rapid and detailed characterization of cellular heterogeneity from
      clinical repositories of embedded human tissues. This technique can be used to
      derive cellular landscapes from archived patient samples (beyond CRC) and as a
      high-resolution tool for disease characterization and subtyping.

PG  - ra101
AB  - Pathogenic mycobacteria use virulence factors, including mannose-capped
      lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), to survive in host phagocytic cells, such as
      neutrophils. We assessed the roles of lactosylceramide (LacCer, CDw17)-enriched
      lipid rafts in the phagocytosis of mycobacteria by human neutrophils and in the
      intracellular fate of phagocytosed mycobacteria. We showed that the association
      of the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn with C24 fatty acid chain-containing LacCer
      was essential for the phagocytosis of mycobacteria by neutrophils. Assays with
      LacCer-containing liposomes, LacCer-coated plastic plates, and LAM-coated beads
      demonstrated that the phagocytosis of mycobacteria was mediated through the
      binding of LacCer to LAM. Both ManLAM from pathogenic species and
      phosphoinositol-capped LAM (PILAM) from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis
      bound equivalently to LacCer to stimulate phagocytosis. However, PILAM from an M.
      smegmatis alpha1,2-mannosyltransferase deletion mutant (DeltaMSMEG_4247), lacking
      the alpha1,2-monomannose side branches of the LAM mannan core, did not bind to
      LacCer or induce phagocytosis. An anti-LacCer antibody immunoprecipitated the SFK
      Hck from the phagosomes of neutrophils that internalized nonpathogenic
      mycobacteria but not from those that internalized pathogenic mycobacteria.
      Furthermore, knockdown of Hck by short inhibitory RNA abolished the fusion of
      lysosomes with phagosomes containing nonpathogenic mycobacteria. Further analysis
      showed that ManLAM, but not PILAM, inhibited the association of Hck with
      LacCer-enriched lipid rafts in phagosomal membranes, effectively blocking
      phagolysosome formation. Together, these findings suggest that pathogenic
      mycobacteria use ManLAM not only for binding to LacCer-enriched lipid rafts and
      entering neutrophils but also for disrupting signaling through Hck-coupled,
      LacCer-enriched lipid rafts and preventing phagolysosome formation.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6625 [doi]
AB  - Activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive, large-conductance potassium (BK) channels in
      vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by local, ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca(2+)
      signals (Ca(2+) sparks) acts as a brake on pressure-induced (myogenic)
      vasoconstriction-a fundamental mechanism that regulates blood flow in small
      resistance arteries. We report that physiological intraluminal pressure within
      resistance arteries activated cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in VSMCs
      through oxidant-induced formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between
      cysteine residues. Oxidant-activated PKG was required to trigger Ca(2+) sparks,
      BK channel activity, and vasodilation in response to pressure. VSMCs from
      arteries from mice expressing a form of PKG that could not be activated by
      oxidants showed reduced Ca(2+) spark frequency, and arterial preparations from
      these mice had decreased pressure-induced activation of BK channels. Thus, the
      absence of oxidative activation of PKG disabled the BK channel-mediated negative 
      feedback regulation of vasoconstriction. Our results support the concept of a
      negative feedback control mechanism that regulates arterial diameter through
      mechanosensitive production of oxidants to activate PKG and enhance Ca(2+)
      sparks.

TI  - Superresolution imaging of the cytoplasmic phosphatase PTPN22 links
      integrin-mediated T cell adhesion with autoimmunity.
PG  - ra99
AB  - Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that play a fundamental role
      in the migration of leukocytes to sites of infection or injury. We found that
      protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) inhibits signaling by
      the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) in effector T
      cells. PTPN22 colocalized with its substrates at the leading edge of cells
      migrating on surfaces coated with the LFA-1 ligand intercellular adhesion
      molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Knockout or knockdown of PTPN22 or expression of the
      autoimmune disease-associated PTPN22-R620W variant resulted in the enhanced
      phosphorylation of signaling molecules downstream of integrins. Superresolution
      imaging revealed that PTPN22-R620 (wild-type PTPN22) was present as large
      clusters in unstimulated T cells and that these disaggregated upon stimulation of
      LFA-1, enabling increased association of PTPN22 with its binding partners at the 
      leading edge. The failure of PTPN22-R620W molecules to be retained at the leading
      edge led to increased LFA-1 clustering and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Our
      data define a previously uncharacterized mechanism for fine-tuning integrin
      signaling in T cells, as well as a paradigm of autoimmunity in humans in which
      disease susceptibility is underpinned by inherited phosphatase mutations that
      perturb integrin function.

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis identifies the critical role of JNK1 in
      neuroinflammation induced by Japanese encephalitis virus.
PG  - ra98
AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of epidemic encephalitis
      worldwide. The pathogenesis of JEV is linked to a robust inflammatory response in
      the central nervous system (CNS). Glial cells are the resident immune cells in
      the CNS and represent critical effectors of CNS inflammation. To obtain a global 
      overview of signaling events in glial cells during JEV infection, we conducted
      phosphoproteomics profiling of a JEV-infected glial cell line. We identified 1816
      phosphopeptides, corresponding to 1264 proteins, that exhibited a change in
      phosphorylation status upon JEV infection. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 
      these proteins were predominantly related to transcription regulation, signal
      transduction, the cell cycle, and the cytoskeleton. Kinase substrate motif
      revealed that substrates for c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) were the most
      overrepresented, along with evidence of increased AKT1 and protein kinase A (PKA)
      signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK, AKT, or PKA reduced the
      inflammatory response of cultured glial cells infected with JEV, as did knockdown
      of JNK1 or its target JUN. JEV genomic RNA was sufficient to activate JNK1
      signaling in cultured glial cells. Of potential clinical relevance, we showed
      that inhibition of JNK signaling significantly attenuated the production of
      inflammatory cytokines in the brain and reduced lethality in JEV-infected mice,
      thereby suggesting that JNK signaling is a potential therapeutic target for the
      management of Japanese encephalitis.

TI  - The GAS6-AXL signaling network is a mesenchymal (Mes) molecular subtype-specific 
      therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.
PG  - ra97
AB  - Ovarian cancer is a complex disease with heterogeneity among the gene expression 
      molecular subtypes (GEMS) between patients. Patients with tumors of a mesenchymal
      ("Mes") subtype have a poorer prognosis than patients with tumors of an
      epithelial ("Epi") subtype. We evaluated GEMS of ovarian cancer patients for
      molecular signaling profiles and assessed how the differences in these profiles
      could be leveraged to improve patient clinical outcome. Kinome enrichment
      analysis identified AXL as a particularly abundant kinase in Mes-subtype tumor
      tissue and cell lines. In Mes cells, upon activation by its ligand GAS6, AXL
      coclustered with and transactivated the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) cMET,
      EGFR, and HER2, producing sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
      activation. In Epi-A cells, AXL was less abundant and induced a transient
      activation of ERK without evidence of RTK transactivation. AXL-RTK crosstalk also
      stimulated sustained activation of the transcription factor FRA1, which
      correlated with the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      (EMT)-associated transcription factor SLUG and stimulation of motility
      exclusively in Mes-subtype cells. The AXL inhibitor R428 attenuated RTK and ERK
      activation and reduced cell motility in Mes cells in culture and reduced tumor
      growth in a chick chorioallantoic membrane model. A higher concentration of R428 
      was needed to inhibit ERK activation and cell motility in Epi-A cells. Silencing 
      AXL in Mes-subtype cells reversed the mesenchymal phenotype in culture and
      abolished tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Thus,
      AXL-targeted therapy may improve clinical outcome for patients with Mes-subtype
      ovarian cancer.

TI  - The NF-kappaB subunit RelB controls p100 processing by competing with the kinases
      NIK and IKK1 for binding to p100.
PG  - ra96
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad9413 [doi]
AB  - The heterodimer formed by the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) subunits p52 and 
      RelB is the product of noncanonical signaling in which the key event is the
      proteolytic processing of p100 to generate p52. The kinases NF-kappaB-inducing
      kinase (NIK) and inhibitor of kappaB kinase 1 (IKK1; also known as IKKalpha) are 
      activated during noncanonical signaling and play essential roles in p100
      processing. In resting cells, RelB remains associated with unprocessed p100 as a 
      transcriptionally inert p100:RelB complex, which is part of a larger assembly
      with other NF-kappaB factors known as the "kappaBsome." We investigated how these
      two different RelB-containing complexes with opposing effects on target gene
      transcription are formed. We found that RelB controls the extent of both p100
      processing and kappaBsome formation during noncanonical signaling. Within an
      apparently "transitional" complex that contains RelB, NIK, IKK1, and p100, RelB
      and the NIK:IKK1 complex competed with each other for binding to a region of
      p100. A fraction of p100 in the transitional complex was refractory to
      processing, which resulted in the formation of the kappaBsome. However, another
      fraction of p100 protein underwent NIK:IKK1-mediated phosphorylation and
      processing while remaining bound to RelB, thus forming the p52:RelB heterodimer. 
      Our results suggest that changes in the relative concentrations of RelB,
      NIK:IKK1, and p100 during noncanonical signaling modulate this transitional
      complex and are critical for maintaining the fine balance between the processing 
      and protection of p100.

TI  - Human IL-22 binding protein isoforms act as a rheostat for IL-22 signaling.
PG  - ra95
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad9887 [doi]
AB  - The cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22), which is a member of the IL-10 family, is
      produced exclusively by immune cells and activates signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in nonimmune cells, such as hepatocytes,
      keratinocytes, and colonic epithelial cells, to drive various processes central
      to tissue homeostasis and immunosurveillance. Dysregulation of IL-22 signaling
      causes inflammatory diseases. IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP; encoded by IL22RA2)
      is a soluble IL-22 receptor, which antagonizes IL-22 activity and has genetic
      associations with autoimmune diseases. Humans have three IL-22BP isoforms,
      IL-22BPi1 to IL-22BPi3, which are generated by alternative splicing; mice only
      have an IL-22BPi2 homolog. We showed that, although IL-22BPi3 had less inhibitory
      activity than IL-22BPi2, IL-22BPi3 was more abundant in various human tissues
      under homeostatic conditions. IL-22BPi2 was more effective than IL-22BPi3 at
      blocking the contribution of IL-22 to cooperative gene induction with the
      inflammatory cytokine IL-17, which is often present with IL-22 in autoimmune
      settings. In addition, we found that IL-22BPi1 was not secreted and therefore
      failed to antagonize IL-22 signaling. Furthermore, IL-22BPi2 was the only isoform
      that was increased in abundance when myeloid cells were activated by Toll-like
      receptor 2 signaling or retinoic acid, a maturation factor for myeloid cells.
      These data suggest that the human IL-22BP isoforms have distinct spatial and

TI  - Bypassing STAT3-mediated inhibition of the transcriptional regulator ID2 improves
      the antitumor efficacy of dendritic cells.
PG  - ra94
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf3957 [doi]
AB  - Despite the potent ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to stimulate lymphocyte
      responses and host immunity, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
      factor-derived DCs (GM-DCs) used as antitumor vaccines have demonstrated
      relatively modest success in cancer immunotherapy. We found that injecting GM-DCs
      into melanoma tumors in mice, or culturing GM-DCs with melanoma-secreted
      cytokines or melanoma-conditioned medium, rapidly suppressed DC-intrinsic
      expression of the gene encoding inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2), a
      transcriptional regulator. Melanoma-associated cytokines repressed Id2
      transcription in murine DCs through the activation of signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Enforced expression of ID2 in GM-DCs
      (ID2-GM-DCs) suppressed their production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Vaccination with ID2-GM-DCs slowed the
      progression of melanoma tumors and enhanced animal survival, which was associated
      with an increased abundance of tumor-infiltrating interferon-gamma-positive
      CD4(+) effector and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells and a decreased number of
      tumor-infiltrating regulatory CD4(+) T cells. The efficacy of the ID2-GM-DC
      vaccine was improved by combinatorial treatment with a blocking antibody to
      programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a current immunotherapy that overcomes
      suppressive immune checkpoint signaling. Collectively, our data reveal a
      previously unrecognized STAT3-mediated immunosuppressive mechanism in DCs and
      indicate that DC-intrinsic ID2 promotes tumor immunity by modulating
      tumor-associated CD4(+) T cell responses. Thus, inhibiting STAT3 or
      overexpressing ID2 selectively in DCs may improve the efficiency of DC vaccines
      in cancer therapy.

      plant kingdom.
PG  - ra93
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf9558 [doi]
AB  - Signaling proteins evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for
      distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G protein (heterotrimeric guanosine
      triphosphate-binding protein) network was achieved in animals through subunit
      duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and
      quantitative phenotypic profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana with protein evolution
      informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G protein machinery evolved by a 
      saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary
      structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Galpha (XLG)
      subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by
      gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution
      uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G protein signaling, but 
      preserved an alpha-helix region that enables interaction with its partner
      Gbetagamma. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints
      imposed by the need for the protein to maintain interactions with various
      partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG proteins evolved rapidly to produce
      three highly divergent members. Analysis of A. thaliana mutants indicated that
      these Galpha and XLG proteins all function with Gbetagamma and evolved to operate
      both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gbetagamma machinery specialized in
      environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Galpha-Gbetagamma retained 
      developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development,
      involve both Galpha and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These
      extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of
      the canonical Galpha subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway
      diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental
      coevolution of residues among interacting proteins.

TI  - The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive.
PG  - ra92
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4497 [doi]
AB  - Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is
      required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that 
      it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure
      of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and
      demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity
      of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine
      sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2
      (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine,
      showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound
      structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine
      binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be
      a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported "apo"-Sestrin2
      structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in 
      the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the 
      higher resolution structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with leucine
      eliminated the large Fobs-Fcalc difference density at this position and improved 
      the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own
      structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also
      contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure
      of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.

      T cells.
PG  - rs10
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf7694 [doi]
AB  - Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an electrophilic drug that is used to treat autoimmune
      conditions, including multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. The mechanism of action
      of DMF is unclear but may involve the covalent modification of proteins or DMF
      serving as a prodrug that is converted to monomethyl fumarate (MMF). We found
      that DMF, but not MMF, blocked the activation of primary human and mouse T cells.
      Using a quantitative, site-specific chemical proteomic platform, we determined
      the DMF sensitivity of >2400 cysteine residues in human T cells. Cysteines
      sensitive to DMF, but not MMF, were identified in several proteins with
      established biochemical or genetic links to T cell function, including protein
      kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta). DMF blocked the association of PKCtheta with the
      costimulatory receptor CD28 by perturbing a CXXC motif in the C2 domain of this
      kinase. Mutation of these DMF-sensitive cysteines also impaired PKCtheta-CD28
      interactions and T cell activation, designating the C2 domain of PKCtheta as a
      key functional, electrophile-sensing module important for T cell biology.

AB  - Among the various subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), those with
      chromosomal rearrangements of the MLL oncogene (AML-MLL) have a poor prognosis.
      AML-MLL tumor cells are resistant to current genotoxic therapies because of an
      attenuated response by p53, a protein that induces cell cycle arrest and
      apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In addition to chemicals that damage DNA,
      efforts have focused on targeting DNA repair enzymes as a general
      chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment. Here, we found that inhibition of 
      the kinase ATR, which is the primary sensor of DNA replication stress, induced
      chromosomal breakage and death of mouse AML(MLL) cells (with an MLL-ENL fusion
      and a constitutively active N-RAS independently of p53. Moreover, ATR inhibition 
      as a single agent exhibited antitumoral activity, both reducing tumor burden
      after establishment and preventing tumors from growing, in an immunocompetent
      allograft mouse model of AML(MLL) and in xenografts of a human AML-MLL cell line.
      We also found that inhibition of ATM, a kinase that senses DNA double-strand
      breaks, also promoted the survival of the AML(MLL) mice. Collectively, these data
      indicated that ATR or ATM inhibition represent potential therapeutic strategies
      for the treatment of AML, especially MLL-driven leukemias.

TI  - CHK1 as a therapeutic target to bypass chemoresistance in AML.
PG  - ra90
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac9704 [doi]
AB  - The nucleoside analog cytarabine, an inhibitor of DNA replication fork
      progression that results in DNA damage, is currently used in the treatment of
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We explored the prognostic value of the expression 
      of 72 genes involved in various aspects of DNA replication in a set of 198 AML
      patients treated by cytarabine-based chemotherapy. We unveiled that high
      expression of the DNA replication checkpoint gene CHEK1 is a prognostic marker
      associated with shorter overall, event-free, and relapse-free survivals and
      determined that the expression of CHEK1 can predict more frequent and earlier
      postremission relapse. CHEK1 encodes checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which is
      activated by the kinase ATR when DNA replication is impaired by DNA damage. High 
      abundance of CHK1 in AML patient cells correlated with higher clonogenic ability 
      and more efficient DNA replication fork progression upon cytarabine treatment.
      Exposing the patient cells with the high abundance of CHK1 to SCH900776, an
      inhibitor of the kinase activity of CHK1, reduced clonogenic ability and
      progression of DNA replication in the presence of cytarabine. These results
      indicated that some AML cells rely on an efficient CHK1-mediated replication
      stress response for viability and that therapeutic strategies that inhibit CHK1
      could extend current cytarabine-based treatments and overcome drug resistance.
      Furthermore, monitoring CHEK1 expression could be used both as a predictor of
      outcome and as a marker to select AML patients for CHK1 inhibitor treatments.

TI  - Familial Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin 1 mutants promote
      gamma-secretase cleavage of STIM1 to impair store-operated Ca2+ entry.
PG  - ra89
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf1371 [doi]
AB  - Some forms of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are caused by mutations in
      presenilins (PSs), catalytic components of a gamma-secretase complex that cleaves
      target proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). Calcium (Ca(2+))
      dysregulation in cells with these FAD-causing PS mutants has been attributed to
      attenuated store-operated Ca(2+) entry [SOCE; also called capacitative Ca(2+)
      entry (CCE)]. CCE occurs when STIM1 detects decreases in Ca(2+) in the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activates ORAI channels to replenish Ca(2+) stores
      in the ER. We showed that CCE was attenuated by PS1-associated gamma-secretase
      activity. Endogenous PS1 and STIM1 interacted in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
      cells, patient fibroblasts, and mouse primary cortical neurons. Forms of PS1 with
      FAD-associated mutations enhanced gamma-secretase cleavage of the STIM1
      transmembrane domain at a sequence that was similar to the gamma-secretase
      cleavage sequence of APP. Cultured hippocampal neurons expressing mutant PS1 had 
      attenuated CCE that was associated with destabilized dendritic spines, which were
      rescued by either gamma-secretase inhibition or overexpression of STIM1. Our
      results indicate that gamma-secretase activity may physiologically regulate CCE
      by targeting STIM1 and that restoring STIM1 may be a therapeutic approach in AD.

TI  - AML suppresses hematopoiesis by releasing exosomes that contain microRNAs
      targeting c-MYB.
PG  - ra88
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf2797 [doi]
AB  - Exosomes are paracrine regulators of the tumor microenvironment and contain
      complex cargo. We previously reported that exosomes released from acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) cells can suppress residual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell
      (HSPC) function indirectly through stromal reprogramming of niche retention
      factors. We found that the systemic loss of hematopoietic function is also in
      part a consequence of AML exosome-directed microRNA (miRNA) trafficking to HSPCs.
      Exosomes isolated from cultured AML or the plasma from mice bearing AML
      xenografts exhibited enrichment of miR-150 and miR-155. HSPCs cocultured with
      either of these exosomes exhibited impaired clonogenicity, through the miR-150-
      and miR-155-mediated suppression of the translation of transcripts encoding
      c-MYB, a transcription factor involved in HSPC differentiation and proliferation.
      To discover additional miRNA targets, we captured miR-155 and its target
      transcripts by coimmunoprecipitation with an attenuated RNA-induced silencing
      complex (RISC)-trap, followed by high-throughput sequencing. This approach
      identified known and previously unknown miR-155 target transcripts. Integration
      of the miR-155 targets with information from the protein interaction database
      STRING revealed proteins indirectly affected by AML exosome-derived miRNA. Our
      findings indicate a direct effect of AML exosomes on HSPCs that, through a
      stroma-independent mechanism, compromises hematopoiesis. Furthermore, combining
      miRNA target data with protein-protein interaction data may be a broadly
      applicable strategy to define the effects of exosome-mediated trafficking of
      regulatory molecules within the tumor microenvironment.

TI  - MuSK is a BMP co-receptor that shapes BMP responses and calcium signaling in
      muscle cells.
PG  - ra87
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf0890 [doi]
AB  - Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) function in most tissues but have cell
      type-specific effects. Given the relatively small number of BMP receptors, this
      exquisite signaling specificity requires additional molecules to regulate this
      pathway's output. The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) is
      critical for neuromuscular junction formation and maintenance. Here, we show that
      MuSK also promotes BMP signaling in muscle cells. MuSK bound to BMP4 and related 
      BMPs with low nanomolar affinity in vitro and to the type I BMP receptors ALK3
      and ALK6 in a ligand-independent manner both in vitro and in cultured myotubes.
      High-affinity binding to BMPs required the third, alternatively spliced MuSK
      immunoglobulin-like domain. In myoblasts, endogenous MuSK promoted BMP4-dependent
      phosphorylation of SMADs and transcription of Id1, which encodes a transcription 
      factor involved in muscle differentiation. Gene expression profiling showed that 
      MuSK was required for the BMP4-induced expression of a subset of genes in
      myoblasts, including regulator of G protein signaling 4 (Rgs4). In myotubes, MuSK
      enhanced the BMP4-induced expression of a distinct set of genes, including
      transcripts characteristic of slow muscle. MuSK-mediated stimulation of BMP
      signaling required type I BMP receptor activity but was independent of MuSK
      tyrosine kinase activity. MuSK-dependent expression of Rgs4 resulted in the
      inhibition of Ca(2+) signaling induced by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
      in myoblasts. These findings establish that MuSK has dual roles in muscle cells, 
      acting both as a tyrosine kinase-dependent synaptic organizing molecule and as a 
      BMP co-receptor that shapes BMP transcriptional output and cholinergic signaling.

TI  - Proteome-wide analysis of arginine monomethylation reveals widespread occurrence 
      in human cells.
PG  - rs9
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf7329 [doi]
AB  - The posttranslational modification of proteins by arginine methylation is
      functionally important, yet the breadth of this modification is not well
      characterized. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified 8030
      arginine methylation sites within 3300 human proteins in human embryonic kidney
      293 cells, indicating that the occurrence of this modification is comparable to
      phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. A site-level conservation analysis revealed
      that arginine methylation sites are less evolutionarily conserved compared to
      arginines that were not identified as modified by methylation. Through
      quantitative proteomics and RNA interference to examine arginine methylation
      stoichiometry, we unexpectedly found that the protein arginine methyltransferase 
      (PRMT) family of arginine methyltransferases catalyzed methylation independently 
      of arginine sequence context. In contrast to the frequency of somatic mutations
      at arginine methylation sites throughout the proteome, we observed that somatic
      mutations were common at arginine methylation sites in proteins involved in mRNA 
      splicing. Furthermore, in HeLa and U2OS cells, we found that distinct arginine
      methyltransferases differentially regulated the functions of the pre-mRNA
      splicing factor SRSF2 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2) and the RNA
      transport ribonucleoprotein HNRNPUL1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein
      U-like 1). Knocking down PRMT5 impaired the RNA binding function of SRSF2,
      whereas knocking down PRMT4 [also known as coactivator-associated arginine
      methyltransferase 1 (CARM1)] or PRMT1 increased the RNA binding function of
      HNRNPUL1. High-content single-cell imaging additionally revealed that knocking
      down CARM1 promoted the nuclear accumulation of SRSF2, independent of cell cycle 
      phase. Collectively, the presented human arginine methylome provides a missing
      piece in the global and integrative view of cellular physiology and protein
      regulation.

PG  - ra86
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf3596 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages exhibit a phenotypic plasticity that enables them to orchestrate
      specific immune responses to distinct threats. The microbial product
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C are
      released during bacterial infection and tissue injury, respectively, and both
      activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We found that these two TLR4 ligands
      stimulated distinct signaling pathways in macrophages, resulting in cells with
      divergent phenotypes. Although macrophages activated by LPS or tenascin-C
      displayed some common features, including activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cytokine synthesis, each ligand
      stimulated the production of different subsets of cytokines and generated
      different phosphoproteomic signatures. Moreover, tenascin-C promoted the
      generation of macrophages that exhibited increased synthesis and phosphorylation 
      of extracellular matrix components, whereas LPS stimulated the production of
      macrophages that exhibited an enhanced capacity to degrade the matrix. These data
      reveal how the activation of one pattern recognition receptor by different
      microenvironmental cues generates macrophage with distinct phenotypes.

PG  - ra85
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab2820 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a master regulator of inflammation and cell 
      death. Whereas most of the activity of NF-kappaB is regulated through the
      inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase (IKK)-dependent degradation of IkappaB, IKK 
      also phosphorylates subunits of NF-kappaB. We investigated the contribution of
      the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 at the IKK phosphorylation site 
      serine 536 (Ser(536)) in humans, which is thought to be required for the
      activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Through experiments with
      knock-in mice (S534A mice) expressing a mutant p65 with an alanine-to-serine
      substitution at position 534 (the murine homolog of human Ser(536)), we observed 
      increased expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes after injection of mice with
      the inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or exposure to gamma
      irradiation, and the enhanced gene expression was most pronounced at late time
      points. Compared to wild-type mice, S534A mice displayed increased mortality
      after injection with LPS. Increased NF-kappaB signaling in the S534A mice was at 
      least in part explained by the increased stability of the S534A p65 protein
      compared to that of the Ser(534)-phosphorylated wild-type protein. Together, our 
      results suggest that Ser(534) phosphorylation of p65 in mice (and, by extension, 
      Ser(536) phosphorylation of human p65) is not required for its nuclear
      translocation, but instead inhibits NF-kappaB signaling to prevent deleterious
      inflammation.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag3232 [doi]
AB  - The p53 family of transcription factors includes p63, which is a master regulator
      of gene expression in epithelial cells. Determining whether p63 is
      tumor-suppressive or tumorigenic is complicated by isoform-specific and cellular 
      context-dependent protein associations, as well as antagonism from mutant p53.
      DeltaNp63 is an amino-terminal-truncated isoform, that is, the predominant
      isoform expressed in cancer cells of epithelial origin. In HaCaT keratinocytes,
      which have mutant p53 and DeltaNp63, we found that mutant p53 antagonized
      DeltaNp63 transcriptional activity but that activation of Ras or transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways reduced the abundance of mutant 
      p53 and strengthened target gene binding and activity of DeltaNp63. Among the
      products of DeltaNp63-induced genes was dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6),
      which promoted the degradation of mutant p53, likely by dephosphorylating p53.
      Knocking down all forms of p63 or DUSP6 and DUSP7 (DUSP6/7) inhibited the basal
      or TGF-beta-induced or epidermal growth factor (which activates Ras)-induced
      migration and invasion in cultures of p53-mutant breast cancer and squamous skin 
      cancer cells. Alternatively, overexpressing DeltaNp63 in the breast cancer cells 
      increased their capacity to colonize various tissues upon intracardiac injection 
      in mice, and this was inhibited by knocking down DUSP6/7 in these
      DeltaNp63-overexpressing cells. High abundance of DeltaNp63 in various tumors
      correlated with poor prognosis in patients, and this correlation was stronger in 
      patients whose tumors also had a mutation in the gene encoding p53. Thus,
      oncogenic Ras and TGF-beta signaling stimulate cancer progression through
      activation of the DeltaNp63 transcriptional program.

TI  - Dynamic DNA methylation regulates neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability.
PG  - ra83
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf5642 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA cytosine methylation, contribute to the
      mechanisms underlying learning and memory by coordinating adaptive gene
      expression and neuronal plasticity. Transcription-dependent plasticity regulated 
      by DNA methylation includes synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling.
      Memory-related plasticity also includes alterations in intrinsic membrane
      excitability mediated by changes in the abundance or activity of ion channels in 
      the plasma membrane, which sets the threshold for action potential generation. We
      found that prolonged inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity
      increased intrinsic membrane excitability of cultured cortical pyramidal neurons.
      Knockdown of the cytosine demethylase TET1 or inhibition of RNA polymerase
      blocked the increased membrane excitability caused by DNMT inhibition, suggesting
      that this effect was mediated by subsequent cytosine demethylation and de novo
      transcription. Prolonged DNMT inhibition blunted the medium component of the
      after-hyperpolarization potential, an effect that would increase neuronal
      excitability, and was associated with reduced expression of the genes encoding
      small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels. Furthermore, the specific 
      SK channel blocker apamin increased neuronal excitability but was ineffective
      after DNMT inhibition. Our results suggested that DNMT inhibition enables
      transcriptional changes that culminate in decreased expression of SK
      channel-encoding genes and decreased activity of SK channels, thus providing a
      mechanism for the regulation of neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability by
      dynamic DNA cytosine methylation. This study has implications for human
      neurological and psychiatric diseases associated with dysregulated intrinsic
      excitability.

      transduced by PI3Kbeta in myeloid cells.
PG  - ra82
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aae0453 [doi]
AB  - Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) catalyze production of the lipid
      messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which plays a central 
      role in a complex signaling network regulating cell growth, survival, and
      movement. This network is overactivated in cancer and inflammation, and there is 
      interest in determining the PI3K catalytic subunit (p110alpha, p110beta,
      p110gamma, or p110delta) that should be targeted in different therapeutic
      contexts. Previous studies have defined unique regulatory inputs for p110beta,
      including direct interaction with Gbetagamma subunits, Rac, and Rab5. We
      generated mice with knock-in mutations of p110beta that selectively blocked the
      interaction with Gbetagamma and investigated its contribution to the PI3K isoform
      dependency of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G protein (heterotrimeric
      guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) responses in primary 
      macrophages and neutrophils. We discovered a unique role for p110beta in
      supporting synergistic PIP3 formation in response to the coactivation of
      macrophages by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the complement
      protein C5a. In contrast, we found partially redundant roles for p110alpha,
      p110beta, and p110delta downstream of M-CSF alone and a nonredundant role for
      p110gamma downstream of C5a alone. This role for p110beta completely depended on 
      direct interaction with Gbetagamma, suggesting that p110beta transduces GPCR
      signals in the context of coincident activation by an RTK. The
      p110beta-Gbetagamma interaction was also required for neutrophils to generate
      reactive oxygen species in response to the Fcgamma receptor-dependent recognition
      of immune complexes and for their beta2 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen 
      or poly-RGD+, directly implicating heterotrimeric G proteins in these two
      responses.

PG  - ra81
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf7279 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an important opportunistic human pathogen that is highly
      resistant to osmotic stresses. To survive an increase in osmolarity, bacteria
      immediately take up potassium ions and small organic compounds known as
      compatible solutes. The second messenger cyclic diadenosine monophosphate
      (c-di-AMP) reduces the ability of bacteria to withstand osmotic stress by binding
      to and inhibiting several proteins that promote potassium uptake. We identified
      OpuCA, the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) component of an uptake system for
      the compatible solute carnitine, as a c-di-AMP target protein in S aureus and
      found that the LAC*DeltagdpP strain of S aureus, which overproduces c-di-AMP,
      showed reduced carnitine uptake. The paired cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS)
      domains of OpuCA bound to c-di-AMP, and a crystal structure revealed a putative
      binding pocket for c-di-AMP in the cleft between the two CBS domains. Thus,
      c-di-AMP inhibits osmoprotection through multiple mechanisms.

TI  - H2S production by reactive oxygen species in the carotid body triggers
      hypertension in a rodent model of sleep apnea.
PG  - ra80
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf3204 [doi]
AB  - Sleep apnea is a prevalent respiratory disease in which episodic cessation of
      breathing causes intermittent hypoxia. Patients with sleep apnea and rodents
      exposed to intermittent hypoxia exhibit hypertension. The carotid body senses
      changes in blood O2 concentrations, and an enhanced carotid body chemosensory
      reflex contributes to hypertension in sleep apnea patients. A rodent model of
      intermittent hypoxia that mimics blood O2 saturation profiles of patients with
      sleep apnea has shown that increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      in the carotid body enhances the chemosensory reflex and triggers hypertension.
      CO generated by heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2) induces a signaling pathway that inhibits
      hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), leading to 
      suppression of carotid body activity. We found that ROS inhibited CO generation
      by HO-2 in the carotid body and liver through a mechanism that required Cys(265) 
      in the heme regulatory motif of heterologously expressed HO-2. We showed that ROS
      induced by intermittent hypoxia inhibited CO production and increased H2S
      concentrations in the carotid body, which stimulated its neural activity. In
      rodents, blockade of H2S synthesis by CSE, by either pharmacologic or genetic
      approaches, inhibited carotid body activation and hypertension induced by
      intermittent hypoxia. Thus, our results indicate that oxidant-induced
      inactivation of HO-2, which leads to increased CSE-dependent H2S production in
      the carotid body, is a critical trigger of hypertension in rodents exposed to
      intermittent hypoxia.

AB  - Arsenic trioxide chemotherapy cures acute promyelocytic leukemia by inducing the 
      ubiquitylation of an oncogenic fusion protein containing promyelocytic leukemia
      protein (PML) subsequent to modification of PML by SUMO1 and SUMO2. We proposed
      that the SUMO switch at Lys(65) of PML enhanced subsequent SUMO2 conjugation to
      Lys(160) and consequent RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation of PML. Ferhi et al note
      differences between their experimental system and ours regarding the outcome and 
      mechanisms of SUMO-dependent PML signaling. When confronted by apparently
      contradictory data, it is appropriate to drill down to where the differences
      could lie.

AB  - Fasci et al proposed that a SENP1-mediated switch from SUMO2 to SUMO1 conjugation
      on Lys(65) in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is required for
      arsenic-induced PML degradation, the basis for the antileukemic activity of
      arsenic. We found that PML or PML/RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha) mutants
      that cannot be SUMO-conjugated on this specific site nevertheless underwent
      immediate arsenic-triggered SUMO modification. Moreover, these mutants were
      efficiently degraded in cells and even in vivo, demonstrating that SUMOylation of
      Lys(65) was dispensable for arsenic response. The existence and putative role of 
      a SUMO switch on PML should thus be reassessed.

TI  - Long-term potentiation modulates synaptic phosphorylation networks and reshapes
      the structure of the postsynaptic interactome.
PG  - rs8
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6716 [doi]
AB  - The postsynaptic site of neurons is composed of more than 1500 proteins arranged 
      in protein-protein interaction complexes, the composition of which is modulated
      by protein phosphorylation through the actions of complex signaling networks.
      Components of these networks function as key regulators of synaptic plasticity,
      in particular hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). The postsynaptic density 
      (PSD) is a complex multicomponent structure that includes receptors, enzymes,
      scaffold proteins, and structural proteins. We triggered LTP in the mouse
      hippocampus CA1 region and then performed large-scale analyses to identify
      phosphorylation-mediated events in the PSD and changes in the protein-protein
      interactome of the PSD that were associated with LTP induction. Our data
      indicated LTP-induced reorganization of the PSD. The dynamic reorganization of
      the PSD links glutamate receptor signaling to kinases (writers) and phosphatases 
      (erasers), as well as the target proteins that are modulated by protein
      phosphorylation and the proteins that recognize the phosphorylation status of
      their binding partners (readers). Protein phosphorylation and protein interaction
      networks converged at highly connected nodes within the PSD network. Furthermore,
      the LTP-regulated phosphoproteins, which included the scaffold proteins Shank3,
      Syngap1, Dlgap1, and Dlg4, represented the "PSD risk" for schizophrenia and
      autism spectrum disorder, such that without these proteins in the analysis, the
      association with the PSD and these two psychiatric diseases was not present.
      These data are a rich resource for future studies of LTP and suggest that the PSD
      holds the keys to understanding the molecular events that contribute to complex
      neurological disorders that affect synaptic plasticity.

TI  - Histone deacetylase 3 supports endochondral bone formation by controlling
      cytokine signaling and matrix remodeling.
PG  - ra79
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf3273 [doi]
AB  - Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are efficacious epigenetic-based therapies 
      for some cancers and neurological disorders; however, each of these drugs
      inhibits multiple HDACs and has detrimental effects on the skeleton. To better
      understand how HDAC inhibitors affect endochondral bone formation, we
      conditionally deleted one of their targets, Hdac3, pre- and postnatally in type
      II collagen alpha1 (Col2alpha1)-expressing chondrocytes. Embryonic deletion was
      lethal, but postnatal deletion of Hdac3 delayed secondary ossification center
      formation, altered maturation of growth plate chondrocytes, and increased
      osteoclast activity in the primary spongiosa. HDAC3-deficient chondrocytes
      exhibited increased expression of cytokine and matrix-degrading genes (Il-6,
      Mmp3, Mmp13, and Saa3) and a reduced abundance of genes related to extracellular 
      matrix production, bone development, and ossification (Acan, Col2a1, Ihh, and
      Col10a1). Histone acetylation increased at and near genes that had increased
      expression. The acetylation and activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)
      were also increased in HDAC3-deficient chondrocytes. Increased cytokine signaling
      promoted autocrine activation of Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and
      activator of transcription (STAT) and NF-kappaB pathways to suppress chondrocyte 
      maturation, as well as paracrine activation of osteoclasts and bone resorption.
      Blockade of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-JAK-STAT signaling, NF-kappaB signaling, and
      bromodomain extraterminal proteins, which recognize acetylated lysines and
      promote transcriptional elongation, significantly reduced Il-6 and Mmp13
      expression in HDAC3-deficient chondrocytes and secondary activation in
      osteoclasts. The JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib also reduced osteoclast activity in
      Hdac3 conditional knockout mice. Thus, HDAC3 controls the temporal and spatial
      expression of tissue-remodeling genes and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes 
      to ensure proper endochondral ossification during development.

AB  - Multiprotein complexes transduce cellular signals through extensive interaction
      networks, but the ability to analyze these networks in cells from small clinical 
      biopsies is limited. To address this, we applied an adaptable multiplex matrix
      system to physiologically relevant signaling protein complexes isolated from a
      cell line or from human patient samples. Focusing on the proximal T cell receptor
      (TCR) signalosome, we assessed 210 pairs of PiSCES (proteins in shared complexes 
      detected by exposed surface epitopes). Upon stimulation of Jurkat cells with
      superantigen-loaded antigen-presenting cells, this system produced
      high-dimensional data that enabled visualization of network activity. A
      comprehensive analysis platform generated PiSCES biosignatures by applying
      unsupervised hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis, an adaptive
      nonparametric with empirical cutoff analysis, and weighted correlation network
      analysis. We generated PiSCES biosignatures from 4-mm skin punch biopsies from
      control patients or patients with the autoimmune skin disease alopecia areata.
      This analysis distinguished disease patients from the controls, detected enhanced
      basal TCR signaling in the autoimmune patients, and identified a potential
      signaling network signature that may be indicative of disease. Thus, generation
      of PiSCES biosignatures represents an approach that can provide information about
      the activity of protein signaling networks in samples including low-abundance
      primary cells from clinical biopsies.

TI  - Small heterodimer partner SHP mediates liver X receptor (LXR)-dependent
      suppression of inflammatory signaling by promoting LXR SUMOylation specifically
      in astrocytes.
PG  - ra78
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf4850 [doi]
AB  - Liver X receptors (LXRs) suppress the expression of inflammatory genes in a
      context-specific manner. In astrocytes, SUMOylation of LXRs promotes their
      anti-inflammatory effects. We found that small heterodimer partner (SHP), also
      known as NR0B2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2), facilitates the
      anti-inflammatory actions of LXRs by promoting their SUMOylation. Knockdown of
      SHP abrogated SUMOylation of LXRs, preventing their anti-inflammatory effects, in
      primary rat astrocytes but not macrophages. The underlying mechanisms differed
      according to LXR isoform. SHP promoted SUMO2 and SUMO3 attachment to LXRalpha by 
      interacting directly with the histone deacetylase and E3 SUMO ligase HDAC4. In
      contrast, SHP promoted SUMO1 attachment to LXRbeta by stabilizing the E3 SUMO
      ligase PIAS1. SHP bound PIAS1 and disrupted its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin
      ligase SIAH1. Knocking down SIAH1 rescued LXRbeta SUMOylation in SHP-deficient
      astrocytes. Our data collectively suggested that SHP mediates the
      anti-inflammatory actions of LXRs through differential regulation of receptor
      SUMOylation specifically in astrocytes, thereby revealing potential avenues for
      therapeutic development in diseases associated with brain inflammation.

TI  - Peripheral motor neuropathy is associated with defective kinase regulation of the
      KCC3 cotransporter.
PG  - ra77
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aae0546 [doi]
AB  - Using exome sequencing, we identified a de novo mutation (c.2971A>G; T991A) in
      SLC12A6, the gene encoding the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KCC3, in a patient with
      an early-onset, progressive, and severe peripheral neuropathy primarily affecting
      motor neurons. Normally, the WNK kinase-dependent phosphorylation of T(991)
      tonically inhibits KCC3; however, cell swelling triggers Thr(991)
      dephosphorylation to activate the transporter and restore cell volume. KCC3 T991A
      mutation in patient cells abolished Thr(991) phosphorylation, resulted in
      constitutive KCC3 activity, and compromised cell volume homeostasis.
      KCC3(T991A/T991A) mutant mice exhibited constitutive KCC3 activity and
      recapitulated aspects of the clinical, electrophysiological, and
      histopathological findings of the patient. These results suggest that the
      function of the peripheral nervous system depends on finely tuned,
      kinase-regulated KCC3 activity and implicate abnormal cell volume homeostasis as 
      a previously unreported mechanism of axonal degeneration.

AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Adam Schrum and Steven Neier, authors of 
      a Research Article that appears in the 2 August 2016 issue of Science Signaling, 
      about a method for identifying protein-protein interactions in patient tissue
      samples. The authors used this method to compare signaling complexes downstream
      of the T cell receptor in T cells from healthy skin with those in T cells from
      the skin of patients with the autoimmune disease alopecia areata. The study
      revealed differences in the relative abundance of some protein complexes between 
      T cells from the control and patient groups. This technique could be adapted for 
      use as a diagnostic tool to stratify patients by molecular phenotype and predict 
      the therapeutic strategy that is likely to work best for each patient.Listen to
      Podcast.

      is a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and
      gene expression, both of which control stem cell fate. We found that disruption
      of Syx, a gene encoding a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor,
      accelerated retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation in murine embryonic stem
      cells aggregated into embryoid bodies. Cells from Syx(+/+) and Syx(-/-) embryoid 
      bodies had different abundances of proteins implicated in stem cell pluripotency.
      The differentiation-promoting proteins Noggin and RARgamma (a retinoic acid
      receptor) were more abundant in cells of Syx(-/-) embryoid bodies, whereas the
      differentiation-suppressing proteins SIRT1 (a protein deacetylase) and the
      phosphorylated form of SMAD1 (the active form of this transcription factor) were 
      more abundant in cells of Syx(+/+) embryoid bodies. These differences were
      blocked by the overexpression of constitutively active RhoA, indicating that the 
      abundance of these proteins was maintained, at least in part, by RhoA activity.
      The peripheral stress fibers in cells from Syx(-/-) embryoid bodies were thinner 
      than those in Syx(+/+) cells. Furthermore, less Noggin and fewer vesicles
      containing Rab3d, a GTPase that mediates Noggin trafficking, were detected in
      cells from Syx(-/-) embryoid bodies, which could result from increased Noggin
      exocytosis. These results suggested that, in addition to inhibiting Noggin
      transcription, RhoA activity in wild-type murine embryonic stem cells also
      prevented neural differentiation by limiting Noggin secretion.

      recruitment and signaling.
PG  - ra75
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf0626 [doi]
AB  - The T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is required for the full activation of
      naive T cells and for the development and maintenance of Foxp3(+) regulatory T
      (Treg) cells. We showed that the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 was bound to the
      plasma membrane in resting cells and that ligand binding to CD28 resulted in its 
      release. Membrane binding by the CD28 cytoplasmic domain required two clusters of
      basic amino acid residues, which interacted with the negatively charged inner
      leaflet of the plasma membrane. These same clusters of basic residues also served
      as interaction sites for Lck, a Src family kinase critical for CD28 function.
      This signaling complex was further stabilized by the Lck-mediated phosphorylation
      of CD28 Tyr(207) and the subsequent binding of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of
      Lck to this phosphorylated tyrosine. Mutation of the basic clusters in the CD28
      cytoplasmic domain reduced the recruitment to the CD28-Lck complex of protein
      kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta), which serves as a key effector kinase in the CD28
      signaling pathway. Consequently, mutation of either a basic cluster or Tyr(207)
      impaired CD28 function in mice as shown by the reduced thymic differentiation of 
      FoxP3(+) Treg cells. On the basis of these results, we propose a previously
      undescribed model for the initiation of CD28 signaling.

      prevent photoreceptor cell degeneration.
PG  - ra74
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag0245 [doi]
AB  - Photoreceptor cell degeneration leads to visual impairment and blindness in
      several types of retinal disease. However, the discovery of safe and effective
      therapeutic strategies conferring photoreceptor cell protection remains
      challenging. Targeting distinct cellular pathways with low doses of different
      drugs that produce a functionally synergistic effect could provide a strategy for
      preventing or treating retinal dystrophies. We took a systems pharmacology
      approach to identify potential combination therapies using a mouse model of
      light-induced retinal degeneration. We showed that a combination of U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration-approved drugs that act on different G protein
      (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
      exhibited synergistic activity that protected retinas from light-induced
      degeneration even when each drug was administered at a low dose. In functional
      assays, the combined effects of these drugs were stimulation of Gi/o signaling by
      activating the dopamine receptors D2R and D4R, as well as inhibition of Gs and Gq
      signaling by antagonizing D1R and the alpha1A-adrenergic receptor ADRA1A,
      respectively. Moreover, transcriptome analyses demonstrated that such combined
      GPCR-targeted treatments preserved patterns of retinal gene expression that were 
      more similar to those of the normal retina than did higher-dose monotherapy. Our 
      study thus supports a systems pharmacology approach to identify treatments for
      retinopathies, an approach that could extend to other complex disorders.

      through opposing effects on STATs in autoimmune settings.
PG  - ra73
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad8953 [doi]
AB  - Rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2) determines the balance between human T helper 17 
      (TH17) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. We investigated its role in the
      generation of T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which help to generate
      antibody-producing B cells under normal and autoimmune conditions. Inhibiting
      ROCK2 in normal human T cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients
      with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) decreased the number and function 
      of TFH cells induced by activation ex vivo. Moreover, inhibition of ROCK2
      activity decreased the abundance of the transcriptional regulator Bcl6 (B cell
      lymphoma 6) and increased that of Blimp1 by reducing the binding of signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and increasing that of STAT5 
      to the promoters of the genes Bcl6 and PRDM1, respectively. In the MRL/lpr murine
      model of SLE, oral administration of the selective ROCK2 inhibitor KD025 resulted
      in a twofold reduction in the numbers of TFH cells and antibody-producing plasma 
      cells in the spleen, as well as a decrease in the size of splenic germinal
      centers, which are the sites of interaction between TFH cells and B cells.
      KD025-treated mice showed a substantial improvement in both histological and
      clinical scores compared to those of untreated mice and had reduced amounts of
      Bcl6 and phosphorylated STAT3, as well as increased STAT5 phosphorylation.
      Together, these data suggest that ROCK2 signaling plays a critical role in
      controlling the development of TFH cells induced by autoimmune conditions through
      reciprocal regulation of STAT3 and STAT5 activation.

PG  - ra72
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad9256 [doi]
AB  - Activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) by
      VEGF binding is critical for vascular morphogenesis. In addition, VEGF disrupts
      the endothelial barrier by triggering the phosphorylation and turnover of the
      junctional molecule VE-cadherin, a process mediated by the VEGFR2 downstream
      effectors T cell-specific adaptor (TSAd) and the tyrosine kinase c-Src. We
      investigated whether the VEGFR2-TSAd-c-Src pathway was required for angiogenic
      sprouting. Indeed, Tsad-deficient embryoid bodies failed to sprout in response to
      VEGF. Tsad-deficient mice displayed impaired angiogenesis specifically during
      tracheal vessel development, but not during retinal vasculogenesis, and in
      VEGF-loaded Matrigel plugs, but not in those loaded with FGF. The SH2 and
      proline-rich domains of TSAd bridged VEGFR2 and c-Src, and this bridging was
      critical for the localization of activated c-Src to endothelial junctions and
      elongation of the growing sprout, but not for selection of the tip cell. These
      results revealed that vascular sprouting and permeability are both controlled
      through the VEGFR2-TSAd-c-Src signaling pathway in a subset of tissues, which may
      be useful in developing strategies to control tissue-specific pathological
      angiogenesis.

PG  - ra71
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf1047 [doi]
AB  - The transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) respond to chemical irritants
      and temperature. TRPV1 responds to the itch-inducing endogenous signal histamine,
      and TRPA1 responds to the itch-inducing chemical chloroquine. We showed that, in 
      sensory neurons, TRPV4 is important for both chloroquine- and histamine-induced
      itch and that TRPV1 has a role in chloroquine-induced itch. Chloroquine-induced
      scratching was reduced in mice in which TRPV1 was knocked down or
      pharmacologically inhibited. Both TRPV4 and TRPV1 were present in some sensory
      neurons. Pharmacological blockade of either TRPV4 or TRPV1 significantly
      attenuated the Ca(2+) response of sensory neurons exposed to histamine or
      chloroquine. Knockout of Trpv1 impaired Ca(2+) responses and reduced scratching
      behavior evoked by a TRPV4 agonist, whereas knockout of Trpv4 did not alter
      TRPV1-mediated capsaicin responses. Electrophysiological analysis of human
      embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells coexpressing TRPV4 and TRPV1 revealed that the
      presence of both channels enhanced the activation kinetics of TRPV4 but not of
      TRPV1. Biochemical and biophysical studies suggested a close proximity between
      TRPV4 and TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons and in cultured cells. Thus, our 
      studies identified TRPV4 as a channel that contributes to both histamine- and
      chloroquine-induced itch and indicated that the function of TRPV4 in itch
      signaling involves TRPV1-mediated facilitation. TRP facilitation through the
      formation of heteromeric complexes could be a prevalent mechanism by which the
      vast array of somatosensory information is encoded in sensory neurons.

TI  - Conservation of protein abundance patterns reveals the regulatory architecture of
      the EGFR-MAPK pathway.
PG  - rs6
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf0891 [doi]
AB  - Various genetic mutations associated with cancer are known to alter cell
      signaling, but it is not clear whether they dysregulate signaling pathways by
      altering the abundance of pathway proteins. Using a combination of RNA sequencing
      and ultrasensitive targeted proteomics, we defined the primary components-16 core
      proteins and 10 feedback regulators-of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in normal human mammary
      epithelial cells and then quantified their absolute abundance across a panel of
      normal and breast cancer cell lines as well as fibroblasts. We found that core
      pathway proteins were present at very similar concentrations across all cell
      types, with a variance similar to that of proteins previously shown to display
      conserved abundances across species. In contrast, EGFR and transcriptionally
      controlled feedback regulators were present at highly variable concentrations.
      The absolute abundance of most core proteins was between 50,000 and 70,000 copies
      per cell, but the adaptors SOS1, SOS2, and GAB1 were found at far lower amounts
      (2000 to 5000 copies per cell). MAPK signaling showed saturation in all cells
      between 3000 and 10,000 occupied EGFRs, consistent with the idea that adaptors
      limit signaling. Our results suggest that the relative stoichiometry of core MAPK
      pathway proteins is very similar across different cell types, with cell-specific 
      differences mostly restricted to variable amounts of feedback regulators and
      receptors. The low abundance of adaptors relative to EGFR could be responsible
      for previous observations that only a fraction of total cell surface EGFR is
      capable of rapid endocytosis, high-affinity binding, and mitogenic signaling.

      the TLR3 and TLR7 pathways.
PG  - ra70
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac9340 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns
      (PAMPs) and stimulate the innate immune response through the production of
      cytokines. The innate immune response depends on the timing of encountering
      PAMPs, suggesting a short-term "memory." In particular, activation of TLR3
      appears to prime macrophages for the subsequent activation of TLR7, which leads
      to synergistically increased production of cytokines. By developing a calibrated 
      mathematical model for the kinetics of TLR3 and TLR7 pathway crosstalk and
      providing experimental validation, we demonstrated the involvement of the
      Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (STAT) pathway in controlling the synergistic production of cytokines. Signaling 
      through this pathway played a dual role: It mediated the synergistic production
      of cytokines, thus boosting the immune response, and it also maintained
      homeostasis to avoid an excessive inflammatory response. Thus, we propose that
      the JAK-STAT pathway provides a cytokine rheostat mechanism, which enables
      macrophages to fine-tune their responses to multiple, temporally separated
      infection events involving the TLR3 and TLR7 pathways.

TI  - Bimolecular complementation affinity purification (BiCAP) reveals dimer-specific 
      protein interactions for ERBB2 dimers.
PG  - ra69
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf0793 [doi]
AB  - The dynamic assembly of multiprotein complexes is a central mechanism of many
      cell signaling pathways. This process is key to maintaining the spatiotemporal
      specificity required for an accurate, yet adaptive, response to rapidly changing 
      cellular conditions. We describe a technique for the specific isolation and
      downstream proteomic characterization of any two interacting proteins, to the
      exclusion of their individual moieties and competing binding partners. We termed 
      the approach bimolecular complementation affinity purification (BiCAP) because it
      combines the use of conformation-specific nanobodies with a protein-fragment
      complementation assay with affinity purification. Using BiCAP, we characterized
      the specific interactome of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family
      member ERBB2 when in the form of a homodimer or when in the form of a heterodimer
      with either EGFR or ERBB3. We identified dimer-specific interaction patterns for 
      key adaptor proteins and identified a number of previously unknown interacting
      partners. Functional analysis for one of these newly identified partners revealed
      a noncanonical mechanism of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
      activation that is specific to the ERBB2:ERBB3 heterodimer and acts through the
      adaptor protein FAM59A in breast cancer cells.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 12 July 2016: Adaptor proteins limit signaling.
PG  - c16
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aah4492 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Steven Wiley, senior author of a Research
      Article that appears in the 12 July 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about how
      the abundance of adaptor proteins and feedback regulators affect the flow of
      information downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
      Information flows through a signaling pathway by sequential interactions between 
      core components of the pathway, many of which have enzymatic activity. Adaptor
      proteins do not directly participate in relaying the signal and do not have
      enzymatic activity, but are important for signaling because they facilitate
      interactions between the core components. Using quantitative methods, Shi et al
      demonstrated that core components of the EGFR pathway were highly abundant in
      both normal cells and cancer cells. However, adaptor proteins were present in
      much lower abundance in both cell types, indicating that it is the abundance of
      these proteins that limit signaling downstream of EGFR. The authors also found
      that differences in EGFR signaling between different cell types likely resulted
      from the variable abundance of feedback regulators.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Mapping the subcellular mechanical properties of live cells in tissues with
      fluorescence emission-Brillouin imaging.
PG  - rs5
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6326 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular matrices (ECMs) are central to the advent of multicellular life,
      and their mechanical properties are modulated by and impinge on intracellular
      signaling pathways that regulate vital cellular functions. High
      spatial-resolution mapping of mechanical properties in live cells is, however,
      extremely challenging. Thus, our understanding of how signaling pathways process 
      physiological signals to generate appropriate mechanical responses is limited. We
      introduce fluorescence emission-Brillouin scattering imaging (FBi), a method for 
      the parallel and all-optical measurements of mechanical properties and
      fluorescence at the submicrometer scale in living organisms. Using FBi, we showed
      that changes in cellular hydrostatic pressure and cytoplasm viscoelasticity
      modulate the mechanical signatures of plant ECMs. We further established that the
      measured "stiffness" of plant ECMs is symmetrically patterned in hypocotyl cells 
      undergoing directional growth. Finally, application of this method to Arabidopsis
      thaliana with photoreceptor mutants revealed that red and far-red light signals
      are essential modulators of ECM viscoelasticity. By mapping the viscoelastic
      signatures of a complex ECM, we provide proof of principle for the organism-wide 
      applicability of FBi for measuring the mechanical outputs of intracellular
      signaling pathways. As such, our work has implications for investigations of
      mechanosignaling pathways and developmental biology.

TI  - An RYR1 mutation associated with malignant hyperthermia is also associated with
      bleeding abnormalities.
PG  - ra68
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad9813 [doi]
AB  - Malignant hyperthermia is a potentially fatal hypermetabolic disorder triggered
      by halogenated anesthetics and the myorelaxant succinylcholine in genetically
      predisposed individuals. About 50% of susceptible individuals carry dominant,
      gain-of-function mutations in RYR1 [which encodes ryanodine receptor type 1
      (RyR1)], though they have normal muscle function and no overt clinical symptoms. 
      RyR1 is predominantly found in skeletal muscle but also at lower amounts in
      immune and smooth muscle cells, suggesting that RYR1 mutations may have a wider
      range of effects than previously suspected. Mild bleeding abnormalities have been
      described in patients with malignant hyperthermia carrying gain-of-function RYR1 
      mutations. We sought to determine the frequency and molecular basis for this
      symptom. We found that some patients with specific RYR1 mutations had abnormally 
      high bleeding scores, whereas their healthy relatives did not. Knock-in mice with
      the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility RYR1 mutation Y522S (MHS RYR1Y522S) had
      longer bleeding times than their wild-type littermates. Primary vascular smooth
      muscle cells from RYR1Y522S knock-in mice exhibited a higher frequency of
      subplasmalemmal Ca(2+) sparks, leading to a more negative resting membrane
      potential. The bleeding defect of RYR1Y522S mice and of one patient was reversed 
      by treatment with the RYR1 antagonist dantrolene, and Ca(2+) sparks in primary
      vascular smooth muscle cells from the MHS RYR1Y522S mice were blocked by
      ryanodine or dantrolene. Thus, RYR1 mutations may lead to prolonged bleeding by
      altering vascular smooth muscle cell function. The reversibility of the bleeding 
      phenotype emphasizes the potential therapeutic value of dantrolene in the
      treatment of such bleeding disorders.

      entry into excitable cells. Cav channels contain a pore-forming alpha1 subunit,
      an auxiliary alpha2delta subunit, and a regulatory beta subunit, each encoded by 
      several genes in mammals. In addition to a domain that interacts with the alpha1 
      subunit, beta2e and beta2a also interact with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma 
      membrane through an electrostatic interaction for beta2e and posttranslational
      acylation for beta2a. We found that an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) promoted the 
      release of beta2e from the membrane without requiring substantial depletion of
      the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from the
      plasma membrane. Experiments with liposomes indicated that Ca(2+) disrupted the
      interaction of the beta2e amino-terminal peptide with membranes containing PIP2
      Ca(2+) binding to calmodulin (CaM) leads to CaM-mediated inactivation of Cav
      currents. Although Cav2.2 coexpressed with beta2a required Ca(2+)-dependent
      activation of CaM for Ca(2+)-mediated reduction in channel activity, Cav2.2
      coexpressed with beta2e exhibited Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of the channel
      even in the presence of Ca(2+)-insensitive CaM. Inducible depletion of PIP2
      reduced Cav2.2 currents, and in cells coexpressing beta2e, but not a form that
      lacks the polybasic region, increased intracellular Ca(2+) further reduced Cav2.2
      currents. Many hormone- or neurotransmitter-activated receptors stimulate PIP2
      hydrolysis and increase cytosolic Ca(2+); thus, our findings suggest that beta2e 
      may integrate such receptor-mediated signals to limit Cav activity.

      activation.
PG  - ra66
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad6275 [doi]
AB  - The adaptor molecule Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kD (CIN85) regulates signaling
      from a number of cell surface receptors, such as growth factor receptors and
      antigen receptors on lymphocytes. Because of its multidomain structure, CIN85 is 
      thought to act as a classical adaptor protein that connects functionally distinct
      components of a given signaling pathway through diverse protein domains. However,
      we found that in B lymphocytes, CIN85 functions to oligomerize SLP-65, which is
      the central effector protein of the B cell receptor (BCR). Therefore, CIN85
      trimerizes through a carboxyl-terminal, coiled-coil domain. The multiple Src
      homology 3 (SH3) domains of trimeric CIN85 molecules associated with multiple
      SLP-65 molecules, which recruited further CIN85 trimers, thereby perpetuating the
      oligomerization process. Formation of this oligomeric signaling complex in
      resting B cells rendered the cells poised for the efficient initiation of
      intracellular signaling upon BCR stimulation. Our data suggest that the
      functionality of signaling cascades does not rely solely on the qualitative
      linkage of their various components but requires a critical number of effectors
      to become concentrated in signaling complexes.

TI  - The ER structural protein Rtn4A stabilizes and enhances signaling through the
      receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB3.
PG  - ra65
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf1604 [doi]
AB  - ErbB3 and ErbB4 are receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by the
      neuregulin (NRG) family of growth factors. These receptors govern various
      developmental processes, and their dysregulation contributes to several human
      disease states. The abundance of ErbB3 and ErbB4, and thus signaling through
      these receptors, is limited by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1, which targets ErbB3
      and ErbB4 for degradation. Reticulons are proteins that influence the morphology 
      of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by promoting the formation of tubules, a
      response of cells to some stressors. We found that the ER structural protein
      reticulon 4A (Rtn4A, also known as Nogo-A) increased ErbB3 abundance and
      proliferative signaling by suppressing Nrdp1 function. Rtn4A interacted with
      Nrdp1 and stabilized ErbB3 in an Nrdp1-dependent manner. Rtn4A overexpression
      induced the redistribution of Nrdp1 from a cytosolic or perinuclear localization 
      to ER tubules. Rtn4A knockdown in human breast tumor cells decreased ErbB3
      abundance, NRG-stimulated signaling, and cellular proliferation and migration.
      Because proteins destined for the plasma membrane are primarily synthesized in
      the sheet portions of the ER, our observations suggest that Rtn4A counteracts the
      Nrdp1-mediated degradation of ErbB3 by sequestering the ubiquitin ligase into ER 
      tubules. The involvement of a reticulon suggests a molecular link between ER
      structure and the sensitivity of cells to receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated
      survival signals at the cell surface.

      1-phosphate promotes lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastasis.
PG  - ra64
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf3241 [doi]
AB  - Tumor cell-derived factors skew macrophages toward a tumor-supporting phenotype
      associated with the secretion of protumorigenic mediators. Apoptosing tumor cells
      release sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which stimulates the production of
      lipocalin 2 (LCN2) in tumor-associated macrophages and is associated with tumor
      metastasis. We explored the mechanism by which S1P induces LCN2 in macrophages
      and investigated how this contributed to tumor growth and metastasis. Knockdown
      of S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) in primary human macrophages and experiments with bone 
      marrow-derived macrophages from S1PR1-deficient mice showed that S1P signaled
      through S1PR1 to induce LCN2 expression. The LCN2 promoter contains a consensus
      sequence for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and
      deletion of the STAT3 recognition sequence reduced expression of an
      LCN2-controlled reporter gene. Conditioned medium from coculture experiments
      indicated that the release of LCN2 from macrophages induced tube formation and
      proliferation in cultures of primary human lymphatic endothelial cells in a
      manner dependent on the kinase PI3K and subsequent induction of the growth factor
      VEGFC, which functioned as an autocrine signal stimulating the receptor VEGFR3.
      Knockout of Lcn2 attenuated tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis and breast tumor
      metastasis both in the breast cancer model MMTV-PyMT mice and in mice bearing
      orthotopic wild-type tumors. Our findings indicate that macrophages respond to
      dying tumor cells by producing signals that promote lymphangiogenesis, which
      enables metastasis.

AB  - The tumor microenvironment is involved in many activities that promote tumor cell
      growth, local spreading, and metastasis. In this issue of Science Signaling, Jung
      et al found that lymphangiogenesis may result from the cooperation of two
      molecules, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lipocalin 2 (LCN2), produced by
      tumor cells and macrophages, respectively. The new S1P-LCN2 axis stresses the
      importance of innate immunity in remodeling the tumor microenvironment and in
      lymphangiogenesis.

TI  - The adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate 2 inhibits alternative macrophage 
      activation and allergic lung inflammation.
PG  - ra63
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad6724 [doi]
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is an adaptor protein that becomes
      tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to the cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
      IL-13, which results in activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt
      pathway. IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to allergic lung inflammation. To examine the 
      role of IRS2 in allergic disease, we evaluated the responses of IRS2-deficient
      (IRS2(-/-)) mice. Unexpectedly, loss of IRS2 resulted in a substantial increase
      in the expression of a subset of genes associated with the generation of
      alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) in response to IL-4 or IL-13 in vitro.
      AAMs secrete factors that enhance allergic responses and promote airway
      remodeling. Moreover, compared to IRS2(+/+) mice, IRS2(+/-) and IRS2(-/-) mice
      developed enhanced pulmonary inflammation, accumulated eosinophils and AAMs, and 
      exhibited airway and vascular remodeling upon allergen stimulation, responses
      that partially depended on macrophage-intrinsic IRS2 signaling. Both in
      unstimulated and IL-4-stimulated macrophages, lack of IRS2 enhanced
      phosphorylation of Akt and ribosomal S6 protein. Thus, we identified a critical
      inhibitory loop downstream of IRS2, demonstrating an unanticipated and previously
      unrecognized role for IRS2 in suppressing allergic lung inflammation and
      remodeling.

TI  - MET signaling in keratinocytes activates EGFR and initiates squamous
      carcinogenesis.
PG  - ra62
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf5106 [doi]
AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is abundant in many human squamous cell
      carcinomas (SCCs), but its functional significance in tumorigenesis is not clear.
      We found that the incidence of carcinogen-induced skin squamous tumors was
      substantially increased in transgenic MT-HGF (mouse metallothionein-hepatocyte
      growth factor) mice, which have increased abundance of the MET ligand HGF.
      Squamous tumors also erupted spontaneously on the skin of MT-HGF mice that were
      promoted by wounding or the application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, 
      an activator of protein kinase C. Carcinogen-initiated tumors had Ras mutations, 
      but spontaneous tumors did not. Cultured keratinocytes from MT-HGF mice and
      oncogenic RAS-transduced keratinocytes shared phenotypic and biochemical features
      of initiation that were dependent on autocrine activation of epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) through increased synthesis and release of EGFR ligands,
      which was mediated by the kinase SRC, the pseudoproteases iRhom1 and iRhom2, and 
      the metallopeptidase ADAM17. Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR caused the
      regression of MT-HGF squamous tumors that developed spontaneously in orthografts 
      of MT-HGF keratinocytes combined with dermal fibroblasts and implanted onto
      syngeneic mice. The global gene expression profile in MET-transformed
      keratinocytes was highly concordant with that in RAS-transformed keratinocytes,
      and a core RAS/MET coexpression network was activated in precancerous and
      cancerous human skin lesions. Tissue arrays revealed that many human skin SCCs
      have abundant HGF at both the transcript and protein levels. Thus, through the
      activation of EGFR, MET activation parallels a RAS pathway to contribute to human
      and mouse cutaneous cancers.

TI  - Tolerogenic nanoparticles inhibit T cell-mediated autoimmunity through SOCS2.
PG  - ra61
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0612 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-dependent autoimmune disease that is
      characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
      The administration to patients of ex vivo-differentiated FoxP3(+) regulatory T
      (Treg) cells or tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) that promote Treg cell
      differentiation is considered a potential therapy for T1D; however, cell-based
      therapies cannot be easily translated into clinical practice. We engineered
      nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver both a tolerogenic molecule, the aryl hydrocarbon 
      receptor (AhR) ligand 2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid
      methyl ester (ITE), and the beta cell antigen proinsulin (NPITE+Ins) to induce a 
      tolerogenic phenotype in DCs and promote Treg cell generation in vivo. NPITE+Ins 
      administration to 8-week-old nonobese diabetic mice suppressed autoimmune
      diabetes. NPITE+Ins induced a tolerogenic phenotype in DCs, which was
      characterized by a decreased ability to activate inflammatory effector T cells
      and was concomitant with the increased differentiation of FoxP3(+) Treg cells.
      The induction of a tolerogenic phenotype in DCs by NPs was mediated by the
      AhR-dependent induction of Socs2, which resulted in inhibition of nuclear factor 
      kappaB activation and proinflammatory cytokine production (properties of
      tolerogenic DCs). Together, these data suggest that NPs constitute a potential
      tool to reestablish tolerance in T1D and potentially other autoimmune disorders.

AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Francisco Quintana, senior author of a
      Research Article that appears in the 21 June 2016 issue of Science Signaling,
      about a nanoparticle-based potential treatment strategy for type 1 diabetes
      (T1D). T1D is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the
      insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. Strategies that induce immune
      tolerance to pancreatic beta cells would be effective treatments for T1D. Yeste
      et al coated gold nanoparticles with a molecule that induces immune tolerance and
      a beta cell antigen that is commonly targeted by autoimmune T cells in T1D. When 
      administered to mice that are genetically predisposed to spontaneously develop
      T1D, the nanoparticles suppressed the development of disease, reduced the
      activity of autoimmune T cells, and promoted the activity of regulatory T cells
      that suppress the autoimmune response. In addition to being translated into the
      clinic for treating T1D, this strategy could be adapted to restore immune
      tolerance in other diseases of autoimmunity by replacing the beta cell antigen
      with other self-antigens.Listen to Podcast.

AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Stuart Yuspa, senior author of a Research
      Article that appears in the 21 June 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about how
      activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET stimulates the formation of
      squamous cell carcinoma in the skin. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is produced
      by mesenchymal cells and stimulates MET, which is present on the surface of
      epithelial cells. HGF-MET signaling directs the proliferation and migration of
      epithelial cells during the development of various organs and is important during
      wound healing. Aberrant MET activation has been implicated in several types of
      cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma. Using a model in which mice
      overexpressing HGF develop spontaneous squamous cell carcinomas in the skin,
      Cataisson et al found that MET promoted the development of squamous tumors by
      stimulating the synthesis and release of ligands that activate the epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR). This mechanism was similar to that through which
      oncogenic RAS promotes skin tumors. Blocking EGFR signaling caused HGF-induced
      squamous tumors to regress, suggesting that EGFR inhibitors might be useful for
      treating squamous cell carcinomas.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Proximity biotinylation provides insight into the molecular composition of focal 
      adhesions at the nanometer scale.
PG  - rs4
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf3572 [doi]
AB  - Focal adhesions are protein complexes that link metazoan cells to the
      extracellular matrix through the integrin family of transmembrane proteins.
      Integrins recruit many proteins to these complexes, referred to as the
      "adhesome." We used proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) in U2OS
      osteosarcoma cells to label proteins within 15 to 25 nm of paxillin, a
      cytoplasmic focal adhesion protein, and kindlin-2, which directly binds beta
      integrins. Using mass spectrometry analysis of the biotinylated proteins, we
      identified 27 known adhesome proteins and 8 previously unknown components close
      to paxillin. However, only seven of these proteins interacted directly with
      paxillin, one of which was the adaptor protein Kank2. The proteins in proximity
      to beta integrin included 15 of the adhesion proteins identified in the paxillin 
      BioID data set. BioID also correctly established kindlin-2 as a cell-cell
      junction protein. By focusing on this smaller data set, new partners for
      kindlin-2 were found, namely, the endocytosis-promoting proteins liprin beta1 and
      EFR3A, but, contrary to previous reports, not the filamin-binding protein
      migfilin. A model adhesome based on both data sets suggests that focal adhesions 
      contain fewer components than previously suspected and that paxillin lies away
      from the plasma membrane. These data not only illustrate the power of using BioID
      and stable isotope-labeled mass spectrometry to define macromolecular complexes
      but also enable the correct identification of therapeutic targets within the
      adhesome.

TI  - Avoiding common pitfalls when clustering biological data.
PG  - re6
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad1932 [doi]
AB  - Clustering is an unsupervised learning method, which groups data points based on 
      similarity, and is used to reveal the underlying structure of data. This
      computational approach is essential to understanding and visualizing the complex 
      data that are acquired in high-throughput multidimensional biological
      experiments. Clustering enables researchers to make biological inferences for
      further experiments. Although a powerful technique, inappropriate application can
      lead biological researchers to waste resources and time in experimental
      follow-up. We review common pitfalls identified from the published molecular
      biology literature and present methods to avoid them. Commonly encountered
      pitfalls relate to the high-dimensional nature of biological data from
      high-throughput experiments, the failure to consider more than one clustering
      method for a given problem, and the difficulty in determining whether clustering 
      has produced meaningful results. We present concrete examples of problems and
      solutions (clustering results) in the form of toy problems and real biological
      data for these issues. We also discuss ensemble clustering as an
      easy-to-implement method that enables the exploration of multiple clustering
      solutions and improves robustness of clustering solutions. Increased awareness of
      common clustering pitfalls will help researchers avoid overinterpreting or
      misinterpreting the results and missing valuable insights when clustering
      biological data.

TI  - A switch in G protein coupling for type 1 corticotropin-releasing factor
      receptors promotes excitability in epileptic brains.
PG  - ra60
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad8676 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety and stress increase the frequency of epileptic seizures. These behavioral
      states induce the secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a 40-amino
      acid neuropeptide neurotransmitter that coordinates many behavioral responses to 
      stress in the central nervous system. In the piriform cortex, which is one of the
      most seizurogenic regions of the brain, CRF normally dampens excitability. By
      contrast, CRF increased the excitability of the piriform cortex in rats subjected
      to kindling, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In nonkindled rats, CRF activates
      its receptor, a G protein (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate-binding
      protein)-coupled receptor, and signals through a Galphaq/11-mediated pathway.
      After seizure induction, CRF signaling occurred through a pathway involving
      Galphas This change in signaling was associated with reduced abundance of
      regulator of G protein signaling protein type 2 (RGS2), which has been reported
      to inhibit Galphas-dependent signaling. RGS2 knockout mice responded to CRF in a 
      similar manner as epileptic rats. These observations indicate that seizures
      produce changes in neuronal signaling that can increase seizure occurrence by
      converting a beneficial stress response into an epileptic trigger.

TI  - Sestrin regulation of TORC1: Is Sestrin a leucine sensor?
PG  - re5
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf2885 [doi]
AB  - Sestrins are highly conserved, stress-inducible proteins that inhibit target of
      rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling. After their transcriptional induction,
      both vertebrate and invertebrate Sestrins turn on the adenosine monophosphate
      (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which activates the tuberous sclerosis
      complex (TSC), a key inhibitor of TORC1 activation. However, Sestrin
      overexpression, on occasion, can result in TORC1 inhibition even in
      AMPK-deficient cells. This effect has been attributed to Sestrin's ability to
      bind the TORC1-regulating GATOR2 protein complex, which was postulated to control
      trafficking of TORC1 to lysosomes. How the binding of Sestrins to GATOR2 is
      regulated and how it contributes to TORC1 inhibition are unknown. New findings
      suggest that the amino acid leucine specifically disrupts the association of
      Sestrin2 with GATOR2, thus explaining how leucine and related amino acids
      stimulate TORC1 activity. We discuss whether and how these findings fit what has 
      already been learned about Sestrin-mediated TORC1 inhibition from genetic studies
      conducted in fruit flies and mammals.

TI  - TNF-insulin crosstalk at the transcription factor GATA6 is revealed by a model
      that links signaling and transcriptomic data tensors.
PG  - ra59
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad3373 [doi]
AB  - Signal transduction networks coordinate transcriptional programs activated by
      diverse extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors and cytokines. Cells
      receive multiple stimuli simultaneously, and mapping how activation of the
      integrated signaling network affects gene expression is a challenge. We
      stimulated colon adenocarcinoma cells with various combinations of the cytokine
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the growth factors insulin and epidermal growth
      factor (EGF) to investigate signal integration and transcriptional crosstalk. We 
      quantitatively linked the proteomic and transcriptomic data sets by implementing 
      a structured computational approach called tensor partial least squares
      regression. This statistical model accurately predicted transcriptional
      signatures from signaling arising from single and combined stimuli and also
      predicted time-dependent contributions of signaling events. Specifically, the
      model predicted that an early-phase, AKT-associated signal downstream of insulin 
      repressed a set of transcripts induced by TNF. Through bioinformatics and
      cell-based experiments, we identified the AKT-repressed signal as glycogen
      synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser(37) on the long form of
      the transcription factor GATA6. Phosphorylation of GATA6 on Ser(37) promoted its 
      degradation, thereby preventing GATA6 from repressing transcripts that are
      induced by TNF and attenuated by insulin. Our analysis showed that predictive
      tensor modeling of proteomic and transcriptomic data sets can uncover pathway
      crosstalk that produces specific patterns of gene expression in cells receiving
      multiple stimuli.

TI  - Augmented noncanonical BMP type II receptor signaling mediates the synaptic
      abnormality of fragile X syndrome.
PG  - ra58
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6060 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic silencing of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) causes fragile X
      syndrome (FXS), a common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism.
      FXS correlates with abnormal synapse and dendritic spine development, but the
      molecular link between the absence of the FMR1 product FMRP, an RNA binding
      protein, and the neuropathology is unclear. We found that the messenger RNA
      encoding bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2) is a target of FMRP.
      Depletion of FMRP increased BMPR2 abundance, especially that of the full-length
      isoform that bound and activated LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), a component of the 
      noncanonical BMP signal transduction pathway that stimulates actin reorganization
      to promote neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Heterozygosity for BMPR2
      rescued the morphological abnormalities in neurons both in Drosophila and in
      mouse models of FXS, as did the postnatal pharmacological inhibition of LIMK1
      activity. Compared with postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue from healthy
      subjects, the amount of full-length BMPR2 and of a marker of LIMK1 activity was
      increased in this brain region from FXS patients. These findings suggest that
      increased BMPR2 signal transduction is linked to FXS and that the BMPR2-LIMK1
      pathway is a putative therapeutic target in patients with FXS and possibly other 
      forms of autism.

TI  - Science Signaling Podcast for 7 June 2016: Modeling signal integration.
PG  - pc13
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aag1902 [doi]
AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Kevin Janes, senior author of a Research 
      Article that appears in the 7 June 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about a
      statistical modeling method that can extract useful information from complex data
      sets. Cells exist in very complex environments. They are constantly exposed to
      growth factors, hormones, nutrients, and many other factors that influence
      cellular behavior. When cells integrate information from multiple stimuli, the
      resulting output does not necessarily reflect a simple additive effect of the
      responses to each individual stimulus. Chitforoushzadeh et al employed a
      statistical modeling approach that maintained the multidimensional nature of the 
      data to analyze the responses of colonic epithelial cells to various combinations
      of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, the growth factor EGF, and insulin. As the
      model predicted, experiments confirmed that insulin suppressed TNF-induced
      proinflammatory signaling through a mechanism that involved the transcription
      factor GATA6.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - BMP signaling turns up in fragile X syndrome: FMRP represses BMPR2.
PG  - fs12
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf9571 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability
      and results from a loss of function of the translational repressor FMRP. In this 
      issue of Science Signaling, Kashima et al find that FMRP binds to and represses a
      specific isoform of BMPR2, a type II bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor.
      Reducing signaling through this BMP pathway reverses neuroanatomical defects
      observed in fragile X models.

TI  - The 4E-BP-eIF4E axis promotes rapamycin-sensitive growth and proliferation in
      lymphocytes.
PG  - ra57
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad8463 [doi]
AB  - Rapamycin has been used as a clinical immunosuppressant for many years; however, 
      the molecular basis for its selective effects on lymphocytes remains unclear. We 
      investigated the role of two canonical effectors of the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR): ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
      (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs). S6Ks are thought to regulate cell growth
      (increase in cell size), and 4E-BPs are thought to control proliferation
      (increase in cell number), with mTORC1 signaling serving to integrate these
      processes. However, we found that the 4E-BP-eIF4E signaling axis controlled both 
      the growth and proliferation of lymphocytes, processes for which the S6Ks were
      dispensable. Furthermore, rapamycin disrupted eIF4E function selectively in
      lymphocytes, which was due to the increased abundance of 4E-BP2 relative to that 
      of 4E-BP1 in these cells and the greater sensitivity of 4E-BP2 to rapamycin.
      Together, our findings suggest that the 4E-BP-eIF4E axis is uniquely
      rapamycin-sensitive in lymphocytes and that this axis promotes clonal expansion
      of these cells by coordinating growth and proliferation.

TI  - Protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation stimulates the transcriptional
      activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1.
PG  - ra56
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf0583 [doi]
AB  - Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates the transcription of genes encoding 
      proteins that enable cells to adapt to reduced O2 availability. Proteins encoded 
      by HIF-1 target genes play a central role in mediating physiological processes
      that are dysregulated in cancer and heart disease. These diseases are also
      characterized by increased production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),
      the allosteric activator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Using
      glutathione S-transferase pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry
      analyses, we demonstrated that PKA interacts with HIF-1alpha in HeLa cervical
      carcinoma cells and rat cardiomyocytes. PKA phosphorylated Thr(63) and Ser(692)
      on HIF-1alpha in vitro and enhanced HIF transcriptional activity and target gene 
      expression in HeLa cells and rat cardiomyocytes. PKA inhibited the proteasomal
      degradation of HIF-1alpha in an O2-independent manner that required the
      phosphorylation of Thr(63) and Ser(692) and was not affected by prolyl
      hydroxylation. PKA also stimulated the binding of the coactivator p300 to
      HIF-1alpha to enhance its transcriptional activity and counteracted the
      inhibitory effect of asparaginyl hydroxylation on the association of p300 with
      HIF-1alpha. Furthermore, increased cAMP concentrations enhanced the expression of
      HIF target genes encoding CD39 and CD73, which are enzymes that convert
      extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate to adenosine, a molecule that enhances
      tumor immunosuppression and reduces heart rate and contractility. These data link
      stimuli that promote cAMP signaling, HIF-1alpha-dependent changes in gene
      expression, and increased adenosine, all of which contribute to the
      pathophysiology of cancer and heart disease.

TI  - Identification of a small-molecule ligand that activates the neuropeptide
      receptor GPR171 and increases food intake.
PG  - ra55
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac8035 [doi]
AB  - Several neuropeptide systems in the hypothalamus, including neuropeptide Y and
      agouti-related protein (AgRP), control food intake. Peptides derived from
      proSAAS, a precursor implicated in the regulation of body weight, also control
      food intake. GPR171 is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G
      protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) for BigLEN (b-LEN), a peptide derived from
      proSAAS. To facilitate studies exploring the physiological role of GPR171, we
      sought to identify small-molecule ligands for this receptor by performing a
      virtual screen of a compound library for interaction with a homology model of
      GPR171. We identified MS0015203 as an agonist of GPR171 and demonstrated the
      selectivity of MS0015203 for GPR171 by testing the binding of this compound to 80
      other membrane proteins, including family A GPCRs. Reducing the expression of
      GPR171 by shRNA (short hairpin RNA)-mediated knockdown blunted the cellular and
      tissue response to MS0015203. Peripheral injection of MS0015203 into mice
      increased food intake and body weight, and these responses were significantly
      attenuated in mice with decreased expression of GPR171 in the hypothalamus.
      Together, these results suggest that MS0015203 is a useful tool to probe the
      pharmacological and functional properties of GPR171 and that ligands targeting
      GPR171 may eventually lead to therapeutics for food-related disorders.

      rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of T and B lymphocyte growth and proliferation.
      In this issue of Science Signaling, So et al found that the isoform of 4E-BP
      (4E-BP2) in lymphocytes that regulates messenger RNA translation is more
      sensitive to the effects of rapamycin than is the 4E-BP isoform found in
      nonlymphoid cells. Furthermore, inhibition of 4E-BP2 blocks both the growth and
      proliferation of lymphocytes.

TI  - Dephosphorylation of the adaptor LAT and phospholipase C-gamma by SHP-1 inhibits 
      natural killer cell cytotoxicity.
PG  - ra54
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad6182 [doi]
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells discriminate between healthy cells and virally infected
      or transformed self-cells by tuning activating and inhibitory signals received
      through cell surface receptors. Inhibitory receptors inhibit NK cell function by 
      recruiting and activating the tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 (SH2)
      domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) to the plasma membrane. 
      However, to date, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV1 is the only direct 
      SHP-1 substrate identified in NK cells. We reveal that the adaptor protein linker
      for activation of T cells (LAT) as well as phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1)
      and PLC-gamma2 are SHP-1 substrates. Dephosphorylation of Tyr(132) in LAT by
      SHP-1 in NK cells abrogated the recruitment of PLC-gamma1 and PLC-gamma2 to the
      immunological synapse between the NK cell and a cancer cell target, which reduced
      NK cell degranulation and target cell killing. Furthermore, the ubiquitylation of
      LAT by the E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b, which was induced by LAT
      phosphorylation, led to the degradation of LAT in response to the engagement of
      inhibitory receptors on NK cells, which abrogated NK cell cytotoxicity. Knockdown
      of the Cbl proteins blocked LAT ubiquitylation, which promoted NK cell function. 
      Expression of a ubiquitylation-resistant mutant LAT blocked inhibitory receptor
      signaling, enabling cells to become activated. Together, these data identify
      previously uncharacterized SHP-1 substrates and inhibitory mechanisms that
      determine the response of NK cells.

TI  - Design of pathway preferential estrogens that provide beneficial metabolic and
      vascular effects without stimulating reproductive tissues.
PG  - ra53
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad8170 [doi]
AB  - There is great medical need for estrogens with favorable pharmacological profiles
      that support desirable activities for menopausal women, such as metabolic and
      vascular protection, but that lack stimulatory activities on the breast and
      uterus. We report the development of structurally novel estrogens that
      preferentially activate a subset of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways and
      result in favorable target tissue-selective activity. Through a process of
      structural alteration of estrogenic ligands that was designed to preserve their
      essential chemical and physical features but greatly reduced their binding
      affinity for ERs, we obtained "pathway preferential estrogens" (PaPEs), which
      interacted with ERs to activate the extranuclear-initiated signaling pathway
      preferentially over the nuclear-initiated pathway. PaPEs elicited a pattern of
      gene regulation and cellular and biological processes that did not stimulate
      reproductive and mammary tissues or breast cancer cells. However, in
      ovariectomized mice, PaPEs triggered beneficial responses both in metabolic
      tissues (adipose tissue and liver) that reduced body weight gain and fat
      accumulation and in the vasculature that accelerated repair of endothelial
      damage. This process of designed ligand structure alteration represents a novel
      approach to develop ligands that shift the balance in ER-mediated extranuclear
      and nuclear pathways to obtain tissue-selective, non-nuclear PaPEs, which may be 
      beneficial for postmenopausal hormone replacement. The approach may also have
      broad applicability for other members of the nuclear hormone receptor
      superfamily.

TI  - Platelets contribute to amyloid-beta aggregation in cerebral vessels through
      integrin alphaIIbbeta3-induced outside-in signaling and clusterin release.
PG  - ra52
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6240 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a vascular dysfunction disorder
      characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the walls of cerebral
      vessels. CAA and Abeta deposition in the brain parenchyma contribute to dementia 
      and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the contribution of platelets,
      which accumulate at vascular Abeta deposits, to CAA. We found that synthetic
      monomeric Abeta40 bound through its RHDS (Arg-His-Asp-Ser) sequence to integrin
      alphaIIbbeta3, which is the receptor for the extracellular matrix protein
      fibrinogen, and stimulated the secretion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the
      chaperone protein clusterin from platelets. Clusterin promoted the formation of
      fibrillar Abeta aggregates, and ADP acted through its receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 on
      platelets to enhance integrin alphaIIbbeta3 activation, further increasing the
      secretion of clusterin and Abeta40 binding to platelets. Platelets from patients 
      with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a bleeding disorder in which platelets have
      little or dysfunctional alphaIIbbeta3, indicated that the abundance of this
      integrin dictated Abeta-induced clusterin release and platelet-induced Abeta
      aggregation. The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel, which irreversibly inhibits
      P2Y12, inhibited Abeta aggregation in platelet cultures; in transgenic AD model
      mice, this drug reduced the amount of clusterin in the circulation and the
      incidence of CAA. Our findings indicate that activated platelets directly
      contribute to CAA by promoting the formation of Abeta aggregates and that Abeta, 
      in turn, activates platelets, creating a feed-forward loop. Thus, antiplatelet
      therapy may alleviate fibril formation in cerebral vessels of AD patients.

AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Zeynep Madak-Erdogan, Benita
      Katzenellenbogen, and John Katzenellenbogen, authors of a Research Article that
      appears in the 24 May 2016 issue of Science Signaling, about designer estrogens
      that have the therapeutic benefits of natural estrogens, but less cancer risk. In
      addition to controlling female reproduction and secondary sex characteristics,
      estrogen is also an important regulator of metabolism, the vasculature, and bone.
      Estrogen production decreases as women enter menopause, leading to changes in
      metabolism, a reduced ability to repair blood vessels, and decreased bone
      density. Although hormone replacement therapy can alleviate these symptoms, it
      can also promote the growth of uterine and breast cancers. Madak-Erdogan et al
      engineered synthetic forms of estrogen that activate the cytosolic signaling
      pathways that are associated with the beneficial effects of this hormone without 
      also activating the nuclear signaling events associated with cancer growth.Listen
      to Podcast.

AB  - In this issue of Science Signaling, Donner et al define a highly interesting role
      for platelets in mediating the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via a
      mechanism linked to integrin alphaIIbbeta3 outside-in signaling and adenosine

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that have adopted activating 
      and inhibitory signaling mechanisms enabling them to be tolerant of normal cells 
      but to distinguish and eliminate tumor cells and virus-infected cells. In this
      issue of Science Signaling, Matalon et al show how inhibitory receptors disrupt
      NK cell activation by stimulating dephosphorylation of the adaptor protein LAT
      (linker of activated T cells) and phospholipase C-gamma by the phosphatase SHP-1 
      [Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1], as well 
      as ubiquitylation of LAT by Cbl family E3 ubiquitin ligases.

TI  - Following the trail of lipids: Signals initiated by PI3K function at multiple
      cellular membranes.
PG  - re4
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad7885 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] is the signaling
      currency of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway; transduction
      through this axis depends on this signaling lipid. Formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3
      is dictated not only by PI3K activation but also by the localization and access
      of PI3K to its substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate).
      PI3K/AKT-mediated signaling is antagonized by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dephosphorylation. 
      Although previously typically considered an event associated with the plasma
      membrane, it is now appreciated that the formation and metabolism of
      PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 occur on multiple membranes with distinct kinetics. Modulated
      activity of phosphatidylinositol lipid kinases and phosphatases contributes to
      intricately orchestrated lipid gradients that define the signaling status of the 
      pathway at multiple sites within the cell.

TI  - Themis1 enhances T cell receptor signaling during thymocyte development by
      promoting Vav1 activity and Grb2 stability.
PG  - ra51
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad1576 [doi]
AB  - The T cell signaling protein Themis1 is essential for the positive and negative
      selection of thymocytes in the thymus. Although the developmental defect that
      results from the loss of Themis1 suggests that it enhances T cell receptor (TCR) 
      signaling, Themis1 also recruits Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1
      (SHP-1) to the vicinity of TCR signaling complexes, suggesting that it has an
      inhibitory role in TCR signaling. We used TCR signaling reporter mice and
      quantitative proteomics to explore the role of Themis1 in developing T cells. We 
      found that Themis1 acted mostly as a positive regulator of TCR signaling in vivo 
      when receptors were activated by positively selecting ligands. Proteomic analysis
      of the Themis1 interactome identified SHP-1, the TCR-associated adaptor protein
      Grb2, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 as the principal
      interacting partners of Themis1 in isolated mouse thymocytes. Analysis of TCR
      signaling in Themis1-deficient and Themis1-overexpressing mouse thymocytes
      demonstrated that Themis1 promoted Vav1 activity both in vitro and in vivo. The
      reduced activity of Vav1 and the impaired T cell development in Themis1(-/-) mice
      were due in part to increased degradation of Grb2, which suggests that Themis1 is
      required to maintain the steady-state abundance of Grb2 in thymocytes. Together, 
      these data suggest that Themis1 acts as a positive regulator of TCR signaling in 
      developing T cells, and identify a mechanism by which Themis1 regulates thymic
      selection.

TI  - BTG1 ameliorates liver steatosis by decreasing stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)
      abundance and altering hepatic lipid metabolism.
PG  - ra50
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad8581 [doi]
AB  - Liver steatosis, a condition in which lipid accumulates in liver cells, is a
      leading cause of many liver diseases. The livers of patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, a cancer characterized by liver steatosis, have decreased abundance of
      the transcription cofactor BTG1 (B cell translocation gene 1). We showed that the
      livers of db/db mice, which are a genetic model of obesity, had decreased BTG1
      mRNA and protein abundance. BTG1 overexpression ameliorated liver steatosis in
      db/db mice, whereas knockdown of BTG1 induced liver steatosis in wild-type mice. 
      Consistent with these changes, we found that BTG1 decreased triglyceride
      accumulation in cultured hepatocytes. BTG1 overexpression inhibited the
      expression of the gene encoding stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), an enzyme
      involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, by suppressing the activity of
      activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Knockdown of SCD1 prevented liver
      steatosis in wild-type mice induced by knockdown of BTG1. Conversely, the ability
      of BTG1 overexpression to ameliorate liver steatosis in db/db mice was negated by
      ATF4 overexpression. Moreover, BTG1 transgenic mice were resistant to liver
      steatosis induced by a high-carbohydrate diet. BTG1 abundance was decreased by
      this diet through a pathway that involved mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
      ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), and cAMP response element-binding protein
      (CREB). Together, our study identifies a role of BTG1 in regulating hepatic lipid
      metabolism and specifically in preventing ATF4 and SCD1 from inducing liver
      steatosis.

TI  - Mice lacking the intracellular cation channel TRIC-B have compromised collagen
      production and impaired bone mineralization.
PG  - ra49
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad9055 [doi]
AB  - The trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels TRIC-A and TRIC-B localize
      predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and likely support Ca(2+) release
      from intracellular stores by mediating cationic flux to maintain electrical
      neutrality. Deletion and point mutations in TRIC-B occur in families with
      autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta. Tric-b knockout mice develop
      neonatal respiratory failure and exhibit poor bone ossification. We investigated 
      the cellular defect causing the bone phenotype. Bone histology indicated collagen
      matrix deposition was reduced in Tric-b knockout mice. Osteoblasts, the
      bone-depositing cells, from Tric-b knockout mice exhibited reduced Ca(2+) release
      from ER and increased ER Ca(2+) content, which was associated with ER swelling.
      These cells also had impaired collagen release without a decrease in
      collagen-encoding transcripts, consistent with a defect in trafficking of
      collagen through ER. In contrast, osteoclasts, the bone-degrading cells, from
      Tric-b knockout mice were similar to those from wild-type mice. Thus, TRIC-B
      function is essential to support the production and release of large amounts of
      collagen by osteoblasts, which is necessary for bone mineralization.

TI  - The transcription factor FOXF1 promotes prostate cancer by stimulating the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK5.
PG  - ra48
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad5582 [doi]
AB  - Forkhead box F1 (FOXF1) is a stromal transcription factor that is not expressed
      in epithelial cells of normal prostate tissue. The role of FOXF1 in cancer is
      conflicting; its loss in some cancers suggests a tumor suppressive function, but 
      its abundance in others is associated with protumorigenic and metastatic traits. 
      Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) is associated with advanced-stage 
      prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) in patients. We detected a population of
      FOXF1-positive tumor cells in aggressive mouse and human PCa. Using two murine
      orthotopic models of PCa, we found that overexpression of FOXF1 in Myc-CaP and
      TRAMP prostate tumor cells induced tumor growth in the prostate and progression
      to peritoneal metastasis. Increased growth of FOXF1-positive prostate tumors was 
      associated with increased phosphorylation of ERK5, a member of the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. FOXF1 transcriptionally induced
      and directly bound to promoter regions of genes encoding the kinases MAP3K2 and
      WNK1, which promoted the phosphorylation and activation of ERK5. Knockdown of
      ERK5 or both MAP3K2 and WNK1 in FOXF1-overexpressing PCa cells reduced cell
      proliferation in culture and suppressed tumor growth and tumor metastasis when
      implanted into mice. In human tumors, FOXF1 expression correlated positively with
      that of MAP3K2 and WNK1 Thus, in contrast to some tumors where FOXF1 may function
      as a tumor suppressor, FOXF1 promotes prostate tumor growth and progression by
      activating ERK5 signaling. Our results also indicate that ERK5 may be a new
      therapeutic target in patients with FOXF1-positive PCa.

TI  - Gain-of-function mutations in protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) may promote
      synaptic defects in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - ra47
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6209 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementia disorder characterized by
      synaptic degeneration and amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain. Through
      whole-genome sequencing of 1345 individuals from 410 families with late-onset AD 
      (LOAD), we identified three highly penetrant variants in PRKCA, the gene that
      encodes protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), in five of the families. All three
      variants linked with LOAD displayed increased catalytic activity relative to
      wild-type PKCalpha as assessed in live-cell imaging experiments using a
      genetically encoded PKC activity reporter. Deleting PRKCA in mice or adding PKC
      antagonists to mouse hippocampal slices infected with a virus expressing the
      Abeta precursor CT100 revealed that PKCalpha was required for the reduced
      synaptic activity caused by Abeta. In PRKCA(-/-) neurons expressing CT100,
      introduction of PKCalpha, but not PKCalpha lacking a PDZ interaction moiety,
      rescued synaptic depression, suggesting that a scaffolding interaction bringing
      PKCalpha to the synapse is required for its mediation of the effects of Abeta.
      Thus, enhanced PKCalpha activity may contribute to AD, possibly by mediating the 
      actions of Abeta on synapses. In contrast, reduced PKCalpha activity is
      implicated in cancer. Hence, these findings reinforce the importance of
      maintaining a careful balance in the activity of this enzyme.

AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Alexandra Newton and Rudolph Tanzi,
      authors of a Research Article that appears in the 10 May 2016 issue of Science
      Signaling, about activating mutations in protein kinase Calpha that may promote
      the type of neural defects that characterize Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's
      disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive loss
      and, eventually, death. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation 
      of amyloid-beta (Abeta), synaptic depression, and synaptic degeneration. Alfonso 
      et al found activating mutations in the gene encoding protein kinase Calpha
      (PKCalpha) in some families with inherited Alzheimer's disease. Loss of PKCalpha 
      function prevented Abeta-induced synaptic depression in brain tissue from mice,
      suggesting that activated forms of PKCalpha may contribute to Alzheimer's disease
      in some patients.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta and Notch ligands act as opposing environmental
      cues in regulating the plasticity of type 3 innate lymphoid cells.
PG  - ra46
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf2176 [doi]
AB  - Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are composed of subsets that are either
      positive or negative for the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) NKp46 (encoded
      by Ncr1). ILC3s are located at mucosal sites, such as in the intestine and lung, 
      where they are exposed to billions of commensal microbes and potentially harmful 
      pathogens. Together with T cells, the various ILC3 subsets maintain the balance
      between homeostasis and immune activation. Through genetic mapping, we identified
      a previously uncharacterized subset of NCR(-) ILC3s in mice that transiently
      express Ncr1, demonstrating previously undescribed heterogeneity within the ILC3 
      population. In addition, we showed that sustained Notch signaling was required
      for the maintenance of the NCR(+) phenotype and that the cytokine transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) impaired the development of NCR(+) ILC3s. Thus, the
      plasticity of ILC3s is regulated by the balance between the opposing effects of
      Notch and TGF-beta signaling, maintaining homeostasis in the face of continual
      challenges.

TI  - Notch signaling in group 3 innate lymphoid cells modulates their plasticity.
PG  - ra45
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf2223 [doi]
AB  - The Notch signaling pathway is conserved throughout evolution, and it controls
      various processes, including cell fate determination, differentiation, and
      proliferation. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are lymphoid cells lacking antigen
      receptors that fulfill effector and regulatory functions in innate immunity and
      tissue remodeling. Type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) reinforce the epithelial barrier and
      maintain homeostasis with intestinal microbiota. We demonstrated that the
      population of natural cytotoxicity receptor-positive (NCR(+)) ILC3s in mice is
      composed of two subsets that have distinct developmental requirements. A major
      subset depended on the activation of Notch2 in NCR(-) ILC3 precursors in the
      lamina propria of the small intestine to stimulate expression of the genes
      encoding the transcription factors T-bet, RORgammat, and aryl hydrocarbon
      receptor (AhR). Notch signaling contributed to the transition of NCR(-) cells
      into NCR(+) cells, the more proinflammatory subset, in a cell-autonomous manner. 
      In the absence of Notch signaling, this subset of NCR(-) ILC3s did not acquire
      the gene expression profile of NCR(+) ILC3s. A second subset of NCR(+) ILC3s did 
      not depend on Notch for their development or for increased transcription factor
      abundance; however, their production of cytokines and cell surface abundance of
      NCRs were decreased in the absence of Notch signaling. Together, our data suggest
      that Notch is a regulator of the plasticity of ILC3s by controlling NCR(+) cell
      fate.

TI  - PERK mediates the IRES-dependent translational activation of mRNAs encoding
      angiogenic growth factors after ischemic stress.
PG  - ra44
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf2753 [doi]
AB  - Angiogenesis is induced by various conditions, including hypoxia. Although
      cap-dependent translation is globally inhibited during ischemia, the mRNAs
      encoding two important proangiogenic growth factors, vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), are translated at early
      time points in ischemic muscle. The translation of these mRNAs can occur through 
      internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), rather than through cap-dependent
      translation. Hypoxic conditions also induce the unfolded protein response (UPR)
      and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading us to assess the interplay between
      hypoxia, ER stress, and IRES-mediated translation of FGF-2 and VEGF We found that
      unlike cap-dependent translation, translation through FGF-2 and VEGF IRESs was
      efficient in cells and transgenic mice subjected to ER stress-inducing stimuli.
      We identified PERK, a kinase that is activated by ER stress, as the driver of
      VEGF and FGF-2 IRES-mediated translation in cells and in mice expressing
      IRES-driven reporter genes and exposed to hypoxic stress. These results
      demonstrate the role of IRES-dependent translation in the induction of the
      proangiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2 in response to acute hypoxic stress.
      Furthermore, the PERK pathway could be a viable pharmacological target to improve
      physiological responses to ischemic situations.

PG  - pc10

AB  - This Podcast features an interview with Rachel Golub and Eric Vivier, authors of 
      two Research Articles that appear in the 3 May 2016 issue of Science Signaling,
      about plasticity of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs are related to the T cells
      and B cells of the adaptive immune system, and they regulate immune responses by 
      secreting cytokines. ILCs are a heterogeneous population of cells that can be
      classified into several subtypes. Type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) can be further subdivided
      into distinct subpopulations. Chea et al found that Notch signaling controlled
      the relative proportions of different ILC3 subtypes in the mouse intestine. A
      related study by Viant et al reports that the Notch and transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways antagonize one another to control the
      balance between different subsets of ILC3s. Both studies demonstrate that ILC3
      fate is plastic and can be influenced by signals present in the microenvironment 
      of these tissue-resident cells.Listen to Podcast.

TI  - Identification of GPR83 as the receptor for the neuroendocrine peptide PEN.
PG  - ra43
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0694 [doi]
AB  - PEN is an abundant peptide in the brain that has been implicated in the
      regulation of feeding. We identified a receptor for PEN in mouse hypothalamus and
      Neuro2A cells. PEN bound to and activated GPR83, a G protein (heterotrimeric
      guanine nucleotide)-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR). Reduction of GPR83 
      expression in mouse brain and Neuro2A cells reduced PEN binding and signaling,
      consistent with GPR83 functioning as the major receptor for PEN. In some brain
      regions, GPR83 colocalized with GPR171, a GPCR that binds the neuropeptide
      bigLEN, another neuropeptide that is involved in feeding and is generated from
      the same precursor protein as is PEN. Coexpression of these two receptors in cell
      lines altered the signaling properties of each receptor, suggesting a functional 
      interaction. Our data established PEN as a neuropeptide that binds GPR83 and
      suggested that these two ligand-receptor systems-PEN-GPR83 and bigLEN-GPR171-may 
      be functionally coupled in the regulation of feeding.

TI  - Neuropilin-1 mediates vascular permeability independently of vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor-2 activation.
PG  - ra42
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad3812 [doi]
AB  - Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) regulates developmental and pathological angiogenesis,
      arteriogenesis, and vascular permeability, acting as a coreceptor for semaphorin 
      3A (Sema3A) and the 165-amino acid isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor 
      A (VEGF-A165). NRP1 is also the receptor for the CendR peptides, a class of cell-
      and tissue-penetrating peptides with a specific R-x-x-R carboxyl-terminal motif. 
      Because the cytoplasmic domain of NRP1 lacks catalytic activity, NRP1 is mainly
      thought to act through the recruitment and binding to other receptors. We report 
      here that the NRP1 intracellular domain mediates vascular permeability.
      Stimulation with VEGF-A165, a ligand-blocking antibody, and a CendR peptide led
      to NRP1 accumulation at cell-cell contacts in endothelial cell monolayers,
      increased cellular permeability in vitro and vascular leakage in vivo.
      Biochemical analyses, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) silencing, and the use of a
      specific VEGFR blocker established that the effects induced by the CendR peptide 
      and the antibody were independent of VEGFR-2. Moreover, leakage assays in mice
      expressing a mutant NRP1 lacking the cytoplasmic domain revealed that this domain
      was required for NRP1-induced vascular permeability in vivo. Hence, these data
      define a vascular permeability pathway mediated by NRP1 but independent of
      VEGFR-2 activation.

TI  - Sleep deprivation impairs memory by attenuating mTORC1-dependent protein
      synthesis.
PG  - ra41
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad4949 [doi]
AB  - Sleep deprivation is a public health epidemic that causes wide-ranging
      deleterious consequences, including impaired memory and cognition. Protein
      synthesis in hippocampal neurons promotes memory and cognition. The kinase
      complex mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulates protein
      synthesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting the eukaryotic translation initiation
      factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4EBP2). We investigated the involvement of the
      mTORC1-4EBP2 axis in the molecular mechanisms mediating the cognitive deficits
      caused by sleep deprivation in mice. Using an in vivo protein translation assay, 
      we found that loss of sleep impaired protein synthesis in the hippocampus. Five
      hours of sleep loss attenuated both mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4EBP2 and 
      the interaction between eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and eIF4G in the 
      hippocampi of sleep-deprived mice. Increasing the abundance of 4EBP2 in
      hippocampal excitatory neurons before sleep deprivation increased the abundance
      of phosphorylated 4EBP2, restored the amount of eIF4E-eIF4G interaction and
      hippocampal protein synthesis to that seen in mice that were not sleep-deprived, 
      and prevented the hippocampus-dependent memory deficits associated with sleep
      loss. These findings collectively demonstrate that 4EBP2-regulated protein
      synthesis is a critical mediator of the memory deficits caused by sleep
      deprivation.

TI  - How Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors, the kinase PKA, and the phosphatase PP2B are
      intertwined in synaptic LTP and LTD.
PG  - e2
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf7067 [doi]
AB  - Both synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are
      thought to be critical for memory formation. Dell'Acqua and co-workers now
      demonstrate that transient postsynaptic incorporation of Ca(2+)-permeable (CP)
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) is
      required for LTD in the exemplary hippocampal CA1 region in 2-week-old mice.
      Mechanistically, LTD depends on AKAP150-anchored protein kinase A (PKA) to
      promote the initial functional recruitment of CP-AMPARs during LTD induction and 
      on AKAP150-anchored protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) to trigger their subsequent
      removal as part of the lasting depression of synaptic transmission.

TI  - The molecular neurobiology of the sleep-deprived, fuzzy brain.
PG  - fs7
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf6196 [doi]
AB  - Sleep deprivation is well established to cause diminution of cognitive function, 
      including disruption of both minute-to-minute working memory and decrements in
      the stabilization of long-term memories. Moreover, "replay" during sleep of
      episodes and sequences of events that were experienced during wakefulness has
      been implicated in consolidation of long-term memories. However, the molecular
      mechanisms underlying the role of sleep in memory function are just starting to
      be defined. In this issue of Science Signaling, Tudor et al identify one
      molecular component underlying the effects of sleep on memory function: dynamic
      experience-dependent regulation of protein synthesis in the hippocampus.

TI  - Computational spatiotemporal analysis identifies WAVE2 and cofilin as joint
      regulators of costimulation-mediated T cell actin dynamics.
PG  - rs3
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad4149 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescence microscopy is one of the most important tools in cell biology
      research because it provides spatial and temporal information to investigate
      regulatory systems inside cells. This technique can generate data in the form of 
      signal intensities at thousands of positions resolved inside individual live
      cells. However, given extensive cell-to-cell variation, these data cannot be
      readily assembled into three- or four-dimensional maps of protein concentration
      that can be compared across different cells and conditions. We have developed a
      method to enable comparison of imaging data from many cells and applied it to
      investigate actin dynamics in T cell activation. Antigen recognition in T cells
      by the T cell receptor (TCR) is amplified by engagement of the costimulatory
      receptor CD28. We imaged actin and eight core actin regulators to generate over a
      thousand movies of T cells under conditions in which CD28 was either engaged or
      blocked in the context of a strong TCR signal. Our computational analysis showed 
      that the primary effect of costimulation blockade was to decrease recruitment of 
      the activator of actin nucleation WAVE2 (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family 
      verprolin-homologous protein 2) and the actin-severing protein cofilin to
      F-actin. Reconstitution of WAVE2 and cofilin activity restored the defect in
      actin signaling dynamics caused by costimulation blockade. Thus, we have
      developed and validated an approach to quantify protein distributions in time and
      space for the analysis of complex regulatory systems.

TI  - FOXF1 maintains endothelial barrier function and prevents edema after lung
      injury.
PG  - ra40
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad1899 [doi]
AB  - Multiple signaling pathways, structural proteins, and transcription factors are
      involved in the regulation of endothelial barrier function. The forkhead protein 
      FOXF1 is a key transcriptional regulator of embryonic lung development, and we
      used a conditional knockout approach to examine the role of FOXF1 in adult lung
      homeostasis, injury, and repair. Tamoxifen-regulated deletion of both Foxf1
      alleles in endothelial cells of adult mice (Pdgfb-iCreER/Foxf1(-/-)) caused lung 
      inflammation and edema, leading to respiratory insufficiency and death. Deletion 
      of a single Foxf1 allele made heterozygous Pdgfb-iCreER/Foxf1(+/-)mice more
      susceptible to acute lung injury. FOXF1 abundance was decreased in pulmonary
      endothelial cells of human patients with acute lung injury. Gene expression
      analysis of pulmonary endothelial cells with homozygous FOXF1 deletion indicated 
      reduced expression of genes critical for maintenance and regulation of adherens
      junctions. FOXF1 knockdown in vitro and in vivo disrupted adherens junctions,
      enhanced lung endothelial permeability, and increased the abundance of the mRNA
      and protein for sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), a key regulator of
      endothelial barrier function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase
      reporter assays demonstrated that FOXF1 directly bound to and induced the
      transcriptional activity of the S1pr1 promoter. Pharmacological administration of
      S1P to injured Pdgfb-iCreER/Foxf1(+/-)mice restored endothelial barrier function,
      decreased lung edema, and improved survival. Thus, FOXF1 promotes normal lung
      homeostasis and repair, in part, by enhancing endothelial barrier function
      through activation of the S1P/S1PR1 signaling pathway.

TI  - Enhanced responsiveness of Ghsr Q343X rats to ghrelin results in enhanced
      adiposity without increased appetite.
PG  - ra39
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aae0374 [doi]
AB  - The ability of the gut hormone ghrelin to promote positive energy balance is
      mediated by the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). GHSR is a G
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is found centrally and peripherally and that
      can signal in a ligand-independent manner basally or when heterodimerized with
      other GPCRs. However, current Ghsr knockout models cannot dissect
      ghrelin-dependent and ghrelin-independent signaling, precluding assessment of the
      physiological importance of these signaling pathways. An animal model carrying a 
      Ghsr mutation that preserves GHSR cell surface abundance, but selectively alters 
      GHSR signaling, would be a useful tool to decipher GHSR signaling in vivo. We
      used rats with the Ghsr(Q343X) mutation (Ghsr(M/M)), which is predicted to delete
      the distal part of the GHSR carboxyl-terminal tail, a domain critical for the
      signal termination processes of receptor internalization and beta-arrestin
      recruitment. In cells, the GHSR-Q343X mutant showed enhanced ligand-induced G
      protein-dependent signaling and blunted activity of processes involved in GPCR
      signal termination. Ghsr(M/M)rats displayed enhanced responses to submaximal
      doses of ghrelin or GHSR agonist. Moreover, Ghsr(M/M)rats had a more stable body 
      weight under caloric restriction, a condition that increases endogenous ghrelin
      tone, whereas under standard housing conditions,Ghsr(M/M)rats showed increased
      body weight and adiposity and reduced glucose tolerance. Overall, our data stress
      the physiological role of the distal domain of GHSR carboxyl terminus as a
      suppressor of ghrelin sensitivity, and we propose using the Ghsr(M/M)rat as a
      physiological model of gain of function in Ghsr to identify treatments for
      obesity-related conditions.

AB  - The gut-derived hormone ghrelin regulates growth hormone release, appetite,
      metabolism, and immune function through its receptor, the growth hormone
      secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a). In this issue of Science Signaling, Chebani et
      al decode GHSR1a signaling by using transgenic rats with a mutation in GHSR1a
      that prevents its interaction with beta-arrestin. These mutant rats are more
      responsive to endogenous ghrelin, resulting in increased fat deposition and
      insulin resistance without affecting food intake.

TI  - Gbeta promotes pheromone receptor polarization and yeast chemotropism by
      inhibiting receptor phosphorylation.
PG  - ra38
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad4376 [doi]
AB  - Gradient-directed cell migration (chemotaxis) and growth (chemotropism) are
      processes that are essential to the development and life cycles of all species.
      Cells use surface receptors to sense the shallow chemical gradients that elicit
      chemotaxis and chemotropism. Slight asymmetries in receptor activation are
      amplified by downstream signaling systems, which ultimately induce dynamic
      reorganization of the cytoskeleton. During the mating response of budding yeast, 
      a model chemotropic system, the pheromone receptors on the plasma membrane
      polarize to the side of the cell closest to the stimulus. Although receptor
      polarization occurs before and independently of actin cable-dependent delivery of
      vesicles to the plasma membrane (directed secretion), it requires receptor
      internalization. Phosphorylation of pheromone receptors by yeast casein kinase 1 
      or 2 (Yck1/2) stimulates their internalization. We showed that the
      pheromone-responsive Gbetagamma dimer promotes the polarization of the pheromone 
      receptor by interacting with Yck1/2 and locally inhibiting receptor
      phosphorylation. We also found that receptor phosphorylation is essential for
      chemotropism, independently of its role in inducing receptor internalization. A
      mathematical model supports the idea that the interaction between Gbetagamma and 
      Yck1/2 results in differential phosphorylation and internalization of the
      pheromone receptor and accounts for its polarization before the initiation of
      directed secretion.

TI  - Dominant-negative Galpha subunits are a mechanism of dysregulated heterotrimeric 
      G protein signaling in human disease.
PG  - ra37
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad2429 [doi]
AB  - Auriculo-condylar syndrome (ACS), a rare condition that impairs craniofacial
      development, is caused by mutations in a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
      signaling pathway. In mice, disruption of signaling by the endothelin type A
      receptor (ET(A)R), which is mediated by the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein) subunit Galpha(q/11) and subsequently phospholipase C
      (PLC), impairs neural crest cell differentiation that is required for normal
      craniofacial development. Some ACS patients have mutations inGNAI3, which encodes
      Galpha(i3), but it is unknown whether this G protein has a role within the ET(A)R
      pathway. We used a Xenopus model of vertebrate development, in vitro
      biochemistry, and biosensors of G protein activity in mammalian cells to
      systematically characterize the phenotype and function of all known
      ACS-associated Galpha(i3) mutants. We found that ACS-associated mutations in
      GNAI3 produce dominant-negative Galpha(i3) mutant proteins that couple to ET(A)R 
      but cannot bind and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate, resulting in the prevention
      of endothelin-mediated activation of Galpha(q/11) and PLC. Thus, ACS is caused by
      functionally dominant-negative mutations in a heterotrimeric G protein subunit.

TI  - Metalloprotease cleavage of the N terminus of the orphan G protein-coupled
      receptor GPR37L1 reduces its constitutive activity.
PG  - ra36
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad1089 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the pharmacology or physiology of GPR37L1, a G protein
      (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor that is
      abundant in the cerebellum. Mice deficient in this receptor exhibit precocious
      cerebellar development and hypertension. We showed that GPR37L1 coupled to the G 
      protein Galpha(s) when heterologously expressed in cultured cells in the absence 
      of any added ligand, whereas a mutant receptor that lacked the amino terminus was
      inactive. Conversely, inhibition of ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteases)
      enhanced receptor activity, indicating that the presence of the amino terminus is
      necessary for GPR37L1 signaling. Metalloprotease-dependent processing of GPR37L1 
      was evident in rodent cerebellum, where we detected predominantly the cleaved,
      inactive form. However, comparison of the accumulation of cAMP (adenosine
      3',5'-monophosphate) in response to phosphodiesterase inhibition in cerebellar
      slice preparations from wild-type and GPR37L1-null mice showed that some
      constitutive signaling remained in the wild-type mice. In reporter assays of
      Galpha(s) or Galpha(i) signaling, the synthetic, prosaposin-derived peptide
      prosaptide (TX14A) did not increase GPR37L1 activity. Our data indicate that
      GPR37L1 may be a constitutively active receptor, or perhaps its ligand is present
      under the conditions that we used for analysis, and that the activity of this
      receptor is instead controlled by signals that regulate metalloprotease activity 
      in the tissue.

AB  - This Focus Issue highlights new discoveries at the level of the receptor, the
      alpha subunit, and the betagamma subunit and spans research in yeast on polarized
      growth and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) trafficking, in mice on an orphan
      GPCR with constitutive activity, and a disease-causing mutation in an alpha
      subunit that results in inappropriate GPCR-G protein coupling.

TI  - Defining the stoichiometry of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding required to
      initiate Ca2+ release.
PG  - ra35
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad6281 [doi]
AB  - Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) are tetrameric intracellular
      Ca(2+)-release channels with each subunit containing a binding site for IP3in the
      amino terminus. We provide evidence that four IP3molecules are required to
      activate the channel under diverse conditions. Comparing the
      concentration-response relationship for binding and Ca(2+)release suggested that 
      IP3Rs are maximally occupied by IP3before substantial Ca(2+)release occurs. We
      showed that ligand binding-deficient subunits acted in a dominant-negative manner
      when coexpressed with wild-type monomers in the chicken immune cell line
      DT40-3KO, which lacks all three genes encoding IP3R subunits, and confirmed the
      same effect in an IP3R-null human cell line (HEK-3KO) generated by CRISPR/Cas9
      technology. Using dimeric and tetrameric concatenated IP3Rs with increasing
      numbers of binding-deficient subunits, we addressed the obligate ligand
      stoichiometry. The concatenated IP3Rs with four ligand-binding sites exhibited
      Ca(2+)release and electrophysiological properties of native IP3Rs. However,
      IP3failed to activate IP3Rs assembled from concatenated dimers consisting of one 
      binding-competent and one binding-deficient mutant subunit. Similarly, IP3Rs
      containing two monomers of IP3R2short, an IP3binding-deficient splice variant,
      were nonfunctional. Concatenated tetramers containing only three
      binding-competent ligand-binding sites were nonfunctional under a wide range of
      activating conditions. These data provide definitive evidence that IP3-induced
      Ca(2+)release only occurs when each IP3R monomer within the tetramer is occupied 
      by IP3, thereby ensuring fidelity of Ca(2+)release.

TI  - Inhibition of class I histone deacetylases blunts cardiac hypertrophy through
      TSC2-dependent mTOR repression.
PG  - ra34
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad5736 [doi]
AB  - Altering chromatin structure through histone posttranslational modifications has 
      emerged as a key driver of transcriptional responses in cells. Modulation of
      these transcriptional responses by pharmacological inhibition of class I histone 
      deacetylases (HDACs), a group of chromatin remodeling enzymes, has been
      successful in blocking the growth of some cancer cell types. These inhibitors
      also attenuate the pathogenesis of pathological cardiac remodeling by blunting
      and even reversing pathological hypertrophy. The mechanistic target of rapamycin 
      (mTOR) is a critical sensor and regulator of cell growth that, as part of mTOR
      complex 1 (mTORC1), drives changes in protein synthesis and metabolism in both
      pathological and physiological hypertrophy. We demonstrated through
      pharmacological and genetic methods that inhibition of class I HDACs suppressed
      pathological cardiac hypertrophy through inhibition of mTOR activity. Mice
      genetically silenced for HDAC1 and HDAC2 had a reduced hypertrophic response to
      thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) and showed reduced mTOR activity. We
      determined that the abundance of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), an mTOR
      inhibitor, was increased through a transcriptional mechanism in cardiomyocytes
      when class I HDACs were inhibited. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, loss of TSC2
      abolished HDAC-dependent inhibition of mTOR activity, and increased expression of
      TSC2 was sufficient to reduce hypertrophy in response to phenylephrine. These
      findings point to mTOR and TSC2-dependent control of mTOR as critical components 
      of the mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors blunt pathological cardiac growth.
      These results also suggest a strategy to modulate mTOR activity and facilitate
      the translational exploitation of HDAC inhibitors in heart disease.

TI  - PLIF: A rapid, accurate method to detect and quantitatively assess protein-lipid 
      interactions.
PG  - rs2
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad4337 [doi]
AB  - Phosphoinositides are a type of cellular phospholipid that regulate signaling in 
      a wide range of cellular and physiological processes through the interaction
      between their phosphorylated inositol head group and specific domains in various 
      cytosolic proteins. These lipids also influence the activity of transmembrane
      proteins. Aberrant phosphoinositide signaling is associated with numerous
      diseases, including cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Thus, identifying
      phosphoinositide-binding partners and the aspects that define their specificity
      can direct drug development. However, current methods are costly, time-consuming,
      or technically challenging and inaccessible to many laboratories. We developed a 
      method called PLIF (for "protein-lipid interaction by fluorescence") that uses
      fluorescently labeled liposomes and tethered, tagged proteins or peptides to
      enable fast and reliable determination of protein domain specificity for given
      phosphoinositides in a membrane environment. We validated PLIF against previously
      known phosphoinositide-binding partners for various proteins and obtained
      relative affinity profiles. Moreover, PLIF analysis of the sorting nexin (SNX)
      family revealed not only that SNXs bound most strongly to phosphatidylinositol
      3-phosphate (PtdIns3P or PI3P), which is known from analysis with other methods, 
      but also that they interacted with other phosphoinositides, which had not
      previously been detected using other techniques. Different phosphoinositide
      partners, even those with relatively weak binding affinity, could account for the
      diverse functions of SNXs in vesicular trafficking and protein sorting. Because
      PLIF is sensitive, semiquantitative, and performed in a high-throughput manner,
      it may be used to screen for highly specific protein-lipid interaction
      inhibitors.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac8460 [doi]
AB  - Lung adenocarcinomas with mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond 
      to EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but resistance invariably
      occurs. We found that the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transduction and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway was aberrantly increased in
      TKI-resistant EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. JAK2
      inhibition restored sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in TKI-resistant 
      cell lines and xenograft models of EGFR-mutant TKI-resistant lung cancer. JAK2
      inhibition uncoupled EGFR from its negative regulator, suppressor of cytokine
      signaling 5 (SOCS5), consequently increasing EGFR abundance and restoring the
      tumor cells' dependence on EGFR signaling. Furthermore, JAK2 inhibition led to
      heterodimerization of mutant and wild-type EGFR subunits, the activity of which
      was then blocked by TKIs. Our results reveal a mechanism whereby JAK2 inhibition 
      overcomes acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and support the use of
      combination therapy with JAK and EGFR inhibitors for the treatment of
      EGFR-dependent NSCLC.

TI  - Inhibition of the kinase WNK1/HSN2 ameliorates neuropathic pain by restoring GABA
      inhibition.
PG  - ra32
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0163 [doi]
AB  - HSN2is a nervous system predominant exon of the gene encoding the kinase WNK1 and
      is mutated in an autosomal recessive, inherited form of congenital pain
      insensitivity. The HSN2-containing splice variant is referred to as WNK1/HSN2. We
      created a knockout mouse specifically lacking theHsn2exon ofWnk1 Although these
      mice had normal spinal neuron and peripheral sensory neuron morphology and
      distribution, the mice were less susceptible to hypersensitivity to cold and
      mechanical stimuli after peripheral nerve injury. In contrast, thermal and
      mechanical nociceptive responses were similar to control mice in an
      inflammation-induced pain model. In the nerve injury model of neuropathic pain,
      WNK1/HSN2 contributed to a maladaptive decrease in the activity of the
      K(+)-Cl(-)cotransporter KCC2 by increasing its inhibitory phosphorylation at
      Thr(906)and Thr(1007), resulting in an associated loss of GABA
      (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition of spinal pain-transmitting nerves.
      Electrophysiological analysis showed that WNK1/HSN2 shifted the concentration of 
      Cl(-)such that GABA signaling resulted in a less hyperpolarized state (increased 
      neuronal activity) rather than a more hyperpolarized state (decreased neuronal
      activity) in mouse spinal nerves. Pharmacologically antagonizing WNK activity
      reduced cold allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia, decreased KCC2 Thr(906)and
      Thr(1007)phosphorylation, and restored GABA-mediated inhibition
      (hyperpolarization) of injured spinal cord lamina II neurons. These data provide 
      mechanistic insight into, and a compelling therapeutic target for treating,
      neuropathic pain after nerve injury.

TI  - Revisiting protein kinase-substrate interactions: Toward therapeutic development.
PG  - re3
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad4016 [doi]
AB  - Despite the efforts of pharmaceutical companies to develop specific kinase
      modulators, few drugs targeting kinases have been completely successful in the
      clinic. This is primarily due to the conserved nature of kinases, especially in
      the catalytic domains. Consequently, many currently available inhibitors lack
      sufficient selectivity for effective clinical application. Kinases phosphorylate 
      their substrates to modulate their activity. One of the important steps in the
      catalytic reaction of protein phosphorylation is the correct positioning of the
      target residue within the catalytic site. This positioning is mediated by several
      regions in the substrate binding site, which is typically a shallow crevice that 
      has critical subpockets that anchor and orient the substrate. The structural
      characterization of this protein-protein interaction can aid in the elucidation
      of the roles of distinct kinases in different cellular processes, the
      identification of substrates, and the development of specific inhibitors. Because
      the region of the substrate that is recognized by the kinase can be part of a
      linear consensus motif or a nonlinear motif, advances in technology beyond simple
      linear sequence scanning for consensus motifs were needed. Cost-effective
      bioinformatics tools are already frequently used to predict kinase-substrate
      interactions for linear consensus motifs, and new tools based on the structural
      data of these interactions improve the accuracy of these predictions and enable
      the identification of phosphorylation sites within nonlinear motifs. In this
      Review, we revisit kinase-substrate interactions and discuss the various
      approaches that can be used to identify them and analyze their binding structures
      for targeted drug development.

TI  - A large Rab GTPase encoded by CRACR2A is a component of subsynaptic vesicles that
      transmit T cell activation signals.
PG  - ra31
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac9171 [doi]
AB  - More than 60 members of the Rab family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)
      exist in the human genome. Rab GTPases are small proteins that are primarily
      involved in the formation, trafficking, and fusion of vesicles. We showed
      thatCRACR2A(Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel regulator 2A) encodes a
      lymphocyte-specific large Rab GTPase that contains multiple functional domains,
      including EF-hand motifs, a proline-rich domain (PRD), and a Rab GTPase domain
      with an unconventional prenylation site. Through experiments involving gene
      silencing in cells and knockout mice, we demonstrated a role for CRACR2A in the
      activation of the Ca(2+) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways in
      response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Vesicles containing this Rab
      GTPase translocated from near the Golgi to the immunological synapse formed
      between a T cell and a cognate antigen-presenting cell to activate these
      signaling pathways. The interaction between the PRD of CRACR2A and the guanidine 
      nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 was required for the accumulation of these
      vesicles at the immunological synapse. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GTP
      binding and prenylation of CRACR2A were associated with its localization near the
      Golgi and its stability. Our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized
      function of a large Rab GTPase and vesicles near the Golgi in TCR signaling.
      Other GTPases with similar domain architectures may have similar functions in T
      cells.

TI  - A peptide of the RGS domain of GRK2 binds and inhibits Galpha(q) to suppress
      pathological cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.
PG  - ra30
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aae0549 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) play a critical role in cardiac 
      function by regulating GPCR activity. GRK2 suppresses GPCR signaling by
      phosphorylating and desensitizing active GPCRs, and through protein-protein
      interactions that uncouple GPCRs from their downstream effectors. Several GRK2
      interacting partners, including Galpha(q), promote maladaptive cardiac
      hypertrophy, which leads to heart failure, a leading cause of mortality
      worldwide. The regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of GRK2 interacts
      with and inhibits Galpha(q) in vitro. We generated TgbetaARKrgs mice with
      cardiac-specific expression of the RGS domain of GRK2 and subjected these mice to
      pressure overload to trigger adaptive changes that lead to heart failure. Unlike 
      their nontransgenic littermate controls, the TgbetaARKrgs mice exhibited less
      hypertrophy as indicated by reduced left ventricular wall thickness, decreased
      expression of genes linked to cardiac hypertrophy, and less adverse structural
      remodeling. The betaARKrgs peptide, but not endogenous GRK2, interacted with
      Galpha(q) and interfered with signaling through this G protein. These data
      support the development of GRK2-based therapeutic approaches to prevent
      hypertrophy and heart failure.

AB  - Mapping the in vivo distribution of endogenous oxidants in animal tissues is of
      substantial biomedical interest. Numerous health-related factors, including diet,
      physical activity, infection, aging, toxins, or pharmacological intervention, may
      cause redox changes. Tools are needed to pinpoint redox state changes to
      particular organs, tissues, cell types, and subcellular organelles. We describe a
      procedure that preserves the in vivo redox state of genetically encoded redox
      biosensors within histological tissue sections, thus providing "redox maps" for
      any tissue and comparison of interest. We demonstrate the utility of the
      technique by visualizing endogenous redox differences and changes in the context 
      of tumor growth, inflammation, embryonic development, and nutrient starvation.

TI  - Loss of Reelin protects against atherosclerosis by reducing leukocyte-endothelial
      cell adhesion and lesion macrophage accumulation.
PG  - ra29
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad5578 [doi]
AB  - The multimodular glycoprotein Reelin controls neuronal migration and synaptic
      transmission by binding to apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2) and very low
      density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr) on neurons. In the periphery, Reelin is
      produced by the liver, circulates in blood, and promotes thrombosis and
      hemostasis. To investigate if Reelin influences atherogenesis, we studied
      atherosclerosis-prone low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr(-/-)) mice
      in which we inducibly deleted Reelin either ubiquitously or only in the liver,
      thus preventing the production of circulating Reelin. In both types of
      Reelin-deficient mice, atherosclerosis progression was markedly attenuated, and
      macrophage content and endothelial cell staining for vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were reduced
      at the sites of atherosclerotic lesions. Intravital microscopy revealed decreased
      leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the Reelin-deficient mice. In cultured human
      endothelial cells, Reelin enhanced monocyte adhesion and increased ICAM1, VCAM1, 
      and E-selectin expression by suppressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
      activity and increasing nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in an
      Apoer2-dependent manner. These findings suggest that circulating Reelin promotes 
      atherosclerosis by increasing vascular inflammation, and that reducing or
      inhibiting circulating Reelin may present a novel approach for the prevention of 
      cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Identification of IL-23p19 as an endothelial proinflammatory peptide that
      promotes gp130-STAT3 signaling.
PG  - ra28
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad2357 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-23 (IL-23), a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the unique p19
      peptide (IL-23p19) and a peptide called IL-12p40, which is shared with IL-12, is 
      implicated in Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and other
      immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Endothelial cells produce the IL-23p19
      peptide in the absence of the IL-12p40 chain and thus do not make heterodimeric
      IL-23. We found that intercellular IL-23p19 increased the cell surface abundances
      of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells, which enhanced the attachment of
      leukocytes and increased their transendothelial migration. Intracellular p19
      associated with the cytokine receptor subunit gp130 and stimulated the
      gp130-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
      (STAT3) signaling. Proinflammatory factors promoted the generation of IL-23p19 in
      endothelial cells. The adventitial capillaries of inflamed temporal arteries in
      patients with giant-cell arteritis (GCA) had endothelial p19 protein associated
      with gp130, but did not contain the IL-12p40 chain. Because adventitial
      capillaries are essential for the entry of inflammatory cells into arterial
      walls, these data suggest that p19 may contribute to GCA disease and could
      represent a therapeutic target. Our results provide evidence that IL-23p19 is a
      previously unrecognized endothelial proinflammatory peptide that promotes
      leukocyte transendothelial migration, advancing our current understanding of the 
      complexities of inflammatory responses.

TI  - The adhesion molecule PECAM-1 enhances the TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of T cell
      function.
PG  - ra27
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad1242 [doi]
AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that 
      inhibits the proinflammatory functions of T cells, and it is a major factor in
      abrogating T cell activity against tumors. Canonical TGF-beta signaling results
      in the activation of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors that regulate
      target gene expression. We found that the cell surface molecule platelet
      endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) facilitated noncanonical
      (Smad-independent) TGF-beta signaling in T cells. Subcutaneously injected tumor
      cells that are dependent on TGF-beta-mediated suppression of immunity for growth 
      grew more slowly in PECAM-1(-/-) mice than in their wild-type counterparts. T
      cells isolated from PECAM-1(-/-) mice demonstrated relative insensitivity to the 
      TGF-beta-dependent inhibition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production,
      granzyme B synthesis, and cellular proliferation. Similarly, human T cells
      lacking PECAM-1 demonstrated decreased sensitivity to TGF-beta in a manner that
      was partially restored by reexpression of PECAM-1. Co-incubation of T cells with 
      TGF-beta and a T cell-activating antibody resulted in PECAM-1 phosphorylation on 
      an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the recruitment of
      the inhibitory Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2
      (SHP-2). Such conditions also induced the colocalization of PECAM-1 with the
      TGF-beta receptor complex as identified by coimmunoprecipitation, confocal
      microscopy, and proximity ligation assays. These studies indicate a role for
      PECAM-1 in enhancing the inhibitory functions of TGF-beta in T cells and suggest 
      that therapeutic targeting of the PECAM-1-TGF-beta inhibitory axis represents a
      means to overcome TGF-beta-dependent immunosuppression within the tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - A calcium-redox feedback loop controls human monocyte immune responses: The role 
      of ORAI Ca2+ channels.
PG  - ra26
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaf1639 [doi]
AB  - In phagocytes, pathogen recognition is followed by Ca(2+) mobilization and NADPH 
      oxidase 2 (NOX2)-mediated "oxidative burst," which involves the rapid production 
      of large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed that ORAI Ca(2+)
      channels control store-operated Ca(2+) entry, ROS production, and bacterial
      killing in primary human monocytes. ROS inactivate ORAI channels that lack an
      ORAI3 subunit. Staphylococcal infection of mice reduced the expression of the
      gene encoding the redox-sensitive Orai1 and increased the expression of the gene 
      encoding the redox-insensitive Orai3 in the lungs or in bronchoalveolar lavages. 
      A similar switch from ORAI1 to ORAI3 occurred in primary human monocytes exposed 
      to bacterial peptides in culture. These alterations in ORAI1 and ORAI3 abundance 
      shifted the channel assembly toward a more redox-insensitive configuration.
      Accordingly, silencing ORAI3 increased the redox sensitivity of the channel and
      enhanced oxidation-induced inhibition of NOX2. We generated a mathematical model 
      that predicted additional features of the Ca(2+)-redox interplay. Our results
      identified the ORAI-NOX2 feedback loop as a determinant of monocyte immune
      responses.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa9913 [doi]
AB  - N-glycosylation of cell surface proteins affects protein function, stability, and
      interaction with other proteins. Orai channels, which mediate store-operated
      Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), are composed of N-glycosylated subunits. Upon activation by 
      Ca(2+) sensor proteins (stromal interaction molecules STIM1 or STIM2) in the
      endoplasmic reticulum, Orai Ca(2+) channels in the plasma membrane mediate Ca(2+)
      influx. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins, and Siglecs are a family of
      sialic acid-binding lectins with immunoglobulin-like repeats. Using Western blot 
      analysis and lectin-binding assays from various primary human cells and cancer
      cell lines, we found that glycosylation of Orai1 is cell type-specific. Ca(2+)
      imaging experiments and patch-clamp experiments revealed that mutation of the
      only glycosylation site of Orai1 (Orai1N223A) enhanced SOCE in Jurkat T cells.
      Knockdown of the sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 reduced alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids 
      in the glycan structure of Orai1 and was associated with increased Ca(2+) entry
      in Jurkat T cells. In human mast cells, inhibition of sialyl sulfation altered
      the N-glycan of Orai1 (and other proteins) and increased SOCE. These data suggest
      that cell type-specific glycosylation influences the interaction of Orai1 with
      specific lectins, such as Siglecs, which then attenuates SOCE. In summary, the
      glycosylation state of Orai1 influences SOCE-mediated Ca(2+) signaling and, thus,
      may contribute to pathophysiological Ca(2+) signaling observed in immune disease 
      and cancer.

AB  - How Ca(2+) permeates the Orai1 channel and the mechanism by which the channel
      achieves high Ca(2+) selectivity remain critical questions in understanding
      store-operated Ca(2+) influx. In research published in Science Signaling,
      Frischauf et al. identified a Ca(2+)-accumulating region (CAR) in the
      extracellular opening of Orai1, which explains how concentrating Ca(2+) at the
      mouth of Orai1 facilitates channel permeation and contributes to selectivity.

AB  - Orai channels at the plasma membrane mediate store-operated Ca(2+) entry in
      response to Ca(2+) depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum. Orai channels are
      gated by stromal-interacting molecule proteins, which act as Ca(2+) sensors, and 
      the association of these proteins is enhanced in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. In
      research published in Science Signaling, Derler et al. report that cholesterol
      inhibits Orai function through direct association with the channel amino
      terminus.

PG  - re2
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad4403 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) signaling regulates various physiological processes in both
      animals and plants. In animals, NO synthesis is mainly catalyzed by NO synthase
      (NOS) enzymes. Although NOS-like activities that are sensitive to mammalian NOS
      inhibitors have been detected in plant extracts, few bona fide plant NOS enzymes 
      have been identified. We searched the data set produced by the 1000 Plants (1KP) 
      international consortium for the presence of transcripts encoding NOS-like
      proteins in over 1000 species of land plants and algae. We also searched for
      genes encoding NOS-like enzymes in 24 publicly available algal genomes. We
      identified no typical NOS sequences in 1087 sequenced transcriptomes of land
      plants. In contrast, we identified NOS-like sequences in 15 of the 265 algal
      species analyzed. Even if the presence of NOS enzymes assembled from
      multipolypeptides in plants cannot be conclusively discarded, the emerging data
      suggest that, instead of generating NO with evolutionarily conserved NOS enzymes,
      land plants have evolved finely regulated nitrate assimilation and reduction
      processes to synthesize NO through a mechanism different than that in animals.

TI  - Structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtr1 reveals an active site for an atypical
      phosphatase.
PG  - ra24
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad4805 [doi]
AB  - Changes in the phosphorylation status of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of
      RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) correlate with the process of eukaryotic
      transcription. The yeast protein regulator of transcription 1 (Rtr1) and the
      human homolog RNAPII-associated protein 2 (RPAP2) may function as CTD
      phosphatases; however, crystal structures of Kluyveromyces lactis Rtr1 lack a
      consensus active site. We identified a phosphoryl transfer domain in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtr1 by obtaining and characterizing a 2.6 A resolution 
      crystal structure. We identified a putative substrate-binding pocket in a deep
      groove between the zinc finger domain and a pair of helices that contained a
      trapped sulfate ion. Because sulfate mimics the chemistry of a phosphate group,
      this structural data suggested that this groove represents the phosphoryl
      transfer active site. Mutagenesis of the residues lining this groove disrupted
      catalytic activity of the enzyme assayed in vitro with a fluorescent chemical
      substrate, and expression of the mutated Rtr1 failed to rescue growth of yeast
      lacking Rtr1. Characterization of the phosphatase activity of RPAP2 and a mutant 
      of the conserved putative catalytic site in the same chemical assay indicated a
      conserved reaction mechanism. Our data indicated that the structure of the
      phosphoryl transfer domain and reaction mechanism for the phosphoryl transfer
      activity of Rtr1 is distinct from those of other phosphatase families.

TI  - Cytokinesis involves a nontranscriptional function of the Hippo pathway effector 
      YAP.
PG  - ra23
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa9227 [doi]
AB  - YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls organ expansion and
      differentiation and is inhibited by the Hippo pathway in cells in interphase.
      Here, we demonstrated that, during mitosis, YAP localized to the midbody and
      spindle, subcellular structures that are involved in cytokinesis, the process by 
      which contraction of the cytoskeleton produces two daughter cells. Furthermore,
      YAP was phosphorylated by CDK1, a kinase that promotes cell cycle progression.
      Knockdown of YAP by shRNA or expression of a nonphosphorylatable form of YAP
      delayed the separation of daughter cells (called abscission) and induced a
      cytokinesis phenotype associated with increased contractile force, membrane
      blebbing and bulges, and abnormal spindle orientation. Consequently, these
      defects led to an increased frequency of multinucleation, micronuclei, and
      aneuploidy. YAP was required for proper localization of proteins that regulate
      contraction during cytokinesis, including ECT2, MgcRacGap, Anillin, and RHOA. In 
      addition, depletion of YAP increased the phosphorylation of myosin light chain,
      which would be expected to activate the contractile activity of myosin II, the
      molecular motor involved in cytokinesis. The polarity scaffold protein PATJ
      coprecipitated with YAP and colocalized with YAP at the cytokinesis midbody, and 
      knockdown of PATJ phenocopied the cytokinetic defects and spindle orientation
      alterations induced by either YAP depletion or expression of a
      nonphosphorylatable YAP mutant. Together, these results reveal an unanticipated
      role for YAP in the proper organization of the cytokinesis machinery during
      mitosis through interaction with the polarity protein PATJ.

AB  - The Hippo pathway prevents organ overgrowth and maintains tissue architecture by 
      inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator YAP. In this issue of Science
      Signaling, Bui et al. find a role for YAP during cytokinesis that is independent 
      of its transcriptional activity. This function of YAP may be important for
      maintaining genomic stability in dividing cells.

TI  - Dynamic regulation of neutrophil polarity and migration by the heterotrimeric G
      protein subunits Galphai-GTP and Gbetagamma.
PG  - ra22
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad8163 [doi]
AB  - Activation of the Gi family of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins
      (G proteins) releases betagamma subunits, which are the major transducers of
      chemotactic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-dependent cell migration. The small
      molecule 12155 binds directly to Gbetagamma and activates Gbetagamma signaling
      without activating the Galphai subunit in the Gi heterotrimer. We used 12155 to
      examine the relative roles of Galphai and Gbetagamma activation in the migration 
      of neutrophils on surfaces coated with the integrin ligand intercellular adhesion
      molecule-1 (ICAM-1). We found that 12155 suppressed basal migration by inhibiting
      the polarization of neutrophils and increasing their adhesion to ICAM-1-coated
      surfaces. GPCR-independent activation of endogenous Galphai and Gbetagamma with
      the mastoparan analog Mas7 resulted in normal migration. Furthermore,
      12155-treated cells expressing a constitutively active form of Galphai1 became
      polarized and migrated. The extent and duration of signaling by the second
      messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were enhanced by 12155.
      Inhibiting the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) restored the
      polarity of 12155-treated cells but did not decrease their adhesion to ICAM-1 and
      failed to restore migration. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct
      role of activated Galphai in promoting cell polarization through a cAMP-dependent
      mechanism and in inhibiting adhesion through a cAMP-independent mechanism.

TI  - Trehalose inhibits solute carrier 2A (SLC2A) proteins to induce autophagy and
      prevent hepatic steatosis.
PG  - ra21
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac5472 [doi]
AB  - Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide that has gained attention for its
      ability to induce cellular autophagy and mitigate diseases related to
      pathological protein aggregation. Despite decades of ubiquitous use as a
      nutraceutical, preservative, and humectant, its mechanism of action remains
      elusive. We showed that trehalose inhibited members of the SLC2A (also known as
      GLUT) family of glucose transporters. Trehalose-mediated inhibition of glucose
      transport induced AMPK (adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein
      kinase)-dependent autophagy and regression of hepatic steatosis in vivo and a
      reduction in the accumulation of lipid droplets in primary murine hepatocyte
      cultures. Our data indicated that trehalose triggers beneficial cellular
      autophagy by inhibiting glucose transport.

PG  - ra20
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad3188 [doi]
AB  - A single extracellular stimulus can promote diverse behaviors among isogenic
      cells by differentially regulated signaling networks. We examined Ca(2+)
      signaling in response to VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), a growth
      factor that can stimulate different behaviors in endothelial cells. We found that
      altering the amount of VEGF signaling in endothelial cells by stimulating them
      with different VEGF concentrations triggered distinct and mutually exclusive
      dynamic Ca(2+) signaling responses that correlated with different cellular
      behaviors. These behaviors were cell proliferation involving the transcription
      factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and cell migration involving
      MLCK (myosin light chain kinase). Further analysis suggested that this signal
      decoding was robust to the noisy nature of the signal input. Using probabilistic 
      modeling, we captured both the stochastic and deterministic aspects of Ca(2+)
      signal decoding and accurately predicted cell responses in VEGF gradients, which 
      we used to simulate different amounts of VEGF signaling. Ca(2+) signaling
      patterns associated with proliferation and migration were detected during
      angiogenesis in developing zebrafish.

AB  - Although vertebrates cannot synthesize the natural disaccharide trehalose,
      exogenous administration of trehalose to mammalian cells may be beneficial for
      protein misfolding disorders. In this issue, DeBosch et al. show that trehalose
      may also be useful in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and identify
      inhibition of cellular glucose import through SLC2A (also known as GLUT)
      transporters as a mechanism by which trehalose stimulates autophagy through the
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

TI  - TGF-beta inhibits the activation and functions of NK cells by repressing the mTOR
      pathway.
PG  - ra19
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad1884 [doi]
AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a major immunosuppressive cytokine 
      that maintains immune homeostasis and prevents autoimmunity through its
      antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties in various immune cell types. 
      We provide genetic, pharmacologic, and biochemical evidence that a critical
      target of TGF-beta signaling in mouse and human natural killer (NK) cells is the 
      serine and threonine kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Treatment of
      mouse or human NK cells with TGF-beta in vitro blocked interleukin-15
      (IL-15)-induced activation of mTOR. TGF-beta and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
      both reduced the metabolic activity and proliferation of NK cells and reduced the
      abundances of various NK cell receptors and the cytotoxic activity of NK cells.
      In vivo, constitutive TGF-beta signaling or depletion of mTOR arrested NK cell
      development, whereas deletion of the TGF-beta receptor subunit TGF-betaRII
      enhanced mTOR activity and the cytotoxic activity of the NK cells in response to 
      IL-15. Suppression of TGF-beta signaling in NK cells did not affect either NK
      cell development or homeostasis; however, it enhanced the ability of NK cells to 
      limit metastases in two different tumor models in mice. Together, these results
      suggest that the kinase mTOR is a crucial signaling integrator of pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines in NK cells. Moreover, we propose that boosting the
      metabolic activity of antitumor lymphocytes could be an effective strategy to
      promote immune-mediated tumor suppression.

TI  - ONC201 kills solid tumor cells by triggering an integrated stress response
      dependent on ATF4 activation by specific eIF2alpha kinases.
PG  - ra18
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac4374 [doi]
AB  - ONC201 (also called TIC10) is a small molecule that inactivates the cell
      proliferation- and cell survival-promoting kinases Akt and ERK and induces cell
      death through the proapoptotic protein TRAIL. ONC201 is currently in early-phase 
      clinical testing for various malignancies. We found through gene expression and
      protein analyses that ONC201 triggered an increase in TRAIL abundance and cell
      death through an integrated stress response (ISR) involving the transcription
      factor ATF4, the transactivator CHOP, and the TRAIL receptor DR5. ATF4 was not
      activated in ONC201-resistant cancer cells, and in ONC201-sensitive cells,
      knockdown of ATF4 or CHOP partially abrogated ONC201-induced cytotoxicity and
      diminished the ONC201-stimulated increase in DR5 abundance. The activation of
      ATF4 in response to ONC201 required the kinases HRI and PKR, which phosphorylate 
      and activate the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. ONC201 rapidly
      triggered cell cycle arrest, which was associated with decreased abundance of
      cyclin D1, decreased activity of the kinase complex mTORC1, and dephosphorylation
      of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. The abundance of X-linked inhibitor of
      apoptosis protein (XIAP) negatively correlated with the extent of apoptosis in
      response to ONC201. These effects of ONC201 were independent of whether cancer
      cells had normal or mutant p53. Thus, ONC201 induces cell death through the
      coordinated induction of TRAIL by an ISR pathway.

TI  - ATF4 induction through an atypical integrated stress response to ONC201 triggers 
      p53-independent apoptosis in hematological malignancies.
PG  - ra17
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac4380 [doi]
AB  - The clinical challenge posed by p53 abnormalities in hematological malignancies
      requires therapeutic strategies other than standard genotoxic chemotherapies.
      ONC201 is a first-in-class small molecule that activates p53-independent
      apoptosis, has a benign safety profile, and is in early clinical trials. We found
      that ONC201 caused p53-independent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cell lines 
      and in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples from
      patients; these included samples from patients with genetic abnormalities
      associated with poor prognosis or cells that had developed resistance to the
      nongenotoxic agents ibrutinib and bortezomib. Moreover, ONC201 caused apoptosis
      in stem and progenitor AML cells and abrogated the engraftment of leukemic stem
      cells in mice while sparing normal bone marrow cells. ONC201 caused changes in
      gene expression similar to those caused by the unfolded protein response (UPR)
      and integrated stress responses (ISRs), which increase the translation of the
      transcription factor ATF4 through an increase in the phosphorylation of the
      translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. However, unlike the UPR and ISR, the
      increase in ATF4 abundance in ONC201-treated hematopoietic cells promoted
      apoptosis and did not depend on increased phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. ONC201
      also inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, likely
      through ATF4-mediated induction of the mTORC1 inhibitor DDIT4. Overexpression of 
      BCL-2 protected against ONC201-induced apoptosis, and the combination of ONC201
      and the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 synergistically increased apoptosis. Thus, our
      results suggest that by inducing an atypical ISR and p53-independent apoptosis,
      ONC201 has clinical potential in hematological malignancies.

PG  - fs1
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad7955 [doi]
AB  - The small molecule ONC201 was identified in a screen for compounds that would
      induce expression of the gene encoding tumor necrosis factor-related
      apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in tumors and thus cause an autocrine- or
      paracrine-induced death in tumor cells. Two Research Articles in this issue of
      Science Signaling by Ishizawa et al. and Kline et al. describe how ONC201 can
      also trigger cytotoxicity by inducing a stress response. The mechanisms of the
      stress response induced differ between hematological malignancies and solid
      tumors, highlighting the complexity of ONC201-induced toxicity and raising
      intriguing issues of tissue-specific pathways activated by the drug.

AB  - Cells are the targets of anticancer therapy, whether the therapy is directed at
      the tumor cells themselves or the cells of the immune system. Articles in this
      issue and in the 2015 Science Signaling archives provide insights into what makes
      a cell responsive to therapy and how understanding the cellular processes
      affected by the drugs (including endosomal trafficking and response to
      proteotoxic stress) can lead to personalized cancer therapies, thereby minimizing
      side effects and ineffective treatment strategies.

TI  - Toward total synthesis of cell function: Reconstituting cell dynamics with
      synthetic biology.
PG  - re1
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac4779 [doi]
AB  - Biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation and phagocytosis, are
      fundamental processes that enable cells to fulfill important physiological roles 
      in multicellular organisms. In the field of synthetic biology, the study of these
      behaviors relies on the use of a broad range of molecular tools that enable the
      real-time manipulation and measurement of key components in the underlying
      signaling pathways. This Review will focus on a subset of synthetic biology tools
      known as bottom-up techniques, which use technologies such as optogenetics and
      chemically induced dimerization to reconstitute cellular behavior in cells. These
      techniques have been crucial not only in revealing causal relationships within
      signaling networks but also in identifying the minimal signaling components that 
      are necessary for a given cellular function. We discuss studies that used these
      systems in a broad range of cellular and molecular phenomena, including the
      time-dependent modulation of protein activity in cellular proliferation and
      differentiation, the reconstitution of phagocytosis, the reconstitution of
      chemotaxis, and the regulation of actin reorganization. Finally, we discuss the
      potential contribution of synthetic biology to medicine.

      signaling.
PG  - ra16
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac9177 [doi]
AB  - Differential regulation of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a G protein
      (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor, contributes
      to the clinically limiting effects of opioid analgesics, such as morphine. We
      used biophysical approaches to quantify spatiotemporal MOR signaling in response 
      to different ligands. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells overexpressing
      MOR, morphine caused a Gbetagamma-dependent increase in plasma membrane-localized
      protein kinase C (PKC) activity, which resulted in a restricted distribution of
      MOR within the plasma membrane and induced sustained cytosolic extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. In contrast, the synthetic opioid
      peptide DAMGO ([d-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin) enabled receptor
      redistribution within the plasma membrane, resulting in transient increases in
      cytosolic and nuclear ERK activity, and, subsequently, receptor internalization. 
      When Gbetagamma subunits or PKCalpha activity was inhibited or when the
      carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites of MOR were mutated, morphine-activated
      MOR was released from its restricted plasma membrane localization and stimulated 
      a transient increase in cytosolic and nuclear ERK activity in the absence of
      receptor internalization. Thus, these data suggest that the ligand-induced
      redistribution of MOR within the plasma membrane, and not its internalization,
      controls its spatiotemporal signaling.

AB  - The exit of metastasizing tumor cells from the vasculature, extravasation, is
      regulated by their dynamic interactions with the endothelial cells that line the 
      internal surface of vessels. To elucidate signals controlling tumor cell adhesion
      to the endothelium and subsequent transendothelial migration, we performed
      phosphoproteomic analysis to map cell-specific changes in protein phosphorylation
      that were triggered by contact between metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells 
      and endothelial cells. From the 2669 unique phosphorylation sites identified, 77 
      and 43 were differentially phosphorylated in the tumor cells and endothelial
      cells, respectively. The receptor tyrosine kinase ephrin type A receptor 2
      (EPHA2) exhibited decreased Tyr(772) phosphorylation in the cancer cells upon
      endothelial contact. Knockdown of EPHA2 increased adhesion of the breast cancer
      cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and their
      transendothelial migration in coculture cell assays, as well as early-stage lung 
      colonization in vivo. EPHA2-mediated inhibition of transendothelial migration of 
      breast cancer cells depended on interaction with the ligand ephrinA1 on HUVECs
      and phosphorylation of EPHA2-Tyr(772). When EPHA2 phosphorylation dynamics were
      compared between cell lines of different metastatic ability, EPHA2-Tyr(772) was
      rapidly dephosphorylated after ephrinA1 stimulation specifically in cells
      targeting the lung. Knockdown of the phosphatase LMW-PTP reduced adhesion and
      transendothelial migration of the breast cancer cells. Overall, cell-specific
      phosphoproteomic analysis provides a bidirectional map of contact-initiated
      signaling between tumor and endothelial cells that can be further investigated to
      identify mechanisms controlling the transendothelial cell migration of cancer
      cells.

TI  - The adhesion GPCR BAI1 mediates macrophage ROS production and microbicidal
      activity against Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - The detection of microbes and initiation of an innate immune response occur
      through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are critical for the
      production of inflammatory cytokines and activation of the cellular microbicidal 
      machinery. In particular, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the 
      NADPH oxidase complex is a critical component of the macrophage bactericidal
      machinery. We previously characterized brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1
      (BAI1), a member of the adhesion family of G protein (heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as a PRR that mediates the
      selective phagocytic uptake of Gram-negative bacteria by macrophages. We showed
      that BAI1 promoted phagosomal ROS production through activation of the Rho family
      guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1, thereby stimulating NADPH oxidase
      activity. Primary BAI1-deficient macrophages exhibited attenuated Rac GTPase
      activity and reduced ROS production in response to several Gram-negative
      bacteria, resulting in impaired microbicidal activity. Furthermore, in a
      peritoneal infection model, BAI1-deficient mice exhibited increased
      susceptibility to death by bacterial challenge because of impaired bacterial
      clearance. Together, these findings suggest that BAI1 mediates the clearance of
      Gram-negative bacteria by stimulating both phagocytosis and NADPH oxidase
      activation, thereby coupling bacterial detection to the cellular microbicidal
      machinery.

AB  - The same pathway, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,
      can produce different cellular responses, depending on stimulus or cell type. We 
      examined the phosphorylation dynamics of the MAPK kinase MEK and its targets
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in primary hepatocytes and
      the transformed keratinocyte cell line HaCaT A5 exposed to either hepatocyte
      growth factor or interleukin-6. By combining quantitative mass spectrometry with 
      dynamic modeling, we elucidated network structures for the reversible threonine
      and tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK in both cell types. In addition to
      differences in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, the HaCaT
      network model required two feedback mechanisms, which, as the experimental data
      suggested, involved the induction of the dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6 and
      the scaffold paxillin. We assayed and modeled the accumulation of the
      double-phosphorylated and active form of ERK1/2, as well as the dynamics of the
      changes in the monophosphorylated forms of ERK1/2. Modeling the differences in
      the dynamics of the changes in the distributions of the phosphorylated forms of
      ERK1/2 suggested that different amounts of MEK activity triggered
      context-specific responses, with primary hepatocytes favoring the formation of
      double-phosphorylated ERK1/2 and HaCaT A5 cells that produce both the
      threonine-phosphorylated and the double-phosphorylated form. These differences in
      phosphorylation distributions explained the threshold, sensitivity, and
      saturation of the ERK response. We extended the findings of differential ERK
      phosphorylation profiles to five additional cultured cell systems and matched
      liver tumor and normal tissue, which revealed context-specific patterns of the
      various forms of phosphorylated ERK.

TI  - ABL kinases promote breast cancer osteolytic metastasis by modulating tumor-bone 
      interactions through TAZ and STAT5 signaling.
PG  - ra12
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad3210 [doi]
AB  - Bone metastases occur in up to 70% of advanced breast cancer. For most patients
      with breast cancer, bone metastases are predominantly osteolytic. Interactions
      between tumor cells and stromal cells in the bone microenvironment drive
      osteolytic bone metastasis, a process that requires the activation of
      osteoclasts, cells that break down bone. We report that ABL kinases promoted
      metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone by regulating the crosstalk between
      tumor cells and the bone microenvironment. ABL kinases protected tumor cells from
      apoptosis induced by TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), activated the
      transcription factor STAT5, and promoted osteolysis through the STAT5-dependent
      expression of genes encoding the osteoclast-activating factors interleukin-6
      (IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1). Furthermore, in breast cancer
      cells, ABL kinases increased the abundance of the Hippo pathway mediator TAZ and 
      the expression of TAZ-dependent target genes that promote bone metastasis.
      Knockdown of ABL kinases or treatment with ABL-specific allosteric inhibitor
      impaired osteolytic metastasis of breast cancer cells in mice. These findings
      revealed a role for ABL kinases in regulating tumor-bone interactions and provide
      a rationale for using ABL-specific inhibitors to limit breast cancer metastasis
      to bone.

TI  - Functional redundancy of the kinases MEK1 and MEK2: Rescue of the Mek1 mutant
      phenotype by Mek2 knock-in reveals a protein threshold effect.
PG  - ra9
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad5658 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian genome contains two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 
      (MEK)-encoding genes, Mek1 and Mek2. MEKs phosphorylate and activate the two
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) isoforms ERK1 and ERK2. Mek1(-/-)
      embryos die due to placental defects, whereas Mek2(-/-) mice survive with a
      normal life span and fertility, suggesting that MEK1 has functions not shared by 
      MEK2. However, most Mek1(+/-)Mek2(+/-) embryos also die from placental defects,
      indicating that both Mek genes contribute to placental development. To assess the
      functional specificity of the Mek1 and Mek2 genes, we produced a Mek1 knock-in
      allele in which the Mek2 coding sequences were placed under the control of Mek1
      regulatory sequences (Mek1(2) allele). Mek1(2/2) mice were viable with no
      apparent phenotype, indicating rescue by MEK2 and functional redundancy between
      the two MEK proteins. However, Mek1(2/-) embryos with Mek2 in only one of the
      Mek1 alleles and the other Mek1 allele null died from abnormal placenta,
      suggesting a dosage effect. Analysis of mice from a Mek1 Mek2 allelic series
      revealed that the occurrence of the placenta phenotype correlated with the amount
      of MEK protein independently of which MEK isoform was produced. Thus, although
      MEK1 and MEK2 can substitute for each other, a minimum amount of MEK is critical 
      for placenta development and embryo survival.

TI  - Identification of Fic-1 as an enzyme that inhibits bacterial DNA replication by
      AMPylating GyrB, promoting filament formation.
PG  - ra11
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0446 [doi]
AB  - The morphology of bacterial cells is important for virulence, evasion of the host
      immune system, and coping with environmental stresses. The widely distributed Fic
      proteins (filamentation induced by cAMP) are annotated as proteins involved in
      cell division because of the presence of the HPFx[D/E]GN[G/K]R motif. We showed
      that the presence of Fic-1 from Pseudomonas fluorescens significantly reduced the
      yield of plasmid DNA when expressed in Escherichia coli or P. fluorescens. Fic-1 
      interacted with GyrB, a subunit of DNA gyrase, which is essential for bacterial
      DNA replication. Fic-1 catalyzed the AMPylation of GyrB at Tyr(109), a residue
      critical for binding ATP, and exhibited auto-AMPylation activity. Mutation of the
      Fic-1 auto-AMPylated site greatly reduced AMPylation activity toward itself and
      toward GyrB. Fic-1-dependent AMPylation of GyrB triggered the SOS response,
      indicative of DNA replication stress or DNA damage. Fic-1 also promoted the
      formation of elongated cells when the SOS response was blocked. We identified an 
      alpha-inhibitor protein that we named anti-Fic-1 (AntF), encoded by a gene
      immediately upstream of Fic-1. AntF interacted with Fic-1, inhibited the
      AMPylation activity of Fic-1 for GyrB in vitro, and blocked Fic-1-mediated
      inhibition of DNA replication in bacteria, suggesting that Fic-1 and AntF
      comprise a toxin-antitoxin module. Our work establishes Fic-1 as an AMPylating
      enzyme that targets GyrB to inhibit DNA replication and may target other proteins
      to regulate bacterial morphology.

TI  - Cholesterol modulates Orai1 channel function.
PG  - ra10
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad7808 [doi]
AB  - STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai proteins are the essential
      components of Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels. We focused on the 
      role of cholesterol in the regulation of STIM1-mediated Orai1 currents.
      Chemically induced cholesterol depletion enhanced store-operated Ca(2+) entry
      (SOCE) and Orai1 currents. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion in mucosal-type
      mast cells augmented endogenous CRAC currents, which were associated with
      increased degranulation, a process that requires calcium influx. Single point
      mutations in the Orai1 amino terminus that would be expected to abolish
      cholesterol binding enhanced SOCE to a similar extent as did cholesterol
      depletion. The increase in Orai1 activity in cells expressing these
      cholesterol-binding-deficient mutants occurred without affecting the amount in
      the plasma membrane or the coupling of STIM1 to Orai1. We detected cholesterol
      binding to an Orai1 amino-terminal fragment in vitro and to full-length Orai1 in 
      cells. Thus, our data showed that Orai1 senses the amount of cholesterol in the
      plasma membrane and that the interaction of Orai1 with cholesterol inhibits its
      activity, thereby limiting SOCE.

TI  - ESCRT proteins restrict constitutive NF-kappaB signaling by trafficking cytokine 
      receptors.
PG  - ra8
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0848 [doi]
AB  - Because signaling mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB
      (NF-kappaB) is initiated by ligands and receptors that can undergo
      internalization, we investigated how endocytic trafficking regulated this key
      physiological pathway. We depleted all of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes 
      required for transport) subunits, which mediate receptor trafficking and
      degradation, and found that the components Tsg101, Vps28, UBAP1, and CHMP4B were 
      essential to restrict constitutive NF-kappaB signaling in human embryonic kidney 
      293 cells. In the absence of exogenous cytokines, depletion of these proteins led
      to the activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling, as well
      as the induction of NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional responses in cultured
      human cells, zebrafish embryos, and fat bodies in flies. These effects depended
      on cytokine receptors, such as the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and tumor 
      necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). Upon depletion of ESCRT subunits, both
      receptors became concentrated on and signaled from endosomes. Endosomal
      accumulation of LTbetaR induced its ligand-independent oligomerization and
      signaling through the adaptors TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF3. These 
      data suggest that ESCRTs constitutively control the distribution of cytokine
      receptors in their ligand-free state to restrict their signaling, which may
      represent a general mechanism to prevent spurious activation of NF-kappaB.

TI  - Purinergic P2Y6 receptors heterodimerize with angiotensin AT1 receptors to
      promote angiotensin II-induced hypertension.
PG  - ra7
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac9187 [doi]
AB  - The angiotensin (Ang) type 1 receptor (AT1R) promotes functional and structural
      integrity of the arterial wall to contribute to vascular homeostasis, but this
      receptor also promotes hypertension. In our investigation of how Ang II signals
      are converted by the AT1R from physiological to pathological outputs, we found
      that the purinergic P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6R), an inflammation-inducible G protein
      (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR),
      promoted Ang II-induced hypertension in mice. In mice, deletion of P2Y6R
      attenuated Ang II-induced increase in blood pressure, vascular remodeling,
      oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. AT1R and P2Y6R formed stable
      heterodimers, which enhanced G protein-dependent vascular hypertrophy but reduced
      beta-arrestin-dependent AT1R internalization. Pharmacological disruption of
      AT1R-P2Y6R heterodimers by the P2Y6R antagonist MRS2578 suppressed Ang II-induced
      hypertension in mice. Furthermore, P2Y6R abundance increased with age in vascular
      smooth muscle cells. The increased abundance of P2Y6R converted AT1R-stimulated
      signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells from beta-arrestin-dependent
      proliferation to G protein-dependent hypertrophy. These results suggest that
      increased formation of AT1R-P2Y6R heterodimers with age may increase the
      likelihood of hypertension induced by Ang II.

TI  - Astroglial networks promote neuronal coordination.
PG  - ra6
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad3066 [doi]
AB  - Astrocytes interact with neurons to regulate network activity. Although the gap
      junction subunits connexin 30 and connexin 43 mediate the formation of extensive 
      astroglial networks that cover large functional neuronal territories, their role 
      in neuronal synchronization remains unknown. Using connexin 30- and connexin
      43-deficient mice, we showed that astroglial networks promoted sustained
      population bursts in hippocampal slices by setting the basal active state of
      neurons. Astroglial networks limited excessive neuronal depolarization induced by
      spontaneous synaptic activity, increased neuronal release probability, and
      favored the recruitment of neurons during bursting, thus promoting the
      coordinated activation of neuronal networks. In vivo, this sustained neuronal
      coordination translated into increased severity of acutely evoked epileptiform
      events and convulsive behavior. These results revealed that connexin-mediated
      astroglial networks synchronize bursting of neuronal assemblies, which can
      exacerbate pathological network activity and associated behavior. Our data thus
      provide molecular and biophysical evidence predicting selective astroglial gap
      junction inhibitors as anticonvulsive drugs.

TI  - Allosteric signaling through an mGlu2 and 5-HT2A heteromeric receptor complex and
      its potential contribution to schizophrenia.
PG  - ra5
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0467 [doi]
AB  - Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors
      (GPCRs) can form multiprotein complexes (heteromers), which can alter the
      pharmacology and functions of the constituent receptors. Previous findings
      demonstrated that the Gq/11-coupled serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and the
      Gi/o-coupled metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptor-GPCRs that are involved in
      signaling alterations associated with psychosis-assemble into a heteromeric
      complex in the mammalian brain. In single-cell experiments with various mutant
      versions of the mGlu2 receptor, we showed that stimulation of cells expressing
      mGlu2-5-HT2A heteromers with an mGlu2 agonist led to activation of Gq/11 proteins
      by the 5-HT2A receptors. For this crosstalk to occur, one of the mGlu2 subunits
      had to couple to Gi/o proteins, and we determined the relative location of the
      Gi/o-contacting subunit within the mGlu2 homodimer of the heteromeric complex.
      Additionally, mGlu2-dependent activation of Gq/11, but not Gi/o, was reduced in
      the frontal cortex of 5-HT2A knockout mice and was reduced in the frontal cortex 
      of postmortem brains from schizophrenic patients. These findings offer structural
      insights into this important target in molecular psychiatry.

TI  - Coordinate actions of innate immune responses oppose those of the adaptive immune
      system during Salmonella infection of mice.
PG  - ra4
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa9303 [doi]
AB  - The immune system enacts a coordinated response when faced with complex
      environmental and pathogenic perturbations. We used the heterogeneous responses
      of mice to persistent Salmonella infection to model system-wide coordination of
      the immune response to bacterial burden. We hypothesized that the variability in 
      outcomes of bacterial growth and immune response across genetically identical
      mice could be used to identify immune elements that serve as integrators enabling
      co-regulation and interconnectedness of the innate and adaptive immune systems.
      Correlation analysis of immune response variation to Salmonella infection linked 
      bacterial load with at least four discrete, interacting functional immune
      response "cassettes." One of these, the innate cassette, in the chronically
      infected mice included features of the innate immune system, systemic
      neutrophilia, and high serum concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-6. Compared with mice with a moderate bacterial load, mice with the
      highest bacterial burden exhibited high activity of this innate cassette, which
      was associated with a dampened activity of the adaptive T cell cassette-with
      fewer plasma cells and CD4(+) T helper 1 cells and increased numbers of
      regulatory T cells-and with a dampened activity of the cytokine signaling
      cassette. System-wide manipulation of neutrophil numbers revealed that
      neutrophils regulated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
      signaling in B cells during infection. Thus, a network-level approach
      demonstrated unappreciated interconnections that balanced innate and adaptive
      immune responses during the dynamic course of disease and identified signals
      associated with pathogen transmission status, as well as a regulatory role for
      neutrophils in cytokine signaling.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab2191 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of pattern recognition receptors,
      which mediate the responses of innate immune cells to microbial stimuli. To
      systematically determine the roles of proteins in canonical TLR signaling
      pathways, we conducted an RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen in human and mouse
      macrophages. We observed a pattern of conserved signaling module dependencies
      across species, but found notable species-specific requirements at the level of
      individual proteins. Among these, we identified unexpected differences in the
      involvement of members of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)
      family between the human and mouse TLR pathways. Whereas TLR signaling in mouse
      macrophages depended primarily on IRAK4 and IRAK2, with little or no role for
      IRAK1, TLR signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production in human macrophages
      depended on IRAK1, with knockdown of IRAK4 or IRAK2 having less of an effect.
      Consistent with species-specific roles for these kinases, IRAK4 orthologs failed 
      to rescue signaling in IRAK4-deficient macrophages from the other species, and
      only mouse macrophages required the kinase activity of IRAK4 to mediate TLR
      responses. The identification of a critical role for IRAK1 in TLR signaling in
      humans could potentially explain the association of IRAK1 with several autoimmune
      diseases. Furthermore, this study demonstrated how systematic screening can be
      used to identify important characteristics of innate immune responses across
      species, which could optimize therapeutic targeting to manipulate human
      TLR-dependent outputs.

AB  - Autophagy is a catabolic cellular mechanism that degrades dysfunctional proteins 
      and organelles. Atherosclerotic plaque formation is enhanced in mice with
      macrophages deficient for the critical autophagy protein ATG5. We showed that
      exposure of macrophages to lipids that promote atherosclerosis increased the
      abundance of the autophagy chaperone p62 and that p62 colocalized with
      polyubiquitinated proteins in cytoplasmic inclusions, which are characterized by 
      insoluble protein aggregates. ATG5-null macrophages developed further p62
      accumulation at the sites of large cytoplasmic ubiquitin-positive inclusion
      bodies. Aortas from atherosclerotic mice and plaques from human endarterectomy
      samples showed increased abundance of p62 and polyubiquitinated proteins that
      colocalized with plaque macrophages, suggesting that p62-enriched protein
      aggregates were characteristic of atherosclerosis. The formation of the
      cytoplasmic inclusions depended on p62 because lipid-loaded p62-null macrophages 
      accumulated polyubiquitinated proteins in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern.
      Lipid-loaded p62-null macrophages also exhibited increased secretion of
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and had an increased tendency to undergo apoptosis, 
      which depended on the p62 ubiquitin-binding domain and at least partly involved
      p62-mediated clearance of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Consistent with our in vitro
      observations, p62-deficient mice formed greater numbers of more complex
      atherosclerotic plaques, and p62 deficiency further increased atherosclerotic
      plaque burden in mice with a macrophage-specific ablation of ATG5. Together,
      these data suggested that sequestration of cytotoxic ubiquitinated proteins by
      p62 protects against atherogenesis, a condition in which the clearance of protein
      aggregates is disrupted.

TI  - Rosmarinic acid is a homoserine lactone mimic produced by plants that activates a
      bacterial quorum-sensing regulator.
PG  - ra1
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa8271 [doi]
AB  - Quorum sensing is a bacterial communication mechanism that controls genes,
      enabling bacteria to live as communities, such as biofilms. Homoserine lactone
      (HSL) molecules function as quorum-sensing signals for Gram-negative bacteria.
      Plants also produce previously unidentified compounds that affect quorum sensing.
      We identified rosmarinic acid as a plant-derived compound that functioned as an
      HSL mimic. In vitro assays showed that rosmarinic acid bound to the
      quorum-sensing regulator RhlR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and competed with
      the bacterial ligand N-butanoyl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). Furthermore,
      rosmarinic acid stimulated a greater increase in RhlR-mediated transcription in
      vitro than that of C4-HSL. In P. aeruginosa, rosmarinic acid induced quorum
      sensing-dependent gene expression and increased biofilm formation and the
      production of the virulence factors pyocyanin and elastase. Because P. aeruginosa
      PAO1 infection induces rosmarinic acid secretion from plant roots, our results
      indicate that rosmarinic acid secretion is a plant defense mechanism to stimulate
      a premature quorum-sensing response. P. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous pathogen that 
      infects plants and animals; therefore, identification of rosmarinic acid as an
      inducer of premature quorum-sensing responses may be useful in agriculture and
      inform human therapeutic strategies.

TI  - A calcium-accumulating region, CAR, in the channel Orai1 enhances Ca(2+)
      permeation and SOCE-induced gene transcription.
PG  - ra131
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab1901 [doi]
AB  - The Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel mediates Ca(2+) influx in a plethora 
      of cell types, thereby controlling diverse cellular functions. The channel
      complex is composed of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an endoplasmic
      reticulum Ca(2+)-sensing protein, and Orai1, a plasma membrane Ca(2+) channel.
      Channels composed of STIM1 and Orai1 mediate Ca(2+) influx even at low
      extracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. We investigated whether the activity of
      Orai1 adapted to different environmental Ca(2+) concentrations. We used homology 
      modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to predict the presence of an
      extracellular Ca(2+)-accumulating region (CAR) at the pore entrance of Orai1.
      Furthermore, simulations of Orai1 proteins with mutations in CAR, along with
      live-cell experiments, or simulations and electrophysiological recordings of the 
      channel with transient, electrostatic loop3 interacting with loop1 (the site of
      CAR) determined that CAR enhanced Ca(2+) permeation most efficiently at low
      external Ca(2+) concentrations. Consistent with these results, cells expressing
      Orai1 CAR mutants exhibited impaired gene expression stimulated by the
      Ca(2+)-activated transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).
      We propose that the Orai1 channel architecture with a close proximity of CAR to
      the selectivity filter, which enables Ca(2+)-selective ion permeation, enhances
      the local extracellular Ca(2+) concentration to maintain Ca(2+)-dependent gene
      regulation even in environments with relatively low Ca(2+)concentrations.

      activity predict the survival of neuroblastoma patients.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0990 [doi]
AB  - Signaling pathways control cell fate decisions that ultimately determine the
      behavior of cancer cells. Therefore, the dynamics of pathway activity may contain
      prognostically relevant information different from that contained in the static
      nature of other types of biomarkers. To investigate this hypothesis, we
      characterized the network that regulated stress signaling by the c-Jun N-terminal
      kinase (JNK) pathway in neuroblastoma cells. We generated an experimentally
      calibrated and validated computational model of this network and used the model
      to extract prognostic information from neuroblastoma patient-specific simulations
      of JNK activation. Switch-like JNK activation mediates cell death by apoptosis.
      An inability to initiate switch-like JNK activation in the simulations was
      significantly associated with poor overall survival for patients with
      neuroblastoma with or without MYCN amplification, indicating that
      patient-specific simulations of JNK activation could stratify patients.
      Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated that extracting information about a
      signaling pathway to develop a prognostically useful model requires understanding
      of not only components and disease-associated changes in the abundance or
      activity of the components but also how those changes affect pathway dynamics.

AB  - In this week's issue of Science Signaling, Fey et al. introduce a new type of
      biomarker. Using the example of neuroblastoma, the authors demonstrate that
      patient-specific differences in the computed property (the Hill coefficient) of
      the dynamics of a pathway involved in cell death signaling outperformed the
      prognostic capability of any single static biomarker alone or in combination.

TI  - Network-level effects of kinase inhibitors modulate TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis
      in the intestinal epithelium.
PG  - ra129
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac7235 [doi]
AB  - Individual signaling pathways operate in the context of the broader signaling
      network. Thus, the response of a cell to signals from the environment is affected
      by the state of the signaling network, such as the clinically relevant example of
      whether some components in the network are inhibited. The cytokine tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) promotes opposing cellular behaviors under different
      conditions; the outcome is influenced by the state of the network. For example,
      in the mouse intestinal epithelium, inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) kinase MEK alters the timing of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. We
      investigated whether MAPK signaling directly influences TNF-alpha-induced
      apoptosis or whether network-level effects secondary to inhibition of the MAPK
      pathway alter the cellular response. We found that inhibitors of the MAPK kinase 
      kinase Raf, MEK, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) exerted distinct 
      effects on the timing and magnitude of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in the mouse
      intestine. Furthermore, even different MEK inhibitors exerted distinct effects;
      one, CH5126766, potentiated TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, and the others reduced
      cell death. Computational modeling and experimental perturbation identified the
      kinase Akt as the primary signaling node that enhanced apoptosis in the context
      of TNF-alpha signaling in the presence of CH5126766. Our work emphasizes the
      importance of integrated network signaling in specifying cellular behavior in
      response to experimental or therapeutic manipulation. More broadly, this study
      highlighted the importance of considering the network-level effects of pathway
      inhibitors and showed the distinct effects of inhibitors that share the same
      target.

TI  - Depletion of H2S during obesity enhances store-operated Ca2+ entry in adipose
      tissue macrophages to increase cytokine production.
PG  - ra128
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac7135 [doi]
AB  - The increased production of proinflammatory cytokines by adipose tissue
      macrophages (ATMs) contributes to chronic, low-level inflammation during obesity.
      We found that obesity in mice reduced the bioavailability of the gaseous
      signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Steady-state, intracellular
      concentrations of H2S were lower in ATMs isolated from mice with diet-induced
      obesity than in ATMs from lean mice. In addition, the intracellular concentration
      of H2S in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was reduced during an acute
      inflammatory response evoked by the microbial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
      Reduced intracellular concentrations of H2S led to increased Ca(2+) influx
      through the store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) pathway, which was prevented by
      the exogenous H2S donor GYY4137. Furthermore, GYY4137 inhibited the Orai3
      channel, a key component of the SOCE machinery. The enhanced production of
      proinflammatory cytokines by RAW264.7 cells and ATMs from obese mice was reduced 
      by exogenous H2S or by inhibition of SOCE. Together, these data suggest that the 
      depletion of macrophage H2S that occurs during acute (LPS-induced) or chronic
      (obesity) inflammation increases SOCE through disinhibition of Orai3 and promotes
      the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  - Loss of FTO in adipose tissue decreases Angptl4 translation and alters
      triglyceride metabolism.
PG  - ra127
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3357 [doi]
AB  - A common variant of the FTO (fat mass- and obesity-associated) gene is a risk
      factor for obesity. We found that mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of FTO
      gained more weight than control mice on a high-fat diet. Analysis of mice lacking
      FTO in adipocytes fed a normal diet or adipocytes from these mice revealed
      alterations in triglyceride metabolism that would be expected to favor increased 
      fatty acid storage by adipose tissue. Mice lacking FTO in adipocytes showed
      increased serum triglyceride breakdown and clearance, which was associated with
      lower serum triglyceride concentrations. In addition, lipolysis in response to
      beta-adrenergic stimulation was decreased in adipocytes and ex vivo adipose
      explants from the mutant mice. FTO is a nucleic acid demethylase that removes
      N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) from mRNAs. We found that FTO bound to Angptl4,
      which encodes an adipokine that stimulates intracellular lipolysis in adipocytes.
      Unexpectedly, the adipose tissue of fasted or fed mice lacking FTO in adipocytes 
      had greater Angptl4 mRNA abundance. However, after high-fat feeding, the mutant
      mice had less Angptl4 protein and more m(6)A-modified Angptl4 than control mice, 
      suggesting that lack of FTO prevented the translation of Angptl4. Injection of
      Angptl4-encoding adenovirus into mice lacking FTO in adipocytes restored serum
      triglyceride concentrations and lipolysis to values similar to those in control
      mice and abolished excessive weight gain from a high-fat diet. These results
      reveal that FTO regulates fatty acid mobilization in adipocytes and thus body
      weight in part through posttranscriptional regulation of Angptl4.

TI  - The microRNA miR-485 targets host and influenza virus transcripts to regulate
      antiviral immunity and restrict viral replication.
PG  - ra126
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3183 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that are responsible for dynamic
      changes in gene expression, and some regulate innate antiviral responses.
      Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic sensor of viral RNA; RIG-I 
      activation induces an antiviral immune response. We found that miR-485 of the
      host was produced in response to viral infection and targeted RIG-I mRNA for
      degradation, which led to suppression of the antiviral response and enhanced
      viral replication. Thus, inhibition of the expression of mir-485 markedly reduced
      the replication of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and the H5N1 strain of influenza
      virus in mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, miR-485 also bound to the H5N1 gene PB1
      (which encodes an RNA polymerase required for viral replication) in a
      sequence-specific manner, thereby inhibiting replication of the H5N1 virus.
      Furthermore, miR-485 exhibited bispecificity, targeting RIG-I in cells with a low
      abundance of H5N1 virus and targeting PB1 in cells with increased amounts of the 
      H5N1 virus. These findings highlight the dual role of miR-485 in preventing
      spurious activation of antiviral signaling and restricting influenza virus
      infection.

TI  - Pleiotrophin promotes vascular abnormalization in gliomas and correlates with
      poor survival in patients with astrocytomas.
PG  - ra125
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa1690 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastomas are aggressive astrocytomas characterized by endothelial cell
      proliferation and abnormal vasculature, which can cause brain edema and increase 
      patient morbidity. We identified the heparin-binding cytokine pleiotrophin as a
      driver of vascular abnormalization in glioma. Pleiotrophin abundance was greater 
      in high-grade human astrocytomas and correlated with poor survival. Anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is a receptor that is activated by pleiotrophin, was
      present in mural cells associated with abnormal vessels. Orthotopically implanted
      gliomas formed from GL261 cells that were engineered to produce pleiotrophin
      showed increased microvessel density and enhanced tumor growth compared with
      gliomas formed from control GL261 cells. The survival of mice with
      pleiotrophin-producing gliomas was shorter than that of mice with gliomas that
      did not produce pleiotrophin. Vessels in pleiotrophin-producing gliomas were
      poorly perfused and abnormal, a phenotype that was associated with increased
      deposition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in direct proximity to
      the vasculature. The growth of pleiotrophin-producing GL261 gliomas was inhibited
      by treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, the ALK inhibitor ceritinib, or
      the VEGF receptor inhibitor cediranib, whereas control GL261 tumors did not
      respond to either inhibitor. Our findings link pleiotrophin abundance in gliomas 
      with survival in humans and mice, and show that pleiotrophin promotes glioma
      progression through increased VEGF deposition and vascular abnormalization.

TI  - The transcription factor ATF2 promotes melanoma metastasis by suppressing protein
      fucosylation.
PG  - ra124
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac6479 [doi]
AB  - Melanoma is one of the most lethal skin cancers worldwide, primarily because of
      its propensity to metastasize. Thus, the elucidation of mechanisms that govern
      metastatic propensity is urgently needed. We found that protein kinase Cepsilon
      (PKCepsilon)-mediated activation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)
      controls the migratory and invasive behaviors of melanoma cells.
      PKCepsilon-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 promoted its transcriptional
      repression of the gene encoding fucokinase (FUK), which mediates the fucose
      salvage pathway and thus global cellular protein fucosylation. In primary
      melanocytes and cell lines representing early-stage melanoma, the abundance of
      PKCepsilon-phosphorylated ATF2 was low, thereby enabling the expression of FUK
      and cellular protein fucosylation, which promoted cellular adhesion and reduced
      motility. In contrast, increased expression of the gene encoding PKCepsilon and
      abundance of phosphorylated, transcriptionally active ATF2 were observed in
      advanced-stage melanomas and correlated with decreased FUK expression, decreased 
      cellular protein fucosylation, attenuated cell adhesion, and increased cell
      motility. Restoring fucosylation in mice either by dietary fucose supplementation
      or by genetic manipulation of murine Fuk expression attenuated primary melanoma
      growth, increased the number of intratumoral natural killer cells, and decreased 
      distal metastasis in murine isograft models. Tumor microarray analysis of human
      melanoma specimens confirmed reduced fucosylation in metastatic tumors and a
      better prognosis for primary melanomas that had high abundance of fucosylation.
      Thus, inhibiting PKCepsilon or ATF2 or increasing protein fucosylation in tumor
      cells may improve clinical outcome in melanoma patients.

TI  - Identifying three-dimensional structures of autophosphorylation complexes in
      crystals of protein kinases.
PG  - rs13
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa6711 [doi]
AB  - Protein kinase autophosphorylation is a common regulatory mechanism in cell
      signaling pathways. Crystal structures of several homomeric protein kinase
      complexes have a serine, threonine, or tyrosine autophosphorylation site of one
      kinase monomer located in the active site of another monomer, a structural
      complex that we call an "autophosphorylation complex." We developed and applied a
      structural bioinformatics method to identify all such autophosphorylation
      complexes in x-ray crystallographic structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We
      identified 15 autophosphorylation complexes in the PDB, of which five complexes
      had not previously been described in the publications describing the crystal
      structures. These five complexes consist of tyrosine residues in the N-terminal
      juxtamembrane regions of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R, Tyr(561))
      and ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2, Tyr(594)), tyrosine residues in the activation
      loops of the SRC kinase family member LCK (Tyr(394)) and insulin-like growth
      factor 1 receptor (IGF1R, Tyr(1166)), and a serine in a nuclear localization
      signal region of CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2, Ser(142)). Mutations in the complex
      interface may alter autophosphorylation activity and contribute to disease;
      therefore, we mutated residues in the autophosphorylation complex interface of
      LCK and found that two mutations impaired autophosphorylation (T445V and N446A)
      and mutation of Pro(447) to Ala, Gly, or Leu increased autophosphorylation. The
      identified autophosphorylation sites are conserved in many kinases, suggesting
      that, by homology, these complexes may provide insight into autophosphorylation
      complex interfaces of kinases that are relevant drug targets.

      actions of G protein-coupled receptors.
PG  - ra123
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab4068 [doi]
AB  - Members of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G
      protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) family play key roles in many physiological
      functions and are extensively exploited pharmacologically to treat diseases. Many
      of the diverse effects of individual GPCRs on cellular physiology are transduced 
      by heterotrimeric G proteins, which are composed of alpha, beta, and gamma
      subunits. GPCRs interact with and stimulate the binding of guanosine triphosphate
      (GTP) to the alpha subunit to initiate signaling. Mammalian genomes encode 16
      different G protein alpha subunits, each one of which has distinct properties. We
      developed a single-platform, optical strategy to monitor G protein activation in 
      live cells. With this system, we profiled the coupling ability of individual
      GPCRs for different alpha subunits, simultaneously quantifying the magnitude of
      the signal and the rates at which the receptors activated the G proteins. We
      found that individual receptors engaged multiple G proteins with varying efficacy
      and kinetics, generating fingerprint-like profiles. Different classes of GPCR
      ligands, including full and partial agonists, allosteric modulators, and
      antagonists, distinctly affected these fingerprints to functionally bias GPCR
      signaling. Finally, we showed that intracellular signaling modulators further
      altered the G protein-coupling profiles of GPCRs, which suggests that their
      differential abundance may alter signaling outcomes in a cell-specific manner.
      These observations suggest that the diversity of the effects of GPCRs on cellular
      physiology may be determined by their differential engagement of multiple G
      proteins, coupling to which produces signals with varying signal magnitudes and
      activation kinetics, properties that may be exploited pharmacologically.

      fails to inhibit the inflammatory response.
PG  - ra122
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0949 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) mediates T cell receptor (TCR)
      signaling primarily to stimulate the production of cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5,
      and IL-13, from T helper 2 (TH2) cells. Compared to wild-type mice, ITK knockout 
      mice are resistant to asthma and exhibit reduced lung inflammation and decreased 
      amounts of TH2-type cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We found that 
      a small-molecule selective inhibitor of ITK blocked TCR-mediated signaling in
      cultured TH2 cells, including the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase
      C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) and the secretion of IL-2 and TH2-type cytokines.
      Unexpectedly, inhibition of the kinase activity of ITK during or after antigen
      rechallenge in an ovalbumin-induced mouse model of asthma failed to reduce airway
      hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. Rather, in mice, pharmacological inhibition
      of ITK resulted in T cell hyperplasia and the increased production of TH2-type
      cytokines. Thus, our studies predict that inhibition of the kinase activity of
      ITK may not be therapeutic in patients with asthma.

TI  - The early synthesis of p35 and activation of CDK5 in LPS-stimulated macrophages
      suppresses interleukin-10 production.
PG  - ra121
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3156 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine that is
      produced primarily by macrophages. We investigated mechanisms by which the timing
      of IL-10 production was controlled in macrophages and found that cyclin-dependent
      kinase 5 (CDK5) activity was markedly increased in lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-stimulated macrophages through the synthesis of the CDK5-binding partner
      and activator p35. Degradation of p35 released the inhibition on
      anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by CDK5-p35 complexes. The transiently
      active CDK5-p35 complexes limited the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation and
      activation of various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), thereby
      preventing the premature production of SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling
      3), an inhibitor of inflammatory responses in macrophages, and IL-10.
      Furthermore, we showed that dextran sodium sulfate failed to induce colitis in
      p35-deficient mice, which was associated with the enhanced production of IL-10 by
      macrophages. Together, our results suggest that CDK5 enhances the inflammatory
      function of macrophages by inhibiting the MAPK-dependent production of IL-10.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0667 [doi]
AB  - Cortactin is an F-actin-binding protein that localizes to the cell cortex, where 
      the actin remodeling that is required for cell migration occurs. We found that
      cortactin shuttled between the cytoplasm and the nucleus under basal conditions. 
      We identified Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a cytosolic protein
      that is involved in oxidant stress responses, as a binding partner of cortactin
      that promoted the cortical localization of cortactin and cell migration. The
      ability of cortactin to promote cell migration is regulated by various
      posttranslational modifications, including acetylation. We showed that the
      acetylated form of cortactin was mainly localized to the nucleus and that
      acetylation of cortactin decreased cell migration by inhibiting the binding of
      cortactin to Keap1. Our findings reveal that Keap1 regulates cell migration by
      affecting the subcellular localization and activity of cortactin independently of
      its role in oxidant stress responses.

TI  - Chaperoning epigenetics: FKBP51 decreases the activity of DNMT1 and mediates
      epigenetic effects of the antidepressant paroxetine.
PG  - ra119
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac7695 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, and molecular chaperones,
      including FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), are independently implicated in
      stress-related mental disorders and antidepressant drug action. FKBP51 associates
      with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which is one of several kinases that
      phosphorylates and activates DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). We searched for a
      functional link between FKBP51 (encoded by FKBP5) and DNMT1 in cells from mice
      and humans, including those from depressed patients, and found that FKBP51
      competed with its close homolog FKBP52 for association with CDK5. In human
      embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, expression of FKBP51 displaced FKBP52 from
      CDK5, decreased the interaction of CDK5 with DNMT1, reduced the phosphorylation
      and enzymatic activity of DNMT1, and diminished global DNA methylation. In mouse 
      embryonic fibroblasts and primary mouse astrocytes, FKBP51 mediated several
      effects of paroxetine, namely, decreased the protein-protein interactions of
      DNMT1 with CDK5 and FKBP52, reduced phosphorylation of DNMT1, and decreased the
      methylation and increased the expression of the gene encoding brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). In human peripheral blood cells, FKBP5 expression
      inversely correlated with both global and BDNF methylation. Peripheral blood
      cells isolated from depressed patients that were then treated ex vivo with
      paroxetine revealed that the abundance of BDNF positively correlated and
      phosphorylated DNMT1 inversely correlated with that of FKBP51 in cells and with
      clinical treatment success in patients, supporting the relevance of this
      FKBP51-directed pathway that prevents epigenetic suppression of gene expression.

TI  - The hepatitis C virus protein NS3 suppresses TNF-alpha-stimulated activation of
      NF-kappaB by targeting LUBAC.
PG  - ra118
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab2159 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is crucial for innate 
      immune defense against viral infections, and its activation requires the
      ubiquitylation of upstream proteins, including the adaptor protein NEMO
      (NF-kappaB essential modulator). Many infectious pathogens, including hepatitis C
      virus (HCV), inhibit NF-kappaB signaling in host cells, which promotes pathogen
      survival. Frequently, HCV-infected individuals develop a chronic infection, which
      suggests that HCV can subvert host antiviral responses. We found that HCV
      infection and replication inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB by the
      inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which was mediated
      by the viral protein NS3 and, to a lesser extent, NS5B. NS3 directly interacted
      with linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), competed with NEMO for
      binding to LUBAC, and inhibited the LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitylation of NEMO 
      and the subsequent activation of NF-kappaB. Together, our results highlight an
      immune evasion strategy adopted by HCV to modulate host antiviral responses and
      enhance virus survival and persistence.

TI  - The interaction of uPAR with VEGFR2 promotes VEGF-induced angiogenesis.
PG  - ra117
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa2403 [doi]
AB  - In endothelial cells, binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to the
      receptor VEGFR2 activates multiple signaling pathways that trigger processes such
      as proliferation, survival, and migration that are necessary for angiogenesis.
      VEGF-bound VEGFR2 becomes internalized, which is a key step in the proangiogenic 
      signal. We showed that the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)
      interacted with VEGFR2 and described the mechanism by which this interaction
      mediated VEGF signaling and promoted angiogenesis. Knockdown of uPAR in human
      umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired VEGFR2 signaling, and uPAR
      deficiency in mice prevented VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Upon exposure of HUVECs
      to VEGF, uPAR recruited the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
      (LRP-1) to VEGFR2, which induced VEGFR2 internalization. Thus, the uPAR-VEGFR2
      interaction is crucial for VEGF signaling in endothelial cells.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad5111 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological inhibitors against the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, a frequently deregulated
      signaling pathway in cancer, are clinically promising, but the development of
      drug resistance is a major limitation. We found that 4EBP1, the central inhibitor
      of cap-dependent translation, was a critical regulator of both prostate cancer
      initiation and maintenance downstream of mTOR signaling in a genetic mouse model.
      4EBP1 abundance was distinctly different between the epithelial cell types of the
      normal prostate. Of tumor-prone prostate epithelial cell types, luminal
      epithelial cells exhibited the highest transcript and protein abundance of 4EBP1 
      and the lowest protein synthesis rates, which mediated resistance to both
      pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
      Decreasing total 4EBP1 abundance reversed resistance in drug-insensitive cells.
      Increased 4EBP1 abundance was a common feature in prostate cancer patients who
      had been treated with the PI3K pathway inhibitor BKM120; thus, 4EBP1 may be
      associated with drug resistance in human tumors. Our findings reveal a molecular 
      program controlling cell type-specific 4EBP1 abundance coupled to the regulation 
      of global protein synthesis rates that renders each epithelial cell type of the
      prostate uniquely sensitive or resistant to inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
      signaling pathway.

TI  - The protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 promotes D2-like dopamine receptor
      signaling.
PG  - ra115
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0872 [doi]
AB  - Protein arginine methylation regulates diverse functions of eukaryotic cells,
      including gene expression, the DNA damage response, and circadian rhythms. We
      showed that arginine residues within the third intracellular loop of the human D2
      dopamine receptor, which are conserved in the DOP-3 receptor in the nematode
      Caenorhabditis elegans, were methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 5
      (PRMT5). By mutating these arginine residues, we further showed that their
      methylation enhanced the D2 receptor-mediated inhibition of cyclic adenosine
      monophosphate (cAMP) signaling in cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T
      cells. Analysis of prmt-5-deficient worms indicated that methylation promoted the
      dopamine-mediated modulation of chemosensory and locomotory behaviors in C.
      elegans through the DOP-3 receptor. In addition to delineating a previously
      uncharacterized means of regulating GPCR (heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor) signaling, these findings may lead
      to the development of a new class of pharmacological therapies that modulate GPCR
      signaling by changing the methylation status of these key proteins.

PG  - ra114
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab2677 [doi]
AB  - Cytokines dimerize cell surface receptors to activate signaling and regulate many
      facets of the immune response. Many cytokines have pleiotropic effects, inducing 
      a spectrum of redundant and distinct effects on different cell types. This
      pleiotropy has hampered cytokine-based therapies, and the high doses required for
      treatment often lead to off-target effects, highlighting the need for a more
      detailed understanding of the parameters controlling cytokine-induced signaling
      and bioactivities. Using the prototypical cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), we
      explored the interrelationships between receptor binding and a wide range of
      downstream cellular responses. We applied structure-based engineering to generate
      IL-13 variants that covered a spectrum of binding strengths for the receptor
      subunit IL-13Ralpha1. Engineered IL-13 variants representing a broad range of
      affinities for the receptor exhibited similar potencies in stimulating the
      phosphorylation of STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6).
      Delays in the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 were only
      apparent for those IL-13 variants with markedly reduced affinities for the
      receptor. From these data, we developed a mechanistic model that quantitatively
      reproduced the kinetics of STAT6 phosphorylation for the entire spectrum of
      binding affinities. Receptor endocytosis played a key role in modulating STAT6
      activation, whereas the lifetime of receptor-ligand complexes at the plasma
      membrane determined the potency of the variant for inducing more distal
      responses. This complex interrelationship between extracellular ligand binding
      and receptor function provides the foundation for new mechanism-based strategies 
      that determine the optimal cytokine dose to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Activation of mTORC1 in skeletal muscle regulates whole-body metabolism through
      FGF21.
PG  - ra113
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3715 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle is the largest organ, comprising 40% of the total body lean mass,
      and affects whole-body metabolism in multiple ways. We investigated the signaling
      pathways involved in this process using TSCmKO mice, which have a skeletal
      muscle-specific depletion of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1). This deficiency
      results in the constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
      (mTORC1), which enhances cell growth by promoting protein synthesis. TSCmKO mice 
      were lean, with increased insulin sensitivity, as well as changes in white and
      brown adipose tissue and liver indicative of increased fatty acid oxidation.
      These differences were due to increased plasma concentrations of fibroblast
      growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hormone that stimulates glucose uptake and fatty acid
      oxidation. The skeletal muscle of TSCmKO mice released FGF21 because of
      mTORC1-triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of a pathway
      involving PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase), eIF2alpha (eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 2alpha), and ATF4 (activating transcription factor 
      4). Treatment of TSCmKO mice with a chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress 
      reduced FGF21 production in muscle and increased body weight. Moreover, injection
      of function-blocking antibodies directed against FGF21 largely normalized the
      metabolic phenotype of the mice. Thus, sustained activation of mTORC1 signaling
      in skeletal muscle regulated whole-body metabolism through the induction of
      FGF21, which, over the long term, caused severe lipodystrophy.

TI  - Filamin A interacts with the coactivator MKL1 to promote the activity of the
      transcription factor SRF and cell migration.
PG  - ra112
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad2959 [doi]
AB  - Megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is a coactivator of serum response factor
      (SRF) that promotes the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation,
      motility, adhesion, and differentiation-processes that also involve dynamic
      cytoskeletal changes in the cell. MKL1 is inactive when bound to monomeric
      globular actin (G-actin), but signals that activate the small guanosine
      triphosphatase RhoA cause actin polymerization and MKL1 dissociation from
      G-actin. We found a new mechanism of MKL1 activation that is mediated through its
      binding to filamin A (FLNA), a protein that binds filamentous actin (F-actin).
      The interaction of FLNA and MKL1 was required for the expression of MKL1 target
      genes in primary fibroblasts, melanoma, mammary and hepatocellular carcinoma
      cells. We identified the regions of interaction between MKL1 and FLNA, and cells 
      expressing an MKL1 mutant that was unable to bind FLNA exhibited impaired cell
      migration and reduced expression of MKL1-SRF target genes. Induction and
      repression of MKL1-SRF target genes correlated with increased or decreased
      MKL1-FLNA interaction, respectively. Lysophosphatidic acid-induced RhoA
      activation in primary human fibroblasts promoted the association of endogenous
      MKL1 with FLNA, whereas exposure to an actin polymerization inhibitor dissociated
      MKL1 from FLNA and decreased MKL1-SRF target gene expression in melanoma cells.
      Thus, FLNA functions as a positive cellular transducer linking actin
      polymerization to MKL1-SRF activity, counteracting the known repressive complex
      of MKL1 and monomeric G-actin.

TI  - Neuregulin-activated ERBB4 induces the SREBP-2 cholesterol biosynthetic pathway
      and increases low-density lipoprotein uptake.
PG  - ra111
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac5124 [doi]
AB  - Cholesterol is a lipid that is critical for steroid hormone production and the
      integrity of cellular membranes, and, as such, it is essential for cell growth.
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family member ERBB4, which forms
      signaling complexes with other EGFR family members, can undergo ligand-induced
      proteolytic cleavage to release a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that enters 
      the nucleus to modify transcription. We found that ERBB4 activates sterol
      regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) to enhance low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis. Expression of the ERBB4 ICD in mammary
      epithelial cells or activation of ERBB4 with the ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1)
      induced the expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol
      biosynthesis, including HMGCR and HMGCS1, and lipid uptake, LDLR, which encodes
      the LDL receptor. Addition of NRG1 increased the abundance of the cleaved, mature
      form of SREBP-2 through a pathway that was blocked by addition of inhibitors of
      PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) or dual inhibition of mammalian target of
      rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, but not by inhibition of AKT or mTORC1. 
      Pharmacological inhibition of the activity of SREBP site 1 protease or of all
      EGFR family members (with lapatinib), but not EGFR alone (with erlotinib),
      impaired NRG1-induced expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes. Collectively,
      our findings indicated that activation of ERBB4 promotes SREBP-2-regulated
      cholesterol metabolism. The connections of EGFR and ERBB4 signaling with
      SREBP-2-regulated cholesterol metabolism are likely to be important in
      ERBB-regulated developmental processes and may contribute to metabolic remodeling
      in ERBB-driven cancers.

TI  - The mode of agonist binding to a G protein-coupled receptor switches the effect
      that voltage changes have on signaling.
PG  - ra110
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac7419 [doi]
AB  - Signaling by many heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G
      protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is either enhanced or attenuated by changes in
      plasma membrane potential. To identify structural correlates of the voltage
      sensitivity of GPCR signaling, we chose muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (the
      M1, M3, and M5 isoforms) as a model system. We combined molecular docking
      analysis with Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assays that
      monitored receptor activity under voltage clamp conditions. When human embryonic 
      kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing the individual receptors were stimulated with
      the agonist carbachol, membrane depolarization enhanced signaling by the M1
      receptor but attenuated signaling by the M3 and M5 receptors. Furthermore,
      whether membrane depolarization enhanced or inhibited receptor signaling depended
      on the type of agonist. Membrane depolarization attenuated M3 receptor signaling 
      when the receptor was bound to carbachol or acetylcholine, whereas depolarization
      enhanced signaling when the receptor was bound to either choline or pilocarpine. 
      Docking calculations predicted that there were two distinct binding modes for
      these ligands, which were associated with the effect of depolarization on
      receptor function. From these calculations, we identified a residue in the M3
      receptor that, when mutated, would alter the binding mode of carbachol to
      resemble that of pilocarpine in silico. Introduction of this mutated M3 receptor 
      into cells confirmed that the membrane depolarization enhanced, rather than
      attenuated, signaling by the carbachol-bound receptor. Together, these data
      suggest that the directionality of the voltage sensitivity of GPCR signaling is
      defined by the specific binding mode of each ligand to the receptor.

TI  - Deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of iRhom1 and iRhom2 promote shedding of the 
      TNF receptor by the protease ADAM17.
PG  - ra109
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac5356 [doi]
AB  - The protease ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) catalyzes the
      shedding of various transmembrane proteins from the surface of cells, including
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its receptors. Liberation of TNF receptors
      (TNFRs) from cell surfaces can dampen the cellular response to TNF, a cytokine
      that is critical in the innate immune response and promotes programmed cell death
      but can also promote sepsis. Catalytically inactive members of the rhomboid
      family of proteases, iRhom1 and iRhom2, mediate the intracellular transport and
      maturation of ADAM17. Using a genetic screen, we found that the presence of
      either iRhom1 or iRhom2 lacking part of their extended amino-terminal cytoplasmic
      domain (herein referred to as DeltaN) increases ADAM17 activity, TNFR shedding,
      and resistance to TNF-induced cell death in fibrosarcoma cells. Inhibitors of
      ADAM17, but not of other ADAM family members, prevented the effects of
      iRhom-DeltaN expression. iRhom1 and iRhom2 were functionally redundant,
      suggesting a conserved role for the iRhom amino termini. Cells from patients with
      a dominantly inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome called tylosis with
      esophageal cancer (TOC) have amino-terminal mutations in iRhom2. Keratinocytes
      from TOC patients exhibited increased TNFR1 shedding compared with cells from
      healthy donors. Our results explain how loss of the amino terminus in iRhom1 and 
      iRhom2 impairs TNF signaling, despite enhancing ADAM17 activity, and may explain 
      how mutations in the amino-terminal region contribute to the cancer
      predisposition syndrome TOC.

AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is among the most
      frequently altered in cancer. Now, two studies show that a mutated oncogenic
      PI3Kalpha, commonly found in breast cancer, leads to dedifferentiation or
      destabilization of luminal and basal epithelial lineages, which in turn leads to 
      increased cancer cell heterogeneity.

TI  - Ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of NKG2D-DAP10 receptor complexes activates
      signaling and functions in human NK cells.
PG  - ra108
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab2724 [doi]
AB  - Cytotoxic lymphocytes share the presence of the activating receptor NK receptor
      group 2, member D (NKG2D) and the signaling-competent adaptor DNAX-activating
      protein 10 (DAP10), which together play an important role in antitumor immune
      surveillance. Ligand stimulation induces the internalization of NKG2D-DAP10
      complexes and their delivery to lysosomes for degradation. In experiments with
      human NK cells and cell lines, we found that the ligand-induced endocytosis of
      NKG2D-DAP10 depended on the ubiquitylation of DAP10, which was also required for 
      degradation of the internalized complexes. Moreover, through combined biochemical
      and microscopic analyses, we showed that ubiquitin-dependent receptor endocytosis
      was required for the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
      and NK cell functions, such as the secretion of cytotoxic granules and the
      inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma. These results suggest that NKG2D-DAP10
      endocytosis represents a means to decrease cell surface receptor abundance, as
      well as to control signaling outcome in cytotoxic lymphocytes.

TI  - Genome-wide RNAi screening implicates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Sherpa in mediating
      innate immune signaling by Toll in Drosophila adults.
PG  - ra107
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005971 [doi]
AB  - The Drosophila Toll pathway plays important roles in innate immune responses
      against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. To identify previously uncharacterized 
      components of this pathway, we performed comparative, ex vivo, genome-wide RNA
      interference screening. In four screens, we overexpressed the Toll adaptor
      protein dMyd88, the downstream kinase Pelle, or the nuclear factor kappaB
      (NF-kappaB) homolog Dif, or we knocked down Cactus, the Drosophila homolog of
      mammalian inhibitor of NF-kappaB. On the basis of these screens, we identified
      the E3 ubiquitin ligase Sherpa as being necessary for the activation of Toll
      signaling. A loss-of-function sherpa mutant fly exhibited compromised production 
      of antimicrobial peptides and enhanced susceptibility to infection by
      Gram-positive bacteria. In cultured cells, Sherpa mediated ubiquitylation of
      dMyd88 and Sherpa itself, and Sherpa and Drosophila SUMO (small ubiquitin-like
      modifier) were required for the proper membrane localization of an adaptor
      complex containing dMyd88. These findings highlight a role for Sherpa in
      Drosophila host defense and suggest the SUMOylation-mediated regulation of dMyd88
      functions in Toll innate immune signaling.

TI  - Phosphorylation of STAT3 mediates the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by cortisol
      in the human amnion at parturition.
PG  - ra106
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac6151 [doi]
AB  - The induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and subsequent production of
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by cortisol in the amnion contrast with the effect of
      cortisol on most other tissues, but this proinflammatory effect of cortisol may
      be a key event in human parturition (labor). We evaluated the underlying
      mechanism activated by cortisol in primary human amnion fibroblasts. Exposure of 
      the amnion fibroblasts to cortisol led to the activation of the cyclic adenosine 
      monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, which induced the
      phosphorylation of the kinase SRC and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3). STAT3 interacted with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the 
      transcription factor CREB-1 (cAMP response element-binding protein 1) at the
      promoter of the gene encoding COX-2, which promoted the production of the
      secreted prostaglandin PGE2. PGE2 activates the prostaglandin receptors EP2 and
      EP4, which stimulate cAMP-PKA signaling. Thus, cortisol reinforced the activation
      of cAMP-PKA signaling through an SRC-STAT3-COX-2-PGE2-mediated feedback loop.
      Inhibiting STAT3, SRC, or the cAMP-PKA pathway attenuated the cortisol-stimulated
      induction of COX-2 and PGE2 production in amnion fibroblasts. In human amnion
      tissue, the amount of phosphorylated STAT3 correlated positively with that of
      cortisol, COX-2, and PGE2, and all were more abundant in tissue obtained after
      active labor than in tissue obtained from cesarean surgeries in the absence of
      labor. These results indicated that the coordinated recruitment of STAT3, CREB-1,
      and GR to the promoter of the gene encoding COX-2 contributes to the feed-forward
      induction of COX-2 activity and prostaglandin synthesis in the amnion during
      parturition.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are thought to play an important role in parturition. Two recent 
      articles by Di Stefano et al. in the Archives and Wang et al. in this issue of
      Science Signaling reveal novel mechanisms by which glucocorticoid signaling can
      drive the epigenetic and transcriptional machinery to induce molecules involved
      in parturition, including the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH),
      the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and the autacoid hormone prostaglandin E2.
      These findings contribute to our understanding of how glucocorticoids may
      regulate human parturition.

PG  - re10
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aad0416 [doi]
AB  - The highly conserved wiring of the SMAD-dependent transforming growth factor beta
      (TGFbeta) superfamily signaling pathway has been mapped over the last 20 years
      after molecular discovery of its component parts. Numerous alternative
      TGFbeta-activated signaling pathways that elicit SMAD-independent biological
      responses also exist. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
      renowned context dependency of TGFbeta signaling output remains an active and
      often confounding area of research, providing a prototype relevant to regulation 
      of other signaling pathways. Highlighting discoveries presented at the 9th FASEB 
      meeting, The TGFbeta Superfamily: Signaling in Development and Disease (July
      12-17th 2015 in Snowmass, Colorado), this Review outlines research into the rich 
      contextual nature of TGFbeta signaling output and offers clues for therapeutic
      advances.

TI  - Abnormal mechanosensing and cofilin activation promote the progression of
      ascending aortic aneurysms in mice.
PG  - ra105
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3141 [doi]
AB  - Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and the extracellular matrix (ECM) are intimately
      associated in the aortic wall. Fbln4(SMKO) mice with an SMC-specific deletion of 
      the Fbln4 gene, which encodes the vascular ECM component fibulin-4, develop
      ascending aortic aneurysms that have increased abundance of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); inhibiting angiotensin II signaling within
      the first month of life prevents aneurysm development. We used comparative
      proteomics analysis of Fbln4(SMKO) aortas from postnatal day (P) 1 to P30 mice to
      identify key molecules involved in aneurysm initiation and expansion. At P14, the
      actin depolymerizing factor cofilin was dephosphorylated and thus activated, and 
      at P7, the abundance of slingshot-1 (SSH1) phosphatase, an activator of cofilin, 
      was increased, leading to actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Also, by P7,
      biomechanical changes and underdeveloped elastic lamina-SMC connections were
      evident, and the abundance of early growth response 1 (Egr1), a mechanosensitive 
      transcription factor that stimulates ACE expression, was increased, which was
      before the increases in ACE abundance and cofilin activation. Postnatal deletion 
      of Fbln4 in SMCs at P7 prevented cofilin activation and aneurysm formation,
      suggesting that these processes required disruption of elastic lamina-SMC
      connections. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is involved in the angiotensin
      II-mediated activation of SSH1, and administration of PI3K inhibitors from P7 to 
      P30 decreased SSH1 abundance and prevented aneurysms. These results suggest that 
      aneurysm formation arises from abnormal mechanosensing of SMCs resulting from the
      loss of elastic lamina-SMC connections and from increased SSH1 and cofilin
      activity, which may be potential therapeutic targets for treating ascending
      aortic aneurysms.

TI  - CD4+ T cell-dependent and CD4+ T cell-independent cytokine-chemokine network
      changes in the immune responses of HIV-infected individuals.
PG  - ra104
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0808 [doi]
AB  - A vital defect in the immune systems of HIV-infected individuals is the loss of
      CD4(+) T cells, resulting in impaired immune responses. We hypothesized that
      there were CD4(+) T cell-dependent and CD4(+) T cell-independent alterations in
      the immune responses of HIV-1(+) individuals. To test this, we analyzed the
      secretion of cytokines and chemokines from stimulated peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations from HIV(+) donors, healthy donors, and
      healthy donors with CD4(+) T cells experimentally depleted. Multivariate analyses
      of 16 cytokines and chemokines at 6 and 72 hours after three stimuli
      (antibody-coated beads to stimulate T cells and R848 or lipopolysaccharide to
      stimulate innate immune cells) enabled integrative analysis of secreted profiles.
      Two major effects in HIV(+) PBMCs were not reproduced upon depletion of CD4(+) T 
      cells in healthy PBMCs: (i) HIV(+) PBMCs maintained T cell-associated secreted
      profiles after T cell stimulation; (ii) HIV(+) PBMCs showed impaired
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion early after innate stimulation. These
      changes arose from hyperactive T cells and debilitated natural killer (NK) cell, 
      respectively. Modeling and experiments showed that early IFN-gamma secretion
      predicted later differences in secreted profiles in vitro. This effect was
      recapitulated in healthy PBMCs by blocking the IFN-gamma receptor. Thus, we
      identified a critical deficiency in NK cell responses of HIV-infected
      individuals, independent of CD4(+) T cell depletion, which directs secreted
      profiles. Our findings illustrate a broad approach for identifying key
      disease-associated nodes in a multicellular, multivariate signaling network.

TI  - Essential roles for Cavbeta2 and Cav1 channels in thymocyte development and T
      cell homeostasis.
PG  - ra103
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac7538 [doi]
AB  - Calcium ions (Ca(2+)) are important in numerous signal transduction processes,
      including the development and differentiation of T cells in the thymus. We report
      that thymocytes have multiple types of pore-forming alpha subunits and regulatory
      beta subunits that constitute voltage-gated Ca(2+) (Cav) channels. In mice, T
      cell-specific deletion of the gene encoding the beta2 regulatory subunit of Cav
      channels (Cacnb2) reduced the abundances of the channels Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 (both 
      of which contain pore-forming alpha1 subunits) and impaired T cell development,
      which led to a substantial decrease in the numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T
      cells. Similar to the effect of Cacnb2 deficiency, pharmacological blockade of
      pore-forming Cav1alpha subunits reduced the sustained Ca(2+) influx in thymocytes
      upon stimulation of the T cell receptor, decreased the abundance of the
      transcription factor NFATc3, inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes in vitro, 
      and led to lymphopenia in mice. Together, our data suggest that Cav1 channels are
      conduits for the sustained Ca(2+) influx that is required for the development of 
      T cells.

AB  - Protein phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism controlling mitotic 
      progression. Protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) is an essential enzyme with conserved
      roles in chromosome segregation and spindle assembly from yeast to humans. We
      applied a baculovirus-mediated gene silencing approach to deplete HeLa cells of
      the catalytic subunit of PP6 (PP6c) and analyzed changes in the phosphoproteome
      and proteome in mitotic cells by quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics.
      We identified 408 phosphopeptides on 272 proteins that increased and 298
      phosphopeptides on 220 proteins that decreased in phosphorylation upon PP6c
      depletion in mitotic cells. Motif analysis of the phosphorylated sites combined
      with bioinformatics pathway analysis revealed previously unknown PP6c-dependent
      regulatory pathways. Biochemical assays demonstrated that PP6c opposed casein
      kinase 2-dependent phosphorylation of the condensin I subunit NCAP-G, and
      cellular analysis showed that depletion of PP6c resulted in defects in chromosome
      condensation and segregation in anaphase, consistent with dysregulation of
      condensin I function in the absence of PP6 activity.

TI  - Frontrunners of T cell activation: Initial, localized Ca2+ signals mediated by
      NAADP and the type 1 ryanodine receptor.
PG  - ra102
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0863 [doi]
AB  - The activation of T cells is the fundamental on switch for the adaptive immune
      system. Ca(2+) signaling is essential for T cell activation and starts as
      initial, short-lived, localized Ca(2+) signals. The second messenger nicotinic
      acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) forms rapidly upon T cell activation 
      and stimulates early Ca(2+) signaling. We developed a high-resolution imaging
      technique using multiple fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator dyes to characterize these 
      early signaling events and investigate the channels involved in NAADP-dependent
      Ca(2+) signals. In the first seconds of activation of either primary murine T
      cells or human Jurkat cells with beads coated with an antibody against CD3, we
      detected Ca(2+) signals with diameters close to the limit of detection and that
      were close to the activation site at the plasma membrane. In Jurkat cells in
      which the ryanodine receptor (RyR) was knocked down or in primary T cells from
      RyR1(-/-) mice, either these early Ca(2+) signals were not detected or the number
      of signals was markedly reduced. Local Ca(2+) signals observed within 20 ms upon 
      microinjection of Jurkat cells with NAADP were also sensitive to RyR knockdown.
      In contrast, TRPM2 (transient receptor potential channel, subtype melastatin 2), 
      a potential NAADP target channel, was not required for the formation of initial
      Ca(2+) signals in primary T cells. Thus, through our high-resolution imaging
      method, we characterized early Ca(2+) release events in T cells and obtained
      evidence for the involvement of RyR and NAADP in such signals.

TI  - The Golgi apparatus is a functionally distinct Ca2+ store regulated by the PKA
      and Epac branches of the beta1-adrenergic signaling pathway.
PG  - ra101
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa7677 [doi]
AB  - Ca(2+) release from the Golgi apparatus regulates key functions of the organelle,
      including vesicle trafficking. We found that the Golgi apparatus was the source
      of prolonged Ca(2+) release events that originated near the nuclei of primary
      cardiomyocytes. Golgi Ca(2+) release was unaffected by depletion of sarcoplasmic 
      reticulum Ca(2+), and disruption of the Golgi apparatus abolished Golgi Ca(2+)
      release without affecting sarcoplasmic reticulum function, suggesting functional 
      and spatial independence of Golgi and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores.
      beta1-Adrenoceptor stimulation triggers the production of the second messenger
      cAMP, which activates the Epac family of Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factors 
      and the kinase PKA (protein kinase A). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs), including those
      in the PDE3 and PDE4 families, degrade cAMP. Activation of beta1-adrenoceptors
      stimulated Golgi Ca(2+) release, an effect that required activation of Epac, PKA,
      and the kinase CaMKII. Inhibition of PDE3s or PDE4s potentiated
      beta1-adrenergic-induced Golgi Ca(2+) release, which is consistent with
      compartmentalization of cAMP signaling near the Golgi apparatus. Interventions
      that stimulated Golgi Ca(2+) release appeared to increase the trafficking of
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) from the Golgi apparatus 
      to the surface membrane of cardiomyocytes. In cardiomyocytes from rats with heart
      failure, decreases in the abundance of PDE3s and PDE4s were associated with
      increased Golgi Ca(2+) release events. These data suggest that the Golgi
      apparatus is a focal point for beta1-adrenergic-stimulated Ca(2+) signaling and
      that the Golgi Ca(2+) store functions independently from the sarcoplasmic
      reticulum and the global Ca(2+) transients that trigger contraction in
      cardiomyocytes.

      network for stochastic all-or-none hyperpigmentation.
PG  - ra99
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac6609 [doi]
AB  - Experimentally induced depolarization of resting membrane potential in
      "instructor cells" in Xenopus laevis embryos causes hyperpigmentation in an
      all-or-none fashion in some tadpoles due to excess proliferation and migration of
      melanocytes. We showed that this stochastic process involved serotonin signaling,
      adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), and the transcription factors cAMP response
      element-binding protein (CREB), Sox10, and Slug. Transcriptional microarray
      analysis of embryos taken at stage 15 (early neurula) and stage 45 (free-swimming
      tadpole) revealed changes in the abundance of 45 and 517 transcripts,
      respectively, between control embryos and embryos exposed to the instructor
      cell-depolarizing agent ivermectin. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the
      human homologs of some of the differentially regulated genes were associated with
      cancer, consistent with the induced arborization and invasive behavior of
      converted melanocytes. We identified a physiological circuit that uses
      serotonergic signaling between instructor cells, melanotrope cells of the
      pituitary, and melanocytes to control the proliferation, cell shape, and
      migration properties of the pigment cell pool. To understand the stochasticity
      and properties of this multiscale signaling system, we applied a computational
      machine-learning method that iteratively explored network models to
      reverse-engineer a stochastic dynamic model that recapitulated the frequency of
      the all-or-none hyperpigmentation phenotype produced in response to various
      pharmacological and molecular genetic manipulations. This computational approach 
      may provide insight into stochastic cellular decision-making that occurs during
      normal development and pathological conditions, such as cancer.

TI  - Tumor-selective proteotoxicity of verteporfin inhibits colon cancer progression
      independently of YAP1.
PG  - ra98
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac5418 [doi]
AB  - Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo
      signaling pathway. Increased YAP1 activity promotes the growth of tumors,
      including that of colorectal cancer (CRC). Verteporfin, a drug that enhances
      phototherapy to treat neovascular macular degeneration, is an inhibitor of YAP1. 
      We found that verteporfin inhibited tumor growth independently of its effects on 
      YAP1 or the related protein TAZ in genetically or chemically induced mouse models
      of CRC, in patient-derived xenografts, and in enteroid models of CRC. Instead,
      verteporfin exhibited in vivo selectivity for killing tumor cells in part by
      impairing the global clearance of high-molecular weight oligomerized proteins,
      particularly p62 (a sequestrome involved in autophagy) and STAT3 (signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 3; a transcription factor). Verteporfin
      inhibited cytokine-induced STAT3 activity and cell proliferation and reduced the 
      viability of cultured CRC cells. Although verteporfin accumulated to a greater
      extent in normal cells than in tumor cells in vivo, experiments with cultured
      cells indicated that the normal cells efficiently cleared verteporfin-induced
      protein oligomers through autophagic and proteasomal pathways. Culturing CRC
      cells under hypoxic or nutrient-deprived conditions (modeling a typical CRC
      microenvironment) impaired the clearance of protein oligomers and resulted in
      cell death, whereas culturing cells under normoxic or glucose-replete conditions 
      protected cell viability and proliferation in the presence of verteporfin.
      Furthermore, verteporfin suppressed the proliferation of other cancer cell lines 
      even in the absence of YAP1, suggesting that verteporfin may be effective against
      multiple types of solid cancers.

TI  - The kinases NDR1/2 act downstream of the Hippo homolog MST1 to mediate both
      egress of thymocytes from the thymus and lymphocyte motility.
PG  - ra100
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab2425 [doi]
AB  - The serine and threonine kinase MST1 is the mammalian homolog of Hippo. MST1 is a
      critical mediator of the migration, adhesion, and survival of T cells; however,
      these functions of MST1 are independent of signaling by its typical effectors,
      the kinase LATS and the transcriptional coactivator YAP. The kinase NDR1, a
      member of the same family of kinases as LATS, functions as a tumor suppressor by 
      preventing T cell lymphomagenesis, which suggests that it may play a role in T
      cell homeostasis. We generated and characterized mice with a T cell-specific
      double knockout of Ndr1 and Ndr2 (Ndr DKO). Compared with control mice, Ndr DKO
      mice exhibited a substantial reduction in the number of naive T cells in their
      secondary lymphoid organs. Mature single-positive thymocytes accumulated in the
      thymus in Ndr DKO mice. We also found that NDRs acted downstream of MST1 to
      mediate the egress of mature thymocytes from the thymus, as well as the
      interstitial migration of naive T cells within popliteal lymph nodes. Together,
      our findings indicate that the kinases NDR1 and NDR2 function as downstream
      effectors of MST1 to mediate thymocyte egress and T cell migration.

TI  - Glutamine-dependent alpha-ketoglutarate production regulates the balance between 
      T helper 1 cell and regulatory T cell generation.
PG  - ra97
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab2610 [doi]
AB  - T cell activation requires that the cell meet increased energetic and
      biosynthetic demands. We showed that exogenous nutrient availability regulated
      the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into distinct subsets. Activation of 
      naive CD4(+) T cells under conditions of glutamine deprivation resulted in their 
      differentiation into Foxp3(+) (forkhead box P3-positive) regulatory T (Treg)
      cells, which had suppressor function in vivo. Moreover, glutamine-deprived CD4(+)
      T cells that were activated in the presence of cytokines that normally induce the
      generation of T helper 1 (TH1) cells instead differentiated into Foxp3(+) Treg
      cells. We found that alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG), the glutamine-derived
      metabolite that enters into the mitochondrial citric acid cycle, acted as a
      metabolic regulator of CD4(+) T cell differentiation. Activation of
      glutamine-deprived naive CD4(+) T cells in the presence of a cell-permeable
      alphaKG analog increased the expression of the gene encoding the TH1
      cell-associated transcription factor Tbet and resulted in their differentiation
      into TH1 cells, concomitant with stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin
      complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Together, these data suggest that a decrease in the
      intracellular amount of alphaKG, caused by the limited availability of
      extracellular glutamine, shifts the balance between the generation of TH1 and
      Treg cells toward that of a Treg phenotype.

      enhancement of cell surface delivery of TGF-beta receptors.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa9432 [doi]
AB  - Increased activity of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which binds to 
      and stimulates cell surface receptors, contributes to cancer progression and
      fibrosis by driving epithelial cells toward a migratory mesenchymal phenotype and
      increasing the abundance of extracellular matrix proteins. The abundance of
      TGF-beta receptors at the cell surface determines cellular responsiveness to
      TGF-beta, which is often produced by the same cells that have the receptors, and 
      thus serves as an autocrine signal. We found that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of
      AS160, a RabGAP [guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating protein], promoted 
      the translocation of TGF-beta receptors from intracellular stores to the plasma
      membrane of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and NMuMG epithelial cells. Consequently,
      insulin, which is commonly used to treat hyperglycemia and activates Akt
      signaling, increased the amount of TGF-beta receptors at the cell surface,
      thereby enhancing TGF-beta responsiveness. This insulin-induced increase in
      autocrine TGF-beta signaling contributed to insulin-induced gene expression
      responses, attenuated the epithelial phenotype, and promoted the migration of
      NMuMG cells. Furthermore, the enhanced delivery of TGF-beta receptors at the cell
      surface enabled insulin to increase TGF-beta-induced gene responses. The
      enhancement of TGF-beta responsiveness in response to Akt activation may help to 
      explain the biological effects of insulin, the progression of cancers in which
      Akt is activated, and the increased incidence of fibroses in diabetes.

AB  - Two recent papers center on the emerging intersection of DNA methylation and
      homeostatic plasticity. To better appreciate the context of these studies, we
      first briefly review the mechanistic connections between DNA methylation and
      plasticity before delving into the ways in which these two papers fortify the
      connection between synapse and nucleus but also highlight the need for studies
      with a broader perspective.

TI  - Rapid multiplex analysis of lipid raft components with single-cell resolution.
PG  - rs11
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac5584 [doi]
AB  - Lipid rafts, a distinct class of highly dynamic cell membrane microdomains, are
      integral to cell homeostasis, differentiation, and signaling. However, their
      quantitative examination is challenging when working with rare cells,
      developmentally heterogeneous cell populations, or molecules that only associate 
      weakly with lipid rafts. We present a fast biochemical method, which is based on 
      lipid raft components associating with the nucleus upon partial lysis during
      centrifugation through nonionic detergent. Requiring little starting material or 
      effort, our protocol enabled the multidimensional flow cytometric quantitation of
      raft-resident proteins with single-cell resolution, thereby assessing the
      membrane components from a few cells in complex cell populations, as well as
      their dynamics resulting from cell signaling, differentiation, or genetic
      mutation.

TI  - Dichotomous roles for externalized cardiolipin in extracellular signaling:
      Promotion of phagocytosis and attenuation of innate immunity.
PG  - ra95
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa6179 [doi]
AB  - Among the distinct molecular signatures present in the mitochondrion is the
      tetra-acylated anionic phospholipid cardiolipin, a lipid also present in
      primordial, single-cell bacterial ancestors of mitochondria and multiple
      bacterial species today. Cardiolipin is normally localized to the inner
      mitochondrial membrane; however, when cardiolipin becomes externalized to the
      surface of dysregulated mitochondria, it promotes inflammasome activation and
      stimulates the elimination of damaged or nonfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy.
      Given the immunogenicity of mitochondrial and bacterial membranes that are
      released during sterile and pathogen-induced trauma, we hypothesized that
      cardiolipins might function as "eat me" signals for professional phagocytes. In
      experiments with macrophage cell lines and primary macrophages, we found that
      membranes with mitochondrial or bacterial cardiolipins on their surface were
      engulfed through phagocytosis, which depended on the scavenger receptor CD36.
      Distinct from this process, the copresentation of cardiolipin with the Toll-like 
      receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide dampened TLR4-stimulated production 
      of cytokines. These data suggest that externalized, extracellular cardiolipins
      play a dual role in host-host and host-pathogen interactions by promoting
      phagocytosis and attenuating inflammatory immune responses.

TI  - SOCS3 in retinal neurons and glial cells suppresses VEGF signaling to prevent
      pathological neovascular growth.
PG  - ra94
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa8695 [doi]
AB  - Neurons and glial cells in the retina contribute to neovascularization, or the
      formation of abnormal new blood vessels, in proliferative retinopathy, a
      condition that can lead to vision loss or blindness. We identified a mechanism by
      which suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in neurons and glial cells
      prevents neovascularization. We found that Socs3 expression was increased in the 
      retinal ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers after oxygen-induced retinopathy. 
      Mice with Socs3 deficiency in neuronal and glial cells had substantially reduced 
      vaso-obliterated retinal areas and increased pathological retinal
      neovascularization in response to oxygen-induced retinopathy, suggesting that
      loss of neuronal/glial SOCS3 increased both retinal vascular regrowth and
      pathological neovascularization. Furthermore, retinal expression of Vegfa (which 
      encodes vascular endothelial growth factor A) was higher in these mice than in
      Socs3 flox/flox controls, indicating that neuronal and glial SOCS3 suppressed
      Vegfa expression during pathological conditions. Lack of neuronal and glial SOCS3
      resulted in greater phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, which led to
      increased expression of its gene target Vegfa, and increased endothelial cell
      proliferation. In summary, SOCS3 in neurons and glial cells inhibited the
      STAT3-mediated secretion of VEGF from these cells, which suppresses endothelial
      cell activation, resulting in decreased endothelial cell proliferation and
      angiogenesis. These results suggest that neuronal and glial cell SOCS3 limits
      pathological retinal angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF signaling.

PG  - rs10
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa3117 [doi]
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is a crucial posttranslational modification for
      regulating cellular processes in bacteria; however, it has not been extensively
      studied because of technical difficulties in the enrichment of phosphopeptides.
      We devised an enrichment protocol that enabled the identification of >1000
      phosphopeptides from a single bacterial sample. We discovered three
      high-confidence serine and threonine phosphorylation motifs, as well as 29 other 
      motifs at various levels of confidence, from three distinct bacterial
      phosphoproteomes. We found that the proline-directed and basophilic
      phosphorylation motifs that are commonly enriched in eukaryotes were not observed
      in bacteria. Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria had a low occurrence of both
      phosphorylation and acetylation in N-terminal phosphopeptides. Because infection 
      of host cells by bacterial pathogens is often accompanied by kinase-mediated
      phosphorylation events, the differences in phosphorylation preferences between
      bacteria and eukaryotes revealed by this study could be useful in identifying
      bacterial-specific targets for future therapies.

TI  - B cell antigen receptors of the IgM and IgD classes are clustered in different
      protein islands that are altered during B cell activation.
PG  - ra93
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005887 [doi]
AB  - The B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) play an important role in the clonal
      selection of B cells and their differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma
      cells. Mature B cells have both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgD types of BCRs,
      which have identical antigen-binding sites and are both associated with the
      signaling subunits Igalpha and Igbeta, but differ in their membrane-bound heavy
      chain isoforms. By two-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy 
      (dSTORM), we showed that IgM-BCRs and IgD-BCRs reside in the plasma membrane in
      different protein islands with average sizes of 150 and 240 nm, respectively.
      Upon B cell activation, the BCR protein islands became smaller and more dispersed
      such that the IgM-BCRs and IgD-BCRs were found in close proximity to each other. 
      Moreover, specific stimulation of one class of BCR had minimal effects on the
      organization of the other. These conclusions were supported by the findings from 
      two-marker transmission electron microscopy and proximity ligation assays.
      Together, these data provide evidence for a preformed multimeric organization of 
      BCRs on the plasma membrane that is remodeled after B cell activation.

TI  - An essential role for Galpha(i2) in Smoothened-stimulated epithelial cell
      proliferation in the mammary gland.
PG  - ra92
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa7355 [doi]
AB  - Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is critical for organogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and
      stem cell maintenance. The gene encoding Smoothened (SMO), the primary effector
      of Hh signaling, is expressed aberrantly in human breast cancer, as well as in
      other cancers. In mice that express a constitutively active form of SMO that does
      not require Hh stimulation in mammary glands, the cells near the transgenic cells
      proliferate and participate in hyperplasia formation. Although SMO is a
      seven-transmembrane receptor like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),
      SMO-mediated activation of the Gli family of transcription factors is not known
      to involve G proteins. However, data from Drosophila and mammalian cell lines
      indicate that SMO functions as a GPCR that couples to heterotrimeric G proteins
      of the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Galphai class. Using genetically modified 
      mice, we demonstrated that SMO signaling through G proteins occurred in the
      mammary gland in vivo. SMO-induced stimulation of proliferation was PTX-sensitive
      and required Galphai2, but not Galphai1, Galphai3, or activation of Gli1 or Gli2.
      Our findings show that activated SMO functions as a GPCR to stimulate
      proliferation in vivo, a finding that may have clinical importance because most
      SMO-targeted agents have been selected based largely on their ability to block
      Gli-mediated transcription.

TI  - Identification of potential drug targets for tuberous sclerosis complex by
      synthetic screens combining CRISPR-based knockouts with RNAi.
PG  - rs9
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3729 [doi]
AB  - The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) family of tumor suppressors, TSC1 and TSC2, 
      function together in an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that is a point 
      of convergence for major cell signaling pathways that regulate mTOR complex 1
      (mTORC1). Mutation or aberrant inhibition of the TSC complex is common in various
      human tumor syndromes and cancers. The discovery of novel therapeutic strategies 
      to selectively target cells with functional loss of this complex is therefore of 
      clinical relevance to patients with nonmalignant TSC and those with sporadic
      cancers. We developed a CRISPR-based method to generate homogeneous mutant
      Drosophila cell lines. By combining TSC1 or TSC2 mutant cell lines with RNAi
      screens against all kinases and phosphatases, we identified synthetic
      interactions with TSC1 and TSC2. Individual knockdown of three candidate genes
      (mRNA-cap, Pitslre, and CycT; orthologs of RNGTT, CDK11, and CCNT1 in humans)
      reduced the population growth rate of Drosophila cells lacking either TSC1 or
      TSC2 but not that of wild-type cells. Moreover, individual knockdown of these
      three genes had similar growth-inhibiting effects in mammalian TSC2-deficient
      cell lines, including human tumor-derived cells, illustrating the power of this
      cross-species screening strategy to identify potential drug targets.

TI  - Oxidized LDL-bound CD36 recruits an Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-Lyn complex in macrophages 
      that promotes atherosclerosis.
PG  - ra91
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa9623 [doi]
AB  - One characteristic of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of lipid-laden
      macrophage foam cells in the arterial wall. We have previously shown that the
      binding of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to the scavenger receptor
      CD36 activates the kinase Lyn, initiating a cascade that inhibits macrophage
      migration and is necessary for foam cell generation. We identified the plasma
      membrane ion transporter Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase as a key component in the macrophage
      oxLDL-CD36 signaling axis. Using peritoneal macrophages isolated from Atp1a1
      heterozygous or Cd36-null mice, we demonstrated that CD36 recruited an
      Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-Lyn complex for Lyn activation in response to oxLDL.
      Macrophages deficient in the alpha1 Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase catalytic subunit did not
      respond to activation of CD36, showing attenuated oxLDL uptake and foam cell
      formation, and oxLDL failed to inhibit migration of these macrophages.
      Furthermore, Apoe-null mice, which are a model of atherosclerosis, were protected
      from diet-induced atherosclerosis by global deletion of a single allele encoding 
      the alpha1 Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase subunit or reconstitution with macrophages that
      lacked an allele encoding the alpha1 Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase subunit. These findings
      identify Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase as a potential target for preventing or treating
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - The E3 ligase RNF43 inhibits Wnt signaling downstream of mutated beta-catenin by 
      sequestering TCF4 to the nuclear membrane.
PG  - ra90
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac6757 [doi]
AB  - Given its fundamental role in development and cancer, the Wnt-beta-catenin
      signaling pathway is tightly controlled at multiple levels. RING finger protein
      43 (RNF43) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase originally found in stem cells and proposed 
      to inhibit Wnt signaling by interacting with the Wnt receptors of the Frizzled
      family. We detected endogenous RNF43 in the nucleus of human intestinal crypt and
      colon cancer cells. We found that RNF43 physically interacted with T cell factor 
      4 (TCF4) in cells and tethered TCF4 to the nuclear membrane, thus silencing TCF4 
      transcriptional activity even in the presence of constitutively active mutants of
      beta-catenin. This inhibitory mechanism was disrupted by the expression of RNF43 
      bearing mutations found in human gastrointestinal tumors, and transactivation of 
      the Wnt pathway was observed in various cells and in Xenopus embryos when the
      RING domain of RNF43 was mutated. Our findings indicate that RNF43 inhibits the
      Wnt pathway downstream of oncogenic mutations that activate the pathway.
      Mimicking or enhancing this inhibitory activity of RNF43 may be useful to treat
      cancers arising from aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway.

TI  - Inactivation of PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors by tyrosine nitration may enable rapid
      inhibition of ABA signaling by nitric oxide in plants.
PG  - ra89
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa7981 [doi]
AB  - Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that inhibits growth and enhances
      adaptation to stress in plants. ABA perception and signaling rely on its binding 
      to receptors of the pyrabactin resistance1/PYR1-like/regulatory components of ABA
      receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) family, the subsequent inhibition of clade A type 2C
      protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), and the phosphorylation of ion channels and
      transcription factors by protein kinases of the SnRK2 family. Nitric oxide (NO)
      may inhibit ABA signaling because NO-deficient plants are hypersensitive to ABA. 
      Regulation by NO often involves posttranslational modification of proteins. Mass 
      spectrometry analysis of ABA receptors expressed in plants and recombinant
      receptors modified in vitro revealed that the receptors were nitrated at tyrosine
      residues and S-nitrosylated at cysteine residues. In an in vitro ABA-induced,
      PP2C inhibition assay, tyrosine nitration reduced receptor activity, whereas
      S-nitrosylated receptors were fully capable of ABA-induced inhibition of the
      phosphatase. PYR/PYL/RCAR proteins with nitrated tyrosine, which is an
      irreversible covalent modification, were polyubiquitylated and underwent
      proteasome-mediated degradation. We propose that tyrosine nitration, which
      requires NO and superoxide anions, is a rapid mechanism by which NO limits ABA
      signaling under conditions in which NO and reactive oxygen species are both
      produced.

TI  - The adaptor protein TRAF3 inhibits interleukin-6 receptor signaling in B cells to
      limit plasma cell development.
PG  - ra88
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa5157 [doi]
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is an adaptor protein 
      that inhibits signaling by CD40 and by the receptor for B cell-activating factor 
      (BAFF) and negatively regulates homeostatic B cell survival. Loss-of-function
      mutations in TRAF3 are associated with human B cell malignancies, in particular
      multiple myeloma. The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) supports the differentiation 
      and survival of normal and neoplastic plasma cells. We found that mice with a
      deficiency in TRAF3 specifically in B cells (B-Traf3(-/-) mice) had about twice
      as many plasma cells as did their littermate controls. TRAF3-deficient B cells
      had enhanced responsiveness to IL-6, and genetic loss of IL-6 in B-Traf3(-/-)
      mice restored their plasma cell numbers to normal. TRAF3 inhibited IL-6 receptor 
      (IL-6R)-mediated signaling by facilitating the association of PTPN22 (a
      nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase) with the kinase Janus-activated kinase 
      1 (Jak1), which in turn blocked phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3
      (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Consistent with these
      results, the number of plasma cells in the PTPN22-deficient mice was increased
      compared to that in the wild-type mice. Our findings identify TRAF3 and PTPN22 as
      inhibitors of IL-6R signaling in B cells and reveal a previously uncharacterized 
      role for TRAF3 in the regulation of plasma cell differentiation.

TI  - The E3 ligase APC/C(Cdh1) promotes ubiquitylation-mediated proteolysis of PAX3 to
      suppress melanocyte proliferation and melanoma growth.
PG  - ra87
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab1995 [doi]
AB  - The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome with the subunit Cdh1 (APC/C(Cdh1))
      is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the control of the cell cycle. Here, we
      identified sporadic mutations occurring in the genes encoding APC components,
      including Cdh1, in human melanoma samples and found that loss of APC/C(Cdh1) may 
      promote melanoma development and progression, but not by affecting cell cycle
      regulatory targets of APC/C. Most of the mutations we found in CDH1 were those
      associated with ultraviolet light (UV)-induced melanomagenesis. Compared with
      normal human skin tissue and human or mouse melanocytes, the abundance of Cdh1
      was decreased and that of the transcription factor PAX3 was increased in human
      melanoma tissue and human or mouse melanoma cell lines, respectively; Cdh1
      abundance was further decreased with advanced stages of human melanoma. PAX3 was 
      a substrate of APC/C(Cdh1) in melanocytes, and APC/C(Cdh1)-mediated
      ubiquitylation marked PAX3 for proteolytic degradation in a manner dependent on
      the D-box motif in PAX3. Either mutating the D-box in PAX3 or knocking down Cdh1 
      prevented the ubiquitylation and degradation of PAX3 and increased proliferation 
      and melanin production in melanocytes. Knocking down Cdh1 in melanoma cells in
      culture or before implantation in mice promoted doxorubicin resistance, whereas
      reexpressing wild-type Cdh1, but not E3 ligase-deficient Cdh1 or a mutant that
      could not interact with PAX3, restored doxorubicin sensitivity in melanoma cells 
      both in culture and in xenografts. Thus, our findings suggest a tumor suppressor 
      role for APC/C(Cdh1) in melanocytes and that targeting PAX3 may be a strategy for
      treating melanoma.

AB  - Double knockout of PTEN and LKB1-genes encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog
      and liver kinase B1, respectively-leads to the spontaneous development of cancer 
      in mice. PTEN converts phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) to
      phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), whereas LKB1 activates the 5'
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The kinase AKT and the
      kinase complex mTORC1 may play key roles in carcinogenesis and are components of 
      signaling pathways that also contain PTEN and LKB1. We propose that via
      activation of AKT and mTORC1, the double knockout of PTEN and LKB1 contributes to
      distinct cell-specific aspects of tumor development and progression. Whereas
      mTORC1 promotes cancer initiation and progression through cell growth, survival, 
      and proliferation, independent induction of the immune inhibitory molecule PD-L1 
      by activated AKT enables the tumors to evade immunosurveillance.

TI  - Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 promotes acute cellular and systemic
      inflammation.
PG  - ra86
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa3206 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory critical illness is a syndrome that is characterized by acute
      inflammation and organ injury, and it is triggered by infections and
      noninfectious tissue injury, both of which activate innate immune receptors and
      pathways. Although reports suggest an anti-inflammatory role for the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5
      (ERK5), we previously found that ERK5 mediates proinflammatory responses in
      primary human cells in response to stimulation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). We
      inhibited the kinase activities and reduced the abundances of ERK5 and MEK5, a
      MAPK kinase directly upstream of ERK5, in primary human vascular endothelial
      cells and monocytes, and found that ERK5 promoted inflammation induced by a broad
      range of microbial TLR agonists and by the proinflammatory cytokines
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
      Furthermore, we found that inhibitors of MEK5 or ERK5 reduced the plasma
      concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in mice challenged with TLR ligands
      or heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus, as well as in mice that underwent sterile
      lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. Finally, we found that inhibition of ERK5
      protected endotoxemic mice from death. Together, our studies support a
      proinflammatory role for ERK5 in primary human endothelial cells and monocytes,
      and suggest that ERK5 is a potential therapeutic target in diverse disorders that
      cause inflammatory critical illness.

TI  - RelB/p52-mediated NF-kappaB signaling alters histone acetylation to increase the 
      abundance of corticotropin-releasing hormone in human placenta.
PG  - ra85
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa9806 [doi]
AB  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) produced in the placenta may be part of a
      clock that regulates the length of human gestation. Maternal plasma CRH abundance
      exponentially increases as pregnancy advances. Glucocorticoid stimulates CRH
      expression in full-term human placenta by promoting noncanonical (RelB/p52
      heterodimer-mediated) nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway activity. Using
      dexamethasone to mimic glucocorticoid exposure, we found that an epigenetic
      switch mediated the glucocorticoid-induced expression of CRH as gestation
      advances. The amount of acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) associated with the
      CRH promoter was greater in cytotrophoblasts from full-term placenta than in
      those from midterm placenta. Knocking down the lysine acetyltransferase CBP
      reduced H3K9 histone acetylation and prevented dexamethasone-induced CRH
      expression. Unexpectedly, knocking down the histone deacetylase HDAC1 or
      pharmacologically inhibiting type I and II HDACs also decreased the expression of
      CRH yet increased the acetylation of H3K9 and other histone regions. Both CBP and
      HDAC1 bound at the CRH promoter in a complex with the RelB/p52 heterodimer in a
      mutually dependent manner; knocking down any one factor in the complex prevented 
      binding of the others as well as the dexamethasone-induced CRH expression. Our
      results suggest that glucocorticoids induce a transcription complex consisting of
      RelB/p52, CBP, and HDAC1 that triggers a dynamic acetylation-mediated epigenetic 
      change to induce CRH expression in full-term human placenta.

TI  - The G protein alpha subunit variant XLalphas promotes inositol
      1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling and mediates the renal actions of parathyroid
      hormone in vivo.
PG  - ra84
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa9953 [doi]
AB  - GNAS, which encodes the stimulatory G protein (heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein) alpha subunit (Galphas), also encodes a large variant
      of Galphas termed extra-large alpha subunit (XLalphas), and alterations in
      XLalphas abundance or activity are implicated in various human disorders.
      Although XLalphas, like Galphas, stimulates generation of the second messenger
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), evidence suggests that XLalphas and
      Galphas have opposing effects in vivo. We investigated the role of XLalphas in
      mediating signaling by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which activates a G
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that stimulates both Galphas and Galphaq/11 in
      renal proximal tubules to maintain phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. At
      postnatal day 2 (P2), XLalphas knockout (XLKO) mice exhibited hyperphosphatemia, 
      hypocalcemia, and increased serum concentrations of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
      D. The ability of PTH to reduce serum phosphate concentrations was impaired, and 
      the abundance of the sodium phosphate cotransporter Npt2a in renal brush border
      membranes was reduced in XLKO mice, whereas PTH-induced cAMP excretion in the
      urine was modestly increased. Basal and PTH-stimulated production of inositol
      1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which is the second messenger produced by Galphaq/11
      signaling, was repressed in renal proximal tubules from XLKO mice. Crossing of
      XLKO mice with mice overexpressing XLalphas specifically in renal proximal
      tubules rescued the phenotype of the XLKO mice. Overexpression of XLalphas in HEK
      293 cells enhanced IP3 generation in unstimulated cells and in cells stimulated
      with PTH or thrombin, which acts through a Gq/11-coupled receptor. Together, our 
      findings suggest that XLalphas enhances Gq/11 signaling to mediate the renal
      actions of PTH during early postnatal development.

TI  - Intravascular pressure enhances the abundance of functional Kv1.5 channels at the
      surface of arterial smooth muscle cells.
PG  - ra83
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac5128 [doi]
AB  - Voltage-dependent potassium (K(v)) channels are present in various cell types,
      including smooth muscle cells (myocytes) of resistance-sized arteries that
      control systemic blood pressure and regional organ blood flow. Intravascular
      pressure depolarizes arterial myocytes, stimulating calcium (Ca(2+)) influx
      through voltage-dependent Ca(2+) (Ca(v)) channels that results in
      vasoconstriction and also K(+) efflux through K(v) channels that oppose
      vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that pressure-induced depolarization may not
      only increase the open probability of plasma membrane-resident K(v) channels but 
      also increase the abundance of these channels at the surface of arterial myocytes
      to limit vasoconstriction. We found that K(v)1.5 and K(v)2.1 proteins were
      abundant in the myocytes of resistance-sized mesenteric arteries. K(v)1.5, but
      not K(v)2.1, continuously recycled between the intracellular compartment and the 
      plasma membrane in contractile arterial myocytes. Using ex vivo preparations of
      intact arteries, we showed that physiological intravascular pressure through
      membrane depolarization or membrane depolarization in the absence of pressure
      inhibited the degradation of internalized K(v)1.5 and increased recycling of
      K(v)1.5 to the plasma membrane. Accordingly, by stimulating the activity of
      Ca(v)1.2, membrane depolarization increased whole-cell K(v)1.5 current density in
      myocytes and K(v)1.5 channel activity in pressurized arteries. In contrast, the
      total amount and cell surface abundance of K(v)2.1 were independent of
      intravascular pressure or membrane potential. Thus, our data indicate that
      intravascular pressure-induced membrane depolarization selectively increased
      K(v)1.5 surface abundance to increase K(v) currents in arterial myocytes, which
      would limit vasoconstriction.

TI  - The transcription cofactor c-JUN mediates phenotype switching and BRAF inhibitor 
      resistance in melanoma.
PG  - ra82
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab1111 [doi]
AB  - Most patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma display remarkable but
      incomplete and short-lived responses to inhibitors of the BRAF kinase or the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), collectively BRAF/MEK inhibitors. 
      We found that inherent resistance to these agents in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma
      cell lines was associated with high abundance of c-JUN and characteristics of a
      mesenchymal-like phenotype. Early drug adaptation in drug-sensitive cell lines
      grown in culture or as xenografts, and in patient samples during therapy, was
      consistently characterized by down-regulation of SPROUTY4 (a negative feedback
      regulator of receptor tyrosine kinases and the BRAF-MEK signaling pathway),
      increased expression of JUN and reduced expression of LEF1. This coincided with a
      switch in phenotype that resembled an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In
      cultured cells, these BRAF inhibitor-induced changes were reversed upon removal
      of the drug. Knockdown of SPROUTY4 was sufficient to increase the abundance of
      c-JUN in the absence of drug treatment. Overexpressing c-JUN in drug-naive
      melanoma cells induced similar EMT-like phenotypic changes to BRAF inhibitor
      treatment, whereas knocking down JUN abrogated the BRAF inhibitor-induced early
      adaptive changes associated with resistance and enhanced cell death. Combining
      the BRAF inhibitor with an inhibitor of c-JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) reduced
      c-JUN phosphorylation, decreased cell migration, and increased cell death in
      melanoma cells. Gene expression data from a panel of melanoma cell lines and a
      patient cohort showed that JUN expression correlated with a mesenchymal gene
      signature, implicating c-JUN as a key mediator of the mesenchymal-like phenotype 
      associated with drug resistance.

PG  - ra81
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa2819 [doi]
AB  - Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) catalyzes the conversion of l-arginine
      and molecular oxygen into l-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous second
      messenger that influences cardiovascular physiology and disease. Several
      mechanisms regulate eNOS activity and function, including phosphorylation at Ser 
      and Thr residues and protein-protein interactions. Combining a tandem affinity
      purification approach and mass spectrometry, we identified stromal cell-derived
      factor 2 (SDF2) as a component of the eNOS macromolecular complex in endothelial 
      cells. SDF2 knockdown impaired agonist-stimulated NO synthesis and decreased the 
      phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(1177), a key event required for maximal activation
      of eNOS. Conversely, SDF2 overexpression dose-dependently increased NO synthesis 
      through a mechanism involving Akt and calcium (induced with ionomycin), which
      increased the phosphorylation of Ser(1177) in eNOS. NO synthesis by iNOS
      (inducible NOS) and nNOS (neuronal NOS) was also enhanced upon SDF2
      overexpression. We found that SDF2 was a client protein of the chaperone protein 
      Hsp90, interacting preferentially with the M domain of Hsp90, which is the same
      domain that binds to eNOS. In endothelial cells exposed to vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF), SDF2 was required for the binding of Hsp90 and calmodulin
      to eNOS, resulting in eNOS phosphorylation and activation. Thus, our data
      describe a function for SDF2 as a component of the Hsp90-eNOS complex that is
      critical for signal transduction in endothelial cells.

TI  - The rhodopsin-guanylyl cyclase of the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii
      enables fast optical control of cGMP signaling.
PG  - rs8
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0611 [doi]
AB  - Blastocladiomycota fungi form motile zoospores that are guided by sensory
      photoreceptors to areas of optimal light conditions. We showed that the microbial
      rhodopsin of Blastocladiella emersonii is a rhodopsin-guanylyl cyclase (RhGC), a 
      member of a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin class of light-activated enzymes
      that generate the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Upon
      application of a short light flash, recombinant RhGC converted within 8 ms into a
      signaling state with blue-shifted absorption from which the dark state recovered 
      within 100 ms. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, Chinese hamster ovary cells, or
      mammalian neurons, RhGC generated cGMP in response to green light in a light
      dose-dependent manner on a subsecond time scale. Thus, we propose RhGC as a
      versatile tool for the optogenetic analysis of cGMP-dependent signaling processes
      in cell biology and the neurosciences.

TI  - Survivin promotes oxidative phosphorylation, subcellular mitochondrial
      repositioning, and tumor cell invasion.
PG  - ra80
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab1624 [doi]
AB  - Survivin promotes cell division and suppresses apoptosis in many human cancers,
      and increased abundance correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis. We showed 
      that a pool of survivin that localized to the mitochondria of certain tumor cell 
      lines enhanced the stability of oxidative phosphorylation complex II, which
      promoted cellular respiration. Survivin also supported the subcellular
      trafficking of mitochondria to the cortical cytoskeleton of tumor cells, which
      was associated with increased membrane ruffling, increased focal adhesion complex
      turnover, and increased tumor cell migration and invasion in cultured cells, and 
      enhanced metastatic dissemination in vivo. Therefore, we found that mitochondrial
      respiration enhanced by survivin contributes to cancer metabolism, and
      relocalized mitochondria may provide a "regional" energy source to fuel tumor
      cell invasion and metastasis.

TI  - HDL-bound sphingosine 1-phosphate acts as a biased agonist for the endothelial
      cell receptor S1P1 to limit vascular inflammation.
PG  - ra79
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa2581 [doi]
AB  - The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) is abundant in endothelial cells,
      where it regulates vascular development and microvascular barrier function. In
      investigating the role of endothelial cell S1P1 in adult mice, we found that the 
      endothelial S1P1 signal was enhanced in regions of the arterial vasculature
      experiencing inflammation. The abundance of proinflammatory adhesion proteins,
      such as ICAM-1, was enhanced in mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of
      S1pr1 and suppressed in mice with endothelial cell-specific overexpression of
      S1pr1, suggesting a protective function of S1P1 in vascular disease. The
      chaperones ApoM(+)HDL (HDL) or albumin bind to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in
      the circulation; therefore, we tested the effects of S1P bound to each chaperone 
      on S1P1 signaling in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
      Exposure of HUVECs to ApoM(+)HDL-S1P, but not to albumin-S1P, promoted the
      formation of a cell surface S1P1-beta-arrestin 2 complex and attenuated the
      ability of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha to activate NF-kappaB and
      increase ICAM-1 abundance. Although S1P bound to either chaperone induced MAPK
      activation, albumin-S1P triggered greater Gi activation and receptor endocytosis.
      Endothelial cell-specific deletion of S1pr1 in the hypercholesterolemic Apoe(-/-)
      mouse model of atherosclerosis enhanced atherosclerotic lesion formation in the
      descending aorta. We propose that the ability of ApoM(+)HDL to act as a biased
      agonist on S1P1 inhibits vascular inflammation, which may partially explain the
      cardiovascular protective functions of HDL.

AB  - Viral infection activates host defense mechanisms, including the production of
      type I interferon (IFN) and the apoptosis of infected cells. We investigated
      whether these two antiviral responses were differentially regulated in infected
      cells. We showed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase
      (MAPKKK) apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) was activated in cells by
      the synthetic double-stranded RNA analog polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid
      [poly(I:C)] and by RNA viruses, and that ASK1 played an essential role in both
      the induction of the gene encoding IFN-beta (IFNB) and apoptotic cell death. In
      contrast, we found that the MAPKKK ASK2, a modulator of ASK1 signaling, was
      essential for ASK1-dependent apoptosis, but not for inducing IFNB expression.
      Furthermore, genetic deletion of either ASK1 or ASK2 in mice promoted the
      replication of influenza A virus in the lung. These results indicated that ASK1
      and ASK2 are components of the antiviral defense mechanism and suggested that
      ASK2 acts as a key modulator that promotes apoptosis rather than the type I IFN
      response. Because ASK2 is selectively present in epithelium-rich tissues, such as
      the lung, ASK2-dependent apoptosis may contribute to an antiviral defense in
      tissues with a rapid repair rate in which cells could be readily replaced.

TI  - Semaphorin 3D autocrine signaling mediates the metastatic role of annexin A2 in
      pancreatic cancer.
PG  - ra77
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa5823 [doi]
AB  - Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) present with metastatic
      disease at the time of diagnosis or will recur with metastases after surgical
      treatment. Semaphorin-plexin signaling mediates the migration of neuronal axons
      during development and of blood vessels during angiogenesis. The expression of
      the gene encoding semaphorin 3D (Sema3D) is increased in PDA tumors, and the
      presence of antibodies against the pleiotropic protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) in the 
      sera of some patients after surgical resection of PDA is associated with longer
      recurrence-free survival. By knocking out AnxA2 in a transgenic mouse model of
      PDA (KPC) that recapitulates the progression of human PDA from premalignancy to
      metastatic disease, we found that AnxA2 promoted metastases in vivo. The
      expression of AnxA2 promoted the secretion of Sema3D from PDA cells, which
      coimmunoprecipitated with the co-receptor plexin D1 (PlxnD1) on PDA cells. Mouse 
      PDA cells in which SEMA3D was knocked down or ANXA2-null PDA cells exhibited
      decreased invasive and metastatic potential in culture and in mice. However,
      restoring Sema3D in AnxA2-null cells did not entirely rescue metastatic behavior 
      in culture and in vivo, suggesting that AnxA2 mediates additional prometastatic
      mechanisms. Patients with primary PDA tumors that have abundant Sema3D have
      widely metastatic disease and decreased survival compared to patients with tumors
      that have relatively low Sema3D abundance. Thus, AnxA2 and Sema3D may be new
      therapeutic targets and prognostic markers of metastatic PDA.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0598 [doi]
AB  - The CLAVATA (CLV) and flagellin (flg) signaling pathways act through peptide
      ligands and closely related plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinases
      (RLKs). The plant peptide CLV3 regulates stem cell homeostasis, whereas the
      bacterial flg22 peptide elicits defense responses. We applied multiparameter
      fluorescence imaging spectroscopy (MFIS) to characterize the dynamics of RLK
      complexes in the presence of ligand in living plant cells expressing receptor
      proteins fused to fluorescent proteins. We found that the CLV and flg pathways
      represent two different principles of signal transduction: flg22 first triggered 
      RLK heterodimerization and later assembly into larger complexes through
      homomerization. In contrast, CLV receptor complexes were preformed, and ligand
      binding stimulated their clustering. This different behavior likely reflects the 
      nature of these signaling pathways. Pathogen-triggered flg signaling impedes
      plant growth and development; therefore, receptor complexes are formed only in
      the presence of ligand. In contrast, CLV3-dependent stem cell homeostasis
      continuously requires active signaling, and preformation of receptor complexes
      may facilitate this task.

TI  - Maintaining epithelial stemness with p63.
PG  - re9
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa1033 [doi]
AB  - In stratified epithelial and glandular tissues, homeostasis relies on the
      self-renewing capacity of stem cells, which are within the basal layer. The p53
      family member p63 is an indispensable transcription factor for epithelial
      morphogenesis and stemness. A splice variant of the transcription factor p63 that
      lacks an amino-terminal domain, DeltaNp63, is selectively found in the basal
      compartments of several ectoderm-derived tissues such as stratified and glandular
      epithelia, in which it is required for the replenishment of stem cells. Thus far,
      the transcriptional programs downstream of p63 in stemness regulation remain
      incompletely defined. Unveiling the molecular basis of stem cell self-renewal may
      be relevant in understanding how this process may contribute to cancer
      development. In this review, we specifically highlight experimental
      investigations, which suggest that p63 is a marker of normal epithelial stem
      cells and describe p63 transcriptional targets that may be involved in stemness
      regulation. Finally, we discuss relevant findings implicating p63 in epithelial
      cancer stem cell biology.

TI  - NF-kappaB signaling relieves negative regulation by miR-194 in hepatocellular
      carcinoma by suppressing the transcription factor HNF-1alpha.
PG  - ra75
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa8441 [doi]
AB  - Constitutive activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear
      factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays an important role in progression of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Emerging modulators of NF-kappaB signaling are
      noncoding RNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs). We previously identified miRNAs
      that reduced the induction of NF-kappaB activity upon addition of tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNFalpha) to HCC cells. We found that among these miRNAs, the
      abundance of liver-enriched miR-194 was decreased in HCC tissue and that low
      abundance of miR-194 correlated with a high occurrence of vascular invasion.
      Overexpressing miR-194 suppressed HCC cell migration and invasiveness in culture 
      and metastatic seeding in mice. Transcripts encoding tripartite motif containing 
      23 (TRIM23), a ubiquitin ligase involved in NF-kappaB activation, and chromosome 
      21 open reading frame 91 (C21ORF91), a protein of unknown function, were
      identified as direct targets of miR-194 in HCC cells; knocking down either
      protein decreased the activity of a luciferase NF-kappaB reporter. Furthermore,
      the NF-kappaB pathway activator TNFalpha, an inflammatory cytokine, inhibited the
      transcription of miR-194 by decreasing the abundance of hepatocyte nuclear
      factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha). The abundance of miR-194 positively correlated with
      that of HNF-1alpha and inversely correlated with that of TNFalpha in human HCC
      tissue. Thus, we identified a pathway in which TNFalpha-NF-kappaB signaling
      switches off negative regulation by suppressing HNF-1alpha-mediated expression of
      miR-194, revealing insight into the mechanisms linking inflammatory pathways,
      miRNA, and HCC metastasis.

TI  - Multiple types of calcium channels arising from alternative translation
      initiation of the Orai1 message.
PG  - ra74
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa8323 [doi]
AB  - In mammals exclusively, the pore-forming Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC)
      channel subunit Orai1 occurs in two forms because of alternative translation
      initiation. The longer, mammal-specific Orai1alpha contains an additional 63
      amino acids upstream of the conserved start site for Orai1beta, which occurs at
      methionine 64 in Orai1alpha. Orai1 participates in the generation of three
      distinct Ca(2+) currents, including two store-operated currents: Icrac, which
      involves activation of Orai1 channels by the Ca(2+)-sensing protein STIM1
      (stromal interaction molecule 1), and Isoc, which involves an interaction among
      Orai1, the transient receptor potential (TRP) family member TRPC1 (TRP canonical 
      1), and STIM1. Orai1 is also a pore-forming subunit of an arachidonic acid (or
      leukotriene C4)-regulated current Iarc that involves interactions among Orai1,
      Orai3, and STIM1. We evaluated the roles of the two Orai1 forms in the Ca(2+)
      currents Icrac, Isoc, and Iarc. We found that Orai1alpha and Orai1beta were
      largely interchangeable for Icrac and Isoc, although Orai1alpha exhibited
      stronger inhibition by Ca(2+). Only the mammalian-specific Orai1alpha functioned 
      in the arachidonic acid-regulated current Iarc. Thus, alternative translation
      initiation of the Orai1 message produces at least three types of Ca(2+) channels 
      with distinct signaling and regulatory properties.

TI  - Reversal of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by inducible genetic
      ablation of GRK2.
PG  - ra73
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa4374 [doi]
AB  - Insulin resistance is a common feature of obesity and predisposes individuals to 
      various prevalent pathological conditions. G protein (heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) integrates several
      signal transduction pathways and is emerging as a physiologically relevant
      inhibitor of insulin signaling. GRK2 abundance is increased in humans with
      metabolic syndrome and in different murine models of insulin resistance. To
      support GRK2 as a potential drug target in type 2 diabetes and obesity, we
      investigated whether lowering GRK2 abundance reversed an ongoing systemic
      insulin-resistant phenotype, using a mouse model of tamoxifen-induced GRK2
      ablation after high-fat diet-dependent obesity and insulin resistance.
      Tamoxifen-triggered GRK2 deletion impeded further body weight gain, normalized
      fasting glycemia, improved glucose tolerance, and was associated with preserved
      insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver, thereby maintaining whole-body 
      glucose homeostasis. Moreover, when continued to be fed a high-fat diet, these
      animals displayed reduced fat mass and smaller adipocytes, were resistant to the 
      development of liver steatosis, and showed reduced expression of proinflammatory 
      markers in the liver. Our results indicate that GRK2 acts as a hub to control
      metabolic functions in different tissues, which is key to controlling insulin
      resistance development in vivo. These data suggest that inhibiting GRK2 could
      reverse an established insulin-resistant and obese phenotype, thereby putting
      forward this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target linking glucose homeostasis
      and regulation of adiposity.

TI  - Protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B56alpha limits phosphatase activity in
      the heart.
PG  - ra72
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa5876 [doi]
AB  - Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine-selective holoenzyme composed
      of a catalytic, scaffolding, and regulatory subunit. In the heart, PP2A activity 
      is requisite for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and central in
      adrenergic signaling. We found that mice deficient in the PP2A regulatory subunit
      B56alpha (1 of 13 regulatory subunits) had altered PP2A signaling in the heart
      that was associated with changes in cardiac physiology, suggesting that the
      B56alpha regulatory subunit had an autoinhibitory role that suppressed excess
      PP2A activity. The increase in PP2A activity in the mice with reduced B56alpha
      expression resulted in slower heart rates and increased heart rate variability,
      conduction defects, and increased sensitivity of heart rate to parasympathetic
      agonists. Increased PP2A activity in B56alpha(+/-) myocytes resulted in reduced
      Ca(2+) waves and sparks, which was associated with decreased phosphorylation (and
      thus decreased activation) of the ryanodine receptor RyR2, an ion channel on
      intracellular membranes that is involved in Ca(2+) regulation in cardiomyocytes. 
      In line with an autoinhibitory role for B56alpha, in vivo expression of B56alpha 
      in the absence of altered abundance of other PP2A subunits decreased basal
      phosphatase activity. Consequently, in vivo expression of B56alpha suppressed
      parasympathetic regulation of heart rate and increased RyR2 phosphorylation in
      cardiomyocytes. These data show that an integral component of the PP2A holoenzyme
      has an important inhibitory role in controlling PP2A enzyme activity in the
      heart.

TI  - A dual role for NOTCH signaling in joint cartilage maintenance and
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - ra71
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa3792 [doi]
AB  - Loss of NOTCH signaling in postnatal murine joints results in osteoarthritis,
      indicating a requirement for NOTCH during maintenance of joint cartilage.
      However, NOTCH signaling components are substantially increased in abundance in
      posttraumatic osteoarthritis in humans and mice, suggesting either a reparative
      or a pathological role for NOTCH activation in osteoarthritis. We investigated a 
      potential dual role for NOTCH in joint maintenance and osteoarthritis by
      generating two mouse models overexpressing the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD)
      within postnatal joint cartilage. The first mouse model exhibited sustained NOTCH
      activation to resemble pathological NOTCH signaling, whereas the second model had
      transient NOTCH activation, which more closely reflected physiological NOTCH
      signaling. Sustained NOTCH signaling in joint cartilage led to an early and
      progressive osteoarthritic-like pathology, whereas transient NOTCH activation
      enhanced the synthesis of cartilage matrix and promoted joint maintenance under
      normal physiological conditions. Through RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemical, and
      biochemical approaches, we identified several targets that could be responsible
      for NOTCH-mediated cartilage degradation, fibrosis, and osteoarthritis
      progression. These targets included components of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and mitogen-activated protein
      kinase signaling pathways, which may also contribute to the posttraumatic
      development of osteoarthritis. Together, these data suggest a dual role for the
      NOTCH pathway in joint cartilage, and they identify downstream effectors of NOTCH
      signaling as potential targets for disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs.

TI  - Reserve stem cells: Differentiated cells reprogram to fuel repair, metaplasia,
      and neoplasia in the adult gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - re8
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa7540 [doi]
AB  - It has long been known that differentiated cells can switch fates, especially in 
      vitro, but only recently has there been a critical mass of publications
      describing the mechanisms adult, postmitotic cells use in vivo to reverse their
      differentiation state. We propose that this sort of cellular reprogramming is a
      fundamental cellular process akin to apoptosis or mitosis. Because reprogramming 
      can invoke regenerative cells from mature cells, it is critical to the long-term 
      maintenance of tissues like the pancreas, which encounter large insults during
      adulthood but lack constitutively active adult stem cells to repair the damage.
      However, even in tissues with adult stem cells, like the stomach and intestine,
      reprogramming may allow mature cells to serve as reserve ("quiescent") stem cells
      when normal stem cells are compromised. We propose that the potential downside to
      reprogramming is that it increases risk for cancers that occur late in adulthood.
      Mature, long-lived cells may have years of exposure to mutagens. Mutations that
      affect the physiological function of differentiated, postmitotic cells may lead
      to apoptosis, but mutations in genes that govern proliferation might not be
      selected against. Hence, reprogramming with reentry into the cell cycle might
      unmask those mutations, causing an irreversible progenitor-like, proliferative
      state. We review recent evidence showing that reprogramming fuels irreversible
      metaplastic and precancerous proliferation in the stomach and pancreas. Finally, 
      we illustrate how we think reprogrammed differentiated cells are likely
      candidates as cells of origin for cancers of the intestine.

TI  - The interaction of heparan sulfate proteoglycans with endothelial
      transglutaminase-2 limits VEGF165-induced angiogenesis.
PG  - ra70
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa0963 [doi]
AB  - Sprouting angiogenesis is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF165) that is localized in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and binds to
      heparan sulfate (HS)-bearing proteins known as heparan sulfate proteoglycans
      (HSPGs). VEGF165 presentation by HSPGs enhances VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2)
      signaling. We investigated the effect of TG2, which binds to HSPGs, on the
      interaction between VEGF165 and HS and angiogenesis. Mice with tg2 deficiency
      showed transiently enhanced retina vessel formation and increased vascularization
      of VEGF165-containing Matrigel implants. In addition, endothelial cells in which 
      TG2 was knocked down exhibited enhanced VEGF165-induced sprouting and migration, 
      which was associated with increased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr(951) and its
      targets Src and Akt. TG2 knockdown did not affect the phosphorylation of VEGFR2
      at Tyr(1175) or cell proliferation in response to VEGF165 and sprouting or
      signaling in response to VEGF121. Decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr(951)
      was due to ECM-localized TG2, which reduced the binding of VEGF165 to endothelial
      ECM in a manner that required its ability to bind to HS but not its catalytic
      activity. Surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that TG2 impeded the
      interaction between VEGF165 and HS. These results show that TG2 controls the
      formation of VEGF165-HSPG complexes and suggest that this regulation could be
      pharmacologically targeted to modulate developmental and therapeutic
      angiogenesis.

PG  - ra69
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa5208 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular
      patterns and initiate innate immune responses through signaling pathways that
      depend on the adaptor proteins MyD88 (myeloid differentiation marker 88) or TRIF 
      (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing interferon-beta). TLR4, in
      particular, uses both adaptor proteins to activate the transcription factor
      nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB); however, the specificity and redundancy of
      these two pathways remain to be elucidated. We developed a mathematical model to 
      show how each pathway encodes distinct dynamical features of NF-kappaB activity
      and makes distinct contributions to the high variability observed in single-cell 
      measurements. The assembly of a macromolecular signaling platform around MyD88
      associated with receptors at the cell surface determined the timing of initial
      responses to generate a reliable, digital NF-kappaB signal. In contrast,
      ligand-induced receptor internalization into endosomes produced noisy, delayed,
      yet sustained NF-kappaB signals through TRIF. With iterative mathematical model
      development, we predicted the molecular mechanisms by which the MyD88- and
      TRIF-mediated pathways provide ligand concentration-dependent signaling dynamics 
      that transmit information about the pathogen threat.

TI  - Proteotoxic stress reprograms the chromatin landscape of SUMO modification.
PG  - rs7
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa2213 [doi]
AB  - The small ubiquitin-like modifier 2 (SUMO-2) is required for survival when cells 
      are exposed to treatments that induce proteotoxic stress by causing the
      accumulation of misfolded proteins. Exposure of cells to heat shock or other
      forms of proteotoxic stress induces the conjugation of SUMO-2 to proteins in the 
      nucleus. We investigated the chromatin landscape of SUMO-2 modifications in
      response to heat stress. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays coupled to 
      high-throughput DNA sequencing and mRNA sequencing, we showed that in response to
      heat shock, SUMO-2 accumulated at nucleosome-depleted, active DNA regulatory
      elements, which represented binding sites for large protein complexes and were
      predominantly associated with active genes. However, SUMO did not act as a direct
      transcriptional repressor or activator of these genes during heat shock. Instead,
      integration of our results with published proteomics data on heat shock-induced
      SUMO-2 substrates supports a model in which the conjugation of SUMO-2 to proteins
      acts as an acute stress response that is required for the stability of protein
      complexes involved in gene expression and posttranscriptional modification of
      mRNA. We showed that the conjugation of SUMO-2 to chromatin-associated proteins
      is an integral component of the proteotoxic stress response, and propose that
      SUMO-2 fulfills its essential role in cell survival by contributing to the
      maintenance of protein complex homeostasis.

TI  - Function and dysfunction of two-pore channels.
PG  - re7
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3314 [doi]
AB  - Two-pore channels (TPCs) are evolutionarily important members of the
      voltage-gated ion channel superfamily. TPCs localize to acidic Ca(2+) stores
      within the endolysosomal system. Most evidence indicate that TPCs mediate Ca(2+) 
      signals through the Ca(2+)-mobilizing messenger nicotinic acid adenine
      dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) to control a range of Ca(2+)-dependent events.
      Recent studies clarify the mechanism of TPC activation and identify roles for
      TPCs in disease, highlighting the regulation of endolysosomal membrane traffic by
      local Ca(2+) fluxes. Chemical targeting of TPCs to maintain endolysosomal
      "well-being" may be beneficial in disorders as diverse as Parkinson's disease,
      fatty liver disease, and Ebola virus infection.

TI  - Regulation of brain glutamate metabolism by nitric oxide and S-nitrosylation.
PG  - ra68
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa4312 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling intermediate during glutamatergic
      neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). NO signaling is in part
      accomplished through cysteine S-nitrosylation, a posttranslational modification
      by which NO regulates protein function and signaling. In our investigation of the
      protein targets and functional impact of S-nitrosylation in the CNS under
      physiological conditions, we identified 269 S-nitrosocysteine residues in 136
      proteins in the wild-type mouse brain. The number of sites was significantly
      reduced in the brains of mice lacking endothelial nitric oxide synthase
      (eNOS(-/-)) or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS(-/-)). In particular,
      nNOS(-/-) animals showed decreased S-nitrosylation of proteins that participate
      in the glutamate/glutamine cycle, a metabolic process by which synaptic glutamate
      is recycled or oxidized to provide energy. (15)N-glutamine-based metabolomic
      profiling and enzymatic activity assays indicated that brain extracts from
      nNOS(-/-) mice converted less glutamate to glutamine and oxidized more glutamate 
      than those from mice of the other genotypes. GLT1 [also known as EAAT2
      (excitatory amino acid transporter 2)], a glutamate transporter in astrocytes,
      was S-nitrosylated at Cys(373) and Cys(561) in wild-type and eNOS(-/-) mice, but 
      not in nNOS(-/-) mice. A form of rat GLT1 that could not be S-nitrosylated at the
      equivalent sites had increased glutamate uptake compared to wild-type GLT1 in
      cells exposed to an S-nitrosylating agent. Thus, NO modulates glutamatergic
      neurotransmission through the selective, nNOS-dependent S-nitrosylation of
      proteins that govern glutamate transport and metabolism.

TI  - Reelin protects against amyloid beta toxicity in vivo.
PG  - ra67
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa6674 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a currently incurable neurodegenerative disorder and 
      is the most common form of dementia in people over the age of 65 years. The
      predominant genetic risk factor for AD is the epsilon4 allele encoding
      apolipoprotein E (ApoE4). The secreted glycoprotein Reelin enhances synaptic
      plasticity by binding to the multifunctional ApoE receptors apolipoprotein E
      receptor 2 (Apoer2) and very low density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr). We have
      previously shown that the presence of ApoE4 renders neurons unresponsive to
      Reelin by impairing the recycling of the receptors, thereby decreasing its
      protective effects against amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomer-induced synaptic
      toxicity in vitro. We showed that when Reelin was knocked out in adult mice,
      these mice behaved normally without overt learning or memory deficits. However,
      they were strikingly sensitive to amyloid-induced synaptic suppression and had
      profound memory and learning disabilities with very low amounts of amyloid
      deposition. Our findings highlight the physiological importance of Reelin in
      protecting the brain against Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction and memory
      impairment.

PG  - ra66
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab3397 [doi]
AB  - As hubs for eukaryotic cell signaling, scaffold proteins are attractive targets
      for engineering and manipulating signaling circuits. We designed synthetic
      scaffolds with a repeated PDZ domain that interacted with engineered kinases of
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade involved in yeast mating to
      investigate how modular interactions mediate kinase cascades. The synthetic
      scaffolds functioned as logic gates of signaling circuits. We replaced the
      endogenous yeast scaffold Ste5 with designer scaffolds with a variable numbers of
      a PDZ domain that bound kinases or phosphatases engineered with a PDZ-binding
      motif. Although association with the membrane was necessary for pathway activity,
      surprisingly, mating responses occurred when the circuit contained a scaffold
      with only two PDZ domains, which could only bind two of the three kinases
      simultaneously. Additionally, the three tiers of the MAPK pathway exhibited
      decreasing positional plasticity from the top [MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK)] to
      the bottom (MAPK) tier such that binding of a MAPKKK, but not a MAPK, from the
      osmoregulatory pathway or protein kinase C pathway to the synthetic scaffold
      activated a reporter of the mating response. We also showed that the output
      duration and intensity could be altered by recruiting phosphatases or varying the
      affinity of the recruited proteins for the scaffold and that a designer MAPK
      scaffold functioned in mammalian cells. Thus, this synthetic approach with
      designer scaffolds should enable the rational manipulation or engineering of
      signaling pathways and provide insight into the functional roles of scaffold
      proteins.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa0354 [doi]
AB  - Activation of Cl(-)-permeable gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors
      elicits synaptic inhibition in mature neurons but excitation in immature neurons.
      This developmental "switch" in the GABA function depends on a postnatal decrease 
      in intraneuronal Cl(-) concentration mediated by KCC2, a Cl(-)-extruding
      K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter. We showed that the serine-threonine kinase WNK1 [with
      no lysine (K)] forms a physical complex with KCC2 in the developing mouse brain. 
      Dominant-negative mutation, genetic depletion, or chemical inhibition of WNK1 in 
      immature neurons triggered a hyperpolarizing shift in GABA activity by enhancing 
      KCC2-mediated Cl(-) extrusion. This increase in KCC2 activity resulted from
      reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of KCC2 at two C-terminal threonines, Thr(906)
      and Thr(1007). Phosphorylation of both Thr(906) and Thr(1007) was increased in
      immature versus mature neurons. Together, these data provide insight into the
      mechanism regulating Cl(-) homeostasis in immature neurons, and suggest that
      WNK1-regulated changes in KCC2 phosphorylation contribute to the developmental
      excitatory-to-inhibitory GABA sequence.

AB  - The DNA damage response network stimulates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis to
      coordinate repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis. The multistep process
      of miRNA biogenesis involves the cleavage of primary miRNAs by the microprocessor
      complex composed of the ribonuclease Drosha and the RNA binding protein DGCR8. We
      found that the tyrosine kinase ABL phosphorylated DGCR8, a modification that was 
      required for the induction of a subset of miRNAs after DNA damage. Focusing on
      the miR-34 family, ABL stimulated the production of miR-34c, but not miR-34a,
      through Drosha/DGCR8-dependent processing of primary miR-34c (pri-miR-34c). This 
      miRNA-selective effect of ABL required the sequences flanking the precursor
      miR-34c (pre-miR-34c) stem-loop. In pri-miRNA processing, DGCR8 binds the pre-miR
      stem-loop and recruits Drosha to the miRNA. RNA cross-linking assays showed that 
      DGCR8 and Drosha interacted with pri-miR-34c, but we found an inverse correlation
      between ABL-stimulated processing and DGCR8 association with pri-miR-34c. When
      coexpressed in HEK293T cells, ABL phosphorylated DGCR8 at Tyr(267). Ectopic
      expression of a Y267F-DGCR8 mutant reduced the recruitment of Drosha to
      pri-miR-34c and prevented ABL or Drosha from stimulating the processing of
      pri-miR-34c. In mice engineered to express a nuclear import-defective mutant of
      ABL, miR-34c, but not miR-34a, expression was reduced in the kidney, and
      apoptosis of the renal epithelial cells was impaired in response to cisplatin.
      These results reveal a new pathway in the DNA damage response wherein
      ABL-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of DGCR8 stimulates the processing of
      selective primary miRNAs.

TI  - Identification of small-molecule inhibitors of calcineurin-NFATc signaling that
      mimic the PxIxIT motif of calcineurin binding partners.
PG  - ra63
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005918 [doi]
AB  - Calcineurin (CN), a serine and threonine protein phosphatase that depends on
      Ca(2+) and calmodulin for its activity, is the target of the immunosuppressant
      drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506). CN dephosphorylates and
      activates members of the NFATc (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family of
      transcription factors in T cells by binding to their conserved PxIxIT motif. Upon
      dephosphorylation, NFATc proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they
      stimulate the expression of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines that are
      required for T cell proliferation and the immune response. We performed a
      pharmacophore-based virtual screening of ~5.5 million commercially available,
      "drug-like" compounds to identify nonpeptidic compounds that inhibited the
      CN-dependent activation of NFATc signaling and that could serve as potential drug
      candidates for immunosuppressive therapy. Of 32 compounds that mimicked the
      PxIxIT motif, 7 competed with NFATc for binding to CN in vitro without
      interfering with the phosphatase activity of CN. Furthermore, in activated human 
      CD4(+) T cells, four of the seven compounds inhibited the expression of
      NFATc-dependent genes, cytokine production, and cell proliferation, suggesting
      that these may have therapeutic potential as immunosuppressive agents.

TI  - IRE1 prevents endoplasmic reticulum membrane permeabilization and cell death
      under pathological conditions.
PG  - ra62
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa0341 [doi]
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as a critical regulator of cell
      survival. IRE1 is a transmembrane protein with kinase and RNase activities that
      is localized to the ER and that promotes resistance to ER stress. We showed a
      mechanism by which IRE1 conferred protection against ER stress-mediated cell
      death. IRE1 signaling prevented ER membrane permeabilization mediated by Bax and 
      Bak and cell death in cells experiencing ER stress. Suppression of IRE1 signaling
      triggered by its kinase activity led to the accumulation of the BH3
      domain-containing protein Bnip3, which in turn triggered the oligomerization of
      Bax and Bak in the ER membrane and ER membrane permeabilization. Consequently, in
      response to ER stress, cells deficient in IRE1 were susceptible to leakage of ER 
      contents, which was associated with the accumulation of calcium in mitochondria, 
      oxidative stress in the cytosol, and ultimately cell death. Our results reveal a 
      role for IRE1 in preventing a cell death-initializing step that emanates from the
      ER and provide a potential target for treating diseases characterized by ER
      stress, including diabetes and Wolfram syndrome.

TI  - DNA methylation regulates neuronal glutamatergic synaptic scaling.
PG  - ra61
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0715 [doi]
AB  - Enhanced receptiveness at all synapses on a neuron that receive glutamatergic
      input is called cell-wide synaptic upscaling. We hypothesize that this type of
      synaptic plasticity may be critical for long-term memory storage within cortical 
      circuits, a process that may also depend on epigenetic mechanisms, such as
      covalent chemical modification of DNA. We found that DNA cytosine demethylation
      mediates multiplicative synaptic upscaling of glutamatergic synaptic strength in 
      cultured cortical neurons. Inhibiting neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX)
      decreased the cytosine methylation of and increased the expression of genes
      encoding glutamate receptors and trafficking proteins, in turn increasing the
      amplitude but not frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents
      (mEPSCs), indicating synaptic upscaling rather than increased spontaneous
      activity. Inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity, either by using the
      small-molecule inhibitor RG108 or by knocking down Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a, induced
      synaptic upscaling to a similar magnitude as exposure to TTX. Moreover, upscaling
      induced by DNMT inhibition required transcription; the RNA polymerase inhibitor
      actinomycin D blocked upscaling induced by DNMT inhibition. Knocking down the
      cytosine demethylase TET1 also blocked the upscaling effects of RG108. DNMT
      inhibition induced a multiplicative increase in mEPSC amplitude, indicating that 
      the alterations in glutamate receptor abundance occurred in a coordinated manner 
      throughout a neuron and were not limited to individual active synapses. Our data 
      suggest that DNA methylation status controls transcription-dependent regulation
      of glutamatergic synaptic homeostasis. Furthermore, covalent DNA modifications
      may contribute to synaptic plasticity events that underlie the formation and
      stabilization of memories.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 4 senses oxidative stress mediated by the oxidation of
      phospholipids in extracellular vesicles.
PG  - ra60
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005860 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress produced in response to infection or sterile injury activates
      the innate immune response. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated
      from the plasma of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or secreted from cells
      subjected to oxidative stress contained oxidized phospholipids that stimulated
      cells expressing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in a manner dependent on its
      co-receptor MD-2. EVs from healthy subjects or reconstituted synthetic EVs
      subjected to limited oxidation gained the ability to stimulate TLR4-expressing
      cells, whereas prolonged oxidation abrogated this property. Furthermore, we found
      that 15-lipoxygenase generated hydro(pero)xylated phospholipids that stimulated
      TLR4-expressing cells. Molecular modeling suggested that the mechanism of
      activation of TLR4 by oxidized phospholipids in EVs was structurally similar to
      that of the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This was supported by
      experiments showing that EV-mediated stimulation of cells required MD-2, that
      mutations that block LPS binding to TLR4 abrogated the stimulatory effect of EVs,
      and that EVs induced TLR4 dimerization. On the other hand, analysis of gene
      expression profiles showed that genes encoding factors that resolve inflammation 
      were more abundantly expressed in responses to EVs than in response to LPS.
      Together, these data suggest that EVs act as an oxidative stress-induced
      endogenous danger signal that underlies the pervasive role of TLR4 in
      inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Analysis of single-cell cytokine secretion reveals a role for paracrine signaling
      in coordinating macrophage responses to TLR4 stimulation.
PG  - ra59
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa2155 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages not only produce multiple cytokines but also respond to multiple
      cytokines, which likely shapes the ultimate response of the population. To
      determine the role of paracrine signaling in shaping the profile of inflammatory 
      cytokines secreted by macrophages in response to stimulation of Toll-like
      receptor 4 (TLR4) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we combined multiplexed,
      microwell-based measurements of cytokine secretion by single cells with analysis 
      of cytokine secretion by cell populations. Loss of paracrine signaling as a
      result of cell isolation reduced the secretion by macrophage-like U937 cells and 
      human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) of a subset of LPS-stimulated
      cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10. Graphical Gaussian modeling 
      (GGM) of the single-cell data defined a regulatory network of paracrine signals, 
      which was validated experimentally in the population through antibody-mediated
      neutralization of individual cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
      was the most influential cytokine in the GGM network. Paracrine signaling by
      TNF-alpha secreted from a small subpopulation of "high-secreting" cells was
      necessary, but not sufficient, for the secretion of large amounts of IL-6 and
      IL-10 by the cell population. Decreased relative IL-10 secretion by isolated MDMs
      was linked to increased TNF-alpha secretion, suggesting that inhibition of the
      inflammatory response also depends on paracrine signaling. Our results reveal a
      previously uncharacterized role for cell-to-cell communication within a
      population in coordinating a rapid innate immune response despite underlying
      cell-to-cell heterogeneity.

TI  - Binding of the sphingolipid S1P to hTERT stabilizes telomerase at the nuclear
      periphery by allosterically mimicking protein phosphorylation.
PG  - ra58
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa4998 [doi]
AB  - During DNA replication, the enzyme telomerase maintains the ends of chromosomes, 
      called telomeres. Shortened telomeres trigger cell senescence, and cancer cells
      often have increased telomerase activity to promote their ability to proliferate 
      indefinitely. The catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase
      (hTERT), is stabilized by phosphorylation. We found that the lysophospholipid
      sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), generated by sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), bound
      hTERT at the nuclear periphery in human and mouse fibroblasts. Docking
      predictions and mutational analyses revealed that binding occurred between a
      hydroxyl group (C'3-OH) in S1P and Asp(684) in hTERT. Inhibiting or depleting SK2
      or mutating the S1P binding site decreased the stability of hTERT in cultured
      cells and promoted senescence and loss of telomere integrity. S1P binding
      inhibited the interaction of hTERT with makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1), an
      E3 ubiquitin ligase that tags hTERT for degradation. Murine Lewis lung carcinoma 
      (LLC) cells formed smaller tumors in mice lacking SK2 than in wild-type mice, and
      knocking down SK2 in LLC cells before implantation into mice suppressed their
      growth. Pharmacologically inhibiting SK2 decreased the growth of subcutaneous
      A549 lung cancer cell-derived xenografts in mice, and expression of wild-type
      hTERT, but not an S1P-binding mutant, restored tumor growth. Thus, our data
      suggest that S1P binding to hTERT allosterically mimicks phosphorylation,
      promoting telomerase stability and hence telomere maintenance, cell
      proliferation, and tumor growth.

TI  - Targeted phosphoproteomics of insulin signaling using data-independent
      acquisition mass spectrometry.
PG  - rs6
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa3139 [doi]
AB  - A major goal in signaling biology is the establishment of high-throughput
      quantitative methods for measuring changes in protein phosphorylation of entire
      signal transduction pathways across many different samples comprising temporal or
      dose data or patient samples. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass
      spectrometry (MS) methods, which involve tandem MS scans that are collected
      independently of precursor ion information and then are followed by targeted
      searching for known peptides, may achieve this goal. We applied DIA-MS to
      systematically quantify phosphorylation of components in the insulin signaling
      network in response to insulin as well as in stimulated cells exposed to a panel 
      of kinase inhibitors targeting key downstream effectors in the network. We
      accurately quantified the effect of insulin on phosphorylation of 86 protein
      targets in the insulin signaling network using either stable isotope standards
      (SIS) or label-free quantification (LFQ) and mapped signal transmission through
      this network. By matching kinases to specific phosphorylation events (based on
      linear consensus motifs and temporal phosphorylation) to the quantitative
      phosphoproteomic data from cells exposed to inhibitors, we investigated predicted
      kinase-substrate relationships of AKT and mTOR in a targeted fashion.
      Furthermore, we applied this approach to show that AKT2-dependent phosphorylation
      of GAB2 promoted insulin signaling but inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)
      signaling in a manner dependent on 14-3-3 binding. Because DIA-MS can increase
      throughput and improve the reproducibility of peptide detection across multiple
      samples, this approach should facilitate more accurate, comprehensive, and
      quantitative assessment of signaling networks under various experimental
      conditions than are possible using other MS proteomic methods.

TI  - A direct screen for c-di-GMP modulators reveals a Salmonella Typhimurium
      periplasmic L-arginine-sensing pathway.
PG  - ra57
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa1796 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger that transduces internal
      and external signals and regulates bacterial motility and biofilm formation. Some
      organisms encode more than 100 c-di-GMP-modulating enzymes, but only for a few
      has a signal been defined that modulates their activity. We developed and applied
      a high-throughput, real-time flow cytometry method that uses a fluorescence
      resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor of free c-di-GMP to screen for
      signals that modulate its concentration within Salmonella Typhimurium. We
      identified multiple compounds, including glucose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine,
      salicylic acid, and L-arginine, that modulated the FRET signal and therefore the 
      free c-di-GMP concentration. By screening a library of mutants, we identified
      proteins required for the c-di-GMP response to each compound. Furthermore, low
      micromolar concentrations of L-arginine induced a rapid translation-independent
      increase in c-di-GMP concentrations and c-di-GMP-dependent cellulose synthesis,
      responses that required the regulatory periplasmic domain of the diguanylate
      cyclase STM1987. L-Arginine signaling also required the periplasmic putative
      L-arginine-binding protein ArtI, implying that L-arginine sensing occurred in the
      periplasm. Among the 20 commonly used amino acids, S. Typhimurium specifically
      responded to L-arginine with an increase in c-di-GMP, suggesting that L-arginine 
      may serve as a signal during S. Typhimurium infection. Our results demonstrate
      that a second-messenger biosensor can be used to identify environmental signals
      and define pathways that alter microbial behavior.

TI  - SUMO deconjugation is required for arsenic-triggered ubiquitylation of PML.
PG  - ra56
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa3929 [doi]
AB  - Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a chromosomal translocation that
      produces an oncogenic fusion protein of the retinoic acid receptor alpha
      (RARalpha) and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Arsenic trioxide
      chemotherapy of this cancer induces the PML moiety to organize nuclear bodies,
      where the oncoprotein is degraded. This process requires the participation of two
      SUMO paralogs (SUMO1 and SUMO2) to promote PML ubiquitylation mediated by the
      ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 and reorganization of PML nuclear bodies. We
      demonstrated that the ubiquitylation of PML required the SUMO deconjugation
      machinery, primarily the deconjugating enzyme SENP1, and was suppressed by
      expression of non-deconjugatable SUMO2. We hypothesized that constitutive SUMO2
      conjugation and deconjugation occurred basally and that arsenic trioxide
      treatment caused the exchange of SUMO2 for SUMO1 on a fraction of Lys(65) in PML.
      On the basis of data obtained with mutational analysis and quantitative
      proteomics, we propose that the SUMO switch at Lys(65) of PML enhanced nuclear
      body formation, subsequent SUMO2 conjugation to Lys(160), and consequent
      RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation of PML. Our work provides insights into how the
      SUMO system achieves selective SUMO paralog modification and highlights the
      crucial role of SENPs in defining the specificity of SUMO signaling.

TI  - The role of ciliary trafficking in Hedgehog receptor signaling.
PG  - ra55
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa5622 [doi]
AB  - Defects in the biogenesis of or transport through primary cilia affect Hedgehog
      protein signaling, and many Hedgehog pathway components traffic through or
      accumulate in cilia. The Hedgehog receptor Patched negatively regulates the
      activity and ciliary accumulation of Smoothened, a seven-transmembrane protein
      that is essential for transducing the Hedgehog signal. We found that this
      negative regulation of Smoothened required the ciliary localization of Patched,
      as specified either by its own cytoplasmic tail or by provision of heterologous
      ciliary localization signals. Surprisingly, given that Hedgehog binding promotes 
      the exit of Patched from the cilium, we observed that an altered form of Patched 
      that is retained in the cilium nevertheless responded to Hedgehog, resulting in
      Smoothened activation. Our results indicate that whereas ciliary localization of 
      Patched is essential for suppression of Smoothened activation, the primary event 
      enabling Smoothened activation is binding of Hedgehog to Patched, and Patched
      ciliary removal is secondary.

TI  - The scaffold protein RACK1 mediates the RANKL-dependent activation of p38 MAPK in
      osteoclast precursors.
PG  - ra54
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005867 [doi]
AB  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 [tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor
      (TNFR)-associated factor 6] and the associated kinase TAK1 [transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGF-beta)-activated kinase 1] are key components of the signaling
      pathways that activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated
      protein kinases (MAPKs) in response to various stimuli. The cytokine RANKL
      (receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand) is essential for the differentiation of 
      bone marrow cells into bone-resorbing osteoclasts through the activation of
      NF-kappaB and MAPK. We found that the scaffold protein RACK1 (receptor for
      activated C kinase 1) selectively mediated the RANKL-dependent activation of p38 
      MAPK through the TRAF6-TAK1 axis by interacting with the MAPK kinase MKK6 (MAPK
      kinase kinase 6), which is upstream of p38 MAPK. RACK1 was necessary for the
      differentiation of bone marrow cells into osteoclasts through the stimulation of 
      p38 MAPK activation. Osteoclast precursors exposed to RANKL exhibited an
      interaction among RACK1, RANK, TRAF6, TAK1, and the kinase MKK6, thereby leading 
      to the activation of the MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway. Experiments in which RACK1 or
      TAK1 was knocked down in osteoclast precursors indicated that RACK1 acted as a
      bridge, bringing MKK6 to the TRAF6-TAK1 complex. Furthermore, local
      administration of RACK1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) into mice
      calvariae reduced the RANKL-induced bone loss by reducing the numbers of
      osteoclasts. These findings suggest that RACK1 specifies the RANKL-stimulated
      activation of p38 MAPK by facilitating the association of MKK6 with TAK1 and may 
      provide a molecular target for a new therapeutic strategy to treat bone diseases.

AB  - Despite initial responses to targeted kinase inhibitors, lung cancer patients
      presenting with primary epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations acquire
      resistance, often due to a second-site mutation (T790M). However, clinical trials
      found no survival benefits in patients treated with a monoclonal antibody (mAb)
      to EGFR that should block activation of the mutated receptor and thus bypass
      resistance to molecules that target the catalytic or ATP-binding site. Using cell
      lines with the T790M mutation, we discovered that prolonged exposure to mAbs
      against only the EGFR triggered network rewiring by (i) stimulating the
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway; (ii) inducing the
      transcription of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and HER3, which 
      encode other members of the EGFR family, and the gene encoding HGF, which is the 
      ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase MET; and (iii) stimulating the
      interaction between MET and HER3, which promoted MET activity. Supplementing the 
      EGFR-specific mAb with those targeting HER2 and HER3 suppressed these
      compensatory feedback loops in cultured lung cancer cells. The triple mAb
      combination targeting all three receptors prevented the activation of ERK,
      accelerated the degradation of the receptors, inhibited the proliferation of
      tumor cells but not of normal cells, and markedly reduced the growth of tumors in
      mice xenografted with cells that were resistant to combined treatment with
      erlotinib and the single function-blocking EGFR mAb. These findings uncovered
      feedback loops that enable resistance to treatment paradigms that use a single
      antibody and indicate a new strategy for the treatment of lung cancer patients.

      to survive.
PG  - ra52
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa6922 [doi]
AB  - Targeting non-oncogenic vulnerabilities may provide additional therapeutic
      approaches in tumors that are resistant to oncogene-targeted therapy. Using a
      computational pathway-based approach, we interrogated clinical breast cancer
      genomic data sets for candidate non-oncogenic vulnerabilities in breast cancers
      that have genomic amplification of ERBB2, which encodes human epidermal growth
      factor 2 (HER2). HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancers showed increased
      expression of genes encoding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Genetic ablation or pharmacological
      inhibition of ERAD led to irrecoverable ER stress and selectively killed HER2(+) 
      breast cancer cells. Cell death caused by ERAD inhibition partially depended on
      increased HER2-mTOR signaling, which imposed an increased proteotoxic burden on
      the ER. Cell death in response to ER stress required the IRE1alpha-JNK pathway,
      which was selectively suppressed in HER2(+) breast cancers by phosphatases that
      inactivate JNK. Accordingly, the cytotoxicity of inhibiting ERAD as well as JNK
      phosphatases was synergistic in HER2(+) but not in HER2-negative breast cancer
      cells. Therefore, our study suggests that reactivation of oncogene-induced stress
      by targeting stress-adaptive pathways may be a beneficial approach for
      therapy-resistant breast cancers.

TI  - Tandem phosphorylation within an intrinsically disordered region regulates ACTN4 
      function.
PG  - ra51
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa1977 [doi]
AB  - Phosphorylated residues occur preferentially in the intrinsically disordered
      regions of eukaryotic proteins. In the disordered amino-terminal region of human 
      alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4), Tyr(4) and Tyr(31) are phosphorylated in cells
      stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), and a mutant with
      phosphorylation-mimicking mutations of both tyrosines exhibits reduced
      interaction with actin in vitro. Cleavage of ACTN4 by m-calpain, a protease that 
      in motile cells is predominantly activated at the rear, removes the Tyr(4) site. 
      We found that introducing a phosphomimetic mutation at only Tyr(31) was
      sufficient to inhibit the interaction with actin in vitro. However, molecular
      dynamics simulations predicted that Tyr(31) is mostly buried and that
      phosphorylation of Tyr(4) would increase the solvent exposure and thus kinase
      accessibility of Tyr(31). In fibroblast cells, EGF stimulation increased tyrosine
      phosphorylation of a mutant form of ACTN4 with a phosphorylation-mimicking
      residue at Tyr(4), whereas a truncated mutant representing the product of
      m-calpain cleavage exhibited EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation at a
      background amount similar to that observed for a double phosphomimetic mutant of 
      Tyr(4) and Tyr(31). We also found that inhibition of the receptor tyrosine
      kinases of the TAM family, such as AXL, blocked EGF-stimulated tyrosine
      phosphorylation of ACTN4. Mathematical modeling predicted that the kinetics of
      phosphorylation at Tyr(31) can be dictated by the kinase affinity for Tyr(4).
      This study suggests that tandem-site phosphorylation within intrinsically
      disordered regions provides a mechanism for a site to function as a switch to
      reveal a nearby function-regulating site.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aab0562 [doi]
AB  - Directional cell migration in an electric field, a phenomenon called galvanotaxis
      or electrotaxis, occurs in many types of cells, and may play an important role in
      wound healing and development. Small extracellular electric fields can guide the 
      migration of amoeboid cells, and we established a large-scale screening approach 
      to search for mutants with electrotaxis phenotypes from a collection of 563
      Dictyostelium discoideum strains with morphological defects. We identified 28
      strains that were defective in electrotaxis and 10 strains with a slightly higher
      directional response. Using plasmid rescue followed by gene disruption, we
      identified some of the mutated genes, including some previously implicated in
      chemotaxis. Among these, we studied PiaA, which encodes a critical component of
      TORC2, a kinase protein complex that transduces changes in motility by activating
      the kinase PKB (also known as Akt). Furthermore, we found that electrotaxis was
      decreased in mutants lacking gefA, rasC, rip3, lst8, or pkbR1, genes that encode 
      other components of the TORC2-PKB pathway. Thus, we have developed a
      high-throughput screening technique that will be a useful tool to elucidate the
      molecular mechanisms of electrotaxis.

TI  - A new strategy to ERADicate HER2-positive breast tumors?
PG  - fs11
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aac4746 [doi]
AB  - HER2-positive breast cancers that have become resistant to HER2-targeting agents,
      such as trastuzumab (also known as Herceptin), have limited treatment options. In
      this issue of Science Signaling, Singh et al. have identified a characteristic
      increase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) system
      in HER2-positive tumors as a mechanism of relieving proteotoxic stress. Synthetic
      lethality arising from targeted disruption of ERAD signaling in conjunction with 
      other HER2-dependent signaling may improve therapeutic management of this
      difficult class of breast tumors.

TI  - The catalytic activity of the kinase ZAP-70 mediates basal signaling and negative
      feedback of the T cell receptor pathway.
PG  - ra49
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005596 [doi]
AB  - T cell activation by antigens binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) must be
      properly regulated to ensure normal T cell development and effective immune
      responses to pathogens and transformed cells while avoiding autoimmunity. The Src
      family kinase Lck and the Syk family kinase ZAP-70 (zeta chain-associated protein
      kinase of 70 kD) are sequentially activated in response to TCR engagement and
      serve as critical components of the TCR signaling machinery that leads to T cell 
      activation. We performed a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic study
      comparing the quantitative differences in the temporal dynamics of
      phosphorylation in stimulated and unstimulated T cells with or without inhibition
      of ZAP-70 catalytic activity. The data indicated that the kinase activity of
      ZAP-70 stimulates negative feedback pathways that target Lck and thereby modulate
      the phosphorylation patterns of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
      motifs (ITAMs) of the CD3 and zeta chain components of the TCR and of signaling
      molecules downstream of Lck, including ZAP-70. We developed a computational model
      that provides a mechanistic explanation for the experimental findings on ITAM
      phosphorylation in wild-type cells, ZAP-70-deficient cells, and cells with
      inhibited ZAP-70 catalytic activity. This model incorporated negative feedback
      regulation of Lck activity by the kinase activity of ZAP-70 and predicted the
      order in which tyrosines in the ITAMs of TCR zeta chains must be phosphorylated
      to be consistent with the experimental data.

TI  - A molecular switch in the scaffold NHERF1 enables misfolded CFTR to evade the
      peripheral quality control checkpoint.
PG  - ra48
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa1580 [doi]
AB  - The peripheral protein quality control (PPQC) checkpoint removes improperly
      folded proteins from the plasma membrane through a mechanism involving the E3
      ubiquitin ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein). PPQC
      limits the efficacy of some cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs, such as VX-809, that
      improve trafficking to the plasma membrane of misfolded mutants of the CF
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), including F508del-CFTR, which retains
      partial functionality. We investigated the PPQC checkpoint in lung epithelial
      cells with F508del-CFTR that were exposed to VX-809. The conformation of the
      scaffold protein NHERF1 (Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory factor 1) determined
      whether the PPQC recognized "rescued" F508del-CFTR (the portion that reached the 
      cell surface in VX-809-treated cells). Activation of the cytoskeletal regulator
      Rac1 promoted an interaction between the actin-binding adaptor protein ezrin and 
      NHERF1, triggering exposure of the second PDZ domain of NHERF1, which interacted 
      with rescued F508del-CFTR. Because binding of F508del-CFTR to the second PDZ of
      NHERF1 precluded the recruitment of CHIP, the coexposure of airway cells to Rac1 
      activator nearly tripled the efficacy of VX-809. Interference with the
      NHERF1-ezrin interaction prevented the increase of efficacy of VX-809 by Rac1
      activation, but the actin-binding domain of ezrin was not required for the
      increase in efficacy. Thus, rather than mainly directing anchoring of
      F508del-CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton, induction of ezrin activation by Rac1
      signaling triggered a conformational change in NHERF1, which was then able to
      bind and stabilize misfolded CFTR at the plasma membrane. These insights into the
      cell surface stabilization of CFTR provide new targets to improve treatment of
      CF.

TI  - ERK reinforces actin polymerization to power persistent edge protrusion during
      motility.
PG  - ra47
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa8859 [doi]
AB  - Cells move through perpetual protrusion and retraction cycles at the leading
      edge. These cycles are coordinated with substrate adhesion and retraction of the 
      cell rear. We tracked spatial and temporal fluctuations in the molecular
      activities of individual moving cells to elucidate how extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling controlled the dynamics of protrusion and
      retraction cycles. ERK is activated by many cell surface receptors, and we found 
      that ERK signaling specifically reinforced cellular protrusions so that they
      translated into rapid, sustained forward motion of the leading edge. Using
      quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy and cross-correlation analysis, we
      showed that ERK controlled the rate and timing of actin polymerization by
      promoting the recruitment of the actin nucleator Arp2/3 to the leading edge.
      These findings support a model in which surges in ERK activity induced by
      extracellular cues enhance Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization to generate
      protrusion power phases with enough force to counteract increasing membrane
      tension and to promote sustained motility.

AB  - Complexes of signaling proteins that are nucleated upon activation of receptor
      tyrosine kinases are dynamic macromolecular assemblies held together by
      interactions, such as the recognition of phosphotyrosines by Src homology 2 (SH2)
      domains. We predicted that reversible binding and phosphatase activity enable
      dynamic regulation of these protein complexes, which could affect signal
      transduction. We explored how dynamics in the interactions among the epidermal
      growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), GRB2-associated binder protein 1 (GAB1), and
      SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) affected EGFR signaling output,
      specifically SHP2 binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated GAB1, which relieves the
      autoinhibition of SHP2. Among the effects of activated SHP2 is increased
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. We found that in H1666 lung
      adenocarcinoma cells, EGFR-activated Src family kinases (SFKs) counteracted
      repeated GAB1 dephosphorylation events and maintained the association of SHP2
      with phosphorylated GAB1 at a cytosolic site distal from EGFR. A computational
      model predicted that an experimentally verified delay in SFK inactivation after
      EGFR inactivation, combined with an amplification of GAB1 phosphorylation in
      cells with proteins in a specific range of concentrations, enabled GAB1
      phosphorylation and GAB1-SHP2 complexes to persist longer than EGFR
      phosphorylation persisted in response to EGF. This SFK-dependent mechanism was
      specific to EGFR and did not occur in response to activation of the receptor
      tyrosine kinase c-MET. Thus, our results quantitatively describe a regulatory
      mechanism used by some receptor tyrosine kinases to remotely control the duration
      of a signal by regulating the persistence of a signaling protein complex.

TI  - Activation of MyD88-dependent TLR1/2 signaling by misfolded alpha-synuclein, a
      protein linked to neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - ra45
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005965 [doi]
AB  - Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease and diffuse Lewy body disease, are
      progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by selective neuronal
      death, abnormal accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein, and sustained
      microglial activation. In addition to inducing neuronal toxicity, higher-ordered 
      oligomeric alpha-synuclein causes proinflammatory responses in the brain
      parenchyma by triggering microglial activation, which may exacerbate pathogenic
      processes by establishing a chronic neuroinflammatory milieu. We found that
      higher-ordered oligomeric alpha-synuclein induced a proinflammatory microglial
      phenotype by directly engaging the heterodimer TLR1/2 (Toll-like receptor 1 and
      2) at the cell membrane, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB
      (nuclear factor kappaB) and the increased production of the proinflammatory
      cytokines TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and IL-1beta
      (interleukin-1beta) in a MyD88-dependent manner. Blocking signaling through the
      TLR1/2 heterodimer with the small-molecule inhibitor CU-CPT22 reduced the nuclear
      translocation of NF-kappaB and secretion of TNF-alpha from cultured primary mouse
      microglia. Candesartan cilexetil, a drug approved for treating hypertension and
      that inhibits the expression of TLR2, reversed the activated proinflammatory
      phenotype of primary microglia exposed to oligomeric alpha-synuclein, supporting 
      the possibility of repurposing this drug for synucleinopathies.

TI  - Phosphorylation of GATA-6 is required for vascular smooth muscle cell
      differentiation after mTORC1 inhibition.
PG  - ra44
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005482 [doi]
AB  - Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo transcriptionally regulated
      reversible differentiation in growing and injured blood vessels. This
      dedifferentiation also contributes to VSMC hyperplasia after vascular injury,
      including that caused by angioplasty and stenting. Stents provide mechanical
      support and can contain and release rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mechanistic
      target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Rapamycin suppresses VSMC hyperplasia and
      promotes VSMC differentiation. We report that rapamycin-induced differentiation
      of VSMCs required the transcription factor GATA-6. Inhibition of mTORC1
      stabilized GATA-6 and promoted the nuclear accumulation of GATA-6, its binding to
      DNA, its transactivation of promoters encoding contractile proteins, and its
      inhibition of proliferation. These effects were mediated by phosphorylation of
      GATA-6 at Ser(290), potentially by Akt2, a kinase that is activated in VSMCs when
      mTORC1 is inhibited. Rapamycin induced phosphorylation of GATA-6 in wild-type
      mice, but not in Akt2(-/-) mice. Intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury was
      greater in Akt2(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice, and the exacerbated response in
      Akt2(-/-) mice was rescued to a greater extent by local overexpression of the
      wild-type or phosphomimetic (S290D) mutant GATA-6 than by that of the
      phosphorylation-deficient (S290A) mutant. Our data indicated that GATA-6 and Akt2
      are involved in the mTORC1-mediated regulation of VSMC proliferation and
      differentiation. Identifying the downstream transcriptional targets of mTORC1 may
      provide cell type-specific drug targets to combat cardiovascular diseases
      associated with excessive proliferation of VSMCs.

AB  - Living organisms sense and respond to changes in nutrient availability to cope
      with diverse environmental conditions. Nitrate (NO3-) is the main source of
      nitrogen for plants and is a major component in fertilizer. Unraveling the
      molecular basis of nitrate sensing and regulation of nitrate uptake should enable
      the development of strategies to increase the efficiency of nitrogen use and
      maximize nitrate uptake by plants, which would aid in reducing nitrate pollution.
      NPF6.3 (also known as NRT1.1), which functions as a nitrate sensor and
      transporter; the kinase CIPK23; and the calcium sensor CBL9 form a complex that
      is crucial for nitrate sensing in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified two
      additional components that regulate nitrate transport, sensing, and signaling:
      the calcium sensor CBL1 and protein phosphatase 2C family member ABI2, which is
      inhibited by the stress-response hormone abscisic acid. Bimolecular fluorescence 
      complementation assays and in vitro kinase assays revealed that ABI2 interacted
      with and dephosphorylated CIPK23 and CBL1. Coexpression studies in Xenopus
      oocytes and analysis of plants deficient in ABI2 indicated that ABI2 enhanced
      NPF6.3-dependent nitrate transport, nitrate sensing, and nitrate signaling. These
      findings suggest that ABI2 may functionally link stress-regulated control of
      growth and nitrate uptake and utilization, which are energy-expensive processes.

TI  - Feedback circuitry between miR-218 repression and RTK activation in glioblastoma.
PG  - ra42
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005978 [doi]
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling promotes the growth and progression of
      glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive type of brain tumor. We previously
      reported that decreased miR-218 expression in GBM directly promotes RTK activity 
      by increasing the expression of key RTKs and their signaling mediators, including
      the RTK epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospholipase C-gamma1
      (PLCgamma1), and the kinases PIK3CA and ARAF. However, increased RTK signaling
      usually activates negative feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. We found 
      that decreased miR-218 expression in GBM cells also increased the expression of
      genes encoding additional upstream and downstream components of RTK signaling
      pathways, including the RTK platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha
      (PDGFRalpha) and the kinases ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1),
      that collectively overrode the negative feedback mechanism. Furthermore,
      increased RTK signaling itself suppressed miR-218 expression. Mass spectrometry
      and DNA pull-down identified binding of signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) along with the transcriptional repressor BCL2-associated 
      transcription factor 1 (BCLAF1) directly to the miR-218 locus. These data
      identify previously unknown feedback loops by which miR-218 repression promotes
      increased RTK signaling in high-grade gliomas.

TI  - Actin cytoskeletal remodeling with protrusion formation is essential for heart
      regeneration in Hippo-deficient mice.
PG  - ra41
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005781 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian heart regenerates poorly, and damage commonly leads to heart
      failure. Hippo signaling is an evolutionarily conserved kinase cascade that
      regulates organ size during development and prevents adult mammalian
      cardiomyocyte regeneration by inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator Yap,
      which also responds to mechanical signaling in cultured cells to promote cell
      proliferation. To identify Yap target genes that are activated during
      cardiomyocyte renewal and regeneration, we performed Yap chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and mRNA expression profiling in Hippo 
      signaling-deficient mouse hearts. We found that Yap directly regulated genes
      encoding cell cycle progression proteins, as well as genes encoding proteins that
      promote F-actin polymerization and that link the actin cytoskeleton to the
      extracellular matrix. Included in the latter group were components of the
      dystrophin glycoprotein complex, a large molecular complex that, when defective, 
      results in muscular dystrophy in humans. Cardiomyocytes near the scar tissue of
      injured Hippo signaling-deficient mouse hearts showed cellular protrusions
      suggestive of cytoskeletal remodeling. The hearts of mdx mutant mice, which lack 
      functional dystrophin and are a model for muscular dystrophy, showed impaired
      regeneration and cytoskeleton remodeling, but normal cardiomyocyte proliferation,
      after injury. Our data showed that, in addition to genes encoding cell cycle
      progression proteins, Yap regulated genes that enhance cytoskeletal remodeling.
      Thus, blocking the Hippo pathway input to Yap may tip the balance so that Yap
      responds to mechanical changes associated with heart injury to promote repair.

      pathway: Insights into stress and related disorders.
PG  - rs5
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa0549 [doi]
AB  - The eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway is involved in cellular adaptation to stress and is
      dysregulated in numerous diseases. Activation of this pathway leads to
      phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2
      (eIF2alpha) and the recruitment of the transcription factor ATF4 (activating
      transcription factor 4) to specific CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-ATF
      response elements (CAREs) located in the promoters of target genes. To monitor
      the spatiotemporal modulation of this pathway in living animals, we generated a
      novel CARE-driven luciferase mouse model (CARE-LUC). These transgenic mice enable
      the investigation of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway activity in the whole organism
      and at the tissue and cellular levels by combining imaging, luciferase assays,
      and immunochemistry. Using this mouse line, we showed the tissue-specific
      activation pattern of this pathway in response to amino acid deficiency or
      endoplasmic reticulum stress and the hepatic induction of this pathway in a
      stress-related pathology model of liver fibrosis. The CARE-LUC mouse model
      represents an innovative tool to investigate the eIF2alpha-ATF4 axis and to
      develop drugs targeting this important pathway in the remediation of related
      pathologies.

TI  - Dynamic phosphoproteomics reveals TORC1-dependent regulation of yeast nucleotide 
      and amino acid biosynthesis.

AB  - Phosphoproteomics studies have unraveled the extent of protein phosphorylation as
      a key cellular regulation mechanism, but assigning functionality to specific
      phosphorylation events remains a major challenge. TORC1 (target of rapamycin
      complex 1) is a kinase-containing protein complex that transduces changes in
      nutrient availability into phosphorylation signaling events that alter cell
      growth and proliferation. To resolve the temporal sequence of phosphorylation
      responses to nutritionally and chemically induced changes in TORC1 signaling and 
      to identify previously unknown kinase-substrate relationships in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic
      analyses after shifts in nitrogen sources and rapamycin treatment. From early
      phosphorylation events that were consistent over at least two experimental
      perturbations, we identified 51 candidate and 10 known proximal targets of TORC1 
      that were direct substrates of TORC1 or of one of its kinase or phosphatase
      substrates. By correlating these phosphoproteomics data with dynamic metabolomics
      data, we inferred the functional role of phosphorylation on the metabolic
      activity of 12 enzymes, including three candidate TORC1-proximal targets: Amd1,
      which is involved in nucleotide metabolism; Hom3, which is involved in amino acid
      metabolism; and Tsl1, which mediates carbohydrate storage. Finally, we identified
      the TORC1 substrates Sch9 and Atg1 as candidate kinases that phosphorylate Amd1
      and Hom3, respectively.

TI  - Redundant and specialized roles for diacylglycerol kinases alpha and zeta in the 
      control of T cell functions.
PG  - re6
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa0974 [doi]
AB  - The diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) attenuate diacylglycerol (DAG)-mediated signals
      by catalyzing the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid. In T lymphocytes, the
      antigen-stimulated generation of DAG links signal strength to the intensity and
      duration of signaling by the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and 
      protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathways. The generation of DAG at the plasma
      membrane of T cells lies at the core of the mechanisms that delimit T cell
      functions. DGKalpha and DGKzeta are the two main isoforms that are found in T
      cells, and several approaches define their precise contribution to T cell
      responses. Each of these isoforms has specialized and redundant functions that
      limit the intensity of DAG-regulated signals downstream of antigenic stimulation.
      This ability, which in normal T cells contributes to maintaining homeostasis and 
      function, is exploited by tumors to evade immune surveillance. Modification of
      DGK activity offers new perspectives for the therapeutic manipulation of T cell
      functions for treatment of autoimmune pathologies, or for overcoming
      tumor-induced T cell tolerance. Precise knowledge of the mechanisms that sustain 
      DGK isoform-specific regulation in T lymphocytes is indispensable for the
      development of new tools for pharmacological intervention.

TI  - Temporal proteomics of NGF-TrkA signaling identifies an inhibitory role for the
      E3 ligase Cbl-b in neuroblastoma cell differentiation.
PG  - ra40
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005769 [doi]
AB  - SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells respond to nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated
      activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) with neurite outgrowth,
      thereby providing a model to study neuronal differentiation. We performed a
      time-resolved analysis of NGF-TrkA signaling in neuroblastoma cells using mass
      spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics. The combination of interactome,
      phosphoproteome, and proteome data provided temporal insights into the molecular 
      events downstream of NGF binding to TrkA. We showed that upon NGF stimulation,
      TrkA recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, which then becomes phosphorylated
      and ubiquitylated and decreases in abundance. We also found that recruitment of
      Cbl-b promotes TrkA ubiquitylation and degradation. Furthermore, the amount of
      phosphorylation of the kinase ERK and neurite outgrowth increased upon Cbl-b
      depletion in several neuroblastoma cell lines. Our findings suggest that Cbl-b
      limits NGF-TrkA signaling to control the length of neurites.

TI  - Combined cardiomyocyte PKCdelta and PKCepsilon gene deletion uncovers their
      central role in restraining developmental and reactive heart growth.
PG  - ra39
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa1855 [doi]
AB  - Cell growth is orchestrated by changes in gene expression that respond to
      developmental and environmental cues. Among the signaling pathways that direct
      growth are enzymes of the protein kinase C (PKC) family, which are ubiquitous
      proteins belonging to three distinct subclasses: conventional PKCs, novel PKCs,
      and atypical PKCs. Functional overlap makes determining the physiological actions
      of different PKC isoforms difficult. We showed that two novel PKC isoforms,
      PKCdelta and PKCepsilon, redundantly govern stress-reactive and developmental
      heart growth by modulating the expression of cardiac genes central to
      stress-activated protein kinase and periostin signaling. Mice with combined
      postnatal cardiomyocyte-specific genetic ablation of PKCdelta and germline
      deletion of PKCepsilon (DCKO) had normally sized hearts, but their hearts had
      transcriptional changes typical of pathological hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy 
      and dysfunction induced by hemodynamic overloading were greater in DCKO mice than
      in mice with a single deletion of either PKCdelta or PKCepsilon. Furthermore,
      gene expression analysis of the hearts of DCKO mice revealed transcriptional
      derepression of the genes encoding the kinase ERK (extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase) and periostin. Mice with combined embryonic ablation of PKCdelta and
      PKCepsilon showed enhanced growth and cardiomyocyte hyperplasia that induced
      pathological ventricular stiffening and early lethality, phenotypes absent in
      mice with a single deletion of PKCdelta or PKCepsilon. Our results indicate that 
      novel PKCs provide retrograde feedback inhibition of growth signaling pathways
      central to cardiac development and stress adaptation. These growth-suppressing
      effects of novel PKCs have implications for therapeutic inhibition of PKCs in
      cancer, heart, and other diseases.

TI  - BRAF-induced tumorigenesis is IKKalpha-dependent but NF-kappaB-independent.
PG  - ra38
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005886 [doi]
AB  - KRAS mutations contribute to cell proliferation and survival in numerous cancers,
      including colorectal cancers (CRC). One pathway through which mutant KRAS acts is
      an inflammatory pathway that involves the kinase IKK and activates the
      transcription factor NF-kappaB. BRAF, a kinase that is downstream of KRAS, is
      mutated in a subset of CRC and is predictive of poor prognosis and therapeutic
      resistance. We found that, in contrast to mutant KRAS, mutant BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) 
      did not trigger NF-kappaB activation but instead triggered the phosphorylation of
      a proteolytic fragment of IKKalpha (p45-IKKalpha) in CRC cells. BRAF(V600E) CRC
      cells had a high abundance of phosphorylated p45-IKKalpha, which was decreased by
      a RAF inhibitor. However, the abundance and DNA binding of NF-kappaB in these
      cells were unaffected by the RAF inhibitor, and expression of BRAF(V600E) in
      human embryonic kidney-293T cells did not activate an NF-kappaB reporter.
      Moreover, BRAF-induced transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and BRAF-dependent
      transcription required phosphorylation of p45-IKKalpha. The kinase TAK1, which
      was associated with the endosomal compartment, phosphorylated p45-IKKalpha.
      Inhibition of endosomal vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) with
      chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 blocked p45-IKKalpha phosphorylation and induced
      apoptosis in BRAF-mutant CRC cells independent of autophagy. Treating mice with
      V-ATPase inhibitors reduced the growth and metastasis of BRAF(V600E) xenograft
      tumors in the cecum of mice.

TI  - Protein kinase G-regulated production of H2S governs oxygen sensing.
PG  - ra37
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005846 [doi]
AB  - Reflexes initiated by the carotid body, the principal O2-sensing organ, are
      critical for maintaining cardiorespiratory homeostasis during hypoxia. O2 sensing
      by the carotid body requires carbon monoxide (CO) generation by heme oxygenase-2 
      (HO-2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis by cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE).
      We report that O2 stimulated the generation of CO, but not that of H2S, and
      required two cysteine residues in the heme regulatory motif (Cys(265) and
      Cys(282)) of HO-2. CO stimulated protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent phosphorylation
      of Ser(377) of CSE, inhibiting the production of H2S. Hypoxia decreased the
      inhibition of CSE by reducing CO generation resulting in increased H2S, which
      stimulated carotid body neural activity. In carotid bodies from mice lacking
      HO-2, compensatory increased abundance of nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase)
      mediated O2 sensing through PKG-dependent regulation of H2S by nitric oxide.
      These results provide a mechanism for how three gases work in concert in the
      carotid body to regulate breathing.

AB  - Oxygen sensing by the carotid body is essential in vertebrates to adapt to
      reduced arterial oxygen tension. In this issue of Science Signaling, Yuan et al. 
      report an intricate signaling system to transduce a physical parameter--oxygen
      tension--into a biological cellular signal (neural discharge) through changes in 
      the production of carbon monoxide (CO), the second messenger cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).

TI  - Constitutive production of c-di-GMP is associated with mutations in a variant of 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa with altered membrane composition.
PG  - ra36
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005943 [doi]
AB  - Most bacteria can form multicellular communities called biofilms on biotic and
      abiotic surfaces. This multicellular response to surface contact correlates with 
      an increased resistance to various adverse environmental conditions, including
      those encountered during infections of the human host and exposure to
      antimicrobial compounds. Biofilm formation occurs when freely swimming
      (planktonic) cells encounter a surface, which stimulates the chemosensory-like,
      surface-sensing system Wsp and leads to generation of the intracellular second
      messenger 3',5'-cyclic-di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). We identified
      adaptive mutations in a clinical small colony variant (SCV) of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and correlated their presence with self-aggregating growth behavior
      and an enhanced capacity to form biofilms. We present evidence that a point
      mutation in the 5' untranslated region of the accBC gene cluster, which encodes
      components of an enzyme responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis, was responsible 
      for a stabilized mRNA structure that resulted in reduced translational efficiency
      and an increase in the proportion of short-chain fatty acids in the plasma
      membrane. We propose a model in which these changes in P. aeruginosa serve as a
      signal for the Wsp system to constitutively produce increased amounts of c-di-GMP
      and thus play a role in the regulation of adhesion-stimulated bacterial
      responses.

TI  - Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates the deubiquitylase OTUB1 at Ser16 to trigger
      its nuclear localization.
PG  - ra35
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa0441 [doi]
AB  - The deubiquitylating enzyme OTUB1 is present in all tissues and targets many
      substrates, in both the cytosol and nucleus. We found that casein kinase 2 (CK2) 
      phosphorylated OTUB1 at Ser(16) to promote its nuclear accumulation in cells.
      Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of CK2 blocked the phosphorylation
      of OTUB1 at Ser(16), causing its nuclear exclusion in various cell types. Whereas
      we detected unphosphorylated OTUB1 mainly in the cytosol, we detected
      Ser(16)-phosphorylated OTUB1 only in the nucleus. In vitro,
      Ser(16)-phosphorylated OTUB1 and nonphosphorylated OTUB1 exhibited similar
      catalytic activity, bound K63-linked ubiquitin chains, and interacted with the E2
      enzyme UBE2N. CK2-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear localization of
      OTUB1 promoted the formation of 53BP1 (p53-binding protein 1) DNA repair foci in 
      the nucleus of osteosarcoma cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Our findings
      indicate that the activity of CK2 is necessary for the nuclear translocation and 
      subsequent function of OTUB1 in DNA damage repair.

TI  - The mTORC1/4E-BP pathway coordinates hemoglobin production with L-leucine
      availability.
PG  - ra34
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa5903 [doi]
AB  - In multicellular organisms, the mechanisms by which diverse cell types acquire
      distinct amino acids and how cellular function adapts to their availability are
      fundamental questions in biology. We found that increased neutral essential amino
      acid (NEAA) uptake was a critical component of erythropoiesis. As red blood cells
      matured, expression of the amino acid transporter gene Lat3 increased, which
      increased NEAA import. Inadequate NEAA uptake by pharmacologic inhibition or
      RNAi-mediated knockdown of LAT3 triggered a specific reduction in hemoglobin
      production in zebrafish embryos and murine erythroid cells through the mTORC1
      (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1)/4E-BP (eukaryotic translation
      initiation factor 4E-binding protein) pathway. CRISPR-mediated deletion of
      members of the 4E-BP family in murine erythroid cells rendered them resistant to 
      mTORC1 and LAT3 inhibition and restored hemoglobin production. These results
      identify a developmental role for LAT3 in red blood cells and demonstrate that
      mTORC1 serves as a homeostatic sensor that couples hemoglobin production at the
      translational level to sufficient uptake of NEAAs, particularly L-leucine.

TI  - Integrative analysis of kinase networks in TRAIL-induced apoptosis provides a
      source of potential targets for combination therapy.
PG  - rs3
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005700 [doi]
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an endogenous 
      secreted peptide and, in preclinical studies, preferentially induces apoptosis in
      tumor cells rather than in normal cells. The acquisition of resistance in cells
      exposed to TRAIL or its mimics limits their clinical efficacy. Because kinases
      are intimately involved in the regulation of apoptosis, we systematically
      characterized kinases involved in TRAIL signaling. Using RNA interference (RNAi) 
      loss-of-function and cDNA overexpression screens, we identified 169 protein
      kinases that influenced the dynamics of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the colon
      adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1. We classified the kinases as sensitizers or
      resistors or modulators, depending on the effect that knockdown and
      overexpression had on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Two of these kinases that were
      classified as resistors were PX domain-containing serine/threonine kinase (PXK)
      and AP2-associated kinase 1 (AAK1), which promote receptor endocytosis and may
      enable cells to resist TRAIL-induced apoptosis by enhancing endocytosis of the
      TRAIL receptors. We assembled protein interaction maps using mass
      spectrometry-based protein interaction analysis and quantitative
      phosphoproteomics. With these protein interaction maps, we modeled information
      flow through the networks and identified apoptosis-modifying kinases that are
      highly connected to regulated substrates downstream of TRAIL. The results of this
      analysis provide a resource of potential targets for the development of TRAIL
      combination therapies to selectively kill cancer cells.

AB  - Immunoblotting (also known as Western blotting) combined with digital image
      analysis can be a reliable method for analyzing the abundance of proteins and
      protein modifications, but not every immunoblot-analysis combination produces an 
      accurate result. I illustrate how sample preparation, protocol implementation,
      detection scheme, and normalization approach profoundly affect the quantitative
      performance of immunoblotting. This study implemented diagnostic experiments that
      assess an immunoblot-analysis workflow for accuracy and precision. The results
      showed that ignoring such diagnostics can lead to pseudoquantitative immunoblot
      data that markedly overestimate or underestimate true differences in protein
      abundance.

PG  - re5
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa6466 [doi]
AB  - Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins represent an important level
      of cellular control. They participate in the efficient transduction of signals
      and form the basis of long-term cellular memory, allowing cells to adapt to a
      rapidly changing environment. More than 200 different PTMs have been described
      that affect many aspects of protein functions, and the importance of these
      modifications is evident from the number of diseases that arise from their
      deregulation. The proteome-wide analysis of certain PTMs, such as
      phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and
      sumoylation, has become a standard procedure in many laboratories. We highlight
      and discuss some important aspects of systems-wide PTM analyses using mass
      spectrometry-based methods.

AB  - Dynamic models can offer deep understanding of information processing mechanisms 
      in physiology, cell signaling, and biological regulation when they are
      appropriately detailed. Here, we describe some of the key aspects of the
      model-building process, including proper parameterization and error analysis, as 
      well as common mistakes, such as model-tweaking and oversimplification, which can
      decrease the value of the models.

AB  - The issue of reproducibility and reliability in science has come to the forefront
      in light of several high-profile studies that could not be reproduced. Whereas
      some errors in reliability can be attributed to the application of new techniques
      that have unappreciated caveats, some problems with reproducibility lie in the
      climate of intense pressure for funding and to publish faced by many researchers.

TI  - T lymphocyte regulation by mevalonate metabolism.
PG  - re4
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005970 [doi]
AB  - Whereas resting T cells, which have low metabolic requirements, use oxidative
      phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to maximize their generation of ATP, activated T cells, 
      similar to tumor cells, shift metabolic activity to aerobic glycolysis, which
      also fuels mevalonate metabolism. Both sterol and nonsterol derivatives of
      mevalonate affect T cell function. The intracellular availability of sterols,
      which is dynamically regulated by different classes of transcription factors,
      represents a metabolic checkpoint that modulates T cell responses. The electron
      carrier ubiquinone, which is modified with an isoprenoid membrane anchor, plays a
      pivotal role in OXPHOS, which supports the proliferation of T cells.
      Isoprenylation also mediates the plasma membrane attachment of the Ras, Rho, and 
      Rab guanosine triphosphatases, which are involved in T cell immunological synapse
      formation, migration, proliferation, and cytotoxic effector responses. Finally,
      multiple phosphorylated mevalonate derivatives can act as danger signals for
      innate-like gammadelta T cells, thus contributing to the immune surveillance of
      stress, pathogens, and tumors. We highlight the importance of the mevalonate
      pathway in the metabolic reprogramming of effector and regulatory T cells.

TI  - Molecular recognition of ketamine by a subset of olfactory G protein-coupled
      receptors.
PG  - ra33
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005912 [doi]
AB  - Ketamine elicits various neuropharmacological effects, including sedation,
      analgesia, general anesthesia, and antidepressant activity. Through an in vitro
      screen, we identified four mouse olfactory receptors (ORs) that responded to
      ketamine. In addition to their presence in the olfactory epithelium, these G
      protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors
      (GPCRs) are distributed throughout the central nervous system. To better
      understand the molecular basis of the interactions between ketamine and ORs, we
      used sequence comparison and molecular modeling to design mutations that (i)
      increased, reduced, or abolished ketamine responsiveness in responding receptors,
      and (ii) rendered nonresponding receptors responsive to ketamine. We showed that 
      olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that expressed distinct ORs responded to
      ketamine in vivo, suggesting that ORs may serve as functional targets for
      ketamine. The ability to both abolish and introduce responsiveness to ketamine in
      GPCRs enabled us to identify and confirm distinct interaction loci in the binding
      site, which suggested a signature ketamine-binding pocket that may guide
      exploration of additional receptors for this general anesthetic drug.

TI  - PTEN inhibits PREX2-catalyzed activation of RAC1 to restrain tumor cell invasion.
PG  - ra32
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005840 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor PTEN restrains cell migration and invasion by a mechanism
      that is independent of inhibition of the PI3K pathway and decreased activation of
      the kinase AKT. PREX2, a widely distributed GEF that activates the GTPase RAC1,
      binds to and inhibits PTEN. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts and breast cancer
      cell lines to show that PTEN suppresses cell migration and invasion by blocking
      PREX2 activity. In addition to metabolizing the phosphoinositide PIP(3), PTEN
      inhibited PREX2-induced invasion by a mechanism that required the tail domain of 
      PTEN, but not its lipid phosphatase activity. Fluorescent nucleotide exchange
      assays revealed that PTEN inhibited the GEF activity of PREX2 toward RAC1. PREX2 
      is a frequently mutated GEF in cancer, and examination of human tumor data showed
      that PREX2 mutation was associated with high PTEN expression. Therefore, we
      tested whether cancer-derived somatic PREX2 mutants, which accelerate tumor
      formation of immortalized melanocytes, were inhibited by PTEN. The three stably
      expressed, somatic PREX2 cancer mutants that we tested were resistant to
      PTEN-mediated inhibition of invasion but retained the ability to inhibit the
      lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN. In vitro analysis showed that PTEN did not
      block the GEF activity of two PREX2 cancer mutants and had a reduced binding
      affinity for the third. Thus, PTEN antagonized migration and invasion by
      restraining PREX2 GEF activity, and PREX2 mutants are likely selected in cancer
      to escape PTEN-mediated inhibition of invasion.

TI  - DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor 2) suppresses osteoclastogenesis and is a
      potential therapeutic target in osteoporosis.
PG  - ra31
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005835 [doi]
AB  - Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by abnormal skeletal fragility due to an 
      imbalance in bone homeostasis. Finding therapeutic targets that promote bone
      formation is valuable for treating osteoporosis. Discoidin domain receptor 2
      (DDR2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that promotes the differentiation of
      bone-depositing cells, osteoblasts, and bone formation. We investigated the role 
      of DDR2 in osteoclastogenesis, the formation of cells responsible for bone
      resorption. We found that, although differentiated osteoclasts had catalytically 
      active DDR2, its abundance was decreased. Overexpression of DDR2 inhibited the
      expression of osteoclastic markers, osteoclast maturation, and
      osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in a culture model of bone matrix.
      Conversely, knocking down Ddr2 through RNA interference accelerated osteoclast
      differentiation and bone resorption in mice. Further, we identified the
      co-receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) as a DDR2-interacting protein. DDR2 facilitated
      the binding of Nrp1 and the co-receptor PlexinA1 by forming a DDR2-Nrp1-PlexinA1 
      complex, which blocked PlexinA1-mediated stimulation of osteoclastogenesis. DDR2 
      prevented PlexinA1 from interacting with the receptor TREM2 and the adaptor
      DAP12. Moreover, knocking down Nrp1 rescued the expression of osteoclastic
      markers observed in DDR2-overexpressing cells, whereas ectopic expression of Nrp1
      in DDR2-silenced cells inhibited the induction of osteoclastogenesis. Nrp1
      enhanced the function of DDR2 in promoting osteoblast differentiation and bone
      formation in mice. In an ovariectomized mouse model of osteoporosis,
      adenovirus-mediated delivery of DDR2 to the femur bone alleviated osteopenic
      phenotypes. Our results revealed that DDR2 functions as an inhibitor of
      osteoclastogenesis, as well as a promoter of osteoblastogenesis, suggesting that 
      enhancing DDR2 may be therapeutic for patients with osteoporosis.

TI  - Site-specific methylation of Notch1 controls the amplitude and duration of the
      Notch1 response.
PG  - ra30
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005892 [doi]
AB  - Physiologically, Notch signal transduction plays a pivotal role in
      differentiation; pathologically, Notch signaling contributes to the development
      of cancer. Transcriptional activation of Notch target genes involves cleavage of 
      the Notch receptor in response to ligand binding, production of the Notch
      intracellular domain (NICD), and NICD migration into the nucleus and assembly of 
      a coactivator complex. Posttranslational modifications of the NICD are important 
      for its transcriptional activity and protein turnover. Deregulation of Notch
      signaling and stabilizing mutations of Notch1 have been linked to leukemia
      development. We found that the methyltransferase CARM1 (coactivator-associated
      arginine methyltransferase 1; also known as PRMT4) methylated NICD at five
      conserved arginine residues within the C-terminal transactivation domain. CARM1
      physically and functionally interacted with the NICD-coactivator complex and was 
      found at gene enhancers in a Notch-dependent manner. Although a
      methylation-defective NICD mutant was biochemically more stable, this mutant was 
      biologically less active as measured with Notch assays in embryos of Xenopus
      laevis and Danio rerio. Mathematical modeling indicated that full but short and
      transient Notch signaling required methylation of NICD.

PG  - re3
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005825 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that suppress the abundance of
      partially complementary mRNAs and inhibit their translation. Each miRNA can
      regulate hundreds of mRNAs, sometimes strongly but often weakly, to mediate a
      diverse array of biological functions, including proliferation, cell signaling,
      differentiation, stress responses and DNA repair, cell adhesion and motility,
      inflammation, cell survival, senescence, and apoptosis, all intimately related to
      cancer initiation, treatment response, and metastasis. The expression and
      activity of miRNAs are spatially and temporally controlled. Global miRNA
      expression is reduced in many cancers. In addition, the expression and processing
      of cancer-related miRNAs that act as oncogenes ("oncomiRs") or tumor suppressors 
      are often dysregulated in cancer. In this review, we summarize emerging knowledge
      about how miRNA biogenesis and gene silencing are altered to promote cancer.

TI  - Outside the coding genome, mammalian microRNAs confer structural and functional
      complexity.
PG  - re2
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005813 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a class of small, regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) 
      with pivotal roles in posttranscriptional gene regulation. Since their initial
      discovery in 1993, numerous miRNAs have been identified in mammalian genomes,
      many of which play important roles in diverse cellular processes in development
      and disease. These small ncRNAs regulate the expression of many protein-coding
      genes posttranscriptionally, thus adding a substantial complexity to the
      molecular networks underlying physiological development and disease. In part,
      this complexity arises from the distinct gene structures, the extensive genomic
      redundancy, and the complex regulation of the expression and biogenesis of
      miRNAs. These characteristics contribute to the functional robustness and
      versatility of miRNAs and provide important clues to the functional significance 
      of these small ncRNAs. The unique structure and function of miRNAs will continue 
      to inspire many to explore the vast noncoding genome and to elucidate the
      molecular basis for the functional complexity of mammalian genomes.

TI  - EGF induces microRNAs that target suppressors of cell migration: miR-15b targets 
      MTSS1 in breast cancer.

AB  - Growth factors promote tumor growth and metastasis. We found that epidermal
      growth factor (EGF) induced a set of 22 microRNAs (miRNAs) before promoting the
      migration of mammary cells. These miRNAs were more abundant in human breast
      tumors relative to the surrounding tissue, and their abundance varied among
      breast cancer subtypes. One of these miRNAs, miR-15b, targeted the 3'
      untranslated region of MTSS1 (metastasis suppressor protein 1). Although
      xenografts in which MTSS1 was knocked down grew more slowly in mice initially,
      longer-term growth was unaffected. Knocking down MTSS1 increased migration and
      Matrigel invasion of nontransformed mammary epithelial cells. Overexpressing
      MTSS1 in an invasive cell line decreased cell migration and invasiveness,
      decreased the formation of invadopodia and actin stress fibers, and increased the
      formation of cellular junctions. In tissues from breast cancer patients with the 
      aggressive basal subtype, an inverse correlation occurred with the high
      expression of miRNA-15b and the low expression of MTSS1. Furthermore, low
      abundance of MTSS1 correlated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, growth
      factor-inducible miRNAs mediate mechanisms underlying the progression of cancer.

      E-mediated allergic responses.
PG  - ra28
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005861 [doi]
AB  - Subsets of B cells inhibit various immune responses through their production of
      the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). We found that IL-10-producing CD5(+) B cells
      suppressed the immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and antigen-mediated activation of mast
      cells in vitro as well as allergic responses in mice in an IL-10-dependent
      manner. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of these B cells on mast cells in
      vitro and in vivo depended on direct cell-to-cell contact through the
      costimulatory receptor CD40 on CD5(+) B cells and the CD40 ligand on mast cells. 
      This contact enhanced the production of IL-10 by the CD5(+) B cells. Through
      activation of the Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 pathway, IL-10 decreased the abundance of the kinases Fyn and Fgr
      and inhibited the activation of the downstream kinase Syk in mast cells.
      Together, these findings suggest that an important function of IL-10-producing
      CD5(+) B cells is inhibiting mast cells and IgE-mediated allergic responses.

AB  - Through various means, noncoding RNAs regulate the expression of genes, many of
      which are associated with cellular homeostasis. Noncoding RNAs--especially
      microRNAs--are critical regulators of the mechanisms underlying numerous
      processes in cell biology, particularly those involved in the development and
      progression of cancer. This special issue of Science Signaling sheds light on the
      physiological and pathophysiological functions of this distinct class of
      molecules.

TI  - Plasma membrane-associated platforms: dynamic scaffolds that organize
      membrane-associated events.
PG  - re1
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa3312 [doi]
AB  - Specialized regions of the plasma membrane dedicated to diverse cellular
      processes, such as vesicle exocytosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and cell 
      migration, share a few cytosolic scaffold proteins that associate to form large
      plasma membrane-associated platforms (PMAPs). PMAPs organize signaling events and
      trafficking of membranes and molecules at specific membrane domains. On the basis
      of the intrinsic disorder of the proteins constituting the core of these PMAPs
      and of the dynamics of these structures at the periphery of motile cells, we
      propose a working model for the assembly and turnover of these platforms.

TI  - Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha triggered by mTORC1 inhibition and PP6C activation
      is required for autophagy and is aberrant in PP6C-mutated melanoma.
PG  - ra27
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa0899 [doi]
AB  - Amino acid deprivation promotes the inhibition of the kinase complex mTORC1
      (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and activation of the kinase GCN2
      (general control nonrepressed 2). Signaling pathways downstream of both kinases
      have been thought to independently induce autophagy. We showed that these two
      amino acid-sensing systems are linked. We showed that pharmacological inhibition 
      of mTORC1 led to activation of GCN2 and phosphorylation of the eukaryotic
      initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) in a mechanism dependent on the catalytic
      subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6C). Autophagy induced by pharmacological
      inhibition of mTORC1 required PP6C, GCN2, and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Although
      some of the PP6C mutants found in melanoma did not form a strong complex with PP6
      regulatory subunits and were rapidly degraded, these mutants paradoxically
      stabilized PP6C encoded by the wild-type allele and increased eIF2alpha
      phosphorylation. Furthermore, these PP6C mutations were associated with increased
      autophagy in vitro and in human melanoma samples. Thus, these data showed that
      GCN2 activation and phosphorylation of eIF2alpha in response to mTORC1 inhibition
      are necessary for autophagy. Additionally, we described a role for PP6C in this
      process and provided a mechanism for PP6C mutations associated with melanoma.

AB  - Rhodopsin is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that serves as a dim-light
      receptor for vision in vertebrates. We probed light-induced conformational
      changes in rhodopsin in its native membrane environment at room temperature using
      time-resolved wide-angle x-ray scattering. We observed a rapid conformational
      transition that is consistent with an outward tilt of the cytoplasmic portion of 
      transmembrane helix 6 concomitant with an inward movement of the cytoplasmic
      portion of transmembrane helix 5. These movements were considerably larger than
      those reported from the basis of crystal structures of activated rhodopsin,
      implying that light activation of rhodopsin involves a more extended
      conformational change than was previously suggested.

TI  - Viral entry route determines how human plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce type 
      I interferons.
PG  - ra25
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa1552 [doi]
AB  - Although plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) represent a rare immune cell type,
      they are the most important source of type I interferons (IFNs) upon viral
      infection. Phagocytosed RNA viruses and RNA virus-infected cells are detected by 
      pDCs with the endosomal pattern recognition receptor (PRR) toll-like receptor 7
      (TLR7). We showed that replication of the yellow fever live vaccine YF-17D in
      human pDCs and pDC-like cell lines stimulated type I IFN production through RIG-I
      (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), a member of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)
      family of cytosolic PRRs. Thus, human pDCs sense replicative viral RNA. In
      contrast, direct contact between pDCs and YF-17D-infected cells stimulated a
      TLR7-dependent, viral replication-independent production of type I IFN. We also
      showed that the RLR pathway was dampened by the activities of interleukin-1
      receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK1 and IRAK4), which are downstream
      effectors of the TLR7 pathway, suggesting that both kinases play opposing roles
      downstream of specific PRRs. Together, these data suggest that a virus can
      stimulate either TLR or RLR signaling in the same cell, depending on how its
      nucleic acid content is delivered.

TI  - Control of IL-17 receptor signaling and tissue inflammation by the p38alpha-MKP-1
      signaling axis in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.
PG  - ra24
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa2147 [doi]
AB  - T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells that secrete the
      proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17), play a key pathogenic role in
      autoimmune diseases. Through inducible and tissue-specific deletion systems, we
      described the time- and tissue-specific roles of the mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) p38alpha in mediating T(H)17 cell-induced tissue inflammation.
      Inducible deletion of Mapk14 (which encodes p38alpha) after the onset of
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model for human
      multiple sclerosis, protected mice from inflammation. Furthermore, the severity
      of EAE was markedly reduced in mice with specific loss of p38alpha in
      neuroectoderm-derived cells, including astrocytes, an effect that was associated 
      with defective production of chemokines and decreased infiltration of the target 
      tissue by immune cells. p38alpha linked IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) signaling to the 
      expression of genes encoding proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Mice that 
      lacked MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), an inhibitor of p38alpha, had exacerbated EAE 
      and enhanced expression of IL-17R-dependent genes. Our results suggest that the
      p38alpha-MKP-1 signaling axis links IL-17R signaling in tissue-resident cells to 
      autoimmune inflammation dependent on infiltrating T(H)17 cells.

TI  - Ca2+ signals regulate mitochondrial metabolism by stimulating CREB-mediated
      expression of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter gene MCU.
PG  - ra23
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005673 [doi]
AB  - Cytosolic Ca2+ signals, generated through the coordinated translocation of Ca2+
      across the plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, mediate 
      diverse cellular responses. Mitochondrial Ca2+ is important for mitochondrial
      function, and when cytosolic Ca2+ concentration becomes too high, mitochondria
      function as cellular Ca2+ sinks. By measuring mitochondrial Ca2+ currents, we
      found that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was reduced in chicken DT40 B lymphocytes
      lacking either the ER-localized inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), which
      releases Ca2+ from the ER, or Orai1 or STIM1, components of the PM-localized Ca2+
      -permeable channel complex that mediates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in
      response to depletion of ER Ca2+ stores. The abundance of MCU, the pore-forming
      subunit of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, was reduced in cells deficient in
      IP3R, STIM1, or Orai1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter reporter
      analyses revealed that the Ca2+ -regulated transcription factor CREB (cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein) directly bound the MCU 
      promoter and stimulated expression. Lymphocytes deficient in IP3R, STIM1, or
      Orai1 exhibited altered mitochondrial metabolism, indicating that Ca2+ released
      from the ER and SOCE-mediated signals modulates mitochondrial function. Thus, our
      results showed that a transcriptional regulatory circuit involving Ca2+
      -dependent activation of CREB controls the Ca2+ uptake capability of mitochondria
      and hence regulates mitochondrial metabolism.

TI  - A biosensor for the activity of the "sheddase" TACE (ADAM17) reveals novel and
      cell type-specific mechanisms of TACE activation.
PG  - rs1
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005680 [doi]
AB  - Diverse environmental conditions stimulate protein "shedding" from the cell
      surface through proteolytic cleavage. The protease TACE [tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNFalpha)--converting enzyme, encoded by ADAM17] mediates protein
      shedding, thereby regulating the maturation and release of various extracellular 
      substrates, such as growth factors and cytokines, that induce diverse cellular
      responses. We developed a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based
      biosensor called TSen that quantitatively reports the kinetics of TACE activity
      in live cells. In combination with chemical biology approaches, we used TSen to
      probe the dependence of TACE activation on the induction of the kinases p38 and
      ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) in various epithelial cell lines.
      Using TSen, we found that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in keratinocytes
      induced rapid and robust TSen cleavage and the accumulation of TACE at the plasma
      membrane. Cytoskeletal disruption also increased the cleavage of endogenous TACE 
      substrates, including transforming growth factor-alpha. Thus, TSen is a useful
      tool for unraveling the mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal activation of
      TACE in live cells.

TI  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch inhibits p38alpha signaling and skin inflammation
      through the ubiquitylation of Tab1.
PG  - ra22
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005903 [doi]
AB  - Deficiency in the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch causes a skin-scratching phenotype in 
      mice. We found that there was increased phosphorylation and activation of the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase p38alpha in spontaneous and experimentally
      induced skin lesions of Itch-deficient (Itch-/-) mice. Itch bound directly to the
      TGF-beta-activated kinase 1-binding protein 1 (Tab1) through a conserved PPXY
      motif and inhibited the activation of p38alpha. Knockdown of Tab1 by short
      hairpin RNA attenuated the prolonged p38alpha phosphorylation exhibited by
      Itch-/- cells. Similarly, reconstitution of Itch-/- cells with wild-type Itch,
      but not the ligase-deficient Itch-C830A mutant, inhibited the phosphorylation and
      activation of p38alpha. Compared to the skin of wild-type mice, the skin of
      Itch-/- mice contained increased amounts of the mRNAs of proinflammatory
      cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta,
      IL-11, and IL-19. Inhibition of p38 or blocking the interaction between p38alpha 
      and Tab1 with a cell-permeable peptide substantially attenuated skin inflammation
      in Itch-/- mice. These findings provide insight into how Itch-mediated regulatory
      mechanisms prevent chronic skin inflammation, which could be exploited
      therapeutically.

TI  - Mer signaling increases the abundance of the transcription factor LXR to promote 
      the resolution of acute sterile inflammation.
PG  - ra21
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005864 [doi]
AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase Mer plays a central role in inhibiting the
      inflammatory response of immune cells to pathogens. We aimed to understand the
      function of Mer signaling in the resolution of sterile inflammation in
      experiments with a Mer-neutralizing antibody or with Mer-deficient (Mer-/-) mice 
      in a model of sterile, zymosan-induced acute inflammation. We found that
      inhibition or deficiency of Mer enhanced local and systemic inflammatory
      responses. The exacerbated inflammatory responses induced by the lack of Mer
      signaling were associated with reduced abundance of the transcription factors
      liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and LXRbeta and decreased expression of their
      target genes in peritoneal macrophages, spleens, and lungs. Similarly, treatment 
      of mice with a Mer/Fc fusion protein, which prevents the Mer ligand Gas6 (growth 
      arrest-specific protein 6) from binding to Mer, exacerbated the inflammatory
      response and decreased the abundance of LXR. Coadministration of the LXR agonist 
      T0901317 with the Mer-neutralizing antibody inhibited the aggravating effects of 
      the antibody on inflammation in mice. In vitro exposure of RAW264.7 cells or
      primary peritoneal macrophages to Gas6 increased LXR abundance in an
      Akt-dependent manner. Thus, we have elucidated a previously uncharacterized
      pathway involved in the resolution of acute sterile inflammation: Enhanced Mer
      signaling during the recovery phase increases the abundance and activity of LXR
      to inactivate the inflammatory response in macrophages.

PG  - ra20
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005648 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress stimulates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and
      NF-kappaB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells during
      several pathological conditions, including ischemia/reperfusion injury. We found 
      that the Nck family of adaptor proteins linked tyrosine kinase signaling to
      oxidative stress-induced activation of NF-kappaB through the classic IkappaB
      kinase-dependent pathway. Depletion of Nck prevented oxidative stress induced by 
      exogenous hydrogen peroxide or hypoxia/reoxygenation injury from activating
      NF-kappaB in endothelial cells, increasing the abundance of the proinflammatory
      molecules ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule-1) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell
      adhesion molecule-1) and recruiting leukocytes. Nck depletion also attenuated
      endothelial cell expression of genes encoding proinflammatory factors but not
      those encoding antioxidants. Nck promoted oxidative stress-induced activation of 
      NF-kappaB by coupling the tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 (platelet
      endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) to the activation of p21-activated kinase, 
      which mediates oxidative stress-induced NF-kappaB signaling. Consistent with this
      mechanism, treatment of mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury in the
      cremaster muscle with a Nck inhibitory peptide blocked leukocyte adhesion and
      emigration and the accompanying vascular leak. Together, these data identify Nck 
      as an important mediator of oxidative stress-induced inflammation and a potential
      therapeutic target for ischemia/reperfusion injury.

      the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) (PMCAs), which use
      ATP to transport Ca(2+) out of cells. PMCA isoforms exhibit different kinetic and
      regulatory properties; thus, the presence and relative abundance of individual
      isoforms may help shape Ca(2+) transients and cellular responses. We studied the 
      effects of three PMCA isoforms (PMCA4a, PMCA4b, and PMCA2b) on Ca(2+) transients 
      elicited by conditions that trigger store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) and that
      blocked Ca(2+) uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum in HeLa cells, human
      embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, or primary endothelial cell isolated from human
      umbilical cord veins (HUVECs). The slowly activating PMCA4b isoform produced
      long-lasting Ca(2+) oscillations in response to SOCE. The fast-activating
      isoforms PMCA2b and PMCA4a produced different effects. PMCA2b resulted in rapid
      and highly PMCA abundance-sensitive clearance of SOCE-mediated Ca(2+) transients,
      whereas PMCA4a reduced cytosolic Ca(2+), resulting in the establishment of a
      higher than baseline cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Mathematical modeling showed
      that slow activation was critical to the sustained oscillation induced by the
      "slow" PMCA4b pump. The modeling and experimental results indicated that the
      distinct properties of PMCA isoforms differentially regulate the pattern of
      SOCE-mediated Ca(2+) transients, which would thus affect the activation of
      downstream signaling pathways.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005547 [doi]
AB  - Factors secreted by tumor cells shape the local microenvironment to promote
      invasion and metastasis, as well as condition the premetastatic niche to enable
      secondary-site colonization and growth. In addition to this secretome, tumor
      cells have increased abundance of growth-promoting receptors at the cell surface.
      We found that the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 (also called Pez, which is mutated 
      in various cancers) suppressed metastasis by reducing intracellular protein
      trafficking through the secretory pathway. Knocking down PTPN14 in tumor cells or
      injecting the peritoneum of mice with conditioned medium from PTPN14-deficient
      cell cultures promoted the growth and metastasis of breast cancer xenografts.
      Loss of catalytically functional PTPN14 increased the secretion of growth factors
      and cytokines, such as IL-8 (interleukin-8), and increased the abundance of EGFR 
      (epidermal growth factor receptor) at the cell surface of breast cancer cells and
      of FLT4 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3) at the cell surface of
      primary lymphatic endothelial cells. We identified RIN1 (Ras and Rab interactor
      1) and PRKCD (protein kinase C-delta) as binding partners and substrates of
      PTPN14. Similar to cells overexpressing PTPN14, receptor trafficking to the cell 
      surface was inhibited in cells that lacked PRKCD or RIN1 or expressed a
      nonphosphorylatable RIN1 mutant, and cytokine secretion was decreased in cells
      treated with PRKCD inhibitors. Invasive breast cancer tissue had decreased
      expression of PTPN14, and patient survival was worse when tumors had increased
      expression of the genes encoding RIN1 or PRKCD. Thus, PTPN14 prevents metastasis 
      by restricting the trafficking of both soluble and membrane-bound proteins.

      activation by the alpha1 adrenoreceptor in smooth muscle cells.
PG  - ra17

AB  - Both purinergic signaling through nucleotides such as ATP (adenosine
      5'-triphosphate) and noradrenergic signaling through molecules such as
      norepinephrine regulate vascular tone and blood pressure. Pannexin1 (Panx1),
      which forms large-pore, ATP-releasing channels, is present in vascular smooth
      muscle cells in peripheral blood vessels and participates in noradrenergic
      responses. Using pharmacological approaches and mice conditionally lacking Panx1 
      in smooth muscle cells, we found that Panx1 contributed to vasoconstriction
      mediated by the alpha1 adrenoreceptor (alpha1AR), whereas vasoconstriction in
      response to serotonin or endothelin-1 was independent of Panx1. Analysis of the
      Panx1-deficient mice showed that Panx1 contributed to blood pressure regulation
      especially during the night cycle when sympathetic nervous activity is highest.
      Using mimetic peptides and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a specific
      amino acid sequence in the Panx1 intracellular loop that is essential for
      activation by alpha1AR signaling. Collectively, these data describe a specific
      link between noradrenergic and purinergic signaling in blood pressure
      homeostasis.

TI  - Sympathetic vasoconstriction takes an unexpected pannexin detour.
PG  - fs4
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa7312 [doi]
AB  - Sympathetic vasoconstriction plays an important role in the control of blood
      pressure and the distribution of blood flow. In this issue of Science Signaling, 
      Billaud et al. show that sympathetic vasoconstriction occurs through a complex
      scheme involving the activation of large-pore pannexin 1 channels and the
      subsequent release of adenosine triphosphate that promotes contraction in an
      autocrine and paracrine manner. This elaborate mechanism may function as a point 
      of intercept for other signaling pathways-for example, in relation to the
      phenomenon "functional sympatholysis," in which exercise abrogates sympathetic
      vasoconstriction in skeletal muscle. Because pannexin 1 channels are inhibited by
      nitric oxide, they may function as a switch to turn off adrenergic signaling in
      skeletal muscle during exercise.

AB  - Immune responses to viral infection are stochastic processes, which initiate in a
      limited number of cells that then propagate the response. A key component of the 
      response to viral infection entails the synthesis and secretion of type I
      interferons (IFNs), including the early induction of the gene encoding IFN-beta
      (Ifnb1). With single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling, we investigated the
      mechanisms underlying how increases in the amount of Ifnb1 mRNA per cell and in
      the numbers of cells expressing Ifnb1 calibrate the response to viral infection. 
      We used single-cell, single-molecule assays to quantify the early induction of
      Ifnb1 expression (the Ifnb1 response) in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells
      infected with Newcastle disease virus, thus retaining the physiological
      stoichiometry of transcriptional regulators to both alleles of the Ifnb1 gene. We
      applied computational methods to extract the stochastic features that underlie
      the cell-to-cell variations in gene expression over time. Integration of
      simulations and experiments identified the role of paracrine signaling in
      increasing the number of cells that express Ifnb1 over time and in calibrating
      the immune response to viral infection.

TI  - Activation of TRPV1 channels inhibits mechanosensitive Piezo channel activity by 
      depleting membrane phosphoinositides.
PG  - ra15
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005667 [doi]
AB  - Capsaicin is an activator of the heat-sensitive TRPV1 (transient receptor
      potential vanilloid 1) ion channels and has been used as a local analgesic. We
      found that activation of TRPV1 channels with capsaicin either in dorsal root
      ganglion neurons or in a heterologous expression system inhibited the
      mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels by depleting phosphatidylinositol
      4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and its precursor phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
      [PI(4)P] from the plasma membrane through Ca(2+)-induced phospholipase Cdelta
      (PLCdelta) activation. Experiments with chemically inducible phosphoinositide
      phosphatases and receptor-induced activation of PLCbeta indicated that inhibition
      of Piezo channels required depletion of both PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2. The
      mechanically activated current amplitudes decreased substantially in the excised 
      inside-out configuration, where the membrane patch containing Piezo1 channels is 
      removed from the cell. PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P applied to these excised patches
      inhibited this decrease. Thus, we concluded that Piezo channel activity requires 
      the presence of phosphoinositides, and the combined depletion of PI(4,5)P2 and
      PI(4)P reduces channel activity. In addition to revealing a role for distinct
      membrane lipids in mechanosensitive ion channel regulation, these data suggest
      that inhibition of Piezo2 channels may contribute to the analgesic effect of
      capsaicin.

TI  - Ski regulates Hippo and TAZ signaling to suppress breast cancer progression.
PG  - ra14
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005735 [doi]
AB  - Ski, the transforming protein of the avian Sloan-Kettering retrovirus, inhibits
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signaling and displays both
      pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities in human cancer. Inhibition of
      TGF-beta signaling is likely responsible for the pro-oncogenic activity of Ski.
      We investigated the mechanism(s) underlying the tumor suppressor activity of Ski 
      and found that Ski suppressed the activity of the Hippo signaling effectors TAZ
      and YAP to inhibit breast cancer progression. TAZ and YAP are transcriptional
      coactivators that can contribute to cancer by promoting proliferation,
      tumorigenesis, and cancer stem cell expansion. Hippo signaling activates the the 
      Lats family of kinases, which phosphorylate TAZ and YAP, resulting in cytoplasmic
      retention and degradation and inhibition of their transcriptional activity. We
      showed that Ski interacted with multiple components of the Hippo pathway to
      facilitate activation of Lats2, resulting in increased phosphorylation and
      subsequent degradation of TAZ. Ski also promoted the degradation of a
      constitutively active TAZ mutant that is not phosphorylated by Lats, suggesting
      the existence of a Lats2-independent degradation pathway. Finally, we showed that
      Ski repressed the transcriptional activity of TAZ by binding to the TAZ partner
      TEAD and recruiting the transcriptional co-repressor NCoR1 to the TEAD-TAZ
      complex. Ski effectively reversed transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchyme
      transition in cultured breast cancer cells and metastasis in TAZ-expressing
      xenografted tumors. Thus, Ski inhibited the function of TAZ through multiple
      mechanisms in human cancer cells.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa6769 [doi]
AB  - Piezo proteins--a family of mammalian cation-selective ion channels that respond 
      to mechanical stretch--are molecular mediators of biological processes, including
      vascular tone, hearing, touch, and pain. In this issue of Science Signaling,
      Rohacs and colleagues demonstrate that activation of the heat-sensitive transient
      receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), another cation channel, inhibits Piezo
      channels through a calcium-induced depletion of phosphoinositides. This
      regulation could contribute to the cellular mechanisms by which the TRPV1
      activator capsaicin mitigates mechanical hypersensitivity.

PG  - tr1
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005839 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle cells release and resequester stored calcium ions to contract and
      subsequently relax. CalDyx (short for "Calcium Dynamics") is a self-contained
      software program that teaches the student about the major events that underlie
      the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process in skeletal muscle. The program 
      simulates changes in the concentrations of myoplasmic calcium (Ca(2+)) in three
      types of adult vertebrate muscle fibers (slow-twitch, fast-twitch, and
      superfast-twitch) in response to action potentials. The simulations are closely
      tied to experimental measurements of changes in the myoplasmic free Ca(2+)
      concentration performed with calcium indicator dyes introduced by microinjection 
      into these fiber types. The program includes 10 exercises that guide the student 
      through the major signaling events of EC coupling, including the release of
      Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the binding of Ca(2+) to the major
      myoplasmic Ca(2+) binding sites, and the return of Ca(2+) to the SR by the Ca
      "pump" proteins of the SR. The program is quantitatively based and should
      increase the student's understanding of kinetic processes within cells.

TI  - Cardiac hypertrophy induced by active Raf depends on Yorkie-mediated
      transcription.
PG  - ra13
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005719 [doi]
AB  - Organ hypertrophy can result from enlargement of individual cells or from cell
      proliferation or both. Activating mutations in the serine-threonine kinase Raf
      cause cardiac hypertrophy and contribute to Noonan syndrome in humans.
      Cardiac-specific expression of activated Raf also causes hypertrophy in
      Drosophila melanogaster. We found that Yorkie (Yki), a transcriptional
      coactivator in the Hippo pathway that regulates organ size, is required for
      Raf-induced cardiac hypertrophy in flies. Although aberrant activation of Yki
      orthologs stimulates cardiac hyperplasia in mice, cardiac-specific expression of 
      an activated mutant form of Yki in fruit flies caused cardiac hypertrophy without
      hyperplasia. Knockdown of Yki caused cardiac dilation without loss of
      cardiomyocytes and prevented Raf-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In flies,
      Yki-induced cardiac hypertrophy required the TEA domain-containing transcription 
      factor Scalloped, and, in mammalian cells, expression of mouse Raf(L613V), an
      activated form of Raf with a Noonan syndrome mutation, increased Yki-induced
      Scalloped activity. Furthermore, overexpression of Tgi (a Tondu domain-containing
      Scalloped-binding corepressor) in the fly heart abrogated Yki- or Raf-induced

TI  - FOXP1 potentiates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
PG  - ra12
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005654 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor FOXP1 (forkhead box protein P1) is a master regulator of
      stem and progenitor cell biology. In diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), copy 
      number amplifications and chromosomal translocations result in overexpression of 
      FOXP1. Increased abundance of FOXP1 in DLBCL is a predictor of poor prognosis and
      resistance to therapy. We developed a genome-wide, mass spectrometry-coupled,
      gain-of-function genetic screen, which revealed that FOXP1 potentiates
      beta-catenin-dependent, Wnt-dependent gene expression. Gain- and loss-of-function
      studies in cell models and zebrafish confirmed that FOXP1 was a general and
      conserved enhancer of Wnt signaling. In a Wnt-dependent fashion, FOXP1 formed a
      complex with beta-catenin, TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2), and the
      acetyltransferase CBP [CREB (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response
      element-binding protein)-binding protein], and this complex bound the promoters
      of Wnt target genes. FOXP1 promoted the acetylation of beta-catenin by CBP, and
      acetylation was required for FOXP1-mediated potentiation of
      beta-catenin-dependent transcription. In DLBCL, we found that FOXP1 promoted
      sensitivity to Wnt pathway inhibitors, and knockdown of FOXP1 or blocking
      beta-catenin transcriptional activity slowed xenograft tumor growth. These data
      connect excessive FOXP1 with beta-catenin-dependent signal transduction and
      provide a molecular rationale for Wnt-directed therapy in DLBCL.

TI  - Phosphorylation of FADD by the kinase CK1alpha promotes KRASG12D-induced lung
      cancer.
PG  - ra9
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005607 [doi]
AB  - Genomic amplification of the gene encoding and phosphorylation of the protein
      FADD (Fas-associated death domain) is associated with poor clinical outcome in
      lung cancer and in head and neck cancer. Activating mutations in the guanosine
      triphosphatase RAS promotes cell proliferation in various cancers. Increased
      abundance of phosphorylated FADD in patient-derived tumor samples predicts poor
      clinical outcome. Using immunohistochemistry analysis and in vivo imaging of
      conditional mouse models of KRAS(G12D)-driven lung cancer, we found that the
      deletion of the gene encoding FADD suppressed tumor growth, reduced the
      proliferative index of cells, and decreased the activation of downstream
      effectors of the RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway that promote
      the cell cycle, including retinoblastoma (RB) and cyclin D1. In mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts, the induction of mitosis upon activation of KRAS required FADD and
      the phosphorylation of FADD by CK1alpha (casein kinase 1alpha). Deleting the gene
      encoding CK1alpha in KRAS mutant mice abrogated the phosphorylation of FADD and
      suppressed lung cancer development. Phosphorylated FADD was most abundant during 
      the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and mass spectrometry revealed that
      phosphorylated FADD interacted with kinases that mediate the G2/M transition,
      including PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1), AURKA (Aurora kinase A), and BUB1 (budding
      uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1). This interaction was decreased in cells treated
      with a CKI-7, a CK1alpha inhibitor. Therefore, as the kinase that phosphorylates 
      FADD downstream of RAS, CK1alpha may be a therapeutic target for KRAS-driven lung
      cancer.

PG  - ra11
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005548 [doi]
AB  - Proteolytic cleavage of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) from the 
      cell surface contributes to anti-inflammatory responses and may be beneficial in 
      reducing the excessive inflammation associated with multiple organ failure and
      mortality during sepsis. Using a clinically relevant mouse model of polymicrobial
      abdominal sepsis, we found that the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase
      (iNOS) in hepatocytes led to the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent 
      activation of the protease TACE (TNF-converting enzyme) and the shedding of TNFR.
      Furthermore, treating mice with a cGMP analog after the induction of sepsis
      increased TNFR shedding and decreased systemic inflammation. Similarly,
      increasing the abundance of cGMP with a clinically approved phosphodiesterase 5
      inhibitor (sildenafil) also decreased markers of systemic inflammation, protected
      against organ injury, and increased circulating amounts of TNFR1 in mice with
      sepsis. We further confirmed that a similar iNOS-cGMP-TACE pathway was required
      for TNFR1 shedding by human hepatocytes in response to the bacterial product
      lipopolysaccharide. Our data suggest that increasing the bioavailability of cGMP 
      might be beneficial in ameliorating the inflammation associated with sepsis.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with chronic systemic inflammation 
      and enhanced susceptibility to systemic bacterial infection (sepsis). We
      hypothesized that low insulin concentrations in T1DM trigger the enzyme
      5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to produce the lipid mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which 
      triggers systemic inflammation that may increase susceptibility to polymicrobial 
      sepsis. Consistent with chronic inflammation, peritoneal macrophages from two
      mouse models of T1DM had greater abundance of the adaptor MyD88 (myeloid
      differentiation factor 88) and its direct transcriptional effector STAT-1 (signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 1) than macrophages from nondiabetic
      mice. Expression of Alox5, which encodes 5-LO, and the concentration of the
      proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were also increased in
      peritoneal macrophages and serum from T1DM mice. Insulin treatment reduced LTB4
      concentrations in the circulation and Myd88 and Stat1 expression in the
      macrophages from T1DM mice. T1DM mice treated with a 5-LO inhibitor had reduced
      Myd88 mRNA in macrophages and increased abundance of IL-1 receptor antagonist and
      reduced production of IL-beta in the circulation. T1DM mice lacking 5-LO or the
      receptor for LTB4 also produced less proinflammatory cytokines. Compared to
      wild-type or untreated diabetic mice, T1DM mice lacking the receptor for LTB4 or 
      treated with a 5-LO inhibitor survived polymicrobial sepsis, had reduced
      production of proinflammatory cytokines, and had decreased bacterial counts.
      These results uncover a role for LTB4 in promoting sterile inflammation in
      diabetes and the enhanced susceptibility to sepsis in T1DM.

PG  - ra8
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005564 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophils, which migrate toward inflamed sites and kill pathogens by producing 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), are important in the defense against bacterial and
      fungal pathogens, but their inappropriate regulation causes various chronic
      inflammatory diseases. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) functions
      downstream of proinflammatory G protein (heterotrimeric guanine
      nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in neutrophils and is a
      therapeutic target. In neutrophils, PI3Kgamma consists of a p110gamma catalytic
      subunit, which is activated by the guanosine triphosphatase Ras, and either a p84
      or p101 regulatory subunit. Loss or inhibition of p110gamma or expression of a
      Ras-insensitive variant p110gamma (p110gamma(DASAA/DASAA)) impairs PIP3
      production, Akt phosphorylation, migration, and ROS formation in response to GPCR
      activation. The p101 subunit binds to, and mediates PI3Kgamma activation by, G
      protein betagamma subunits, and p101(-/-) neutrophils have a similar phenotype to
      that of p110gamma(-/-) neutrophils, except that ROS responses are normal. We
      found that p84(-/-) neutrophils displayed reduced GPCR-stimulated PIP3 and Akt
      signaling, which was indistinguishable from that of p101(-/-) neutrophils.
      However, p84(-/-) neutrophils produced less ROS and exhibited normal migration in
      response to GPCR stimulation. These data suggest that p84-containing PI3Kgamma
      controls GPCR-dependent ROS production. Thus, the PI3Kgamma regulatory subunits
      enable PI3Kgamma to mediate distinct neutrophil responses, which may occur by
      targeting PIP3 signaling into spatially distinct domains.

TI  - Synaptojanin 2 is a druggable mediator of metastasis and the gene is
      overexpressed and amplified in breast cancer.
PG  - ra7
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005537 [doi]
AB  - Amplified HER2, which encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) family, is a target of effective therapies against breast cancer. In
      search for similarly targetable genomic aberrations, we identified copy number
      gains in SYNJ2, which encodes the 5'-inositol lipid phosphatase synaptojanin 2,
      as well as overexpression in a small fraction of human breast tumors. Copy gain
      and overexpression correlated with shorter patient survival and a low abundance
      of the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-31. SYNJ2 promoted cell migration and
      invasion in culture and lung metastasis of breast tumor xenografts in mice.
      Knocking down SYNJ2 impaired the endocytic recycling of EGFR and the formation of
      cellular lamellipodia and invadopodia. Screening compound libraries identified
      SYNJ2-specific inhibitors that prevented cell migration but did not affect the
      related neural protein SYNJ1, suggesting that SYNJ2 is a potentially druggable
      target to block cancer cell migration.

TI  - Heparin is an activating ligand of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase ALK.
PG  - ra6
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005916 [doi]
AB  - Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the few remaining "orphan" receptor
      tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in which the ligands are unknown. Ligand-mediated
      activation of RTKs is important throughout development. ALK is particularly
      relevant to the development of the nervous system. Increased activation of RTKs
      by mutation, genetic amplification, or signals from the stroma contributes to
      disease progression and acquired drug resistance in cancer. Aberrant activation
      of ALK occurs in subsets of lung adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, and other
      cancers. We found that heparin is a ligand that binds specifically to the ALK
      extracellular domain. Whereas heparins with short chain lengths bound to ALK in a
      monovalent manner and did not activate the receptor, longer heparin chains
      induced ALK dimerization and activation in cultured neuroblastoma cells. Heparin 
      lacking N- and O-linked sulfate groups or other glycosaminoglycans with sulfation
      patterns different than heparin failed to activate ALK. Moreover, antibodies that
      bound to the extracellular domain of ALK interfered with heparin binding and
      prevented heparin-mediated activation of ALK. Thus, heparin and perhaps related
      glycosaminoglycans function as ligands for ALK, revealing a potential mechanism
      for the regulation of ALK activity in vivo and suggesting an approach for
      developing ALK-targeted therapies for cancer.

AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), as its name
      suggests, is aberrantly activated, mutated, or abundant in multiple cancers.
      Although widely studied in the context of cancer, the ligand that normally binds 
      to and activates ALK in vertebrates has remained elusive. In this issue of
      Science Signaling, Murray and colleagues identify heparin as an ALK ligand.

TI  - MAPK feedback encodes a switch and timer for tunable stress adaptation in yeast.
PG  - ra5
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005774 [doi]
AB  - Signaling pathways can behave as switches or rheostats, generating binary or
      graded responses to a given cell stimulus. We evaluated whether a single
      signaling pathway can simultaneously encode a switch and a rheostat. We found
      that the kinase Hog1 mediated a bifurcated cellular response: Activation and
      commitment to adaptation to osmotic stress are switchlike, whereas protein
      induction and the resolution of this commitment are graded. Through
      experimentation, bioinformatics analysis, and computational modeling, we
      determined that graded recovery is encoded through feedback phosphorylation and a
      gene induction program that is both temporally staggered and variable across the 
      population. This switch-to-rheostat signaling mechanism represents a versatile
      stress adaptation system, wherein a broad range of inputs generate an "all-in"
      response that is later tuned to allow graded recovery of individual cells over
      time.

TI  - Annotation of human cancers with EGFR signaling-associated protein complexes
      using proximity ligation assays.
PG  - ra4
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005906 [doi]
AB  - Strategies to measure functional signaling-associated protein complexes have the 
      potential to augment current molecular biomarker assays, such as genotyping and
      expression profiling, used to annotate diseases. Aberrant activation of epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling contributes to diverse cancers. We used a
      proximity ligation assay (PLA) to detect EGFR in a complex with growth factor
      receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), the major signaling adaptor for EGFR. We used
      multiple lung cancer cell lines to develop and characterize EGFR:GRB2 PLA and
      correlated this assay with established biochemical measures of EGFR signaling. In
      a panel of patient-derived xenografts in mice, the intensity of EGFR:GRB2 PLA
      correlated with the reduction in tumor size in response to the EGFR inhibitor
      cetuximab. In tumor biopsies from three cohorts of lung cancer patients, positive
      EGFR:GRB2 PLA was observed in patients with and without EGFR mutations, and the
      intensity of EGFR:GRB2 PLA was predictive of overall survival in an EGFR
      inhibitor-treated cohort. Thus, we established the feasibility of using PLA to
      measure EGFR signaling-associated protein complexes in patient-based materials,
      suggesting the potential for similar assays for a broader array of receptor
      tyrosine kinases and other key signaling molecules.

TI  - STIM2 enhances receptor-stimulated Ca(2)(+) signaling by promoting recruitment of
      STIM1 to the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions.
PG  - ra3
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005748 [doi]
AB  - A central component of receptor-evoked Ca(2+) signaling is store-operated Ca(2+) 
      entry (SOCE), which is activated by the assembly of STIM1-Orai1 channels in
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) (ER-PM) junctions in response
      to depletion of ER Ca(2+). We report that STIM2 enhances agonist-mediated
      activation of SOCE by promoting STIM1 clustering in ER-PM junctions at low
      stimulus intensities. Targeted deletion of STIM2 in mouse salivary glands
      diminished fluid secretion in vivo and SOCE activation in dispersed salivary
      acinar cells stimulated with low concentrations of muscarinic receptor agonists. 
      STIM2 knockdown in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells diminished
      agonist-induced Ca(2+) signaling and nuclear translocation of NFAT (nuclear
      factor of activated T cells). STIM2 lacking five carboxyl-terminal amino acid
      residues did not promote formation of STIM1 puncta at low concentrations of
      agonist, whereas coexpression of STIM2 with STIM1 mutant lacking the polybasic
      region STIM1DeltaK resulted in co-clustering of both proteins. Together, our
      findings suggest that STIM2 recruits STIM1 to ER-PM junctions at low stimulus
      intensities when ER Ca(2+) stores are mildly depleted, thus increasing the
      sensitivity of Ca(2+) signaling to agonists.

TI  - Localized TRPA1 channel Ca2+ signals stimulated by reactive oxygen species
      promote cerebral artery dilation.
PG  - ra2
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.2005659 [doi]
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can have divergent effects in cerebral and
      peripheral circulations. We found that Ca(2+)-permeable transient receptor
      potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels were present and colocalized with NADPH
      (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase 2 (NOX2), a
      major source of ROS, in the endothelium of cerebral arteries but not in other
      vascular beds. We recorded and characterized ROS-triggered Ca(2+) signals
      representing Ca(2+) influx through single TRPA1 channels, which we called "TRPA1 
      sparklets." TRPA1 sparklet activity was low under basal conditions but was
      stimulated by NOX-generated ROS. Ca(2+) entry during a single TRPA1 sparklet was 
      twice that of a TRPV4 sparklet and ~200 times that of an L-type Ca(2+) channel
      sparklet. TRPA1 sparklets representing the simultaneous opening of two TRPA1
      channels were more common in endothelial cells than in human embryonic kidney
      (HEK) 293 cells expressing TRPA1. The NOX-induced TRPA1 sparklets activated
      intermediate-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels, resulting in smooth
      muscle hyperpolarization and vasodilation. NOX-induced activation of TRPA1
      sparklets and vasodilation required generation of hydrogen peroxide and
      lipid-peroxidizing hydroxyl radicals as intermediates. 4-Hydroxy-nonenal, a
      metabolite of lipid peroxidation, also increased TRPA1 sparklet frequency and
      dilated cerebral arteries. These data suggest that in the cerebral circulation,
      lipid peroxidation metabolites generated by ROS activate Ca(2+) influx through
      TRPA1 channels in the endothelium of cerebral arteries to cause dilation.

TI  - The kinase activity of the Ser/Thr kinase BUB1 promotes TGF-beta signaling.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling regulates cell proliferation
      and differentiation, which contributes to development and disease. Upon binding
      TGF-beta, the type I receptor (TGFBRI) binds TGFBRII, leading to the activation
      of the transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3. Using an RNA interference screen of
      the human kinome and a live-cell reporter for TGFBR activity, we identified the
      kinase BUB1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles-1) as a key mediator of
      TGF-beta signaling. BUB1 interacted with TGFBRI in the presence of TGF-beta and
      promoted the heterodimerization of TGFBRI and TGFBRII. Additionally, BUB1
      interacted with TGFBRII, suggesting the formation of a ternary complex. Knocking 
      down BUB1 prevented the recruitment of SMAD3 to the receptor complex, the
      phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 and their interaction with SMAD4,
      SMAD-dependent transcription, and TGF-beta-mediated changes in cellular phenotype
      including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion.
      Knockdown of BUB1 also impaired noncanonical TGF-beta signaling mediated by the
      kinases AKT and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). The ability of BUB1 
      to promote TGF-beta signaling depended on the kinase activity of BUB1. A
      small-molecule inhibitor of the kinase activity of BUB1 (2OH-BNPP1) and a
      kinase-deficient mutant of BUB1 suppressed TGF-beta signaling and formation of
      the ternary complex in various normal and cancer cell lines. 2OH-BNPP1
      administration to mice bearing lung carcinoma xenografts reduced the amount of
      phosphorylated SMAD2 in tumor tissue. These findings indicated that BUB1
      functions as a kinase in the TGF-beta pathway in a role beyond its established
      function in cell cycle regulation and chromosome cohesion.

TI  - 2014: signaling breakthroughs of the year.
PG  - eg1
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aaa4696 [doi]
AB  - The 2014 breakthroughs fell into four main areas: innate immunity, host-microbe
      interactions, cell death signaling, and methodological advances in the study of
      cell signaling. Nominations included new discoveries about signaling in innate
      immune cells, innate immune functions for lymphoid and nonhematological cells,
      and the importance of host-microbe interactions for the regulation of host
      physiology. Also this year, we received nominations highlighting molecular
      mechanisms by which p53 contributes to the pathology of chronic inflammation and 
      how signaling pathways mediate programmed necrotic cell death. Finally, 2014 saw 
      the use of new techniques to study cell signaling and identify drug targets, such
      as the in vivo use of RNA interference to study signaling in T cells and new
      computational methods to study large datasets of different data types.
