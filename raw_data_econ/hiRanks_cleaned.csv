5,"Employment hours cyclical dictated productivity consumption . This intratemporal labor wedge arise product labor market distortions . Based employee wages , literature attributed intratemporal wedge almost entirely labor market distortions . Because wages may smoothed versions labor 's true cyclical price , instead examine self-employed intermediate inputs , respectively . For recent decades United States , find price markup movements least cyclical wage markup movements . Thus , countercyclical price markups deserve central place business-cycle research , alongside sticky wages matching frictions .",1
