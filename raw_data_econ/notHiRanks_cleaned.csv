2,"We analyze drivers size audience number questions asked parallel sessions annual conference German Economics Association . We find location presentation least important number academics attending talk combined effect person presenting paper presented . Being presenter late morning session second day conference , close place coffee served , significantly increases size audience . When comes asking questions , location becomes less important , smaller rooms lead questions asked ( women ) . Younger researchers well senior researchers attract questions comments . There also interesting gender effects . Women attend research sessions diligently men , seem ask fewer questions men . Men less likely attend presentations health , education , welfare , development economics women . Our findings suggest strategic scheduling sessions could ensure better participation conferences . Moreover , different behaviors men women conferences might also contribute lack women senior scientist positions . ( This abstract borrowed another version item . )",0

This paper investigates greater variety living arrangements contributes increased resource disparities among children Germany . Children single parent families disadvantaged least three dimensions decisive later achievements : material standard living , parental education , parental childcare time . We compute multidimensional inequality poverty indices using SOEP data 1991-2012 . We distinguish parental publicly provided childcare , increasingly important in-kind benefit Germany . We find multidimensional inequality poverty declined expanded public childcare strongly reduces resource disparities among children . ( This abstract borrowed another version item . )",0

7,"This study estimates earning losses workers experiencing involuntary job separation . We employ , first time earning losses literature , Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator fixed effects several advantages respect conventional fixed effects models . The Poisson estimator allows considering full set involuntary separations , including zero labor market earnings unemployment . By including individuals zero earnings using new method , loss year separation becomes larger previous studies . The loss starts roughly 30 percent , although quickly shrinks , remains around 15 percent following years . In addition , find compared reasons separation , earning loss pattern unique involuntary separations , type separation implies permanent scarring . This latter finding makes us confident self-reported involuntariness separation reliable source information . ( This abstract borrowed another version item . )",0
