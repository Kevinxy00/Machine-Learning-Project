1,"The labor market increasingly rewards social skills . Between 1980 2012 , jobs requiring high levels social interaction grew nearly 12 percentage points share U.S. labor force . Math-intensive less social jobs?including many STEM occupations?shrank 3.3 percentage points period . Employment wage growth particularly strong jobs requiring high levels math skill social skills . To understand patterns , I develop model team production workers ?trade tasks? exploit comparative advantage . In model , social skills reduce coordination costs , allowing workers specialize work together efficiently . The model generates predictions sorting relative returns skill across occupations , I investigate using data NLSY79 NLSY97 . Using comparable set skill measures covariates across survey waves , I find labor market return social skills much greater 2000s mid-1980s 1990s .",1
2,"We develop theory endogenous uncertainty business cycles short-lived shocks generate long-lasting recessions . In model , higher uncertainty fundamentals discourages investment . Since agents learn actions others , information flows slowly times low activity uncertainty remains high , discouraging investment . The economy displays uncertainty traps : self-reinforcing episodes high uncertainty low activity . Although economy recovers quickly small shocks , large temporary shocks may long-lasting effects level activity . The economy subject information externality uncertainty traps may remain efficient allocation . Embedding mechanism standard business cycle framework , find endogenous uncertainty increases persistence large recessions improves performance model accounting Great Recession .",1

5,"We present new channel transmission monetary policy , deposits channel . We show Fed funds rate rises , banks widen spreads charge deposits , deposits flow banking system . We present model due market power deposit markets . Consistent market power mechanism , deposit spreads increase deposits flow concentrated markets . This true even control lending opportunities comparing different branches bank . Since deposits main source liquid assets households , deposits channel explain observed strong relationship liquidity premium Fed funds rate . Since deposits also uniquely stable funding source banks , deposits channel impacts bank lending . When Fed funds rate rises , banks raise deposits concentrated markets contract lending banks . Our estimates imply deposits channel account entire transmission monetary policy bank balance sheets .",1
6,"Can democracy attract competent leaders , attaining broad representation ? Economic models suggest free-riding incentives lower opportunity costs give less competent comparative advantage entering political life . Moreover , elites human capital , selecting competence may lead uneven representation . This article examines patterns political selection among universe municipal politicians national legislators Sweden , using extraordinarily rich data competence traits social background entire population . We document four new facts together characterize ?inclusive meritocracy.? First , politicians average significantly smarter better leaders population represent . Second , positive selection present even conditioning family ( hence social ) background , suggesting individual competence key selection . Third , representation social background , whether measured parental earnings occupational social class , remarkably even . Fourth , best weak trade-off selection competence social representation , mainly due strong positive selection politicians low ( parental ) socioeconomic status . A broad implication facts possible democracy generate competent socially representative leadership .",1

8,"We propose model job search reference-dependent preferences , loss aversion relative recent income ( reference point ) . In model , newly unemployed individuals search hard since consumption reference point . Over time , though , get used lower income thus reduce search effort . In anticipation benefit cut , search effort rises , declines get accustomed lower postcut benefit level . The model fits typical pattern exit unemployment , even unobserved heterogeneity . To distinguish models , use unique reform unemployment insurance ( UI ) benefit path . In 2005 , Hungary switched single-step UI system two-step system , overall generosity unchanged . The system generated increased hazard rates anticipation , especially following , benefit cuts ways standard model hard time explaining . We estimate model optimal consumption , endogenous search effort , unobserved heterogeneity . The reference-dependent model fits hazard rates substantially better plausible versions standard model , including habit formation . Our estimates indicate slow-adjusting reference point substantial impatience , likely reflecting present-bias .",1

We invented new cutting technology reduces waste primary raw material gave technology random subset producers . Despite clear net benefits nearly firms , 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low . We hypothesize important reason lack adoption misalignment incentives within firms : key employees ( cutters printers ) typically paid piece rates , incentive reduce waste , new technology slows , least initially . Fearing reductions effective wage , employees resist adoption various ways , including misinforming owners value technology . To investigate hypothesis , implemented second experiment among firms originally received technology : offered one cutter one printer per firm lump-sum payment , approximately month?s earnings , conditional demonstrating competence using technology presence owner . This incentive payment , small point view firm , significant positive effect adoption . The results suggest misalignment incentives within firms important barrier technology adoption setting .",1

We investigate impact transformation wage structure following jobs moved outside boundary lead employers contracting firms . We develop new method identifying outsourcing food , cleaning , security , logistics services administrative data using universe social security records Germany . We document dramatic growth domestic outsourcing Germany since early 1990s . Event-study analyses show wages outsourced jobs fall approximately 10?15 % relative similar jobs outsourced . We find evidence wage losses associated outsourcing stem loss firm-specific rents , suggesting labor cost savings important reason firms choose contract services . Finally , tie increase outsourcing activity broader changes German wage structure , particular showing outsourcing cleaning , security , logistics services alone accounts around 9 % increase German wage inequality since 1980s .",1
13,"Examining performance cashiers French grocery store chain , find manager bias negatively affects minority job performance . In stores studied , cashiers work different managers different days schedules determined quasi-randomly . When minority cashiers , majority cashiers , scheduled work managers biased ( determined implicit association test ) , absent often , spend less time work , scan items slowly , take time customers . This appears biased managers interact less minorities , leading minorities exert less effort . Manager bias consequences average performance minority workers : average minority majority workers perform equivalently , days managers unbiased , minorities perform significantly better majority workers . The findings consistent statistical discrimination hiring whereby minorities underperform assigned biased managers , firm sets higher hiring standard minorities get similar average performance minority nonminority workers .",1
14,"Measuring consumer responsiveness medical care prices central issue health economics key ingredient optimal design regulation health insurance markets . We leverage natural experiment large self-insured firm required employees switch insurance plan provided free health care nonlinear , high-deductible plan . The switch caused spending reduction 11.8 % 13.8 % total firm-wide health spending . We decompose spending reduction components ( ) consumer price shopping , ( ii ) quantity reductions , ( iii ) quantity substitutions find spending reductions entirely due outright reductions quantity .

An `` oligarchic '' society , political power hands major producers , protects property rights also tends erect significant entrybarriers new entrepreneurs . Democracy , political power widely diffused , imposes redistributive taxes producers , tends avoid entry barriers . When taxes democracy high distortions caused entry barriers low , oligarchic society achieves greater efficiency . Because comparative advantage entrepreneurship shifts away incumbents , inefficiency created entry barriers oligarchy deteriorates time . The typical pattern one rise decline oligarchic societies : An oligarchic society may first become richer , later fall behind similar democratic society .
